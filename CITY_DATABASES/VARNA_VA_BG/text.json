The complex includes two small nearby catacombs.\nDedicated to the Holy Trinity, it was an active hesychast monastic community of the Second Bulgarian Empire since the 12th century and perhaps survived until the early 18th century. Nearby, remains of a 5th-century cave monastery have been found. \n\nA cave monastery may have existed not far from the modern monastery Aladzha, near Varna. Its early dating to the fourth century is secured by fragments of glassware, but coins of Justinian indicate that the complex may have still been in use during the 500s.\nAs late as the early 20th century, the forested hills surrounding the monastery and known as Hachuka (Mount of the Cross) or Latin, were regarded by locals as sacred and inhabited by a mythical chthonic daemon treasure keeper, Imri Pop or Rim-Papa.Today, the grotto is a popular tourist destination. Its present name appeared in the late Ottoman period; Alaca (Turkish for motley) referred to its colourful murals, now almost destroyed. Thematic light shows are being staged in the summer.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCurta, Florin (2001).

          "The gallery which contained alot more explanations and pictures as to why and how it looked were in a different place to the actual ruins. We were advised to see the ruins which were just large holes in the wall 1st. There isn't much, 2 floors with various icons and whatnot.",

          "A lovely place to visit! I would recommend going if you have a couple of hours spare. I spent an hour and a half there with my boyfriend and we both enjoyed it. We took some great photos as it wasn't very busy. There is a museum where you can read up on the history of the",

          "There are several places int he complex - the historical museum, the monastery and the catacombs. Unfortunately there are a lot of crowds and tourists so it is not actually a quiet place. There are a lot of stairs to get in to the monastery so keep in mind. All of the paintings",
          "The caves lay on two floors and it is fascinating that people actually lived there day by day. The suroundings are very beautiful and green, wild nature and still somehow religious. Very nice :) The kids were fascinated by the kitchen and the monks rooms, they even pretend to",
          "Placed in a protected forest area, the monastery caves are very well preserved and the complex also includes 2 catacombs. For these 2 catacombs you'll have to walk through the forest and on the way, you'll see different protected species of trees and plants.If you are a nature",

Katedralen Hram Uspenie Bogorodichno) is the largest church building in Varna and the third largest cathedral in Bulgaria (after St. Alexander Nevski Cathedral in Sofia and St. Dimitar Cathedral in Vidin). Officially opened on 30 August 1886. It is the residence of the bishopric of Varna and Preslav and one of the symbols of Varna.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Preparations and planning ===\nDuring Russian Knyaz Dondukov-Korsakov's visit to Varna, he noticed the need for a cathedral church that would suit the needs of the growing city's population of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Metropolitan Simeon gathered the community to elect a commission aimed at preparing the construction of a new church, particularly selecting the spot, raising money and securing timber and building materials. The construction was evaluated at 300\u2013400,000 French francs, most of them expected to be collected by means of voluntary donations. The 15,000 francs that were initially collected were quickly laid out, but the Bulgarian government granted a sum of 100,000 leva and a lottery of 150,000 2-lev tickets was run.\nPrimarily materials from the vicinity of Varna were used for the construction of the cathedral. Stones from the destroyed fortified walls of the city were collected, material for the fa\u00e7ade was brought from the neighbouring villages of Lyuben Karavelovo and Kumanovo, the inner columns were made of local stone. The outer columns under the windows used stone from Rousse and the arches relied on limy freestone. Copper plates for the roof, as well as elevating gear to lift the blocks of stone, were brought from England.\n\nThe foundation stone was laid by Bulgarian Knyaz Alexander on 22 August 1880 after a solemn ceremony and prayer in front of a crowd of Bulgarians and Armenians. The Knyaz gave amnesty to all the local prisoners that had three months or less left to spend in prison.\nThe name that was chosen, Dormition of the Theotokos, was in memory of Russian Empress consort Maria Alexandrovna, a benefactress of Bulgaria and aunt of the Bulgarian knyaz, who had recently died.\nThe initially selected spot was not liked by the knyaz, who preferred a location on a hill in the then-outskirts of the city, where a garden could also be arranged and so that the cathedral could be seen from the whole city.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe project for the cathedral, modelled after the temple in the Peterhof Palace, was by an Odessan architect by the name of Maas. Construction began immediately after the foundation stone was laid and took six years. Initially, the local government concluded a 6,000-leva contract with the architect, but he soon asked for more resources, so the commission decided to buy his plans but not engage him with the construction. Thus, the foundations were laid after the plan of Maas, whereas the building itself followed the plan of municipal architect P. Kupka.\nAccording to the project, the cathedral is a three-naved cross-domed basilica featuring two aisles and sized of 35 by 35 m, with the main altar being dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos, the north one to Saint Alexander Nevsky and the south one to Saint Nicholas the Miracle Worker.\nThe issue of selecting a master builder was discussed in the summer of 1880, but the negotiations with Kolyu Ficheto from Tarnovo proved unsuccessful. Local master Vasil Ivanov was given the temporary guidance, the job was however was assigned to Yanko Kostandi after a long search. On 15 March 1884, the commission entrusted Gencho Kanchev from Tryavna with the task. The temple was erected in the following year, the roof was finished in September and the first church service was given on 30 August 1886.\n\n\n=== Furnishing ===\nThe furnishing of the interior, however, also continued in the following years. The bishop's throne, the work of Niko Mavrudi, was placed in 1897 and the iconostasis was manufactured later by master Ivan Filipov from Debar. It was decided that a new and separate bell tower would not be erected and instead a dome would be lifted and a part of the original building adapted for the purpose. The bell was supposed to weigh 100 poods (1.6 tons) and bear the inscription \"In honour of the Liberator\". 42 small and 3 large icons were brought from Russia as a donation by Nicholas II in 1901, additional 8 intended for the middle and north doors following in 1904. The church's floor was covered with ceramic tiles of different colours in 1911 and the balcony was finished four years later.\nThe 38 m-high belfry was fully erected between 1941 and 1943 by architect Stefan Venedict Popow, the domes took their current appearance in the period, steam heating was installed and the construction of the roof was changed as well. It was initially very hard to find a contractor to sponsor the repairs, as well as the securing and transportation of materials. The decoration of the Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral began after 1949 under Professor N. Rostovtsev, who donated the narthex murals. The chandeliers that were then installed were the work of woodcarver P. Kushlev.\nThe large painted windows were installed in the 1960s. Saints Cyril and Methodius are depicted on the larger south ones (looking towards the square), while the north ones portray St Angelarius and St Clement of Ohrid.\nThe copper domes, damaged by patina, were reconstructed and gilded in the spring of 2000. The fa\u00e7ade was renovated the same year.\n\n\n== References and sources ==\nKatedralen hram \"Uspenie Presvyatiya Bogoroditsi\". Varna.info.bg. Accessed 19 March 2006.",

The Roman Thermae are situated in the southeastern part of the modern city, which under the Roman Empire was known as Odessus. The baths were constructed in the late 2nd century AD and rank as the fourth-largest preserved Roman thermae in Europe and the largest in the Balkans.\n\n\n== History ==\nAncient Varna, first a Thracian settlement and then an Ancient Greek colony, became part of the Roman Empire in 15 AD and was assigned to the province of Moesia with a certain degree of local autonomy. The Roman baths of Varna were built towards the end of the 2nd century and remained in use for about a hundred years, till the late 3rd century. Coins of Roman emperor Septimius Severus (r. 193\u2013211) have been discovered among the bath ruins. Much later, in the 14th century, the ruins of the Roman Thermae were the site of craftsmen's workshops.The ruins were first scientifically recognized as an ancient object in 1906 by the Austro-Hungarian researcher E. Kalinka. The site was further researched by Czech-Bulgarian archaeologist brothers Karel and Hermann \u0160korpil. Further parts of the ruins were uncovered between 1959 and 1971 by a team under M. Mirchev. In August 2013, Varna Municipality ordered an urgent reconservation project for the Roman Thermae worth 125,000 Bulgarian leva.\n\n\n== Layout ==\nThe remains of the Roman Thermae lie in the southeastern part of modern Varna, at the intersection of San Stefano Street and Han Krum Street. They have an area of some 7,000 m2 (75,000 sq ft), with the vaults reaching up to 20\u201322 m (66\u201372 ft) in height. By area, the Roman baths of Varna are the fourth-largest among the preserved thermae in Europe, behind the Baths of Caracalla and Baths of Diocletian in the imperial capital Rome and the baths of Trier. The thermae are the largest in the Balkan region and the biggest surviving ancient building in what is today Bulgaria.The Roman Thermae of Varna feature the whole range of facilities including a apodyterium (changing room), a frigidarium (cold pool), a tepidarium (warm pool) and a caldarium (hot pool) as well as a  palaestra (a space with social and athletic functions). Heating was provided by means of a hypocaust, an underfloor heating system of pipes.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The low entrance fee makes this worth the visit as the place has not been restored at all. You will not see many tourists here as the majority seem to want to be at the beach. The employee at the entrance is very nice and they have multi language pamphlets for an extra fee. No",
          "This is a very interesting place, As me and my husband had visited roman sites in England we did have an idea about how the baths were set out and how they worked but there was very little information as you walked round. We think that the town council could make a lot more of",
          "You cannot see much from the front gates,but dont let this put you off going in.. It opens out into a very large site and is well preserved.There are underground vaulted chambers and furnaces,etc and its very easy to visualise how the complex must have looked even without the",

          "They say this Roman Spa is the third largest in Europe. I cannot think what number two must be, because, while slightly smaller than the one in Rome, it is in quite good shape and very large. I am a fan of ruins and this one is worth the trip.",
          "The man at the ticket counter will give you loads of information about the history of the Baths. In addition there are very good displays all over. The place is desolate so you will be the only one walking around. Quite fascinating to imagine what it was like!",
          "Valuable remnant of the roman civilization, unfortunately they are poorly maintained and sparsely sign-posted.",
          "Very beautiful and informative but not a large amount has been preserved and the place is overgrown if you have been to Turkey then this will disappoint you but if you haven't it's a good place to start.",

          "Bulgaria doesn't really seem to know how to make the best of the few attractions it does have. If you've been to any of the Roman ruins in Turkey then this will be a disappointment. It's small, not that well preserved and also overgrown."

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989. It specialises in International Economics and Administration, Law, and Architecture.\n\n\n=== Institutes and colleges ===\nThere are four BAS research institutes: Oceanology, Fisheries, Aero and Hydrodynamics, Metallography. The Institute of Oceanology (IO-BAS) has been active in Black Sea deluge theory studies and deepwater archaeology in cooperation with Columbia University, MIT, UPenn, and National Geographic.\nColleges:\n\nCollege of Tourism, University of Economics\nHigher School of ManagementOther universities' local branches:\n\nNew Bulgarian University Local Centre Varna\nConstantine of Preslav University of Shumen Department of Information, Qualification and Continuing Education Varna\n\n\n=== Secondary education ===\nSome of the top high schools are:\n\nFirst Language School (English and German)\nDr. Petar Beron Second High School of Mathematics\nAcad.

Over the past few decades, it developed as a festival centre of international standing.

          "This place is huge, and there are two floors. I had a heavy bag with me and this made it a difficult experience but the exhibits are fascinating. Most text is available in both Bulgarian and English, there is some French and German but not \u2026",
          "The museum is well laid out, starting one in the earliest of times and walking up through successive ages, all with local finds. Along with the most ancient of golden jewelry, the thought that all these artifacts came from right around \u2026",

          "Lovely museum, probably the BEST place in the whole world to see the oldest crafted gold found on our Planet (as of 2019) exhibited.",
          "Loved it. I couldn't believe some of the gold artifacts with the level of detail were from the 3rd century BC. Museum closes at 5pm and there is ample parking for free in the streets to the right of town square. I would say a complete tour will take you two hours. Entrance fee in Sept 19 was 10 lev per person.",
          "The oldest gold jewellery so far discovered is kept here, it predates the great pyramids. The museum follows the history of Bulgaria from the stone age onwards. You'll need at least an hour but take your time you won't be disappointed",

Highlight is the exhibition on the oldest gold ever found, from approx. 4600 BC. It also includes a good overview of the Greek and Roman influences on Bulgaria. A great journey through time of the local Varna region.",

          "A great museum and must-see for the Varna gold items discovered from approx 5000BC!

          "Quite small for the reputation Bulgarians claim.  Second floor is dedicated to religious iconography. \ud83d\ude23 A few items scattered throughout worth seeing but nothing worth standing in line for. It would be better if they closed a few smaller \u2026",

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989.

Other public leisure centres opened in the Sea Garden, Asparuhov Park and elsewhere. The number and range of gym and recreation clubs in Varna have increased in recent years, which reflects the healthy lifestyle of the average Varna citizens.\nIn the region there are three golf courses\u2014Lighthouse Golf Club, BlackSeaRama Golf & Villas and Thracian Cliffs Golf & Beach Resort. The three 18-hole golf courses are of professional quality, constructed in the region to the north of the city in the vicinity of Balchik and Kavarna.Varna also hosts international competitions, including world championships, and national events in several sports on a regular basis, including auto racing and motocross, karting, openwater swimming marathons. Bulgarian national basketball and volleyball teams host their games, including FIVB Volleyball World League games, at the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna athletes won 1 of the 3 medals for Bulgaria at the 2016 Summer Olympics and 4 of the 12 medals at the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of airports in Bulgaria\nList of cities and towns in Bulgaria\nList of mayors of Varna\nSt. Nikolai, Varna\nDisappearance of Lars Mittank\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Varna at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website\nOfficial Varna City Guide\nHistorical And Cultural Guide Of Varna",

It was named the Boris Georgiev City Art Gallery in 1999, in honour of Varna-born artist Boris Georgiev\nBoris Georgiev (1888\u20131962).The edifice of the Boris Georgiev City Art Gallery was opened in September 1885 as the building of the Varna Men's High School. Designed in the Gothic Revival style, the building draws inspiration from medieval Northern European Brick Gothic. According to some researchers, Bulgarian National Revival master architect Gencho Kanev played an important part in the design of the edifice. Between 1912 and 1928, the building of the Varna Men's High School was used as a hospital, only to resume its operation as a school after 1928. A general meeting of Varna artists decided on 12 January 1944 to make the building the home of the Varna City Art Gallery. The north wing of the building was demolished in 1952 to make way for the Nakhimov Navy School, the modern Saints Cyril and Methodius School. Under architects Goranov and Kamenov in 1982\u20131987, the building was reorganized to better serve the purpose of a gallery.The Boris Georgiev City Art Gallery owns a significant collection of Bulgarian art from the early 20th century onwards, and most notably the largest collection of works by gallery patron Boris Georgiev. Other Bulgarian artists represented in the gallery's permanent exhibition are Vladimir Dimitrov, Ivan Milev, Sirak Skitnik , Zlatyu Boyadzhiev, Tsanko Lavrenov, Nayden Petkov,David Peretz, Svetlin Rusev, Daria Vassilaynska. Displayed on the second floor are examples of portrait art from the Dutch Golden Age. The gallery's third floor regularly accommodates concerts, plays and readings. In total, the gallery has an area of 1,000 square metres (11,000 sq ft) spread over eight exhibition halls.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989. It specialises in International Economics and Administration, Law, and Architecture.\n\n\n=== Institutes and colleges ===\nThere are four BAS research institutes: Oceanology, Fisheries, Aero and Hydrodynamics, Metallography. The Institute of Oceanology (IO-BAS) has been active in Black Sea deluge theory studies and deepwater archaeology in cooperation with Columbia University, MIT, UPenn, and National Geographic.\nColleges:\n\nCollege of Tourism, University of Economics\nHigher School of ManagementOther universities' local branches:\n\nNew Bulgarian University Local Centre Varna\nConstantine of Preslav University of Shumen Department of Information, Qualification and Continuing Education Varna\n\n\n=== Secondary education ===\nSome of the top high schools are:\n\nFirst Language School (English and German)\nDr. Petar Beron Second High School of Mathematics\nAcad.

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989.

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989.

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989. It specialises in International Economics and Administration, Law, and Architecture.\n\n\n=== Institutes and colleges ===\nThere are four BAS research institutes: Oceanology, Fisheries, Aero and Hydrodynamics, Metallography. The Institute of Oceanology (IO-BAS) has been active in Black Sea deluge theory studies and deepwater archaeology in cooperation with Columbia University, MIT, UPenn, and National Geographic.\nColleges:\n\nCollege of Tourism, University of Economics\nHigher School of ManagementOther universities' local branches:\n\nNew Bulgarian University Local Centre Varna\nConstantine of Preslav University of Shumen Department of Information, Qualification and Continuing Education Varna\n\n\n=== Secondary education ===\nSome of the top high schools are:\n\nFirst Language School (English and German)\nDr. Petar Beron Second High School of Mathematics\nAcad.

        "wiki": "Bulgaria ( (listen); Bulgarian: \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, romanized: Balgariya), officially the Republic of Bulgaria (Bulgarian: \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, romanized: Republika Balgariya, IPA: [r\u025b\u02c8publik\u0250 b\u0250\u026b\u02c8\u0261arij\u0250]), is a country in Southeastern Europe. It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and North Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. The capital and largest city is Sofia; other major cities are Plovdiv, Varna and Burgas. With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), Bulgaria is Europe's sixteenth-largest country.\nOne of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the Neolithic Karanovo culture, which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for ancient Thracians, Persians, Celts and Macedonians; stability came when the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 45. The Eastern Roman Empire lost some of these territories to Slavic and then Turkic Bulgar invaders in the late 7th century. The Bulgars founded the First Bulgarian Empire in AD 681, which dominated most of the Balkans and significantly influenced Slavic cultures by developing the Cyrillic script. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor Basil II conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a Second Bulgarian Empire, which reached its apex under Ivan Asen II (1218\u20131241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the empire disintegrated in 1396 and fell under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries.\nThe Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378 resulted in the formation of the third and current Bulgarian state. Many ethnic Bulgarians were left outside the new nation's borders, which stoked irredentist sentiments that led to several conflicts with its neighbours and alliances with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria came under the Soviet-led Eastern Bloc and became a one-party socialist state The ruling Communist Party gave up its monopoly on power after the revolutions of 1989 and allowed multiparty elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a democracy and a market-based economy. Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, Bulgaria has been a unitary parliamentary republic composed of 27 provinces, with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. \nBulgaria is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Council of Europe; it is a founding state of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and has taken a seat on the UN Security Council three times. Its market economy is part of the European Single Market and mostly relies on services, followed by industry\u2014especially machine building and mining\u2014and agriculture. Bulgaria is a developing country and ranks 52nd in the Human Development Index, the lowest development rank in the European Union alongside Romania. Widespread corruption is a major socioeconomic issue; Bulgaria ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union in 2018. The country also faces a demographic crisis, with its population shrinking annually since the late 1980s; it currently numbers roughly seven million, down from a peak of nearly nine million in 1988.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Bulgaria is derived from the Bulgars, a tribe of Turkic origin that founded the country. Their name is not completely understood and is difficult to trace back earlier than the 4th century AD, but it is possibly derived from the Proto-Turkic word bul\u0123ha (\"to mix\", \"shake\", \"stir\") and its derivative bulgak (\"revolt\", \"disorder\"). The meaning may be further extended to \"rebel\", \"incite\" or \"produce a state of disorder\", and so, in the derivative, the \"disturbers\". Ethnic groups in Inner Asia with phonologically similar names were frequently described in similar terms: during the 4th century, the Buluoji, a component of the \"Five Barbarian\" groups in Ancient China, were portrayed as both a \"mixed race\" and \"troublemakers\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and antiquity ===\n\nNeanderthal remains dating to around 150,000 years ago, or the Middle Paleolithic, are some of the earliest traces of human activity in the lands of modern Bulgaria. Remains from Homo sapiens found there are dated ca. 47,000\u2009years\u2009BP. This result represents the earliest arrival of modern humans in Europe. The Karanovo culture arose circa 6,500 BC and was one of several Neolithic societies in the region that thrived on agriculture. The Copper Age Varna culture (fifth millennium BC) is credited with inventing gold metallurgy. The associated Varna Necropolis treasure contains the oldest golden jewellery in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years. The treasure has been valuable for understanding social hierarchy and stratification in the earliest European societies.The Thracians, one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern Bulgarians, appeared on the Balkan Peninsula some time before the 12th century BC. The Thracians excelled in metallurgy and gave the Greeks the Orphean and Dionysian cults, but remained tribal and stateless. The Persian Achaemenid Empire conquered most of present-day Bulgaria in the 6th century BC and retained control over the region until 479 BC. The invasion became a catalyst for Thracian unity, and the bulk of their tribes united under king Teres to form the Odrysian kingdom in the 470s BC. It was weakened and vassalized by Philip II of Macedon in 341 BC, attacked by Celts in the 3rd century, and finally became a province of the Roman Empire in AD 45.By the end of the 1st century AD, Roman governance was established over the entire Balkan Peninsula and Christianity began spreading in the region around the 4th century. The Gothic Bible\u2014the first Germanic language book\u2014was created by Gothic bishop Ulfilas in what is today northern Bulgaria around 381. The region came under Byzantine control after the fall of Rome in 476. The Byzantines were engaged in prolonged warfare against Persia and could not defend their Balkan territories from barbarian incursions. This enabled the Slavs to enter the Balkan Peninsula as marauders, primarily through an area between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains known as Moesia. Gradually, the interior of the peninsula became a country of the South Slavs, who lived under a democracy. The Slavs assimilated the partially Hellenized, Romanized, and Gothicized Thracians in the rural areas.\n\n\n=== First Bulgarian Empire ===\n\nNot long after the Slavic incursion, Moesia was once again invaded, this time by the Bulgars under Khan Asparukh. Their horde was a remnant of Old Great Bulgaria, an extinct tribal confederacy situated north of the Black Sea in what is now Ukraine and southern Russia. Asparukh attacked Byzantine territories in Moesia and conquered the Slavic tribes there in 680. A peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire was signed in 681, marking the foundation of the First Bulgarian Empire. The minority Bulgars formed a close-knit ruling caste.Succeeding rulers strengthened the Bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries. Krum introduced a written code of law and checked a major Byzantine incursion at the Battle of Pliska, in which Byzantine emperor Nicephorus I was killed. Boris I abolished paganism in favour of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in 864. The conversion was followed by a Byzantine recognition of the Bulgarian church and the adoption of the Cyrillic alphabet, developed in the capital, Preslav. The common language, religion and script strengthened central authority and gradually fused the Slavs and Bulgars into a unified people speaking a single Slavic language. A golden age began during the 34-year rule of Simeon the Great, who oversaw the largest territorial expansion of the state.After Simeon's death, Bulgaria was weakened by wars with Magyars and Pechenegs and the spread of the Bogomil heresy. Preslav was seized by the Byzantine army in 971 after consecutive Rus' and Byzantine invasions. The empire briefly recovered from the attacks under Samuil, but this ended when Byzantine emperor Basil II defeated the Bulgarian army at Klyuch in 1014. Samuil died shortly after the battle, and by 1018 the Byzantines had conquered the First Bulgarian Empire. After the conquest, Basil II prevented revolts by retaining the rule of local nobility, integrating them in Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy, and relieving their lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing tax in kind instead. The Bulgarian Patriarchate was reduced to an archbishopric, but retained its autocephalous status and its dioceses.\n\n\n=== Second Bulgarian Empire ===\n\nByzantine domestic policies changed after Basil's death and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, the largest being led by Peter Delyan. The empire's authority declined after a catastrophic military defeat at Manzikert against Seljuk invaders, and was further disturbed by the Crusades. This prevented Byzantine attempts at Hellenisation and created fertile ground for further revolt. In 1185 Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organized a major uprising and succeeded in re-establishing the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with its capital at Tarnovo.\n\nKaloyan, the third of the Asen monarchs, extended his dominion to Belgrade and Ohrid. He acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of the pope and received a royal crown from a papal legate. The empire reached its zenith under Ivan Asen II (1218\u20131241), when its borders expanded as far as the coast of Albania, Serbia and Epirus, while commerce and culture flourished. Ivan Asen's rule was also marked by a shift away from Rome in religious matters.The Asen dynasty became extinct in 1257. Internal conflicts and incessant Byzantine and Hungarian attacks followed, enabling the Mongols to establish suzerainty over the weakened Bulgarian state. In 1277, swineherd Ivaylo led a great peasant revolt that expelled the Mongols from Bulgaria and briefly made him emperor. He was overthrown in 1280 by the feudal landlords, whose factional conflicts caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to disintegrate into small feudal dominions by the 14th century. These fragmented rump states\u2014two tsardoms at Vidin and Tarnovo and the Despotate of Dobrudzha\u2014became easy prey for a new threat arriving from the Southeast: the Ottoman Turks.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule ===\n\nThe Ottomans were employed as mercenaries by the Byzantines in the 1340s but later became invaders in their own right. Sultan Murad I took Adrianople from the Byzantines in 1362; Sofia fell in 1382, followed by Shumen in 1388. The Ottomans completed their conquest of Bulgarian lands in 1393 when Tarnovo was sacked after a three-month siege and the Battle of Nicopolis which brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom in 1396. Sozopol was the last Bulgarian settlement to fall, in 1453. The Bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.Christians were considered an inferior class of people under the Ottoman system. Bulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes (including devshirme, or blood tax), their culture was suppressed, and they experienced partial Islamisation. Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the Rum Millet, which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith. The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas, and in the militant Catholic community in the northwest of the country.As Ottoman power began to wane, Habsburg Austria and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies. The Austrians first backed an uprising in Tarnovo in 1598, then a second one in 1686, the Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688 and finally Karposh's Rebellion in 1689. The Russian Empire also asserted itself as a protector of Christians in Ottoman lands with the Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca in 1774.\n\nThe Western European Enlightenment in the 18th century influenced the initiation of a national awakening of Bulgaria. It restored national consciousness and provided an ideological basis for the liberation struggle, resulting in the 1876 April Uprising. Up to 30,000 Bulgarians were killed as Ottoman authorities put down the rebellion. The massacres prompted the Great Powers to take action. They convened the Constantinople Conference in 1876, but their decisions were rejected by the Ottomans. This allowed the Russian Empire to seek a military solution without risking confrontation with other Great Powers, as had happened in the Crimean War. In 1877 Russia declared war on the Ottomans and defeated them with the help of Bulgarian rebels, particularly during the crucial Battle of Shipka Pass which secured Russian control over the main road to Constantinople.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian state ===\n\n \nThe Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day. The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as \"the Balkan Prussia\". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918\u2014two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.\n\nThe resulting political unrest led to the establishment of a royal authoritarian dictatorship by Tsar Boris III (1918\u20131943). Bulgaria entered World War II in 1941 as a member of the Axis but declined to participate in Operation Barbarossa and saved its Jewish population from deportation to concentration camps. The sudden death of Boris III in mid-1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against Germany, and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum. The government of Bogdan Filov subsequently failed to achieve peace with the Allies. Bulgaria did not comply with Soviet demands to expel German forces from its territory, resulting in a declaration of war and an invasion by the USSR in September 1944. The communist-dominated Fatherland Front took power, ended participation in the Axis and joined the Allied side until the war ended. Bulgaria suffered little war damage and the Soviet Union demanded no reparations. But all wartime gains, with the notable exception of Southern Dobrudzha, were lost.The left-wing coup d'\u00e9tat of 9 September 1944 led to the abolition of the monarchy and the executions of some 1,000\u20133,000 dissidents, war criminals, and members of the former royal elite. But it was not until 1946 that a one-party people's republic was instituted following a referendum. It fell into the Soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of Georgi Dimitrov (1946\u20131949), who established a repressive, rapidly industrializing Stalinist state. By the mid-1950s standards of living rose significantly and political repressions eased. The Soviet-style planned economy saw some market-oriented policies emerging on an experimental level under Todor Zhivkov (1954\u20131989). Compared to wartime levels, national GDP increased five-fold and per capita GDP quadrupled by the 1980s, although severe debt spikes took place in 1960, 1977 and 1980. Zhivkov's daughter Lyudmila bolstered national pride by promoting Bulgarian heritage, culture and arts worldwide. Facing declining birth rates among the ethnic Bulgarian majority, in 1984 Zhivkov's government forced the minority ethnic Turks to adopt Slavic names in an attempt to erase their identity and assimilate them. These policies resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 ethnic Turks to Turkey.The Communist Party was forced to give up its political monopoly on 10 November 1989 under the influence of the Revolutions of 1989. Zhivkov resigned and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy. The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the Communist Party, now rebranded as the Bulgarian Socialist Party. A new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth\u2014the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s. After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly, and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status in 2003. It became a member of NATO in 2004 and participated in the War in Afghanistan. After several years of reforms it joined the European Union and single market in 2007 despite Brussels' concerns about government corruption. Bulgaria hosted the 2018 Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the National Palace of Culture in Sofia.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBulgaria occupies a portion of the eastern Balkan peninsula, bordering five countries\u2014Greece and Turkey to the south, North Macedonia and Serbia to the west, and Romania to the north. The land borders have a total length of 1,808 kilometres (1,123 mi), and the coastline has a length of 354 kilometres (220 mi). Its total area of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi) ranks it as the world's 105th-largest country. Bulgaria's geographic coordinates are 43\u00b0 N 25\u00b0 E. The most notable topographical features are the Danubian Plain, the Balkan Mountains, the Thracian Plain, and the Rila-Rhodope massif. The southern edge of the Danubian Plain slopes upward into the foothills of the Balkans, while the Danube defines the border with Romania. The Thracian Plain is roughly triangular, beginning southeast of Sofia and broadening as it reaches the Black Sea coast.The Balkan mountains run laterally through the middle of the country from west to east. The mountainous southwest has two distinct alpine type ranges - Rila and Pirin, which border the lower but more extensive Rhodope Mountains to the east, and various medium altitude mountains to west, northwest and south, like Vitosha, Osogovo and Belasitsa. Musala, at 2,925 metres (9,596 ft), is the highest point in both Bulgaria and the Balkan peninsula. The Black Sea coast is the country's lowest point. Plains occupy about one third of the territory, while plateaux and hills occupy 41%. Most rivers are short and with low water levels. The longest river located solely in Bulgarian territory, the Iskar, has a length of 368 kilometres (229 mi). The Struma and the Maritsa are two major rivers in the south.Bulgaria has a varied and changeable climate, which results from being positioned at the meeting point of the Mediterranean, Oceanic and Continental air masses combined with the barrier effect of its mountains. Northern Bulgaria averages 1 \u00b0C (1.8 \u00b0F) cooler, and registers 200 millimetres (7.9 in) more precipitation, than the regions south of the Balkan mountains. Temperature amplitudes vary significantly in different areas. The lowest recorded temperature is \u221238.3 \u00b0C (\u221236.9 \u00b0F), while the highest is 45.2 \u00b0C (113.4 \u00b0F). Precipitation averages about 630 millimetres (24.8 in) per year, and varies from 500 millimetres (19.7 in) in Dobrudja to more than 2,500 millimetres (98.4 in) in the mountains. Continental air masses bring significant amounts of snowfall during winter.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity and environment ===\n\nThe interaction of climatic, hydrological, geological and topographical conditions has produced a relatively wide variety of plant and animal species.\nBulgaria's biodiversity, one of the richest in Europe, is conserved in three national parks, 11 nature parks, 10 biosphere reserves and 565 protected areas. Ninety-three of the 233 mammal species of Europe are found in Bulgaria, along with 49% of butterfly and 30% of vascular plant species. Overall, 41,493 plant and animal species are present. Larger mammals with sizable populations include deer (106,323 individuals), wild boars (88,948), jackals (47,293) and foxes (32,326). Partridges number some 328,000 individuals, making them the most widespread gamebird. A third of all nesting birds in Bulgaria can be found in Rila National Park, which also hosts Arctic and alpine species at high altitudes. Flora includes more than 3,800 vascular plant species of which 170 are endemic and 150 are considered endangered. A checklist of larger fungi in Bulgaria by the Institute of Botany identifies more than 1,500 species. More than 35% of the land area is covered by forests.In 1998, the Bulgarian government adopted the National Biological Diversity Conservation Strategy, a comprehensive programme seeking the preservation of local ecosystems, protection of endangered species and conservation of genetic resources. Bulgaria has some of the largest Natura 2000 areas in Europe covering 33.8% of its territory. It also achieved its Kyoto Protocol objective of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 30% from 1990 to 2009.Bulgaria ranks 30th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, but scores low on air quality. Particulate levels are the highest in Europe, especially in urban areas affected by automobile traffic and coal-based power stations. One of these, the lignite-fired Maritsa Iztok-2 station, is causing the highest damage to health and the environment in the European Union. Pesticide use in agriculture and antiquated industrial sewage systems produce extensive soil and water pollution. Water quality began to improve in 1998 and has maintained a trend of moderate improvement. Over 75% of surface rivers meet European standards for good quality.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nBulgaria is a parliamentary democracy where the prime minister is the head of government and the most powerful executive position. The political system has three branches\u2014legislative, executive and judicial, with universal suffrage for citizens at least 18 years old. The Constitution also provides possibilities of direct democracy, namely petitions and national referenda. Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election. Normally, the prime minister-elect is the leader of the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.Unlike the prime minister, presidential domestic power is more limited. The directly elected president serves as head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the presidential veto by a simple majority vote. Political parties gather in the National Assembly, a body of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote. The National Assembly has the power to enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the prime minister and other ministers, declare war, deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements.\n\nOverall, Bulgaria displays a pattern of unstable governments. Boyko Borisov is serving his third term as prime minister since 2009, when his centre-right, pro-EU party GERB won the general election and ruled as a minority government with 117 seats in the National Assembly. His first government resigned on 20 February 2013 after nationwide protests caused by high costs of utilities, low living standards, corruption and the perceived failure of the democratic system. The protest wave was notable for self-immolations, spontaneous demonstrations and a strong sentiment against political parties.The subsequent snap elections in May resulted in a narrow win for GERB, but the Bulgarian Socialist Party eventually formed a government led by Plamen Oresharski after Borisov failed to secure parliamentary support. The Oresharski government resigned in July 2014 amid continuing large-scale protests. A caretaker government took over and called the October 2014 elections which resulted in a third GERB victory, but a total of eight parties entered parliament. Borisov formed a coalition with several right-wing parties, but resigned again after the candidate backed by his party failed to win the 2016 Presidential election. The March 2017 snap election was again won by GERB, but with 95 seats in Parliament. They formed a coalition with the far-right United Patriots, who hold 27 seats.Freedom House has reported a continuing deterioration of democratic governance after 2009, citing reduced media independence, stalled reforms, abuse of authority at the highest level and increased dependence of local administrations on the central government. Bulgaria is still listed as \"Free\", with a political system designated as a semi-consolidated democracy, albeit with deteriorating scores. The Democracy Index defines it as a \"Flawed democracy\". A 2018 survey by the Institute for Economics and Peace reported that less than 15% of respondents considered elections to be fair.\n\n\n=== Legal system ===\nBulgaria has a civil law legal system. The judiciary is overseen by the Ministry of Justice. The Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court of Cassation are the highest courts of appeal and oversee the application of laws in subordinate courts. The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges. The legal system is regarded by both domestic and international observers as one of Europe's most inefficient due to pervasive lack of transparency and corruption. Law enforcement is carried out by organisations mainly subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. The General Directorate of National Police (GDNP) combats general crime and maintains public order. GDNP fields 26,578 police officers in its local and national sections. The bulk of criminal cases are transport-related, followed by theft and drug-related crime; homicide rates are low. The Ministry of the Interior also heads the Border Police Service and the National Gendarmerie\u2014a specialized branch for anti-terrorist activity, crisis management and riot control. Counterintelligence and national security are the responsibility of the State Agency for National Security.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nBulgaria is a unitary state. Since the 1880s, the number of territorial management units has varied from seven to 26. Between 1987 and 1999 the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces (oblasti, singular oblast). A new administrative structure was adopted in parallel with the decentralization of the economic system. It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province (Sofia-Grad). All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces are subdivided into 265 municipalities. Municipalities are run by mayors, who are elected to four-year terms, and by directly elected municipal councils. Bulgaria is a highly centralized state where the Council of Ministers directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding.\n\n\n=== Largest cities and towns ===\n\n\n=== Foreign relations and security ===\n\nBulgaria became a member of the United Nations in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the Security Council three times, most recently from 2002 to 2003. It was also among the founding nations of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1975. Euro-Atlantic integration has been a priority since the fall of communism, although the communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the European Communities by 1987. Bulgaria signed the European Union Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005, and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007. In addition, it has a tripartite economic and diplomatic collaboration with Romania and Greece, good ties with China and Vietnam and a historical relationship with Russia.\n\nBulgaria deployed significant numbers of both civilian and military advisors in Soviet-allied countries like Nicaragua and Libya during the Cold War. The first deployment of foreign troops on Bulgarian soil since World War II occurred in 2001, when the country hosted six KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft and 200 support personnel for the war effort in Afghanistan. International military relations were further expanded with accession to NATO in March 2004 and the US-Bulgarian Defence Cooperation Agreement signed in April 2006. Bezmer and Graf Ignatievo air bases, the Novo Selo training range, and a logistics centre in Aytos subsequently became joint military training facilities cooperatively used by the United States and Bulgarian militaries. Despite its active international defence collaborations, Bulgaria ranks as among the most peaceful countries globally, tying 6th alongside Iceland regarding domestic and international conflicts, and 26th on average in the Global Peace Index.Domestic defence is the responsibility of the all-volunteer Bulgarian armed forces, composed of land forces, navy and an air force. The land forces consist of two mechanized brigades and eight independent regiments and battalions; the air force operates 106 aircraft and air defence systems in six air bases, and the navy operates various ships, helicopters and coastal defence weapons. Active troops dwindled from 152,000 in 1988 to 31,300 in 2017, supplemented by 3,000 reservists and 16,000 paramilitary. Inventory is mostly made up of Soviet equipment like Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-25 jets, S-300PT air defence systems and SS-21 Scarab short-range ballistic missiles.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBulgaria has an open, upper middle income range market economy where the private sector accounts for more than 70% of GDP. From a largely agricultural country with a predominantly rural population in 1948, by the 1980s Bulgaria had transformed into an industrial economy with scientific and technological research at the top of its budgetary expenditure priorities. The loss of COMECON markets in 1990 and the subsequent \"shock therapy\" of the planned system caused a steep decline in industrial and agricultural production, ultimately followed by an economic collapse in 1997. The economy largely recovered during a period of rapid growth several years later, but the average salary of 1,036 leva ($615) per month remains the lowest in the EU. More than a fifth of the labour force are employed on a minimum wage of $1.16 per hour.A balanced budget was achieved in 2003 and the country began running a surplus the following year. Expenditures amounted to $21.15 billion and revenues were $21.67 billion in 2017. Most government spending on institutions is earmarked for security. The ministries of defence, the interior and justice are allocated the largest share of the annual government budget, whereas those responsible for the environment, tourism and energy receive the least amount of funding. Taxes form the bulk of government revenue at 30% of GDP. Bulgaria has some of the lowest corporate income tax rates in the EU at a flat 10% rate. The tax system is two-tier. Value added tax, excise duties, corporate and personal income tax are national, whereas real estate, inheritance, and vehicle taxes are levied by local authorities. Strong economic performance in the early 2000s reduced government debt from 79.6% in 1998 to 14.1% in 2008. It has since increased to 28.7% of GDP by 2016, but remains the third lowest in the EU.The Yugozapaden planning area is the most developed region with a per capita gross domestic product (PPP) of $26,580 in 2016. It includes the capital city and the surrounding Sofia Province, which alone generate 42% of national gross domestic product despite hosting only 22% of the population. GDP per capita (in PPS) and the cost of living in 2018 stood at 51 and 50.5% of the EU average, respectively. National PPP GDP was estimated at $143.1 billion in 2016, with a per capita value of $20,116. Economic growth statistics take into account illegal transactions from the informal economy, which is the largest in the EU as a percentage of economic output. The Bulgarian National Bank issues the national currency, lev, which is pegged to the euro at a rate of 1.95583 lev\u0430 per euro.After several consecutive years of high growth, repercussions of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 resulted in a 3.6% contraction of GDP in 2009 and increased unemployment. Industrial output declined 10%, mining by 31%, and ferrous and metal production marked a 60% drop. Positive growth was restored in 2010 but intercompany debt exceeded $59 billion, meaning that 60% of all Bulgarian companies were mutually indebted. By 2012, it had increased to $97 billion, or 227% of GDP. The government implemented strict austerity measures with IMF and EU encouragement to some positive fiscal results, but the social consequences of these measures, such as increased income inequality and accelerated outward migration, have been \"catastrophic\" according to the International Trade Union Confederation.Siphoning of public funds to the families and relatives of politicians from incumbent parties has resulted in fiscal and welfare losses to society. Bulgaria ranks 71st in the Corruption Perceptions Index and experiences the worst levels of corruption in the European Union, a phenomenon that remains a source of profound public discontent. Along with organized crime, corruption has resulted in a rejection of the country's Schengen Area application and withdrawal of foreign investment. Government officials reportedly engage in embezzlement, influence trading, government procurement violations and bribery with impunity. Government procurement in particular is a critical area in corruption risk. An estimated 10 billion leva ($5.99 billion) of state budget and European cohesion funds are spent on public tenders each year; nearly 14 billion ($8.38 billion) were spent on public contracts in 2017 alone. A large share of these contracts are awarded to a few politically connected companies amid widespread irregularities, procedure violations and tailor-made award criteria. Despite repeated criticism from the European Commission, EU institutions refrain from taking measures against Bulgaria because it supports Brussels on a number of issues, unlike Poland or Hungary.\n\n\n=== Structure and sectors ===\n\nThe labour force is 3.36 million people, of whom 6.8% are employed in agriculture, 26.6% in industry and 66.6% in the services sector. Extraction of metals and minerals, production of chemicals, machine building, steel, biotechnology, tobacco and food processing and petroleum refining are among the major industrial activities. Mining alone employs 24,000 people and generates about 5% of the country's GDP; the number of employed in all mining-related industries is 120,000. Bulgaria is Europe's fifth-largest coal producer. Local deposits of coal, iron, copper and lead are vital for the manufacturing and energy sectors. The main destinations of Bulgarian exports outside the EU are Turkey, China and the United States, while Russia and Turkey are by far the largest import partners. Most of the exports are manufactured goods, machinery, chemicals, fuel products and food. Two-thirds of food and agricultural exports go to OECD countries.Although cereal and vegetable output dropped by 40% between 1990 and 2008, output in grains has since increased, and the 2016\u20132017 season registered the biggest grain output in a decade. Maize, barley, oats and rice are also grown. Quality Oriental tobacco is a significant industrial crop. Bulgaria is also the largest producer globally of lavender and rose oil, both widely used in fragrances. Within the services sector, tourism is a significant contributor to economic growth. Sofia, Plovdiv, Veliko Tarnovo, coastal resorts Albena, Golden Sands and Sunny Beach and winter resorts Bansko, Pamporovo and Borovets are some of the locations most visited by tourists. Most visitors are Romanian, Turkish, Greek and German. Tourism is additionally encouraged through the 100 Tourist Sites system.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\n\nSpending on research and development amounts to 0.78% of GDP, and the bulk of public R&D funding goes to the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS). Private businesses accounted for more than 73% of R&D expenditures and employed 42% of Bulgaria's 22,000 researchers in 2015. The same year, Bulgaria ranked 39th out of 50 countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index, the highest score being in education (24th) and the lowest in value-added manufacturing (48th). Chronic government underinvestment in research since 1990 has forced many professionals in science and engineering to leave Bulgaria.\n\nDespite the lack of funding, research in chemistry, materials science and physics remains strong. Antarctic research is actively carried out through the St. Kliment Ohridski Base on Livingston Island in Western Antarctica. The information and communication technologies (ICT) sector generates three per cent of economic output and employs 40,000 to 51,000 software engineers. Bulgaria was known as a \"Communist Silicon Valley\" during the Soviet era due to its key role in COMECON computing technology production. The country is a regional leader in high performance computing: it operates Avitohol, the most powerful supercomputer in Southeast Europe, and will host one of the eight petascale EuroHPC supercomputers.Bulgaria has made numerous contributions to space exploration. These include two scientific satellites, more than 200 payloads and 300 experiments in Earth orbit, as well as two cosmonauts since 1971. Bulgaria was the first country to grow wheat and vegetables in space with its Svet greenhouses on the Mir space station. It was involved in the development of the Granat gamma-ray observatory and the Vega program, particularly in modelling trajectories and guidance algorithms for both Vega probes. Bulgarian instruments have been used in the exploration of Mars, including a spectrometer that took the first high quality spectroscopic images of Martian moon Phobos with the Phobos 2 probe. Cosmic radiation en route to and around the planet has been mapped by Liulin-ML dosimeters on the ExoMars TGO. Variants of these instruments have also been fitted on the International Space Station and the Chandrayaan-1 lunar probe. Another lunar mission, SpaceIL's Beresheet, was also equipped with a Bulgarian-manufactured imaging payload. Bulgaria's first geostationary communications satellite\u2014BulgariaSat-1\u2014was launched by SpaceX in 2017.\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\n\nTelephone services are widely available, and a central digital trunk line connects most regions. Vivacom (BTC) serves more than 90% of fixed lines and is one of the three operators providing mobile services, along with A1 and Telenor. Internet penetration stood at 66.8% of the population aged 16\u201374 and 75.1% of households, in 2019.Bulgaria's strategic geographic location and well-developed energy sector make it a key European energy centre despite its lack of significant fossil fuel deposits. Thermal power plants generate 48.9% of electricity, followed by nuclear power from the Kozloduy reactors (34.8%) and renewable sources (16.3%). Equipment for a second nuclear power station at Belene has been acquired, but the fate of the project remains uncertain. Installed capacity amounts to 12,668 MW, allowing Bulgaria to exceed domestic demand and export energy.The national road network has a total length of 19,512 kilometres (12,124 mi), of which 19,235 kilometres (11,952 mi) are paved. Railroads are a major mode of freight transportation, although highways carry a progressively larger share of freight. Bulgaria has 6,238 kilometres (3,876 mi) of railway track and currently a total of 81 kilometres (50 miles) of high-speed lines are in operation. Rail links are available with Romania, Turkey, Greece, and Serbia, and express trains serve direct routes to Kiev, Minsk, Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Sofia and Plovdiv are the country's air travel hubs, while Varna and Burgas are the principal maritime trade ports.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of Bulgaria is 7,364,570 people according to the 2011 national census. The majority of the population, 72.5%, reside in urban areas. As of 2019, Sofia is the most populated urban centre with 1,241,675 people, followed by Plovdiv (346,893), Varna (336,505), Burgas (202,434) and Ruse (142,902). Bulgarians are the main ethnic group and constitute 84.8% of the population. Turkish and Roma minorities account for 8.8 and 4.9%, respectively; some 40 smaller minorities account for 0.7%, and 0.8% do not self-identify with an ethnic group. Former Statistics head Reneta Indzhova has disputed the 2011 census figures, suggesting the actual population is smaller than reported. The Roma minority is usually underestimated in census data and may represent up to 11% of the population. Population density is 65 per square kilometre, almost half the European Union average.In 2018 the average total fertility rate (TFR) across Bulgaria was 1.56 children per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1, it remains considerably below the high of 5.83 children per woman in 1905. Bulgaria subsequently has one of the oldest populations in the world, with the average age of 43 years.Bulgaria is in a state of demographic crisis. It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people\u2014mostly young adults\u2014left the country by 2005. The majority of children are born to unmarried women. Furthermore, a third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5% of families do not have children under the age of 16. The resulting birth rates are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest.High death rates result from a combination of an ageing population, a high number of people at risk of poverty and a weak healthcare system. More than 80% of all deaths are due to cancer and cardiovascular conditions; nearly a fifth of those are avoidable. Mortality rates can be sharply reduced to levels below the EU average through timely and adequate access to medical services, which the healthcare system does not provide fully. Although healthcare in Bulgaria is nominally universal, out-of-pocket expenses account for nearly half of all healthcare spending, which significantly limits access to medical care. Other problems disrupting care provision are the emigration of doctors due to low wages, understaffed and under-equipped regional hospitals, supply shortages and frequent changes to the basic service package for those insured. The 2018 Bloomberg Health Care Efficiency Index ranked Bulgaria last out of 56 countries. Average life expectancy is 74.8 years compared with an EU average of 80.99 and a world average of 72.38.\nPublic expenditures for education are far below the European Union average as well. Educational standards were once high, but have declined significantly since the early 2000s. Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had dropped. By 2018, Programme for International Student Assessment studies found 47% of pupils in the 9th grade to be functionally illiterate in reading and natural sciences. Average basic literacy stands high at 98.4% with no significant difference between sexes. The Ministry of Education and Science partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. Education in primary and secondary public schools is free and compulsory. The process spans through 12 grades, where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level. Higher education consists of a 4-year bachelor degree and a 1-year master's degree. Bulgaria's highest-ranked higher education institution is Sofia University.Bulgarian is the only language with official status and native for 85% of the population. It belongs to the Slavic group of languages, but it has a number of grammatical peculiarities, shared with its closest relative Macedonian, that set it apart from other Slavic languages: these include a complex verbal morphology (which also codes for distinctions in evidentiality), the absence of noun cases and infinitives, and the use of a suffixed definite article. Other major languages are Turkish and Romani, which according to the 2011 census were spoken natively by 9.1% and 4.2% respectively.\nThe country scores high in gender equality, ranking 18th in the 2018 Global Gender Gap Report. Although women's suffrage was enabled relatively late, in 1937, women today have equal political rights, high workforce participation and legally mandated equal pay. Bulgaria has the highest ratio of female ICT researchers in the EU, as well as the second-highest ratio of females in the technology sector at 44.6% of the workforce. High levels of female participation are a legacy of the Socialist era.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nMore than three-quarters of Bulgarians subscribe to Eastern Orthodoxy. Sunni Muslims are the second-largest religious community and constitute 10% of Bulgaria's overall religious makeup, although a majority of them are not observant and find the use of Islamic veils in schools unacceptable. Less than 3% of the population are affiliated with other religions and 11.8% are irreligious or do not self-identify with a religion. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church gained autocephalous status in AD 927, and has 12 dioceses and over 2,000 priests. Bulgaria is a secular state with guaranteed religious freedom by constitution, but Orthodoxy is designated as a \"traditional\" religion.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nContemporary Bulgarian culture blends the formal culture that helped forge a national consciousness towards the end of Ottoman rule with millennia-old folk traditions. An essential element of Bulgarian folklore is fire, used to banish evil spirits and illnesses. Many of these are personified as witches, whereas other creatures like zmey and samodiva (veela) are either benevolent guardians or ambivalent tricksters. Some rituals against evil spirits have survived and are still practised, most notably kukeri and survakari. Martenitsa is also widely celebrated. Nestinarstvo, a ritual fire-dance of Thracian origin, is included in the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.Nine historical and natural objects are UNESCO World Heritage Sites:  Pirin National Park, Sreburna Nature Reserve, the Madara Rider, the Thracian tombs in Sveshtari and Kazanlak, the Rila Monastery, the Boyana Church, the Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo and the ancient city of Nesebar. The Rila Monastery was established by Saint John of Rila, Bulgaria's patron saint, whose life has been the subject of numerous literary accounts since Medieval times.The establishment of the Preslav and Ohrid literary schools in the 10th century is associated with a golden period in Bulgarian literature during the Middle Ages. The schools' emphasis on Christian scriptures made the Bulgarian Empire a centre of Slavic culture, bringing Slavs under the influence of Christianity and providing them with a written language. Its alphabet, Cyrillic script, was developed by the Preslav Literary School. The Tarnovo Literary School, on the other hand, is associated with a Silver age of literature defined by high-quality manuscripts on historical or mystical themes under the Asen and Shishman dynasties. Many literary and artistic masterpieces were destroyed by the Ottoman conquerors, and artistic activities did not re-emerge until the National Revival in the 19th century. The enormous body of work of Ivan Vazov (1850\u20131921) covered every genre and touched upon every facet of Bulgarian society, bridging pre-Liberation works with literature of the newly established state. Notable later works are Bay Ganyo by Aleko Konstantinov, the Nietzschean poetry of Pencho Slaveykov, the Symbolist poetry of Peyo Yavorov and Dimcho Debelyanov, the Marxist-inspired works of Geo Milev and Nikola Vaptsarov, and the Socialist realism novels of Dimitar Dimov and Dimitar Talev. Tzvetan Todorov is a notable contemporary author, while Bulgarian-born Elias Canetti was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981.\n\n\u0410 religious visual arts heritage includes frescoes, murals and icons, many produced by the medieval Tarnovo Artistic School. Like literature, it was not until the National Revival when Bulgarian visual arts began to reemerge. Zahari Zograf was a pioneer of the visual arts in the pre-Liberation era. After the Liberation, Ivan Mrkvi\u010dka, Anton Mitov, Vladimir Dimitrov, Tsanko Lavrenov and Zlatyu Boyadzhiev introduced newer styles and substance, depicting scenery from Bulgarian villages, old towns and historical subjects. Christo is the most famous Bulgarian artist of the 21st century, known for his outdoor installations.Folk music is by far the most extensive traditional art and has slowly developed throughout the ages as a fusion of Far Eastern, Oriental, medieval Eastern Orthodox and standard Western European tonalities and modes. Bulgarian folk music has a distinctive sound and uses a wide range of traditional instruments, such as gadulka, gaida, kaval and tupan. A distinguishing feature is extended rhythmical time, which has no equivalent in the rest of European music. The State Television Female Vocal Choir won a Grammy Award in 1990 for its performances of Bulgarian folk music. Written musical composition can be traced back to the works of Yoan Kukuzel (c. 1280\u20131360), but modern classical music began with Emanuil Manolov, who composed the first Bulgarian opera in 1890. Pancho Vladigerov and Petko Staynov further enriched symphony, ballet and opera, which singers Ghena Dimitrova, Boris Christoff, Ljuba Welitsch and Nicolai Ghiaurov elevated to a world-class level. Bulgarian performers have gained acclaim in other genres like electropop (Mira Aroyo), jazz (Milcho Leviev) and blends of jazz and folk (Ivo Papazov).The Bulgarian National Radio, bTV and daily newspapers Trud, Dnevnik and 24 Chasa are some of the largest national media outlets. Bulgarian media were described as generally unbiased in their reporting in the early 2000s and print media had no legal restrictions. Since then, freedom of the press has deteriorated to the point where Bulgaria scores 111th globally in the World Press Freedom Index, lower than all European Union members and membership candidate states. The government has diverted EU funds to sympathetic media outlets and bribed others to be less critical on problematic topics, while attacks against individual journalists have increased. Collusion between politicians, oligarchs and the media is widespread.Bulgarian cuisine is similar to that of other Balkan countries and demonstrates strong Turkish and Greek influences. Yogurt, lukanka, banitsa, shopska salad, lyutenitsa and kozunak are among the best-known local foods. Meat consumption is lower than the European average, given a cultural preference for a large variety of salads. Bulgaria was the world's second-largest wine exporter until 1989, but has since lost that position. The 2016 harvest yielded 128 million litres of wine, of which 62 million was exported mainly to Romania, Poland and Russia. Mavrud, Rubin, Shiroka melnishka, Dimiat and Cherven Misket are the typical grapes used in Bulgarian wine. Rakia is a traditional fruit brandy that was consumed in Bulgaria as early as the 14th century.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nBulgaria appeared at the first modern Olympic games in 1896, when it was represented by gymnast Charles Champaud. Since then, Bulgarian athletes have won 52 gold, 89 silver, and 83 bronze medals, ranking 25th in the all-time medal table. Weight-lifting is a signature sport of Bulgaria. Coach Ivan Abadzhiev developed innovative training practices that have produced many Bulgarian world and Olympic champions in weight-lifting since the 1980s. Bulgarian athletes have also excelled in wrestling, boxing, gymnastics, volleyball and tennis. Stefka Kostadinova is the reigning world record holder in the women's high jump at 2.09 metres (6 feet 10 inches), achieved during the 1987 World Championships. Grigor Dimitrov is the first Bulgarian tennis player in the Top 3 ATP Rankings.Football is the most popular sport in the country by a substantial margin. The national football team's best performance was a semi-final at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, when the squad was spearheaded by forward Hristo Stoichkov. Stoichkov is the most successful Bulgarian player of all time; he was awarded the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball and was considered one of the best in the world while playing for FC Barcelona in the 1990s. CSKA and Levski, both based in Sofia, are the most successful clubs domestically and long-standing rivals. Ludogorets is remarkable for having advanced from the local fourth division to the 2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League group stage in a mere nine years. Placed 39th in 2018, it is Bulgaria's highest-ranked club in UEFA.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nOutline of Bulgaria\nCraiova Group\nEuropean Union\nEurope\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBulgaria at Curlie\nBulgaria at UCB Libraries GovPubs.\n Wikimedia Atlas of Bulgaria\n Geographic data related to Bulgaria at OpenStreetMap\nBulgaria Profile from Balkan Insight\nPresident of The Republic of Bulgaria",

          "After going up a lot of stairs finally you reach to the entrance, there are 7 (I \u2018m not sure)slides with loops , there is kids pool and cafe in the area, for locker you have to pay , there are changing room and toilets and lots of sun beds and also umbrellas for free, if you",
          "Good and refreshing. Kids enjoy a lot. Even suited for adults and teenagers. You can walk to the place from most places",
          "Visited the park on a Tuesday arrived at 10.30am to see there was 150 steps to entrance. No food or drink allowed into park and they do check your bags....once inside plenty of sun beds and umbrellas. 6 slides, a lazy river and a kids area...swim up bar and food areas. Only down",

          "Great day out we walked to the park from Kini Park hotel took around 20 minutes. The kids from ages 3 to 15 all had fun. The park was clean with plenty of bins located throughout the park. My son got stung by a wasp and the medical team took care of him to ensure he soon forgot",
          "We spent an amazing day out here. We arrived as they opened at 10am and pretty much had the park to ourselves for almost an hour. We ate at one of the on-site restaurants and it was very reasonably priced - I was surprised, because these attractions usually come with inflated",
          "Avoid at all costs. Despite being told it was accessible for those with mobility issues, we found it was not. Many steps to pay window. More steps to barrier. Went after 4pm, as it was cheaper and website said til 7pm. After paying, told exit by 6.30pm and car park locked at",

          "We recently visited Aquapolis during our holiday to golden sands. It was perfect as only a 10 minute walk from our hotel. Lots of stairs to get up to the entrance but fine for us as no pushchairs or anything but could be tricky if you have restricted mobility. The park isn't",
          "The slides are fun, but the safety is not up to standard. I hurt my tailbone from hitting the bottom on Kamikaze, hit the back of my head on Colorado and my girlfriend also had several scratches and bruises. I think there is a real chance of getting seriously injured in this",
          "Great day out if you are staying locally. Reasonably priced. Wasn't over crowded so barely any queuing. You can put your valuables in a lockers so they are safe whilst you go on the slides. But be warned, to gain entr\u00e9e to the water park you have to climb many steps, this",

Plenty of slides for thrill seekers or family friendly slides for little children, with a children\u2019s swimming pool and climbing area and a lagoon pool with waves. Also, my dad couldn\u2019t get on most slides as",

          "This place is fun for the whole family. There are lots of good slides, with different heights. You are provided with a rubber ring which you use on the slides and lazy river which you could go round all day on. Not too busy and no queues for the slides which was superb and also",
          "Was a wonderful day out. We spent the whole day here lounging by the pool and going on the slides. There was no big queues for the slides which made it a lot more fun as there was no waiting around. We ate at the resteraunt and all of us really enjoyed our meal. Would definitely",

          "A nice water park which we did walk to from our hotel, lots of steps to walk up. A little expensive for us as neither my husband or myself used pool or slides but still had to pay full price, and it goes on height so our 8yr old was full price too. The boys loved it and the",
          "The rides are ok and the pool is filthy black mould growing on the tiles and the lazy river water is filthy we came home with ear infections. Food is over priced and for the money they charge to get into the park the could at least clean the pools.",

          "We visited the aqua park during our stay in Golden Sands and I can say I regret it 1. After paying for the entrance inside we had to pay additional for the lounge chairs which to me seems like a ripoff 2. I had some food and a note of 0.5l of bottled water for my 1 year old",
          "It was a nice place for one day with good staff and services but there was just 5 roller and children pool The floor in some places covered by cement and the stairs wewnt standard By the way it was a good place for amusing half a day",

          "We were 8 friends for a day of fun. Aquapolis isn't a real aquapark( has only 5 rides) but was ok. Even if is a little pricy we had a lot of fun. Wasn't crowded and was very ok. You need to pay sunbeds ! Most important thing is that they have free pick up shuttle ! One by all",
          "Excellent facilities for smaller kids I have a 3 year old and 7 years old boy they loved it very child friendly and loads of lifeguards on duty that were on point at all times very secure",

          "This is well worth the visit; whether with family, friends or children. Lots of different slides to try, from nice and gentle, to terrifying lol Went towards the end of the season, so was perhaps far quieter than it may be during peak season, but would still be worth any",
          "It a fun place to get wet if you happen to be in the area. It is fine and fun for kids all age. Some of the facilities desperately need remodeling and the service in the restaurant takes forever. But in general I would recommend it. Go and get wet!",
          "lots of toys and games, very helpful staff and cafe, taking photos, clean area and friendly environment, reasonable price. you have all the day to stay but a half-day could be very enjoyable.",
          "Had a blast, got wet, good time had by all. Lots of staff to make sure everyone stays safe. Will rerun soon",
          "Has got only like 5 different slides. Not so fun. You know like comparing to Malaysia Aqua Park,this one was boring!!! No pool with waves. No bulks of waters. No amused park. No different resturants.",

          "We went there to try this top attraction of Sunny Beach and of Bulgaria even if the prices we've seen on their site were pretty high, considering the lot of extras not included and without having any family choices. Still, we thought to try a half day entrance in the afternoon.",
          "There are over 100 steps to climb before you get to the entrance- beware. Very expensive to actually get in but food and drink not too bad once you are in. 5 lev per sunbed to hire but it's definitely worth it. There are very few flumes here - I think 6 in total and they are",
          "The children (aged 6, 6 and 4 years) enjoyed their stay. The waterpark is not the biggest, but the childrens area was great for the smaller kids. You can't bring even drinking water to the park. Every drink and eatble needs to be left outside of the park.",
          "It is a small waterpark near Golden sands . I has 2 restaurants and a cozy pool bar . There a plenty of sun beds and umbrellas that are all paid . You are not allowed to bring food . The negative point is that you should carry money with yourself and the wrist bands given to you",
          "There are some things that could be better: Food, it could be covered by the entrance fee, at least one Burger on the house! There are two big slides which worth to see it The other games are kind of you-can-find-in-any-aqua-parks. Totally, I recommend that for families coz",
          "A small waterpark that was value for money. Ideal for those who don't want to walk far. No queues, plenty of sunbeds (small charge) relaxing and fun. I tried all the rides which were great and felt safe on them. No food/drink is allowed inside but the prices were reasonable for",
          "Most expensive and awful park in Bulgaria, no service at all. Action Aqua park in Nessebar is better in every single way. When you arrive you have to take very long stairs, what is not nice if you have children. There are no family tickets and you pay for a child of 9 years old,",
          "Me and my family visited this amazing waterpark during our visit to festival village appartments in cap Salou, we booked the tickets through a rep in the hotel and it was made so easy! Waterpark was also only around a 15minute walk aswell so you could take in the wonderful views",
          "Charged full price for half an event as many of the rides don't open until July, including many of the places to eat. From the moment you walk in there is soo many hidden charges \u20ac9 for a locker, more if you wish for a safety deposit box. Then you are \u20ac4 per basic sun lounger",
          "It's a small water park but joyful and good.the best point is the low price of entrance ticket despite number of games are enough. The games are suitable for every ages",
          "Aquapolis is easy to get to by bus and the buses are very cheap in Bulgaria. There are not many slides at this park but there are also pools a lazy river, jacuzzi and sun beds that are nice to relax on. I would recommend that you bring a picnic as the shops and food places are",

          "We went some years ago when this area was getting popular with tourists.It was great value for money and being newly built was very clean with every facility.People very friendly, food great but if you hire a car be very careful of cars that are black with blacked out",
          "We visited this aqupark with family. Complex is nice but its goinig to bi quit older and the purity of swiming pools deosnt look like the best. Otherwise good fun for bigger children, one and hlaf yaer old baby not so many attractions. Food court is big and rich. Regular fast",
          "Ok waterpark, but pricy considering the quality and safety. Not allowed to bring your own food which is okay if the food had been good. Overall worth a visit but dont think I would go there again.",

          "We visited the water park with open minds after reading some not very good reviews. We found the Aquapolis to be an extremely pleasant day out. The steps on entry made us laugh as they seemed never ending, the price for entry 33 levs each about \u00a311 each there was a charge for",
          "This wasn't the best aqua park we went, but it was nice and kids like it. We like the drinks and the food was ok.",
          "this waterpark is well worth the visit, but as others have warned be aware of the total price having added on the extras. The entrance fee of 33 lev is reasonable for a day out, ie \u00a312 - \u00a314 dependant on exchange rate, then \u00a32 for a bed each, this is the going rate on the",
          "We were somehow disappointed probably because we were comparing Aquapolis with the Aqua parks in Nessebar and Sunny Beach. This one is smaller and offers less opportunities for entertainment. On the other hand it's more expensive and you should pay for everything on the top of",

          "It was long waiting and lot of begging from children and now here. According to the website - the most beatifull aquapark in europe we've been awaiting something \"wow\". At the beggining there was long stairway (200 stairs) - too long for children and for stroller (twin stroller)",
          "Extremely fun, for kids, teenagers, adults, adventurers and weaklings. ;) So much fun! Great slides and kids areas. Hot tiles!! Be prepared for an expensive, warm and cooled day in the sun:) Definitly worth a visit.",
          "This is probably the largest of the aqua parks in the Torrevieja area. Went there with my wife and three kids (5-11 years old). First thing we noticed was that they charge for parking. Then we bought the tickets that were quite expensive. Entered the park and were asked if we",
          "Love the water park. Great for kids and big kids. Food and drink reasonable and love the pool bar. Worth a day out.",
          "We have 3 kids and love to travel, thus we have been in many water parks around the world. Aquapolis in Golden Sands is the worse water park we ever visited. The park is very small and dirty, only few simple slides. But the main problem is the workers in this park that are",
          "Quite expencive, but really worth the visit. We left our shoes unattended when we rode the rides and no-one took them. Safe to leave them.",

          "Having visited Bulgaria a number of times over the last 10 years this is one of those places we visit again and again! No culture but a great day out, lots of fun with many water slides, a lazy river, jacuzzi. Its ideal for adults and kids alike. Not much queuing for the slides",
          "As there isn't any other similar attraction nearby, this one is OK. The main drawback is that you are not allowed to bring even water, never mind food, which is somewhat remnant from post communist era - establishment ordering customers what to eat or not - pathetic. If you know",

          "The are only 6 slides. But only 3 are really good and exciting. Prices are very high. After hour I was bored. There is one swimming pool for relax and one \"river\" but without current water and I have to push off the walls and this was tiring.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Varna Necropolis (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b) (also Varna Cemetery) is a burial site in the western industrial zone of Varna (approximately half a kilometre from Lake Varna and 4 km from the city centre), internationally considered one of the key archaeological sites in world prehistory. The oldest gold treasure in the world, dating from 4,600 BC to 4,200 BC, was discovered at the site.\n\n\n== Discovery and excavation ==\nThe site was accidentally discovered in October 1972 by excavator operator Raycho Marinov. The first to value the significant historical meaning was Dimitar Zlatarski, the creator of the Dalgopol Historical Museum. He was called by the locals to examine what they had found earlier that day. He realized how important the finding was, so he contacted the Varna Historical Museum and, after signing government papers, he handed over the research to the direction of Mihail Lazarov (1972\u20131976) and Ivan Ivanov (1972\u20131991). About 30% of the estimated necropolis area is still not excavated.\nA total of 294 graves have been found in the necropolis, many containing sophisticated examples of metallurgy (gold and copper), pottery (about 600 pieces, including gold-painted ones), high-quality flint and obsidian blades, beads, and shells.\n\n\n== Chronology ==\nThe graves have been dated to 4569\u20134340 BC by radiocarbon dating in 2006  and belong to the Chalcolithic Varna culture, which is the local variant of the KGKVI.\n\n\n== Burial rites ==\n\nThere are crouched and straight inhumations. Some graves do not contain a skeleton, but grave gifts (cenotaphs). These symbolic (empty) graves are the richest in gold artifacts. Three thousand gold artifacts were found, with a weight of approximately six kilograms. Grave 43 contained more gold than has been found in the entire rest of the world for that epoch. Three symbolic graves contained masks of unbaked clay.\nThe findings showed that the Varna culture had trade relations with distant lands (possibly including the lower Volga and the Cyclades), perhaps exporting metal goods and salt from the Provadiya rock salt mine. The copper ore used in the artifacts originated from a Sredna Gora mine near Stara Zagora, and Mediterranean Spondylus shells found in the graves may have served as primitive currency.\nThe culture had sophisticated religious beliefs about afterlife and had developed hierarchical status differences. The site offers the oldest known burial evidence of an elite male (Marija Gimbutas claims that the end of the fifth millennium BC is the time that the transition to male dominance began in Europe). The high status male buried with the most remarkable amount of gold held a war adze or mace and wore a gold penis sheath. Bull-shaped gold platelets might also have venerated virility, instinctual force, and warfare. Gimbutas holds that the artifacts were made largely by local craftspeople.\n\n\n== Historical impact ==\nAccording to M. Gimbutas (1991), \"The discontinuity of the Varna, Karanovo, Vin\u010da and Lengyel cultures in their main territories and the large scale population shifts to the north and northwest are indirect evidence of a catastrophe of such proportions that cannot be explained by possible climatic change, land exhaustion, or epidemics (for which there is no evidence in the second half of the 5th millennium B.C.). Direct evidence of the incursion of horse-riding warriors is found, not only in single burials of males under barrows, but in the emergence of a whole complex of Kurgan cultural traits.\"\nAccording to J. Chapman (2005), \"Once upon a time, not so very long ago, it was widely accepted that steppe nomads from the North Pontic zone invaded the Balkans, putting an end to the Climax Copper Age society that produced the apogee of tell living, autonomous copper metallurgy and, as the grandest climax, the Varna cemetery with its stunning early goldwork. Now the boot is very much on the other foot and it is the Varna complex and its associated communities that are held responsible for stimulating the onset of prestige goods-dominated steppe mortuary practice following the expansion of farming.\"\nAmong the metallic (gold and copper) and non-metallic (minerals, rocks, pottery, pigments, biofacts) artifacts in the graves from the Varna Chalcolithic site are numerous beads of a chalcedony (carnelian) and agate composition. Three main morphological types of beads are described: type 1 \u2013 elongated barrel-shaped; type 2 \u2013 elongated with trapezohedral facets; type 3 \u2013 short cylindrical (Kostov, 2007; Kostov, Pelevina, 2008). The carnelian and related beads of type 2 have a \"constant\" number of 32 facets \u2013 16+16 on both sides on the elongation of the bead, which is considered probably the earliest in Chalcolithic complex faceting on such a hard mineral (hardness of chalcedony is 6.5\u20137 on the Mohs scale). In the hole of a single carnelian bead was found a gold mini-cylinder (~2x2 mm). The gold artifacts from the Varna Chalcolithic necropolis are assumed to be the \"oldest gold of mankind\" according to their total volume and quantity. Analysis of the measured weight of the different types of gold art\u0435facts (beads, appliqu\u00e9s, rings, bracelets, pectorals and diadems) revealed a weight system with at least two minimal weight units of ~0.14 and ~0.40 g among both mineral and gold beads (Kostov, 2004; 2007). The second one (=2 carats) was suggested as a basic \"Chalcolithic unit\" with the name van (from the first letters of Varna necropolis).\n\n\n== Museum exhibitions ==\n\nThe artifacts can be seen at the Varna Archaeological Museum and at the National Historical Museum in Sofia. In 2006, some gold objects were included in a major and broadly advertised national exhibition of antique gold treasures in both Sofia and Varna.\nThe Varna gold started touring the world in 1973; it was included in \"The Gold of the Thracian Horseman\" national exhibition, shown at many of the world's leading museums and exhibition venues in the 1970s. In 1982, it was exhibited for 7 months in Japan as \"The Oldest Gold in the World - The First European Civilization\" with massive publicity, including two full length TV documentaries. In the 1980s and 1990s it was also shown in Canada, Germany, France, Italy, and Israel, among others, and featured in a cover story by the National Geographic Magazine.\nThe Varna necropolis artifacts were shown for the first time in the United States in 1998 and 1999 as part of a major Bulgarian archaeological exhibition, Thracians' Riches: Treasures from Bulgaria. In 2009\u20132010, several artifacts were shown at the New York University Institute for the Study of the Ancient World in a joint Bulgarian-Romanian-Moldovan exhibition entitled The Lost World of Old Europe: The Danube Valley, 5000\u20133500 BC.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOld Europe\nPrehistoric Balkans\nVarna culture, Hamangia culture (directly related)\nGumelni\u021ba\u2013Karanovo culture, Karanovo culture, Lengyel culture (distantly related)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAnthony, D.

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories.

Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989. It specialises in International Economics and Administration, Law, and Architecture.\n\n\n=== Institutes and colleges ===\nThere are four BAS research institutes: Oceanology, Fisheries, Aero and Hydrodynamics, Metallography.

Over the past few decades, it developed as a festival centre of international standing. Varna is a front-runner for European Capital of Culture for 2019, planning to open several new high-profile facilities such as a new opera house and concert hall, a new exhibition centre, and a reconstruction of the Summer Theatre, the historic venue of the International Ballet Competition.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nVarna Archaeological Museum (founded 1888)\nNaval Museum (founded 1923)\nRoman Baths\nAladzha Monastery\nBattle of Varna Park Museum (founded 1924)\nMuseum of Ethnography\nNational Revival Museum\nHistory of Varna Museum\nHistory of Medicine Museum\nHealth Museum (children's)\nPuppet Museum (antique puppets from Puppet Theatre shows)\nBulgar Settlement of Phanagoria ethnographical village (mockup, with historical reenactments)\nAquarium (founded 1912)\nNicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium\nNaval Academy Planetarium\nMuseum of Natural History\nTerrarium\nVarna Zoo\nDolphinarium (founded 1984)\n\n\n=== Galleries ===\nBoris Georgiev City Art Gallery\nGeorgi Velchev Gallery\nModern Art Centre (Graffit Gallery Hotel)\nPrint Gallery\nNumerous smaller fine and applied arts galleries\n\n\n=== Performing arts professional companies ===\n\nOpera and Philharmonic Society (opera, symphonic and chamber music, ballet, and operetta performances;

          "We where visiting Varna and walking through the big Sea side park when we saw signes for the zoo. Since our Kids(twins) love animals we decided to pay it a visit. The entrance fee is very low, so that's a plus! The park itself is very clean and the animals look very well cared",
          "It was 3 lev to enter what looked like a small petting zoo in Varna sea gardens. This seemed reasonable and a good place to go to after reading online about \u2018top\u2019 things to do in Varna. I could not believe my eyes though when I saw the size of the enclosures for these poor",
          "For starters, I recommend them to charge more to foreigner tourists, just for the sake of improving the installation. It's a small but diverse zoo, with more budget it could greatly improve the animals well-being and attract more people. It was very nice to sit down on a bench",
          "There are many species of birds and animals Ticket prices are cheap even with a discount for children, students and retirees You can walk and browse or just sit on a bench and watch the animals One of my favorite places in Varna",

          "It's good that it's there. Because small children have a place to see and smell real animals, but this is the epic positive thing. With this funny fee of 1.5 leva I know that it is not possible to secure the improvement of the conditions and increase of the animals as species,",
          "The zoo is small and the animals are all just sad. I believe if they charged more they'll be able to pay the workers to do more and better. It is NOT a bad zoo, just don't go there expecting to see a real zoo -- it's more like a nice big garden with animals.",

          "Me and my wife had different views on the matter, first of all 1.5 Lev entrance, 1 for elderly and students, a joke of a price. Most of small animal shelters are hand made with wood planks. The bigger animals are really close to the walking trace, you could literally touch the",

          "An excellent way to spend an hour with our children. Was really nice to see animals being kept in such good conditions and none of them seemed stressed. Good value for money too, 75p each to go in, free food to feed the animals in the close encounter area. Worth a visit, the",

          "The zoo was a great stop - for a very cheap price, we got to get our children a glimpse of some very cool animals. However, the lions and bear were kept in very small enclosures, and I wonder if they had enough room. Additionally, there was a small horse which roamed freely",

          "I found the zoo to be fairly well kept and maintained. The animals seemed relaxed and cared for. The weather was nice warm and sunny. It is not a large zoo but has a good variety of different animals. The entry fee was very low and they staff on the desk were very helpful.",

          "This zoo is very good for what it is. It only costs 1.5 lev each to enter so don't know how they manage to look after the animals on this money as well as maintain the zoo itself. The animals looked well cared for but some enclosures could do with being updated. Visited a couple",

          "We saw a lot of large or small, modern or old zoos but the zoo in Varna is the most horrible. This is not a zoo but the nineteenth century menagerie. Most of the animals live in terrible conditions. Old, rusty cages. Mainly concrete or mud on the paddock for animals."

        "wiki": "Golden Sands (Bulgarian: \u0417\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u044f\u0441\u044a\u0446\u0438, Zlatni pyasatsi) is a major seaside resort town on the northern Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, adjacent to a national park of the same name in the municipality of Varna. \nLocated 17 km north of downtown Varna, it is virtually connected to the city by a continuous swath of resorts and villa communities. It is a popular tourist destination, drawing many visitors from Romania, Ukraine, Poland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, Scandinavia, France, Central and Eastern Europe, the Persian Gulf, Israel, and other countries.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nGolden Sands is served by several regular bus lines of the Varna public transit system. Buses 9, 89 and 109 connect the resort to Varna Railway Station, bus 409 connects to Varna International Airport via the city centre and buses 209 and 309 connect to other areas of Varna.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nThe old-growth forests between ancient Odessos and Dionysopolis were first mentioned by Pliny as the home of mythical dwarfs, visited by the Argonauts. Byzantine sources name the local fortress Gerania; there are 4th-7th century AD remains of massive stone ramparts and a basilica along the edge of the Franga plateau. The cave Aladzha Monastery, 3 km to the west, was a monastic centre from antiquity through the Second Bulgarian Empire. In the days of the Ottoman Empire, Uzunkum (Turkish: long sands) was known as a hideaway for outlaws. It was largely uninhabited until the 1950s, although used for outings. \nResort development started in 1957 and in about two decades, the place was transformed into a modern holiday complex with numerous hotels (many open year-round), villas, apartment buildings, spa centres, restaurants, clubs, casinos, attractions, shopping centres, and sports facilities, including a yacht marina, a horse riding school, and the Aquapolis water park. Golden Sands was privatized in the 1990s and attracted considerable investment through the 2000s. Designed initially for 13,000 hotel beds, it had over 30,000 beds reported in 2007; according to Varna Tourist Chamber sources, the actual number was significantly higher, by some unverified critical estimates even approaching 90,000. Currently, most hotels offer all-inclusive vacations, but there are also concerted efforts to reposition the resort as a high-end destination.\nThe area is labelled to have the purest quartz sand on the coast and abounds in old trees, landscaped gardens, and pedestrian malls. Golden Sands authorities resist demands to provide more automobile roads and car parks, citing the resort's reputation as family friendly, green, and a largely pedestrian place. \nHot mineral water springs and lush woodlands cascading from the Franga Plateau, forming the Golden Sands Nature Park, turn the town into one of the most popular tourist spots in Eastern Europe. It also comprises the Holiday Club Riviera luxury resort, several villa communities including Panorama, Chaika, Kabakum, and Alen Mak, and the historic grotto of Aladzha Monastery in the vicinity. A contemporary chapel of John the Baptist was recently added. Just north is perhaps the best known gay beach in the nation. Three 18-hole golf courses designed by Gary Player and Ian Woosnam are currently (2007) being developed around Balchik and Kavarna a short drive to the north.\n\n \nGolden Sands urban development took place within a protected area declared in 1943 (its original name was Hachuka State Forest); some nature landmarks were lost in the process, such as beach freshwater ponds abounding in tortoises and snakes and beach nesting bird habitats. But the bulk of the nature park was preserved and its area expanded almost twice to over 1,300 hectares. In the 2000s, although Golden Sands managed to a large extent to avoid being overdeveloped as other large resorts were, parts of the protected forest adjacent to the urban area were cleared for the construction of the Aquapolis water park. \nIn 2007, a larger-capacity water purification plant was also badly needed. The scenic route Varna-Golden Sands, ruptured by a small landslide caused by overdevelopment in the Lipov Kladenets villa district in 2004, remained closed and all traffic redirected to inland roads. In 2007, all roads proved inadequate to handle an unexpected surge of Romanian motorists looking for all-inclusive deals during the Easter and May Day vacations, causing massive traffic jams and accidents.\n\n\n== Buildings and structures ==\nIn 2007, a 1:10 replica of the Eiffel Tower with an observation deck and a restaurant was erected.\nThe tallest building is INTERNATIONAL Hotel Casino & Tower Suites\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Visited with my daughter end Aug. Small water park showing its age, lots of very steep steps to entrance. Not very busy when we visited so queues not a problem. Food well priced, fresh and hot. As mentioned in prev reviews safety is a huge issue at this park with the lifeguards",
          "After going up a lot of stairs finally you reach to the entrance, there are 7 (I \u2018m not sure)slides with loops , there is kids pool and cafe in the area, for locker you have to pay , there are changing room and toilets and lots of sun beds and also umbrellas for free, if you",
          "Good and refreshing. Kids enjoy a lot. Even suited for adults and teenagers. You can walk to the place from most places",
          "Visited the park on a Tuesday arrived at 10.30am to see there was 150 steps to entrance. No food or drink allowed into park and they do check your bags....once inside plenty of sun beds and umbrellas. 6 slides, a lazy river and a kids area...swim up bar and food areas. Only down",
          "Family day out 4 children 3 Adults. Small park so easy to locate your children. The park was not busy so plenty of loungers and umbrellas. The lazy river was very slow and also quite dirty. There were approx 6 big slides and 4 little ones. There was enough to keep us busy. The",
          "Great day out we walked to the park from Kini Park hotel took around 20 minutes. The kids from ages 3 to 15 all had fun. The park was clean with plenty of bins located throughout the park. My son got stung by a wasp and the medical team took care of him to ensure he soon forgot",
          "We spent an amazing day out here. We arrived as they opened at 10am and pretty much had the park to ourselves for almost an hour. We ate at one of the on-site restaurants and it was very reasonably priced - I was surprised, because these attractions usually come with inflated",
          "Avoid at all costs. Despite being told it was accessible for those with mobility issues, we found it was not. Many steps to pay window. More steps to barrier. Went after 4pm, as it was cheaper and website said til 7pm. After paying, told exit by 6.30pm and car park locked at",
          "We didn't have a very good time here. Great offer for kids, butthere was nothing to do while we waited for it to pass...",
          "We spent a nice, full day here, and really enjoyed it. Nice slopes, and lots of sun-beds. And friendly staff. Well worth a day away from the beach!",
          "We recently visited Aquapolis during our holiday to golden sands. It was perfect as only a 10 minute walk from our hotel. Lots of stairs to get up to the entrance but fine for us as no pushchairs or anything but could be tricky if you have restricted mobility. The park isn't",
          "The slides are fun, but the safety is not up to standard. I hurt my tailbone from hitting the bottom on Kamikaze, hit the back of my head on Colorado and my girlfriend also had several scratches and bruises. I think there is a real chance of getting seriously injured in this",
          "Great day out if you are staying locally. Reasonably priced. Wasn't over crowded so barely any queuing. You can put your valuables in a lockers so they are safe whilst you go on the slides. But be warned, to gain entr\u00e9e to the water park you have to climb many steps, this",
          "It's almost the smallest water park I've ever been. The river is small and very few games. My hotel had almost the same facilities in it. If you don't visit here, will not miss too much.",
          "Came here with my father and his wife, my partner and my 21 year old son. My father has a stick and can\u2019t walk too far, be warned there are about ten million steps! Stuffed if you have a wheel chair or pram. Expensive I thought to get in 35 levs each! I\u2019ve been to much better",
          "We came here not looking at reviews just knew the price. Was fair value for our family of 5, be aware if your child is under 120cm tall they expect them to wear armbands or swim vest even if they can swim, my 6 year old was 119cm and can swim 100m. So we took her red band off",
          "The place was nice. They have attractions both for kids and teens. Place is clean and cozy. The staff (except an excellent girl) was awful-no support, no instructions, no cautions, no smile. There are two restaurants, the one in the upper part was great: helpful staff, excellent",
          "Its a family place every corner you look you can find a family enjoying their time. Staff were so kind and supportive they speak both English and Dutch. Restaurant prices were good for golden sands. The entry stairs are too much and we didn't find any elevator at the entry its",
          "Was slightly nervous given the previous reviews. As we have found time and time again these are NOT true. We paid \u00a370 to get in, \u00a31 for a locker, the sun beds and umbrellas were free and the photos at the end of the day were \u00a33.50 each. I do however believe there has been a",
          "I have two children aged 10 & 14. We spent the whole day here, it was great, kids loved it. Very clean, no queueing for hours great places to eat.",
          "AquaPolis is the best watermark in Bulgaria is nice and beutifull for family and friends we will return next year",
          "Great day out yesterday, was a bit torn if we should go to this water park of the Caribbean (not sure of spelling )one close by, but after speaking to others at our hotel we decided aquapolis, Glad we did had a good day out, found it clean, lots of room to move about, Longest",
          "Nice attractions and good price. The entrance costs 35 leva per person. There are 6 different types of slides. Not boring plus the one is a little bit scary ;) The food and the drinks are pretty expensive.",
          "place is lovely but very expensive for what slides are there. my partner and i did everything twice in an hour or so",
          "We visited here with my 11month old son. We nonkt really spent a couple of hours here as only one pool with a couple of small slidea was suitable for him. I assumed, maybe wrongly, that we would be able to take him on the slightly bigger slides on our laps, but when we did so we",
          "So if you asked my kids they\u2019d say it was best day of the holiday. They absolutely loved every minute of it. My daughter 3 enjoyed the toddler slides and pools and my son 14 loved the larger slides. We spent like 4 hours there which was fun filled. Then theirs my thoughts and",
          "Looked on the Facebook page and there was a special offer...only 25lv instead of 35lv... arrived to find out this offer only applies if you are Bulgarian!!! Any visitors from other countries must pay full price !!! So wrong!!! Not alot to do... on the positive side there are",
          "TUI advised us that due to a local council inspection of the water park they advised that NO ONE goes to this park as its un safe",
          "Still too cold for water activities.. Hopefully will be warmer from mid June onwards. Plan on spending max 4 hours here unless you plan to lie in the sun all day. It is not as big as most water parks but really good for kids to have fun whilst you lie under a tree.",
          "Not impressed. It's OK but needs some renovation. There are a few water slides, lazy river, almost nothing for very young kids and this is it basically.",
          "Great time,smaller than other water parks we have been to but for the cost it is well worth it, enough rides to keep you happy and all sunbeds are free.",
          "Me and my gf decided to visit the park monday 17th of september it was a fair walk but we didnt want to spend out on a cab and was lucky we didnt as when we got there was shut, it doesnt say this anywhere on the website and the hotels, beaches and streets are still packed out so",
          "Visited as part of our trip to Golden Sands with a 20 month old and partner. this water park is only a short way from golden sands beach so great location! however, there is only a very long staircase up to the main doors so be aware if travelling with a buggy! it has two",
          "I was with my family very interesting my daughter love (9years old) and I like play any equipment for playing . for 7 hours is good",
          "No so good experience. Boring time, few slides, awful bed-lounge, old surroundings. Awful food, I think that they get the food from the freezer. They don't invest in this place and it's obvious.",
          "Hard to spend a whole day here. The life guards seemed to be sun bathing and lying down while blowing whistles all day. Nice grounds and the lazy river was ok. Thought I was gonna fly off one of the slides and it was scary",
          "Well, this was disappointment. Place was half empty, only few restaurants on site. Pipes were kids size and whole environment boring. One hour is just enough and overpriced compared to similar...",
          "HI Well to start with the positive things the only one I found is that this place is not so crowded so kids can play easily and the food is acceptable and not expensive... BUT In parallel many negative things: 1- Transportation not so easy. 2- Price is ok but it is expensive if",
          "It was very nice being here. In the end of the day we slept like babies after climbing all those stairs. The employees weren\u2019t smiling at all. It was very unpleasant to be treated with such an attitude. But the rest was ok.",
          "The food is pretty good u dont starve There are not a lot of tourists so u dont stay long at lines Pregnant ladies have free pass",
          "A good way to spend a few hours in the sun. Be aware that if you have children then unless they\u2019re quite young then you will be paying adult price at 35 lev as the limit is set at less than 4 feet tall! There also seems to be some sort of racket with the local taxis as we were",
          "It is the only one in Varna area. It is great for family and friends. Water is clean and has a good temperature. There is a small restaurant.",
          "Quality slides. Amazing views of the mountain. Cheap quality fast food. Plenty of slides for thrill seekers or family friendly slides for little children, with a children\u2019s swimming pool and climbing area and a lagoon pool with waves. Also, my dad couldn\u2019t get on most slides as",
          "Fantastic day out! We loved it so much we visited twice! Plenty of sunloungers, really clean, food was nice and a reasonable price and most of all the slides were fab!",
          "This place is fun for the whole family. There are lots of good slides, with different heights. You are provided with a rubber ring which you use on the slides and lazy river which you could go round all day on. Not too busy and no queues for the slides which was superb and also",
          "Was a wonderful day out. We spent the whole day here lounging by the pool and going on the slides. There was no big queues for the slides which made it a lot more fun as there was no waiting around. We ate at the resteraunt and all of us really enjoyed our meal. Would definitely",
          "Small but fun Aqua park, would recommend going there for anyone interested in this sort of things! Some nice slides plus a swimming area",
          "The six slides at aquapolis are all excellent and reasonably thrilling. The park is quiet and peaceful and nicely laid out. Prices are reasonable and definitely worth a visit.",
          "I was so looking forward to a day out at the waterpark mentioned...I am appalled that you can't take snacks and basics like water into the park. They search your bags and you have to leave all food etc they take it out for you!!!. I am a diabetic ?!! I tried to explain but they",
          "We visited Aquapolis on Sunday 12th August. The Park is very small and does not have many slides buy what they do have are ok. You could not spend a whole day here. Please be careful of the on site Doctors my step daughter was winded coming down a water slide. My fiancee went to",
          "A family of 7, (three children 6,4 and 2, parents and grandparents). We were given the option of paying 35 or 18 lev for the 6 year old as she was just above the 120cms height. As she loves water parks we opted for the higher price giving her access to all the slides and she",
          "All the whisteling make you distracted from looking after your own kids. Seems like most of the whisteling isnt even reasonable! Totally stressful! Fun slides and pools but too much cews!!!",
          "Fab little water park. Not enough for a whole day really but if you go after 4pm you get a reduced entry rate and still have 3 hours to enjoy the park which is long enough. Drinks are the same prices in town so still cheap. We loved the slides. Collect ur inflatable before you",
          "Have just had a great day at Aquapolis water park golden sands.It cost \u00a364 admission for 2 adults and 2 children over 120cm(which is the height minimum to use all slides).It is quite a small water park compared to others we\u2019ve been to,however was not at all crowded and never had",
          "had a very good day out and food nice and reasonably priced too. not very big but worth a visit !!!!",
          "I visited with my 6 year old grandson and a friend who is 9 years old. To get to the entrance you have to climb (and I do mean climb!) At least 100 steps. In hot weather this in itself is an accomplishment. I did not see any lifts for disabled parties. Be aware that if your",
          "A family of 12 with two under 2's had a great time here. Friendly staff and a great day out. The little ones loved it. Only downside with two pushchairs is the steps leading up to it.",
          "We can here on Saturday afternoon, we arrived and it just looked nothing like a waterpark you wouldn\u2019t know it was a waterpark. There was loads of steps to walk up probably about 50+ steps. It cost 35 Bulgarian lev which is about \u00a315. You receive a yellow band which is for a",
          "We visited this place with our 7 years old boy and he didn\u2019t want to leave. He enjoyed every slide. It was definitely an excelente option. I am pregnant, so I didn\u2019t need to pay of all as I will NOT use the slides, they were very considered and friendly, just my husband and",
          "My partner and I came here for half a day and paid 35 lev each. We only stayed for about 2 and a half hours. We went on every slide at least 3 times. It\u2019s quite a small water park so I would only suggest staying for a couple of hours. Enjoyed the lazy river and there\u2019s an",
          "The price ia too high for such a place. Clean, the slides are fun, but the prices of water and food out there are too big.",
          "We had a fantastic day here today. Something for everyone (two teens and a 9 year old) which is very hard for us to manage with an 8 year age gap between our oldest and youngest. Would recommend a visit with any age child. Food in the main restaurant is better than fast food",
          "There really is only a few slides that don\u2019t have a enough water going down so U tend to get stuck and push urself down . Also they charge a person over 120cm a adult price . There\u2019s a park 2 hours away but worth the trip I been told . Saving your money no good if u need to",
          "This aqua park is certainly fun, costing at the time 35lev for the day. There are numerous slides and tubes, fun for both adults and children alike. Would recommend this place as a relaxing day out solo or with family.",
          "We visited last week as a family of four and really enjoyed it. It cost 140 Lev which is around \u00a368.00. Bottles of water were 2 lev and a small locker was 2 lev activated by your wrist fob. The park was practically empty probably due to the time of year so there were no queues",
          "it is a small water park but has fantastic view and 2 slids are good and scary the price is not so hight and mid range it is good for 3-4 hours a day spend there",
          "This is one of the best water parks I\u2019ve ever been to. It was clean, the wait to go on the slide was short and the staff are really helpful and speak English. If you ever get the chance go!",
          "This place is very exciting for kids and for adults for sure. Great slides, huge place, several activities. Perfect for a fun family vacation.",
          "Nice water park in Golden sands.Easy and free parking.Definitely worth avisit, but one day was enough.",
          "We keep coming back to this waterpark every time we are in golden sands There is lots to do for families and the rides are still fun, It's around \u00a315 in British money which isn't that bad and although you can't take food in with you, they keep it until you leave if you have food",
          "Great water park and great place to go with familly and you will have amazing time amazing moments amazing memories :)",
          "I had a very good time with my friends there. The park is small and it has 6 slides, and it was astonishing and amazing.",

          "My family and I were in Varna last summer . Black sea was great , Golden sand beach is very famous , and beautiful . Aquapolis park was fantastic.",
          "I visited here two weeks ago with my boyfriend. We both enjoyed this park and was pleasantly surprised with the rides. Yes it is a small water park with only 6 slides however we found enough to keep us busy for the day. The rides that are there are good and entertaining. The",
          "Although not the biggest water park our girls loved the slides The inflatable rings were free and the girls were safe to use the slides without constant parental supervision Food and drink has to be purchased on site but reasonably priced Great day had by all",
          "Despite the negative reviews my son and I had a great day at the waterpark. We walked from our hotel which was 5 minutes from the main strip and beach so convenient location. My son was over 120cm high (same for rollercoaster son England) and so I paid full price for us both",
          "We had a half a day her during our holiday and that was long enough really. its quite expensive for Bulgaria at \u00a350 for a full day entry for 2 adults and 1 child although my 11 year old son had to pay full price as he above 120cm. There are only 5 slides nothing special compared",

          "Went here for the first time at 5.30pm just to get our wristbands and let the kids have a quick go. When we got there I took of my flip flops and left them by our buggy. Not even one hour and someone had stolen my adidas flip flops so I had to walk 20 mins back barefoot. After",
          "Strict rules. No drinking or food is allowed at the entrance. Expensive park and charge for chairs!!!! Few good slides . Cold pool and cold jacuzzi.",
          "We had a great time, but be prepared to spend. Lot! You have to pay everything separate, 33 leva per person entrance and extra 5 leva per person for scheslong, mat and umbrella. No food allowed inside and bars are of course very expensive. On the plus side we were allowed to",
          "The park is nice for an afternoon but a bit too small and with not too many attractions for an entire day. There are about 6 activities you can enjoy here for both children and adults. The problem is that for only these things the park is a bit too pricey because you have to",
          "Cute staff specially Alexandra Great place to go with familly It is for all ages children and adults you will have amazing time amazing moments amazing memories",
          "this park is great for children. you can give box(small box is 2lv and big box is4), umbrella and bed is 5lv. A cameraman taken you a lot of picture and you can buy it. evry picture 15lv. don't forget towel. You can not get along with food.",
          "This water park was on our doorstep from the hotel . Really good day out , kids loved it and offers lots of sun loungers snack bars and ice cream stands . Be prepared to walk up lots of stairs to get to the slides was probably the most exercise I did all holiday lol . Prices for",
          "maybe one of the oldest if not the oldest aqua park on the black sea, so there were not many attractions like in Nesebar and Sunny beach .. Even Pomorie have one now. This one needs an urgent renovation to respond to the price of the tickets. Everything inside is payed",
          "A quite ordinary water park except for the swim in bar and the 131 STEPS to climb from the car park to the enterance. Also the wristbands only worked to let you in and out - unable to load with credit for the bar and restaurant so lots of soggy notes",
          "A nice water park which we did walk to from our hotel, lots of steps to walk up. A little expensive for us as neither my husband or myself used pool or slides but still had to pay full price, and it goes on height so our 8yr old was full price too. The boys loved it and the",
          "The rides are ok and the pool is filthy black mould growing on the tiles and the lazy river water is filthy we came home with ear infections. Food is over priced and for the money they charge to get into the park the could at least clean the pools.",
          "Average aqua park with few slides and pools for adults and children, there are also one fast food and one restaurant there",
          "Water was dirty and bottom of the pool. Waterslides were good, expect one wich hurted one of us. Food there was okay.",
          "Nice place to visit, clean and safe. Quite expensive. Good pizzas. Nice slides. Toilets not so clean.",
          "My friend and I visited Aquapolis whilst in Golden Sands in June. It cost 38 lev (approx \u00a319 each) and this included all day entry, sunbed, mat and parasole. The waterpark was well run for adults and children. You couldn't take food or drink in with you, but these can be bought",
          "Nice and very big pool area, I was here for relaxing the whole day. Sun bed was 5 lev: OK for a whole day.",
          "Our experience can be summed up with two words: TERRIBLE, WASTE 1. Even though we were clients, we still had to pay 5 BGN for parking. 2. At the point of entry two extremely rude gentlemen scanned our bags to detect food/drinks that will save us from paying the ridiculously",
          "Great place to have fun. Perfect after few days on the beach cos you do something active. Recommend to everyone.",
          "Not many rides but all the rides are fun. Must pay for sunbeds also when inside and if your child is over 120 cm ( my daughter is 9 and well over) its full price!!! overall had a nice day there.",
          "We visited the aqua park during our stay in Golden Sands and I can say I regret it 1. After paying for the entrance inside we had to pay additional for the lounge chairs which to me seems like a ripoff 2. I had some food and a note of 0.5l of bottled water for my 1 year old",
          "It was a nice place for one day with good staff and services but there was just 5 roller and children pool The floor in some places covered by cement and the stairs wewnt standard By the way it was a good place for amusing half a day",
          "Very busy place but absolutely no problem with professional staff . We spent time with family and friends and I suggested to anyone else",
          "We were 8 friends for a day of fun. Aquapolis isn't a real aquapark( has only 5 rides) but was ok. Even if is a little pricy we had a lot of fun. Wasn't crowded and was very ok. You need to pay sunbeds ! Most important thing is that they have free pick up shuttle ! One by all",
          "Excellent facilities for smaller kids I have a 3 year old and 7 years old boy they loved it very child friendly and loads of lifeguards on duty that were on point at all times very secure",
          "They promised 20 lv for adults from 1 to 15 June. But workers did not know anything about this and I had to pay 33 lv for each adult and 16 lv for child. And they deleted negative comments on Facebook!",
          "Absolutely brilliant a must if you go on holiday to Bulgaria not to be missed as only 3 minute walk from Hilton Doubletree",
          "The slides are really fun it's a small water park but a great one and the life guards are nice but the price to get into the water park was expensive",
          "I really enjoyed all of the slides and all of the pools. The water was not cold. The only problem was the wrist bands from the lockers as they were being misplaced a lot. The food was also really tasty.",
          "This aqua park is located in a few kilometers from center of golden sands. It is not a big aqua park. It has a few slides. But, it is OK to spend half a day.",
          "nice small waterpark inexpensive good facilities child pool slides and lazy river easy to get around nice pool bar",
          "This is well worth the visit; whether with family, friends or children. Lots of different slides to try, from nice and gentle, to terrifying lol Went towards the end of the season, so was perhaps far quieter than it may be during peak season, but would still be worth any",
          "It a fun place to get wet if you happen to be in the area. It is fine and fun for kids all age. Some of the facilities desperately need remodeling and the service in the restaurant takes forever. But in general I would recommend it. Go and get wet!",
          "lots of toys and games, very helpful staff and cafe, taking photos, clean area and friendly environment, reasonable price. you have all the day to stay but a half-day could be very enjoyable.",
          "Had a blast, got wet, good time had by all. Lots of staff to make sure everyone stays safe. Will rerun soon",
          "Has got only like 5 different slides. Not so fun. You know like comparing to Malaysia Aqua Park,this one was boring!!! No pool with waves. No bulks of waters. No amused park. No different resturants.",
          "Excellent place for a day out with the family.A trip to this park is a must.There's sunbeds,slopes, food and everything so you can stay the whole day there.",
          "We spend here a good day.There are two swiimming pools and lots of atractions.This a good place to have fun in Golden sands",
          "By it's price - it's not bad, but I was expected more water slides and attractions. It needs to be renovated, found a lot of loose bricks in pools.",
          "Good place for family and children . This place for all popular and whith mor slaiding and pool for all and child",
          "good place and clean place . but very smal this slide good and fast . whith pool and pool for children",
          "The atmosphere is very good, you can have a amazing day in aquapolis. Of course it is not big and I think the entrance fee is expensive. I recommend this place you can enjoy it.",
          "it's the top place in golden sands and is good to have fun the entrance is 33Lev and locker price is from 2-4 Lev it has bed also for rest do not try the restaurant,not worth it!",
          "The Aquapolis is nice and standard and we enjoyed it but there's not so much to say WOW but it was good and reasonable, the drinks at poolbar are more expensive, yoe have to wear slippers , they capture photos of you whilst sliding on the slides and print it , the pictures are",
          "Went here mid Aug with our son loads of slides,wave pool plenty of beds to sit on a small charge for the day.It was quite busy but then it is Aug I would recommend a speedy pass as we queued a while for most of the slides.food run of the mill pizzas and burgers hotdog's quite",
          "A good place for having fun with friends in Golden Sands, a lot of water slides, for kids and for adults, bars for drinks and food and sunbeds.",
          "Good day out - a fair amount of slides but you'll have to walk uphill and followed by an amount of stairs to get to the top. Fair amount of restaurants and bars - fairly priced which was decent. Kids and adult pools were cute - lazy river is very lazy providing you don't have",
          "Great day out for 100 lev for three only five main slides but never mire than a 5 minute wait even though it was busy reasonable priced snack bars as no food is allowed to be brought into the park huge supply of rubber rings and two man boats pools for smaller children to play",
          "After being slightly disappointed with the hotel and things to do we needed a good fun day out. We were about 100 metres from Aquapolis so we thought perfect - let's try it out. Once you have got to the entrance after many steps you are in a beautiful setting with a stunning",
          "We visited twice this season, once with a friend & 2 teenagers & next with our Son & Daughter & our 2 grandchildren. It's brilliant... It has everything from 1year old to 90 year olds. It's a great day out for everyone if you like water parks.The food is a good price, drinks are",
          "There are many attractions. We went after 4 pm, so we got a discount, since they close @ 6 pm. 2 h is enough time to do everything active, since you can lay in your hotel for free.",
          "Nice rides and sunbathing areas, good selection of pools, nice bar siiting in the water. Food at the restaurant is not safe, we were food poisoned.",
          "Perfect for both children and grown ups! They have fun for the whole family, and its perfect in the hot sun.",
          "Good place for children . Pool is just right depth for small kids and plenty of umbrellas for shade.Lots of lifeguards ,who;s whistles can become annoying at times",
          "Good day out with our children here. Facilities are clean & attendants are pleasant & helpful. Food purchased here was of a good standard. The lazy river could of been a bit more flowing.",
          "Visited this water park last week with my boyfriend. Excellently located 30 seconds away from our hotel. It is quite a small water park with only 6 slides but I wouldn't let this put you off. It's a great water park with a great pool and area for kids as well as the slides. 30",
          "This water park is an OK size not as big as a few I have been to but it was really good great for my 3 year old daughter plenty for her to do, she loved the castle sides as it has 3 different water sides, the swim up pool bar was amazing and the top jacuzzi was really good they",
          "We had a great day out here , kids and adults loved it. There is small water okay area for young kids. Jacuzzi were cold water but still nice when sun is hot. Fast food eatery, reasonable prices. No good or drink allowed into the establishment. Poolside bar available. Lazy",
          "every thing was very good just there was not a big variety of slides and the life guards didn't at all help push the tubes although u were stick to the slide and needed a little help to start sliding. every thing Else was very good",
          "a few good slides, but could be better. i went to many waterparks and this is at the end of the list. if you have little kids it doesnt worth to go",
          "positive point :nice sea view - nice decoration - good bar in pool - good restaurant we have lots of fun there - negative point : locker does not free - sun bed does not free",
          "We went there to try this top attraction of Sunny Beach and of Bulgaria even if the prices we've seen on their site were pretty high, considering the lot of extras not included and without having any family choices. Still, we thought to try a half day entrance in the afternoon.",
          "There are over 100 steps to climb before you get to the entrance- beware. Very expensive to actually get in but food and drink not too bad once you are in. 5 lev per sunbed to hire but it's definitely worth it. There are very few flumes here - I think 6 in total and they are",
          "The children (aged 6, 6 and 4 years) enjoyed their stay. The waterpark is not the biggest, but the childrens area was great for the smaller kids. You can't bring even drinking water to the park. Every drink and eatble needs to be left outside of the park.",
          "It is a small waterpark near Golden sands . I has 2 restaurants and a cozy pool bar . There a plenty of sun beds and umbrellas that are all paid . You are not allowed to bring food . The negative point is that you should carry money with yourself and the wrist bands given to you",
          "There are some things that could be better: Food, it could be covered by the entrance fee, at least one Burger on the house! There are two big slides which worth to see it The other games are kind of you-can-find-in-any-aqua-parks. Totally, I recommend that for families coz",
          "A small waterpark that was value for money. Ideal for those who don't want to walk far. No queues, plenty of sunbeds (small charge) relaxing and fun. I tried all the rides which were great and felt safe on them. No food/drink is allowed inside but the prices were reasonable for",
          "Most expensive and awful park in Bulgaria, no service at all. Action Aqua park in Nessebar is better in every single way. When you arrive you have to take very long stairs, what is not nice if you have children. There are no family tickets and you pay for a child of 9 years old,",
          "Me and my family visited this amazing waterpark during our visit to festival village appartments in cap Salou, we booked the tickets through a rep in the hotel and it was made so easy! Waterpark was also only around a 15minute walk aswell so you could take in the wonderful views",
          "Charged full price for half an event as many of the rides don't open until July, including many of the places to eat. From the moment you walk in there is soo many hidden charges \u20ac9 for a locker, more if you wish for a safety deposit box. Then you are \u20ac4 per basic sun lounger",
          "It's a small water park but joyful and good.the best point is the low price of entrance ticket despite number of games are enough. The games are suitable for every ages",
          "Aquapolis is easy to get to by bus and the buses are very cheap in Bulgaria. There are not many slides at this park but there are also pools a lazy river, jacuzzi and sun beds that are nice to relax on. I would recommend that you bring a picnic as the shops and food places are",
          "Some of the waterslides are great.. But there were way to many halfway projeckts.. If you try a waterslide, you dont even reach the water before the lifegard ruches you",
          "The place is very easy to find, there is a nice parking as well. Because of the beginning of the season, there were not so many people and we had nice time. There is a nice bar in the water, after experiencing all the attractions.",
          "I've been to a lot of waterparks and I'll surely visit once more, a lot of rides and the water is brilliant, the only thing that is a problem is that won't let you bring beverages or food with you",
          "Its not big as the park in burgas but still friendly to family. Cant enter food but the prices is fair. Its located in beautiful mountains views",
          "Absolutely brilliant well worth visit great fun.i went in September 23.so basically had the park to ourselves..",
          "We went some years ago when this area was getting popular with tourists.It was great value for money and being newly built was very clean with every facility.People very friendly, food great but if you hire a car be very careful of cars that are black with blacked out",
          "We visited this aqupark with family. Complex is nice but its goinig to bi quit older and the purity of swiming pools deosnt look like the best. Otherwise good fun for bigger children, one and hlaf yaer old baby not so many attractions. Food court is big and rich. Regular fast",
          "Ok waterpark, but pricy considering the quality and safety. Not allowed to bring your own food which is okay if the food had been good. Overall worth a visit but dont think I would go there again.",
          "Great family day out. All ages of children will find a water slide for them. Great value for money so went twice during our fortnight stay.",
          "Worth a visit. Slides enjoyed and lazy river was good for keeping cool whilst topping up tan. Food was good priced and nice. Be warned lots of steps before get into Waterpark.",
          "We visited the water park with open minds after reading some not very good reviews. We found the Aquapolis to be an extremely pleasant day out. The steps on entry made us laugh as they seemed never ending, the price for entry 33 levs each about \u00a311 each there was a charge for",
          "This wasn't the best aqua park we went, but it was nice and kids like it. We like the drinks and the food was ok.",
          "this waterpark is well worth the visit, but as others have warned be aware of the total price having added on the extras. The entrance fee of 33 lev is reasonable for a day out, ie \u00a312 - \u00a314 dependant on exchange rate, then \u00a32 for a bed each, this is the going rate on the",
          "We were somehow disappointed probably because we were comparing Aquapolis with the Aqua parks in Nessebar and Sunny Beach. This one is smaller and offers less opportunities for entertainment. On the other hand it's more expensive and you should pay for everything on the top of",
          "it was a brill day for a family a big family like mine with children and adults. i will warn there is a lot of steps and wasps round the eating areas however don't let that put you off it really is a good water park",
          "There really aren't that many steps to climb and once there, you'll have a wonderful day. Lots of slides for young and very young, plenty of sunbeds. Pleasant little food outlet plenty of seating.",
          "This was a great day out, fun and relaxed. I did think it was a bit expensive, but all in all was well worth it. Clean fun and friendly place to go especially with the kids Im not sure if there was wheelchair access, I didn't see any but that doesn't mean there wasn't.",
          "Great place for the kids, great water slides. The food at the cafeteria can be spared. We totaly reccommend !",
          "My boyfriend and I fancied a fun day whilst staying in Salou so we booked Aquapolis. We were at Aquapolis for 4 hours and in that time we queued up for a security lock, went on 2 rides got some lunch and watched 20mins of the dolphin show. For each ride the queuing time was",
          "fun family day out, a little dated but clean and loads of fun. Watch out though as few hidden charges once in park like lounges and food a,little pricey.",
          "6 slides so small, not busy on the Monday we went, which meant very small queues plenty of loungers but are extra at 5lv each. They do search bags for food and drink on entry. Small locker for valuables is 2lv Food on site not overly expensive. Free rings to use on the",
          "Expensive to get in then charged for sun loungers too! Ice cream booth wasn't opened all day. Very grumpy man on snack stall.",
          "-park is small with limited games -In the park was about 6 slides - nice but nothing special. Very nice was basin for children -mat and umberella is not free - the bar in -the pool is very excellent -\u201cIt's Not Bad, and you should visit here once",
          "went there with my teenage 3 children found it a very expensive day out when you take into consideration car park fee and entrance fee plus having to buy your water etc value for money in my opionion poor",
          "The water park was well maintained and clean. The lifeguards were ensuring that guests were following the rules and keeping safe. I was disappointed that the park charged for the chairs and sun parasols. I think that the chairs/parasols should be included in the price of",
          "Quite small water park but price wasnt too high and there were nice pool are for kids. Thanks also that we didnt have to pay about 2-year old son (who was too small to go to slides) and me cause I was pregnant. Couple of small ice-cream kiosk and restaurant, I expected much more",
          "Boring for those under 120 cm and also boring for them over 140 cm. It is simply not worth the money. Try the beach instead .",
          "+have a nice view of sea and forest. +foods are acceptable quality. -park is small with limited games. -i think entrance is a little expensive. -locker have additional charge. -umberella is not free.",
          "Spent the most of a day here with my family (wife + 3 boys). It isn't the biggest aquapark, but ok. I was, however, annoyed about the fact that you had pay for anything; parking, entrance (expensive for Bulgaria), lockers, shade from umbrellas etc. You are not allowed to bring",
          "It was long waiting and lot of begging from children and now here. According to the website - the most beatifull aquapark in europe we've been awaiting something \"wow\". At the beggining there was long stairway (200 stairs) - too long for children and for stroller (twin stroller)",
          "Extremely fun, for kids, teenagers, adults, adventurers and weaklings. ;) So much fun! Great slides and kids areas. Hot tiles!! Be prepared for an expensive, warm and cooled day in the sun:) Definitly worth a visit.",
          "This is probably the largest of the aqua parks in the Torrevieja area. Went there with my wife and three kids (5-11 years old). First thing we noticed was that they charge for parking. Then we bought the tickets that were quite expensive. Entered the park and were asked if we",
          "Love the water park. Great for kids and big kids. Food and drink reasonable and love the pool bar. Worth a day out.",
          "We have 3 kids and love to travel, thus we have been in many water parks around the world. Aquapolis in Golden Sands is the worse water park we ever visited. The park is very small and dirty, only few simple slides. But the main problem is the workers in this park that are",
          "Quite expencive, but really worth the visit. We left our shoes unattended when we rode the rides and no-one took them. Safe to leave them.",
          "good place to have funny all family,food and facility is super you can have relax place with another person toggether",
          "33 Levs for anyone over 120cm in height, 5 Levs for sun lounger and parasol and 3 Levs for bottled water, you cannot take your own food and drink in here, you are searched for it.",

          "Having visited Bulgaria a number of times over the last 10 years this is one of those places we visit again and again! No culture but a great day out, lots of fun with many water slides, a lazy river, jacuzzi. Its ideal for adults and kids alike. Not much queuing for the slides",
          "As there isn't any other similar attraction nearby, this one is OK. The main drawback is that you are not allowed to bring even water, never mind food, which is somewhat remnant from post communist era - establishment ordering customers what to eat or not - pathetic. If you know",
          "We visited this water park three successive summers between 2011 -2013. We stayed for a whole day enjoying the slides, floating on the inflatable rings, sliding down the winding and tunnel slides, also the speedy slides, swimming in the pool with the bar in the water, enjoying",
          "Goooood poool! perfect place to spend an active day! Niceeeeee! I recommend to all who will be there !",
          "Do not go. This is not a proper water park. Some website links boast that this is the best one in Easter Europe. I can assure you that these are all gimmicks and this water park is very basic, few slides, unkept, and the ushers/animators are all arrogant. Unbelievable.",
          "I liked everything, especially the \"asian old city\" design. I did not really appreciate payment for sunbeds, taking into account that the entry price is not so low.",
          "We spent an entire day at the Aquapolis and used almost every facility. If you need some variation from the basic pool at the hotel or the weather is windy I do recommend it, especially if you have small children that will love the dragon water slide.",
          "Liked water slides and the viriety; the design, the service inside. Dislike the que at at opening hours under the hot sut at 10h.",
          "Great place for all the family. Different attractions for every taste.Scary, but still funny slides. I sure recommend to visit.",

          "In my opinion this is a pretty average water park. I visited Sunny Beach and Nessebar water parks last year and both were a great deal better than this one. Considering that the Sunny Beach parks have a very similar entrance fee but much better facilities and a greater",
          "Great value for money. Be warned you will need to pay for sunchairs if you want some. Was 5 lev each when we went",
          "small and expensive, not allowed to take own food or drink in.. the rides and the layout is good, you also have to pay 5 lev for a sunbed..",
          "One thing are for sure....Those Bulgarian know how to cheat their customers big time. You pat the Entrance Fee, some harsh Security Guards demands to look through your bags... No, they don't ask politely, they DEMAND access and speak so purely English you think is not possible.",
          "Just across the road from our hotel, Great fun day out but lots of steps to climb up to get to the slides !",
          "Whoever says Bulgaria is cheap is lying! This water park is pretty pricey for a family of 5 at nearly 5 times the price of one in Romania! However, it is a super day out and we spent the full day there with our children of 11, 10 and 7. Yes even the 7 year old could go down the",
          "My family and I went to this place on the 2nd August. I have to say it is really clean, well staffed and just great fun. Best day of our holiday by far. Only negative point was we had two buggies which we had to carry up what seemed to be a thousand steps!! Worth the effort",
          "This is a water slide park for kids and youngsters.The food was quite expensive on the inside and you aren't allowed to bring anything with you. They have 4 slides for tubes, a race track for 4, a even faster slide. A nice pool for small children with small slides. The park has",
          "It is great, with or without kids ;) But it is quiet expensive in group (no own food or drinks allowed)",
          "Fun for all the family and enough to keep you entertained all day. Plenty of sun beds with shade inside the park and excellent eating facilities all over. Staff are very helpful as well.",
          "Second -time here, I found all tubes and water slides open. It takes alt leats 8 hours to drive-in- out-through all over the places. I have no time to be bored !!",
          "Only thing that we didn't like, we bought the entrance tickets and had to buy also beach chairs and sun shade inside the park. Without chairs you just can't be anywhere.",
          "We have spent here one day but I can say that is a real pleasure and looks very nice. Also, it is very clean and you can see that the design is really good! This should be mandatory on your list!",
          "Well worth the money but book with your holiday reps. The bus pick you up and drops you off again all in the price. You get a fob to put money on to buy food and drinks whilst in the park, and what you do not use you get back before leaving a very good idea i think. The rides",
          "It was very small and had just a few slids and we got board after an hour and there were nothing left to do ! But I have to mention that the water was very clean esp the main swimming pool. They also took some good pictures from us that we bought them. Maybe we expected so much",
          "The water was ice cold in every pool, slide and even in the jacuzzi! Park costs a lot compared to other activities in Bulgaria. The place seemed out dated and was quite dirty. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!",
          "It's rather small aquapark. Nevertheless you'll find there extreme attraction, some with balloons. Zone for little kids is nice: sculptures, slides for infants. Dislikes: some zones need to be repaired, beach beds and safes are availiable for EXTRA charge, shots taken on the",
          "we visited aquapolis 2013 summer . it was a normal waterpark and just a few lame stuff . but it worth's the visit . and it wasnt very crowded .",

          "Went to the water park with 4 children aged between 4-13 years old! Nope doesn't matter here doesn't go by ages goes by height over 120cm is classed as an adult at 33 lev each, under that its 16 lev for children and tiny babies are free, all together was 214 lev for 7 people (6",

          "Very expensive input, as in (Italy-France-Germany) but we are in Bulgaria. Then the most amazing thing we all searched at the entrance in the luggage, but not for safety, for their absurd ban on taking off from food and drink to be then forced to consume their products sold",
          "Went to the water park to get away from our dreadful Hotel & had a great day out, it cost 33 lev each to get in which I didn't think to bad, can't take your own food in & your bags are searched, food is ok stay away from the cheese burgers they rank, the ques for the slides can",

          "I went there with 2 small children, I was hoping that my 3 year old daughter will enjoy the slides that I wanted to try but she was too small for those unfortunately. Not having access to the adult slides, I find it too expensice, so maybe don't go there with small children,",
          "On arrivel to the waterpark you are confronted by about between 50 to 100 steps so if you are of need of a walking aid or have a breathing problem then you are in trouble, once in the staff were all very miserable the food was good & cheap, the amount of slides it has were not",
          "But it's very far away from the beach. Also, once you've got in, you must take a lot of steps up to get to where the fun begins, as there are a lot of stairs there.",
          "the floor had small stone and they hurt me. but the water was VERY CLEAN and i enjoyed of environment",

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989. It specialises in International Economics and Administration, Law, and Architecture.\n\n\n=== Institutes and colleges ===\nThere are four BAS research institutes: Oceanology, Fisheries, Aero and Hydrodynamics, Metallography.

Over the past few decades, it developed as a festival centre of international standing.

          "It turned out that Bulgaria have a rich history when it comes to seacraft. I was amazed by the full sized vessels equipment and gear preserved and gathered right next to the center. For me it was very interesting to be able to touch and get inside the exhibits. I strongly",
          "The museum is a bit all over the place... but in an understandable way, I suppose. The history of Bulgaria means there's lots to say about its maritime past but there's not always been continuity - most recently its Soviet rule. The museum picks its way around all this quite",
          "The museum is small but packed with naval history. The museum has a very nice layout. The upper floors are hot but there is some air conditioning :) I think everyone can find something interesting for himself. And the best part was that one can go inside the torpedo boat and",
          "Having recently visited the Naval museum with my father, we found it to be well layed out and Interesting Positives.. Photography permitted Nice location Senior discount for my father Well layed out and presented Negatives... Rude and miserable staff Stray Kittens/Cats",
          "Not a big place, but it tell an interesting story. And som nice military hardware in the courtyard. So worth a visit if you are in the area.",
          "Being a visitor from America, it was nice to see another countries naval history. Interactive exhibits. Good to kill and hour or so.",
          "I hoped this museum would be good - and it is. Bulgaria is not really known as a naval power, but the connection with the USSR during Bulgaria's communist era (1946-1990) is apparent in many of the displays. An excellent glimpse of Cold War history and technology! The",
          "It's a small museum with lots of interesting items. I couldn't get to the sub that is outside of the main building because was raining. No matter that, the visitor has the opportunity to see old maritime equipment from the Cold War era on the outside of the building. In the",
          "I really enjoyed the museum and all the history. For an additional ticket you can go on the submarine out in front of the museum which was fun and interestingl",
          "First I read on the internet that the place will be closed due to renovation. It was not closed. We were happy. So we went in. Seems obvious that a country with a see has some fleets, but I was surprised that Bulgaria actually has some serious naval history. I especially liked",
          "Very interesting history of Bulgarian navy, well presented with English translation on all exhibits.",
          "Exhibition and museum that wont let you close to the objects except the torpedo boat( that costs 2 leva extra). Most signs in bulgarian and english. Exhibition inside is well done. Would have been fun to look closer into the helicopters in the garden.",
          "Little surprised by the price of inside collection versus the outside collection plus the ship but suggest to buy both tickets. Inside you cannot take pics of the historical collection but outside are helicopters, cannons, boats and separate boat you can access for small fee.",
          "Great, unusual museum. Friendly staff and lots of exhibits inside and out immaculately presented but not much signage in English.",
          "Only when we arrived did we find out that entrance was free on that day so it made the visit even more pleasant. The museum is in the old french consulate which is a nice building in itself.",
          "We've visited the National Maritime Museum during Museum Night, which provided free entry and some nice events happening outside the museum (such as cannon shooting and tying knots). The vehicles outside are very impressive and also the inside of the museum shows the interesting",
          "Considering that Bulgaria isn't really a naval power or really known for its' maritime history, this museum seemed to make the most of it. I found it interesting and the texts were also in English.",
          "My teenage boys really liked looking at the military vehicles and artifacts that are located outside, but the adults in the group appreciated the indoor artifacts as well. Good way to spend an hour or so if you're in the gardens.",
          "If one is into maritime history, this is a very nice place to visit. Not too large with good exhibition of the last 200 maritime years of Bulgaria. Would definitely visit again.",
          "There is an outside display of a torpedo boat and other military equipment. The internal displays were pristine and easy to follow with some great models and original materials. This was backed up by maps , photos and paintings to provide an entertaining visit.",
          "An hour or so well spent.Small museum with lots to see, only 4 lev, including entrance to an MTB from 1912!",
          "we have been past this museum many times but never went in this time we had long walk from Varna mall down to Varna centre through the sea gardens and right along to the national museum it was getting late as we arrived we did not intend to go in but the children wanted",
          "very interesting good to visit with childrend nice historic view of the soviet navy indor and out door about 1 h visit",
          "Probably my favorite museum in Varna. Many things to see, some old stuff and lots of history. The information is well served, didn't lose my attention. I was there at night, during \"the night of the museums\", and it was great...",
          "Nice for people interested in nautical history. Accessible by public transport and within walking distance of the city center.",
          "This museum is centrally located in an attractive part of Varna. Seniors, even foreigners like me, get a discount, making the entry only 2 leva. I thought the most interesting part of the museum was outside, where there is a surprisingly large amount of war hardware: mines,",
          "Bulgaria has never been a powerhouse with a Black Sea Fleet like the Soviet Union possessed and today Russia still possesses. Bulgaria's fleet evolved after Russia-Turkey War that gave Bulgaria it's independence from the Ottoman Empire. No sooner had that happened than Bulgaria",
          "Maybe it's a standard that in this museum you may met more staff than exhibits. Also tickets policy is very interesting, it's cheap, but staff in ticket office give you three diffrent tickets for one person. But worth of visit. And don't try parking there :-), you must find",
          "One of the must see attractions in Varna city. We gladly visited during our stay in Saints Konstantin and Helena, we took a day to visit Varna and it was worthed. Interesting to see the ancient warships and helicopters, ammunition and mines. To bad that the interior was closed",
          "It is a different museum with its unique story and objects. If you are keen on maritime history you definitely should visit it. You can see also old ship head decorations, uniforms of seamen and officers, ship collection of the naval and the commercial fleet in various periods,",
          "The museum is not so big and impressive, but interesting for people interested by marine history. Especially the last existing torpedo boat in the world.",
          "You love the ships and the recent war history this is the place for you...you will see the battle ships helicopters and submarine from the 1st and second Mondial wars...the submarine is also available for the visit inside",
          "It is a small museum but that should be expected of small naval country, Some articles you would expect from a small Eastern European naval country but others are unusually large for the purpose they were intended for. Unfortunately a number of the outside displays are just",
          "A nice place to spend a morning, although not impressive, just good if you are there and you want to spend sometime doing something different than walking along beachside",
          "Don't bother to go. There are better 'nautical sights' on the nearby beach!! lol A collection of scrap displayed in an open museum.",
          "An enjoyable place to visit but due to the lack of a developed sea history it cannot be expected for people to be impressed on a global scale, it is however rather appropriate for an individual person to learn something.",
          "Small but very nice, it brings you through the history of the Bulgarian Navy and its important port of Varna from ancient greeks to the end of cold war and nowadays. Recommended",
          "Very knowledgeable tour guide. Learned a lot. There is much to be seen, lots of history. Has this romantic sense of battle and the sea. Loved it. Going again definitely",
          "A museum dedicated to the marine situated in the sea garden in a beautiful old house near the swimming complex.",
          "When we completed our walk in through the Sea Park we were a little tired, until we saw the forward section of a ship. Walking down the fence line we saw a huge array of naval history in the open air portion of the museum. Across the street a submarine. We had to go inside. One",
          "If you like Naval History, ships and sea military battles-this is your place. It is placed on the South side of Sea Garden in Varna which is another grate place to visit and see. May ship models inside, outside boats,torpedo ships and rocket ships, also sea helicopters to see in",
          "I was serveral time in Varna, but we missed this museum all time. It worst the money to go in!!! The garden is also very good with all the sights. The paintings about the see is adorable, beautiful! Do not miss it!",
          "Very nice location in the Varna Sea garden, the building was renovated a few years ago and the exhibition is the best of its kind in the country.",
          "When we visited the place was just empty besides some posters on the walls. it was basically a waste of our time.",
          "Despite the fact that Bulgaria hasn't exactly had a world-class navy over the years, this museum has a very nice collection of artifacts, flags, ship models, weapons, and so on. The English descriptions are a bit iffy and can be hard to follow, and for those who really aren't",
          "A good museum to get familiar with the history of Bulgaria and their struggle to become independent. There are signs all over in english and staff did all their could to clear my doubts.",
          "If you are into weapons, guns, ships, uniforms, flags, bomb shells, choppers, airplanes - this is your place! But what fascinated me the most was the presentation of a shotgun used in the Great War. The soldier explained every detail of the weapon to me and even demonstrated it!",
          "I liked the evolution of the anchors. There is a lot of information in English though it can be rather old school and dry to read. Worth a stop for two hours. For 2 lev extra you can experience the tight accommodation of an old ship. There was no info about what ship that was",
          "Well, having seen many normal museums, filled with broken pots and lumps of coins, it was nice to see something a bit different, pots with shell fish and lumps of coins. Only kidding, Varna is on the coast and has a rich navel history. It was interesting to lean about the role",
          "This place has to be seen. Not only is it great value for money but the amount of things to see are amazing. Included are a submarine and ship plus lots of navy artillery and mines etc outside but also inside they have a comprehensive collection of Bulgarian navy memorabilia",
          "We watched from outside, and you can stroll around an have a look to all they have in their outside area. It is a nice small museum. If you're interested in history this is maybe interesting. We were with our son, and he was in bigger naval museums, so there was no big",

          "A great value museum for anyone interested in modern and recent history. Starting outside, there\u2019s a range of naval equipment including two helicopters, an anchor collection and a replica of the Druzki. It\u2019s a bit odd because they aren\u2019t arranged in a particularly useful layout,",
          "The best part of the museum is the outside area. In front of the museum is the Druzhki which was used in the First Balkan War (1912) and was used in the only Bulgarian naval victory in that war - this is an important national artifact. The rest is more standard and includes",

          "the collection is dated and i hate being followed around like a thief by the staff i also didnt like that they cleaned and polished all of the artifacts everything looks to new and the patina of all the guns and swords were wiped off overall the outside collection is cool to see",
          "A Small but well laid out museum, detailing Bulgaria's Naval and Military history, definitely worth a visit if you have the time.",
          "Not a vast array of exhibits, but the museum is relatively new, there are a few of them outside (helicopters, boats and artillery), the most interesting stuff is inside. A good hour looking at the naval history of Bulgaria, 5 lev entry fee",
          "The Museum is worth a visit with small children, especially boys as there are unseen machines and old ships from a socialist past. Most of the exhibits are in the open air, which is a nice garden in the west end of the Sea Garden of Varna. It is very peaceful inside as many",
          "Helpful guides who were inobtrusive but happy to help if needed. Large exhibits are in the grounds and the remainder are on 3 floors inside. Fascinating insight into Bulgarias involvement with 2nd world war and the communist era. Free entry, closed tuesday",

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved.

        "wiki": "The Battle of Varna took place on 10 November 1444 near Varna in eastern Bulgaria. The Ottoman Army under Sultan Murad II defeated the Hungarian\u2013Polish and Wallachian armies commanded by W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Poland (also King of Hungary), John Hunyadi (acting as commander of the combined Christian forces) and Mircea II of Wallachia. It was the final battle of the Crusade of Varna.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Hungarian Kingdom fell into crisis after the death of King Sigismund in 1437. His son-in-law and successor, King Albert, ruled for only two years and died in 1439, leaving his widow Elizabeth with an unborn child, Ladislaus the Posthumous. The Hungarian noblemen then called the young King W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Poland to the throne of Hungary, expecting his aid in defense against the Ottomans. After his Hungarian coronation, he never went back to his homeland again, assuming rule of the Hungarian Kingdom next to the influential nobleman John Hunyadi.\nAfter failed expeditions in 1440\u201342 against Belgrade and Transylvania, and the defeats of the \"long campaign\" of Hunyadi in 1442\u201343, the Ottoman sultan Murad II signed a ten-year truce with Hungary. After he had made peace with the Karaman Emirate in Anatolia in August 1444, he resigned the throne to his twelve-year-old son Mehmed II.\nAnticipating an Ottoman invasion encouraged by the young and inexperienced new Ottoman sultan, Hungary co-operated with Venice and Pope Eugene IV to organize a new crusader army led by Hunyadi and W\u0142adys\u0142aw III. On receipt of this news, Mehmet II understood that he was too young and inexperienced to successfully fight the coalition. He recalled Murad II to the throne to lead the army into battle, but Murad II refused. Angry at his father, who had long since retired to a contemplative life in southwestern Anatolia, Mehmed II wrote, \"If you are the Sultan, come and lead your armies. If I am the Sultan I hereby order you to come and lead my armies.\" It was only after receiving this letter that Murad II agreed to lead the Ottoman army.\n\n\n== Preparations ==\nThe mixed Papal army was composed mainly of Hungarian, Polish, Bohemian (whose combined armies numbered 16,000) and Wallachian (7,000) forces, with smaller detachments of Czechs, Papal knights, Teutonic Knights, Bosnians, Croatians, Bulgarians, Lithuanians and Ruthenians.Papal, Venetian and Genoese ships under Alvise Loredan had blockaded the Dardanelles as the Hungarian army was to advance on Varna, where it would meet the Papal fleet and sail down the coast to Constantinople, pushing the Ottomans out of Europe. The Hungarian advance was rapid, Ottoman fortresses were bypassed, while local Bulgarians from Vidin, Oryahovo, and Nicopolis joined the army (Fruzhin, son of Ivan Shishman, also participated in the campaign with his own guard). On October 10 near Nicopolis, some 7,000 Wallachian cavalrymen under Mircea II, one of Vlad Dracul's sons, also joined.\nArmenian refugees in the Kingdom of Hungary also took part in the wars of their new country against the Ottomans as early as the battle of Varna in 1444, when some Armenians were seen amongst the Christian forces.\n\n\n== Deployment ==\n\nLate on November 9, a large Ottoman army of around 60,000 men approached Varna from the west. At a supreme military council called by Hunyadi during the night, the Papal legate, cardinal Julian Cesarini, insisted on a quick withdrawal. However, the Christians were caught between the Black Sea, Lake Varna, the steep wooded slopes of the Franga Plateau (356 m high), and the enemy. Cesarini then proposed a defense using the Wagenburg of the Hussites until the arrival of the Christian fleet. The Hungarian magnates and the Croatian and Czech commanders backed him, but the young (20-year-old) W\u0142adys\u0142aw and Hunyadi rejected the defensive tactics. Hunyadi declared: \"To escape is impossible, to surrender is unthinkable. Let us fight with bravery and honor our arms.\" W\u0142adys\u0142aw accepted this position and gave him the command. Andreas del Palatio states that Hunyadi commanded the \"Wallachian army\" indicating a large Romanian component in Hunyadi's personal army.In the morning of November 10, Hunyadi deployed the army of some 20,000 crusaders as an arc between Lake Varna and the Franga plateau; the line was about 3.5 km long. Two banners with a total of 3,500 men from the king's Polish and Hungarian bodyguards, Hungarian royal mercenaries, and banners of Hungarian nobles held the center. The Wallachian cavalry was left in reserve behind the center.\nThe right flank that lined up the hill towards the village of Kamenar numbered 6,500 men in 5 banners. Bishop Jan Dominek of Varadin with his personal banner led the force; Cesarini commanded a banner of German mercenaries and a Bosnian one. The Bishop of Eger led his own banner, and the military governor of Slavonia, ban Franco Talotsi, commanded one Croatian banner.\nThe left flank, a total of 5,000 men in 5 banners, was led by Michael Szil\u00e1gyi, Hunyadi's brother in law, and was made up of Hunyadi's Transylvanians, Bulgarians, German mercenaries and banners of Hungarian magnates. Behind the Hungarians, closer to the Black Sea and the lake, was the Wagenburg, defended by 300 or 600 Czech and Ruthenian mercenaries under hetman Ceyka, along with Poles, Lithuanians and Wallachians. Every wagon was manned by 7 to 10 soldiers and the Wagenburg was equipped with bombards.\nThe Ottoman center included the Janissaries and levies from Rumelia deployed around two Thracian burial mounds. Murad observed and directed the battle from one of them. The Janissaries dug in behind ditches and two palisades. The right wing consisted of Kapikulus and Sipahis from Rumelia, and the left wing was made up by Ak\u0131nc\u0131s, Sipahis from Anatolia, and other forces. Janissary archers and Ak\u0131nc\u0131 light cavalry were deployed on the Franga plateau.\n\n\n== Battle ==\n\nThe light Ottoman cavalry assaulted the Croats of ban Franco Talotsi. Christians from the left riposted with bombards and firearms and stopped the attack. Christian soldiers chased the Ottomans in a disorderly pursuit. The Anatolian cavalry ambushed them from the flank. The Christian right wing attempted to flee to the small fortress of Galata on the other side of Varna Bay, but most of them were slain in the marshland around Varna Lake and the River Devnya, where Cesarini also met his end. Only ban Talotsi's troops managed to withdraw behind the Wagenburg.\n\nThe other Ottoman flank assaulted the Hungarians and Bulgarians of Michael Szilagyi. Their push was stopped and turned back; then Sipahis attacked again. Hunyadi decided to help and advised W\u0142adys\u0142aw to wait until he returned; then advanced with two cavalry companies. The young king, ignoring Hunyadi's advice, rushed 500 of his Polish knights against the Ottoman center. They attempted to overrun the Janissary infantry and take Murad prisoner, and almost succeeded, but in front of Murad's tent W\u0142adys\u0142aw's horse either fell into a trap or was stabbed, and the king was slain by mercenary Kodja Hazar, who beheaded him while doing so. The remaining coalition cavalry were demoralized and defeated by the Ottomans.\nOn his return, Hunyadi tried frantically to salvage the king's body, but all he could accomplish was to organize the retreat of the remains of his army; it suffered thousands of casualties in the chaos, and was virtually annihilated. Neither the head nor body of the king have ever been found. The minnesinger Michael Beheim wrote a song based on the story of Hans Mergest who spent 16 years in Ottoman captivity after the battle.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nThe death of W\u0142adys\u0142aw left Hungary in the hands of the four-year-old Ladislaus Posthumous of Bohemia and Hungary. He was succeeded in Poland by Casimir IV Jagiellon after a three-year interregnum.\nMurad's casualties at Varna were so heavy, it was not until three days later that he realized he was victorious. Nevertheless, the Ottoman victory in Varna, followed by the Ottoman victory in the Second Battle of Kosovo in 1448, deterred the European states from sending any substantial military assistance to the Byzantines during the Ottoman siege of Constantinople in 1453.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn the aftermath, the Ottomans had removed a significant opposition to their expansion into central and eastern Europe; subsequent battles forced a large number of Europeans to become Ottoman subjects.\nThe fallen Polish King was named W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Warne\u0144czyk in memory of the battle.\nThe Battle of Varna is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \"WARNA 10 XI 1444\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOszk.hu: Battle map of the Battle of Varna\u2014(in Hungarian)\nImber, Colin (July 2006). \"Introduction\".

          "The gardens were very crowded. The paths are quite steep. There isn't that much to see, there's more in good garden centre back home. Waterfalls only look spectacular when there's a lot of water. The Palace is small with limited exhibits and no crowd management.",

          "The palace and botanical gardens were nice and relaxing with a lovely waterfall and lots of nature. The castle itself consisted of two floors with some historic information and an art gallery on the bottom floor. This would have got a higher rating if it wasn't for the toilets",
          "We had a very unpleasant surprise when we wanted to go from one side of the gardens to another as it seems there is some kind of conflict between the caretakers and/or administration. This is what I am rating. They should not put the tourists that pay for the entrance in between",

          "Very lovely gardens and it was probably very nice when there weren't so many people all over the place. There is a new entrance to park and it is a bit of a walk. They should have some water for purchase as you are pretty exhausted and thirsty by the time you make it back.",
          "The Botanic Garden. A place that is calm and serene. Silence and good for meditation. The Castle brings you back to early times, but yet it seems modern. Especially the bathroom surpriced me. I alwasy go back to Balchik, whenever I visit Varna/Golden Sands.",

It has 38 pairs of supports, each one capable of carrying 2,400 tons. The bridge experiences significant traffic, with 10,000 vehicles crossing it every day.\nThe bridge's construction began in 1973 when the need for a larger canal to link Lake Varna and the sea became necessary. The initial launch date was 30 September 1976, but construction was ahead of schedule and finished on 8 September, when the Asparuhov Most was opened in a ceremony by Todor Zhivkov. Meanwhile, the new canal that the bridge crosses began operation on 1 September, with the first ship going through on 4 September the same year.\nAfter 20 years of neglect, reconstruction work began in 1996 to end in October 1998, but the installation was not reopened until 17 September 1999, long overdue from the initial plans of a 16-month reconstruction.\nToday the Asparuhov Most is not only an important transport installation, but also a place where extreme sports fans meet, as the bridge is a favourable location for bungee jumping.Asparuhovo bridge is also a Suicide bridge.In September 2015 the municipality of Varna announced plans to fully renovate the bridge and add cycle tracks.\n\n\n== References ==\nVarna.info.bg.

        "wiki": "Balchik (Bulgarian: \u0411\u0430\u043b\u0447\u0438\u043a, is a Black Sea coastal town and a seaside resort in the Southern Dobruja area of northeastern Bulgaria. It is located in Dobrich Province, 35 km southeast of Dobrich and 42 km northeast of Varna. The town sprawls scenically along hilly terraces descending from the Dobruja plateau to the sea. It is often called \"The white city\" because of the white color of the hills.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe town is named after the medieval ruler Balik, brother of Dobrotitsa, after whom is named the city of Dobrich.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFounded as a Thracian settlement, it was later colonised by the Ionian ancient Greeks with the name Krounoi (Ancient Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03af) (renamed as Dionysopolis (Ancient Greek: \u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03c5\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2), after the discovery of a statue of Dionysus in the sea). Later became a Greek-Byzantine and Bulgarian fortress. Under the Ottoman Empire, the town came to be known with its present name, which perhaps derived from a Gagauz word meaning \"small town\". Another opinion is that its actual name derived from that of a local noble - Balik.\nAfter the liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Balchik developed as centre of a rich agricultural region, wheat-exporting port, and district (okoliya) town, and later, as a major tourist destination with the beachfront resort of Albena to its south.\nAfter the Second Balkan War, in 1913, the town was renamed Balcic and became part of the Kingdom of Romania. It was regained by Bulgaria during World War I (1916\u20131919), but Romania restored its authority when hostilities in the region ceased. In 1940, just before the outbreak of World War II in the region, Balchik was ceded by Romania to Bulgaria by the terms of the Craiova Treaty.\nDuring Romania's administration, the Balchik Palace was the favourite summer residence of Queen Marie of Romania and her immediate family. The town is the site of Marie's Oriental villa, the place where her heart was kept, in accordance with her last wishes, until 1940 (when the Treaty of Craiova awarded the region back to Bulgaria). It was then moved to Bran Castle, in central Romania. Today, the Balchik Palace and the adjacent Balchik Botanical Garden are the town's most popular landmarks and a popular tourist sightseeing destination.\nDuring the inter-war period, Balchik was also a favorite destination for Romanian avant-garde painters, lending his name to an informal school of post-impressionist painters \u2013 the Balcic School of Painting - which is central in the development of Romanian 20th-century painting. Many works of the artists composing the group depict the town's houses and the Turkish inhabitants, as well as the sea.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe city's population is 11,051 people (data from National Statistics Institute - Bulgaria, 2018). The total population of Balchik municipality is 19,331.\nAccording to an estimate by Bulgarian historian Rayna Gavrilova the Bulgarian population before 1878 was only around 10%.The ethnic composition has gradually changed from mostly Gagauz and Tatar/Turkish to predominantly Bulgarian. According to the latest 2011 census data, Balchik's ethnic composition is the following:\nBulgarians: 7,916 (72.9%)\nTurks: 1,715 (15.8%)\nGypsies: 954 (8.8%)\nOthers: 191 (1.8%)\nIndefinable: 79 (0.7%)\nUndeclared: 755 (6.5%)\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Art ===\nHeld each year since 1991, \"The Process \u2013 Space Art Festival\" is an annual international festival of Contemporary Art, which takes place over two weeks in June. Balchik Palace also hosts In the Palace International Short Film Festival.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nHeld annually each summer since 2006 in the nearby town of Kavarna, the Kavarna Rock Fest hosts top-name bands for a three-day festival.  Previous acts have included Motorhead, Twisted Sister, Motley Crew, Scorpions, Alice Cooper, Deep Purple, and the Michael Schenker Group.Since a few years the major has cancelled the  Kavarna Rock Fest due to different music preference.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nBalchik is becoming well known internationally as a golfing destination.  There are three 18-hole championship golf courses within the local vicinity, two designed by Gary Player - Thracian Cliffs GC and BlackSeaRama GC; and one designed by Ian Woosnam - Lighthouse GC.  A fourth 18-hole golf course is currently in the planning stages.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nFrancis Ford Coppola spent 11 days at the Balchik palace shooting scenes of Youth Without Youth.\nBalchik Ridge, in Antarctica, is named after the town.\nThe currently unused Balchik Airfield is envisaged to be prepared for low-cost airlines, especially from Russia.\nFamous Turkish poet Naz\u0131m Hikmet wrote his well-known poem \"Mavi Liman\" (The Blue Port) in Balchik.\n\n\n== Twin towns - sister cities ==\n\nBalchik is twinned with:\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nDecree of Dionysopolis\nBalchik Palace\nAlbena\nBulgarian Black Sea Coast\nDobrich Province\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBalchik.com \u2013 Hotels, Restaurants, News, Events and Properties\n\u2013 Online catalog of Balchik\nBalchik Photos\nAncient coinage from Dionysopolis\nSearchable Greek Inscriptions at The Packard Humanities Institute (PHI)  \u2013 Segment from Decree of Dionysopolis reviewed in Inscriptiones graecae in Bulgaria repertae by Georgi Mihailov\nQuiet Nest Palace\nInternational Art Forum \u2013 WithoutBorders\nIn The Palace International Short Film Festival, Balchik\nBulgariaLeisure.com, Tourism Information Portal (in Bulgarian and English)",

          "Pleasant walk through the gardens. They weren\u2019t brilliantly well kept, dead-heading needed. You walk down some pretty steep steps into the palace area which comprises several small buildings now turned into the wine shop etc. Finally you leave the premises onto the seafront.",
          "While the Palace and the Botanical Gardens are unique places on Earth, you are welcome by a frustrated person at the entrance which shows like you are not welcome to visit.",
          "It was a great time walking in these beautiful gardens with nice selections of flowers and trees. I find very impressive the collection of exotic plants and cactuses there.",

          "Arrived here with a tour which entrance here was included. Enjoyed my visit not usually something I would do but well worth a visit some nice architecture and we had wine tasting included in our tour. I found the cactus exhibit very interesting and a nice garden to spend the",
          "Not too bad really plenty of effort gone into the upkeep of the gardens, the walk from the entrance leads you down to the seafront and on to the prom with bars and restaurants",
          "The gardens are lovely to look round but a bit of a maze. Although you are given a basic map on entrance a few well positioned signs would be useful walking round as we ended up missing bits. The Palace is really interesting but I found the signs on things indicting what they",

          "This botanical garden and the Queen\u2019s palace are simple and unexciting places to visit. The palace is a lovely small but simple palace for the Queen of Romania who used to rule Balchik as a part of Romania empire. Her British and Russian root brought an aspiration to build her",
          "The overall experience was nice. The gardens are worth the effort, the plants are beautiful, i fell in love with the castuses. Also, the panoramic view offered by the garden is worth a moment of contemplation. The buildings are well preserved, but only a couple could be visited",
          "If you are looking for a place to visit in the hot summer days, this is the place you have to be - between the old big trees, the beautifully arranged gardens, the Palace with his stone walls, the waterfall - recharge your batteries while the temperatures under the sun is about",

          "We went there for a \"quick promenade\" which was actually transformed in an almost 3 hours walk. All the tulips and spring flowers were blossomed and their colours is incredible. The cacti exposition is very nice and the arrangement is extraordinary. The castle was rather a",
          "We only wanted to see the gardens, not the palace, but we were told you had to buy tickets to both, which I didn\u2019t think was correct but we still bought the two. It was expensive- I think 14 lev per person. The grounds were lovely, but the palace was nothing special and not",

          "We spent a few hours in the palace garden. It is very nice to spend a day there as couple or familly. You should have bulgarian curency with you, if not there are exchange points near by for EUR USD RON. We were happy that some restaurants outside the castle accepted",
          "Balchik in entirety is a nice place, cosy, clean, you will have beach, port, and a view in terraces, which helped the gardens to gain more beauty. One of the bigger Botanical Gardens from East Europe, with a large variety of plants, arranged in sections and in good maintenance,",
          "At the far western end of the seafront, this palace was completed in 1926 by King Ferdinand of Romania for his English wife, Queen Marie, when Balchik was part of Romania. Size-wise, it's a relatively modest villa, though the architecture \u2013 a blend of local, Gothic and Islamic",
          "We wanted to see this place, but decided to turn around. The reason? I think the entrance staff wanted to scam us. We were coming to the area of palace from the road E87, where it said entry for cars. We have seen the price of the entrance to the park on the internet, so we knew",

          "We attended with friends via the top entrance prior to Balchik, this might look like the wrong road but persist. The gardens and the various palace buildings are well spread out so allow yourself at least a day to browse (we're going back). There are several restaurants at the",

          "The garden is large and versatile including various different kind of parts. It was beautiful even in the middle of September and I can only imagine how beautiful it's during summer when roses are in their best. There is one entrance from the sea promenade and it's nice walk",
          "I had the extrodinary chance of staying at one of the garden's villas, and as if the chilly september mornings filled with bird songs, subtle sounds of the irrigation devices and dim, distant waves of the Black Sea weren't enough, seeing the palace itself was a one of a kind",
          "We visited the palace & gardens as part of an excursion. We visited the gardens first, these were beautiful & well maintained & preserved. There is a separate cactus garden full of different types of cactus. The gardens are very tranquil & offer a lovely view of the bay. There",

          "We would have visited the gardens more than once, but we didn't bother to do more that step inside the palace as heaving with people and very little to see inside. Unfortunately the two businesses work together and they are not allowed to give you just entrance to the gardens.",
          "Lovely area and we were entertained on our private tour with cocktails and canopies. However, the Palace itself was pretty empty of paintings etc. Not what us Brits are used to in our grand houses. Apparently when the royal family left all their personal paintings were sold. The",

          "Little bit crazy to get in. They have two very small ticket offices and you have to buy separate tickets for Botanical Garden and Palace. You have to by the one for botanical Garden if you want to visit the palace. Same times gets very crowded and confused but while inside you",

          "If you ever go to Balchik, the castle and the botanical garder are a must see. Better if you go in May, as everything is green and the flowers are bloomed",
          "The gardens were lovely, and we had a nice wander round, some of the views were beautiful over the sea.",
          "Lovely gardens in a great cliff side setting above a beach. Waterfalls and indoor glass houses. Well worth a visit if you're on the Black Sea coast.",
          "Amazing, magical place. The view of the sea is spectacular. Very green. They could make only 1 ticket, instead of selling different tickets from 2 different desks.",
          "It would probably be best to visit at a cooler time of day, but there is plenty of shade. There were lots and lots of cactus and great floral displays and a ravine with stream and waterfalls where the mill used to be. All in all a lovely place to visit. But not suited to push",
          "First they charge the castle then they charge for the garden to reach the castle. This is misleading and ridiculous. In the garden you seen a load of plants and a few water springs. Near the castle there is a winery shop with wine tasting and incredible high bottle pricing to",

          "The gardens were very crowded. The paths are quite steep. There isn't that much to see, there's more in good garden centre back home. Waterfalls only look spectacular when there's a lot of water. The Palace is small with limited exhibits and no crowd management.",
          "Just an other tourist trap, hahaha! Expensive for Bulgaria, not authentic at all (for instance : an empty house with \u201ccopy of things from the queen\u201d and they call that the Palace of the queen). Do not lose your time and geld there!",
          "We spent about three hours in the gardens and the palace. The gardens are very nice and relaxing, many different vegetation, flowers, water, fountains and waterfalls. There are several places for wine tasting and restaurants. The palace is situatied inside the gardens, so to",

          "The botanical garden was relaxing, even with the full power of the sun above, you can find places where the sea breeze and the trees shadow cool you down. Really impresive cactus plants and nice flower gardens, although repetitive. The palace was ok, not impressive, would say",
          "Balchik Palace and Gardens were the summer residence of Queen Mary of Romania. Palace and Botanical gardens are conected, but there are 2 entry fees. You will be impressed by the botanical gardens and the way there are been taking care of. The palace is composed by 2 floors,",
          "To start with you should know that you have to pay two entrance fees 6Lev and then 8Lev per person this is because the area is run by two organisations who obviously cannot work together. If your taking a buggy like we did, it\u2019s not impossible but be prepared for a lot of",
          "I enjoyed very much the gardens. It is so green... You walk through vineyards with the grapes hanging over your head, and the old stone walls add to the atmosphere. The palace was less for me. The palace might be interesting for people focused on the local history of this",
          "Went on a very hot day , wasn\u2019t impressed greatly , rude staff and not really that much to see just nice to get away from the general public .gardens always have a nice calm feeling . The palace should not be called a palace , its tiny and not really worth the money , best thing",
          "Great way of spending an afternoon after a rain. Make sure you get proper shoes because the visit of the gardens might get slippery. I'm not sure it's worth visiting the inside of the castle (it's just 3 rooms), but the gardens are exquisite!",
          "Strange was that you need 2 tickets for same area (because belongs to 2 diff institutions). Also.........souvenirs are quite expensive inside. Same things cost 50% at least outside the palace. But in the rest........what amazing view, how much history inside (mainly for",

          "Plenty of opportunity to take photos of flowers, butterflies etc here. The whole place (and \u2018palace\u2019) is very picturesque in any case. The cactus and succulent fan is also well catered for too. Might have been a little less hot in the morning I guess.",

          "The palace and botanical gardens were nice and relaxing with a lovely waterfall and lots of nature. The castle itself consisted of two floors with some historic information and an art gallery on the bottom floor. This would have got a higher rating if it wasn't for the toilets",
          "We had a very unpleasant surprise when we wanted to go from one side of the gardens to another as it seems there is some kind of conflict between the caretakers and/or administration. This is what I am rating. They should not put the tourists that pay for the entrance in between",

          "Incredible landscape. Tiny palace, but very cozy and well integrated in the rocky and forestry landscape. The narrow alleys besides the palace make you feel away from the cruel materialistic world. Very well maintained places (both the palace and the botanical garden), maybe",

          "If you are in the area then it's certainly worth a visit. The views are STUNNING and it's a magical place if viewed from afar. Just don't look close because like many things in Bulgaria it is poorly looked after and why you get up close the cracks really show. Example: The Rose",

          "The \"castle\" is interesting but the garden is the best thing to see. If you visit the garden, you'll need a couple of hours to stroll down the alleys, maybe a whole day if you want to see everything. - Take a guide to learn more about the history of the place; - The ticket is 14",
          "The gardens, the palace, the paths and the amazing view and the great piece of history is something that you should enjoy if you are in Balchik. It cand take half a day to walk and enjoy the small paths and if you are a wine lover there are 2 places where you cand taste and buy",

          "Somewhat confusingly organized, but once you're past the shops and ticket offices, you're ready for hours of enjoyment in the exceptionally well kempt gardens. The palace makes for an idyllic setting, between the gardens and the beach, but is not that special inside. Make sure",
          "You could just follow the trails and get to the castle and then return to the car. You shouldn't. There are thousands of plants around you, tagged. Take your time and read their names, raise your eyes and learn. Two more steps, do the same. Every half of hour, drink something.",
          "Only go on a clouded day, because there are many stairs. Remember water. It is not suited for kidstrollers, high heels or poorly walkers! But surefooted kids will love it. It is a nice park with beautiful flowers. The park is almost fairytale-like. We saw two small yellow snakes",

          "This is the best thing to do in Eastern Bulgaria. The gardens really are stunning. I had seen photos before visiting but no photos do it justice. Expect to spend a couple of hours here. There's no set route around so you can go at your own pace and visit whichever parts you",

          "Great place to take a walk. In july - august in too hot to really enjoy it. They don't accept credit cards and I recommend to pay cash, in leva cause the exchange course is really high. The entrance is 14 leva (garden and castle) and if paying in RON is 42 Ron.",

          "An amazingly beautiful place that has kept the spirit and the magic of the old times. Definitely to visit during summer so that you can enjoy the amazing botanical garden.

Give yourself at least 2 hours to visit the beautiful gardens.",

Although you pay two entrance fees (one for entering the palace and the other for the gardens) the personal at the entrance is very rude and there are no paper or soap at the toilet. The view from the palace towards the sea it's pretty nice! Enjoy!",

          "IMPORTANT !!! You will see a big quee and a couple of stuff stopping people making them pay 2 tickets at the first till ( one for palace and one for botanical). If you want to see only botanical insist to go below that, as there is second till only for botanical garden. Otherwise it is ripoff they will make pay twice!!",

          "It's a beautiful place!",
          "As with many interesting and pretty places in Bulgaria, this one is also spoiled by the lack of basic services. There are throngs of tourists in the high season. Yet, the toilets (two of them) are basically disgusting. Missing toilet paper \u2026",

          "Amazing place.",
          "The tour of the palace is pretty much tied in with the botanical gardens. The palace is only small and looking around only takes 15 minutes but it is still worth seeing once but the gardens are spectacular.",

          "Wonderful from the gardens to the view.",
          "This is absolutely stunning place, straight out of a fairy tale. The grounds are beautiful and the botanical gardems are shockingly big \u2014 I had no idea there are that many cacti in the world, let alone in Balchik! The combination of a beautiful park, traditional architecture and beautiful sea views make for a real stunner.",
          "Personnel is very impolite, and you have to buy tickets for the palace + the garden, even if you want to visit only one place. Overall expensive and overpriced",

It is suggested to enter from the beach area, due to a congestion of terraces and low budget boutiques installed from the city.\n\nThey normally accept Lei or Euro, but safest thing is Leva.\n\nPlease remember that you have to pay both the garden and palace entry. There is no negociating.",

Sea depth does not exceed 1.6 metres at a distance up to 100\u2013150 metres from the beach.  The tourist season lasts from May till October.\nThe resort is named after a female character from a tale by Bulgarian writer Yordan Yovkov.

        "wiki": "Newar caste system is the system by which New\u0101rs, the historical inhabitants of Kathmandu Valley, are divided into groups on the basis of Vedic varna model and divided according to their hereditary occupations. First introduced at the time of the Licchavis (A.D. 300 \u2013 c. 879), the Newar caste system assumed its present shape during the medieval Malla period (A.D. 1201\u20131769). The Newar caste structure resembles more closely that of North India and Madheshis than that of Khas 'Parbatiyas' in that all four Varna (Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra) and untouchables are represented. The social structure of Newars is unique as it is the last remaining example of a pre-Islamic North Indic civilisation in which Buddhist elements enjoy equal status with the Brahmanic elements.\n\n\n== History of Assimilation ==\nAccording to various historical sources, even though the presence of varna and caste had been a known element in the social structure of the Kathmandu Valley since the Licchavi period (c., 3rd century CE), majority of the residents of the Nepal Valley were for the first time codified into a written code only in the 14th century in the Nepalarastrasastra by the Maithil\u2013origin king Jayasthithi Malla (1354\u20131395 A.D.) Jayasthithi Malla, with the aid of five K\u0101nyakubja and Maithil Brahmins whom he invited from the Indian plains, divided the population of the valley into each of four major classes (varna)\u2014Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra\u2014derived from the ancient Hindu text Manusmriti and based on individual's occupational roles. The four classes varna encompassed a total of 64 castes jat within it, with the Shudras being further divided into 36 sub-castes. Various existing and immigrant population of Kathmandu Valley have assimilated among the four varnas accordingly. It is believed that most of the existing indigenous people were incorporated under the Shudra varna of farmers and working-class population. Similarly, notable examples of immigrant groups being assimilated include the Rajopadhyaya Brahmins, who are the descendants of the K\u0101nyakubja Brahmins of Kannauj who immigrated to Kathmandu Valley as late as the 12th century CE. The dozens of noble and ruling Maithil clans (present day Chathar\u012bya Sr\u0113\u1e63\u1e6dha) who came along ruling kings or as part of their nobility (most notably with Maithili Karnata King Hari Simha Deva (c. 1324 CE) were also assimilated in the Newar nation in the Kshatriya varna. The Khadgis (N\u0101ya/Kasa\u012b), Dhobis, Kapalis/Jogis, Halwais (Rajkarnikars) among other caste groups are also believed to have immigrated to Kathmandu Valley from the southern plains.\n\n\n== Four Varna-Jati within Newars ==\nUnlike the Hindu caste systems prevalent in Khas and Madhesi societies, the existence and influence of Buddhist \"ex-monks\" from ancient times in the Kathmandu Valley added a \"double-headed\" element to the Newar caste system. While R\u0101jop\u0101dhy\u0101ya Brahmins (or D\u00e9va-bh\u0101ju) occupied the highest social position in the Hindu side, the Vajracharya (or Guru/Gu-bh\u0101ju) formed the head among the Buddhists. For Hindu Newars, Brahmans had formal precedence with Kshatriyas, which included the royal family and the various groups now known as Sr\u0113\u1e63\u1e6dha who ran the administration of the Malla courts. For Buddhist Newars, the non-celibate (gr\u0325hastha) priestly sangha class Vajracharyas and Shakyas ( who are collectively called \"Ba\u00f1d\u0101\" or \"Bar\u00e9\") were provided with the highest position. In Kathmandu, they were followed by a lay patron Buddhist caste of Ur\u0101y, or Upasakas, who specialized in the trade with Tibet. Therefore, the Hindu Rajopadhyaya Brahmins and Buddhist Vajracharyas occupy the highest position in Newar society. This is followed by the Hindu Kshatriya nobility (Chathar\u012bya Sr\u0113\u1e63\u1e6dha) and the Vaishya merchant and traders castes. The Newar varna logic as stratified from the Hindu Brahmanic perspective place Shakya-Bar\u00e9, Ur\u0101y among the Buddhists, and P\u0101ncthariya Sr\u0113\u1e63\u1e6dha, Tamrakar and Halwais among the Hindus among the dwija twice-born status as the core Vaishya castes of Newars who are highly specialized in trade and commerce.These three varnas (Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya) and castes of either religious identity inside their respective Varna (Hindu R\u0101jop\u0101dhy\u0101ya/Chathar\u012bya/P\u0101nchthar\u012bya and Buddhist Vajr\u0101ch\u0101rya/Sh\u0101kya/Ur\u0101y) collectively form the upper-caste twice-born segment of Newar society. Their upper status is maintained by their exclusive entitlement to secret Tantric initiation rites (\u0101gama and diksha rituals) which cannot be conducted on castes other than the three upper varnas. Along with this, their higher status also requires them to conduct additional life-cycle (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) ceremonies like the sacred-thread wearing ceremony upanayana (for R\u0101jop\u0101dhy\u0101yas and Chathar\u012byas) or the rites of bar\u00e9chy\u00e9gu or \u0101ch\u0101ryabhisheka (for Vajracharyas and Shakyas). Higher castes are supposed to be 'more pure' because they celebrate more ceremonies and observe more rites of purification and because events such as births and death defile them for longer periods of time than they do Jy\u0101pu agriculturists and other service providers. Sr\u0113\u1e63\u1e6dha also maintain their superior status over others with the claim that they firmly belong to the mainstream Brahmanic Hindu cultural world than the Jy\u0101pu and others, and are in much more intimate contact with the Brahmans.  Because of their high social status, these upper-level castes have also traditionally formed the core of the land-owning gentry and as patrons to all other caste groups.The distinction between Hindu and Buddhist is largely irrelevant from the castes occupying the Shudra varna (Jyapu and below) as they generally do not differentiate between the either and profess both the religions equally and with great fervour. This group include among them highly differentiated and specialized castes\u2014agriculturalists, farmers, potters, painters, dyers, florists, butchers, tailors, cleaners, etc.\u2014m\u00e9tiers needed in the daily lives of the Newars or for their cultural or ritual needs. The division into Hindu and Buddhist castes has not been regarded by Newars as a serious cleavage since both groups share the same basic values and social practices and are in close accord with their underlying religious philosophy. Majority of the Newars, in fact, participate in many of the observances of both religions.The Newar castes, Buddhist as well as Hindu, are no less pollution-conscious than the Khas and the Madhesis. Caste endogamy, however, which has been one of the main methods of maintaining status in India, is not strictly observed in Nepal by either the Newars or the Khasas. The strictest rules governing the relations between members of different castes are those pertaining to commensality. Boiled rice and dal (a sauce made of lentils), in particular, must not be accepted from a person of lower caste. Other rules further restrict social intermingling between the castes, but they tend to be treated more casually.\n\n\n== Advent of Khas/Gorkhali rulers and the Muluki Ain ==\nThe most successful attempt at imposing the caste system was made in the 19th century by Jung Bahadur Kunwar who was very keen to have his own status raised. He became the first of the Ranas and his task was to establish the legitimacy of Ranas and secure his control over the land. He succeeded in introducing the caste system to a much greater degree and rigidity than Jayasthitimalla, the Malla king had done just over five hundred years before him. With the advent of Khas domination since Nepal's unification by Prithvi Narayan Shah in 1769 A.D. the center of power shifted from the Newar noble families to these power and land hungry rural nobility whose core values were concentration of power at home and conquest abroad. \nAfter the takeover of power by the Khas rulers, Newars as a block were reduced to the status of an occupied subject race, and except for a loyal family or two, they were stripped of their social status and economic foothold. Even Newar Brahmins who had been serving as priests for Newars lost ritual status vis-a-vis the \"Hill Brahman\", the Parbate Bahuns, of the Khas people community. Even the old military-administrative caste of the \u015are\u1e63\u1e6dha was largely reduced to 'Matawali' status, and were barred from joining high military and administrative posts for a long period of time. The last Newar noble to hold some power, Kaji Tribhuvan Pradhan, was beheaded in a court intrigue in 1806 A.D. Newars were generally not admitted in the civil service till 1804 A.D, after which only a handful of Newars were admitted in the higher administration. These notable exceptions came from the Kshatriya-status Chathar\u012bya clans like the Pradhan, Rajbhandari, Math\u00e9ma, among others, who did reach high administrative and military positions in the new Gorkhali administration. Even though Gorkhalis saw them as part of the 'defeated' aristocracy of the Malla kingdoms, they went on to form the core of the ruling administrative elite of the new Nepali state till the end of Rana regime in 1951 A.D. Irrespective of the Newars' own complex and much elaborate social stratification, the legal code \"Muluki Ain\", promulgated in January 1854 A.D. by the new Rana regime, classified the entire Newar community as a single \"enslavable alcohol-drinking\" caste. It was in 1863 A.D. that majority of the Newars were upgraded to \"non-enslaveable\" category, after Jung Bahadur's content at Newars' administration of public offices during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The most drastic change came only as late as 1935 A.D. during Juddha Shamsher's reign when amendments were made in the old legal code as a result of years of lobbying that granted the Rajopadhyayas the status of Upadhyaya Brahmans, and the Chathar\u012bya \u015are\u1e63\u1e6dha the status of \"pure\" Kshatriya, enlisting these two Newar castes in the pan-Nepal tagadhari caste of \"dwija\" status.Newars were not admitted in the army till 1951 A.D. -the year when the festival of Indra Jatra discontinued to be celebrated as \"the Victory Day\"\u2014 commemorating the conquest of the valley by the Gorkhali army. Economically, the position of the Newars was weakened by the diversion of Tibet trade from the Chumbi Valley route since 1850s A.D. and the competition with the Marwaris became all the stiffer since the end of the World War I. Although Jung Bahadur and his descendants were well disposed to a few clientele Newar families, the 104 years of their family rule was not a golden age of Newar social history. It was only those clientele Newar families patronized by the Ranas who succeeded in upgrading their social and economic status by imitating new norms of the Rana Durbar. The Chathar\u012bya, for example, succeeded in producing the required social credentials to prove that the Chathar\u012bya tharghar (families of noble extraction, and referred to as \"asal Srestha\") alone were \"pure\" Kshatriyas, where as similar claims by other Newar castes were not successful.As a consequence, among the Newars, caste has become more complex and stratified than among the non-Newar group. This latter group may consider all Newar people to be equally Matawali, essentially placing all upper-caste Newars in the Vaishya varna and lower-caste Newars among the clean Shudras, but this has never been the perception of the Newars themselves, especially among high-caste Newars.\n\n\n== Historical relation to other non-Newar Nepalis ==\nHistorically, Newars in general divided non-Newar Nepalis into three general groups: Sae(n), Khae(n), Marsy\u0101.\nMongoloid people, thought generally to have Tibetan connections, are called \"Sae(n)\" This term is said to be derived from an old Newari term for a Tibetan or, according to some, for Lhasa. This term has also been traditionally used as synonymous to the Tamangs whose habitat has been the surrounding areas of the Valley. All other Mongoloid groups would have been generally placed in caste-status accorded to the \"Sae(n)\". For the non-Mongoloid hill 'Khas' tribe of the west who are in large part associated with the Gorkhali invaders, the term Party\u0101 or Parbat\u00e9 meaning hill-dweller is used in polite reference. The ordinary term, considered pejorative, is \"Khae(n)\" derived from their tribal designation Khas. This general term refers in some contexts only to the upper-status divisions of the western Khas group, the Bahun (Khae(n) Barmu) and the Chhetri (Khae(n)) but in other contexts may also include the low status (generally untouchable) occupational Khas groups such as K\u0101mi (blacksmiths), Dam\u0101i (tailors), S\u0101rki(shoemakers and leather workers). Furthermore, other non-Mongoloid hill groups who may be of dubious historical Khas connections, such as the Gaine, are included as Khae(n).\nThe southern plains Terai dwellers who are referred as Marsy\u0101, which is a colloquial corruption of the word Madhesiy\u0101. The Madhesiy\u0101 population have a history of being embraced by the Newar population. Historic records show that Maithil Brahmin and K\u0101nyakubja Brahmin were invited by various Malla kings as their royal priests and advisors. It is widely believed that the present Rajopadhyaya Brahmins are the descendants of those immigrant groups. Similarly, Madhesi royal clans including Malla themselves and their courtier castes like Kayastha, Hada, Chauhan, Chandel, Vaidhya, Rajput, etc. migrated into Kathmandu Valley in the 14th century and ruled as Malla kings and their nobility, who have since coalesced to form the current Chathar\u012bya (Kshatriya) caste. Historical records also show trading, service, and untouchable clans of the Indian plains immigrating to Nepal Valley along with the entourage of the Maithil and Malla kings, and in due process, becoming Newars themselves. Some of them includes Dusadh/Podhya, Jogi/Jugi/Kapali, Dhobi/Dhobi, Mali/M\u0101l\u0101kar, Halwai/Rajkarnikar, Teli/Manandhar/S\u0101yami, Kumhar/Kumh\u0101/Prajapati, Chamar/Chyamah, among others.\nFor Newar Brahmans, Khae Bahuns and Chetris are only water-acceptable. The Chathar\u012bya and Pa\u00f1cthariya accept water and all foods except boiled rice and lentils from them. Jyapu and lower clean occupational groups accept water as well as boiled rice and lentils from them. Conversely, those Khas groups untouchable to the upper Khas groups themselves are also untouchable for the Newars. The Sae(n) were generally treated as water-unacceptable by Brahmans. The Chathar\u012bya and strict Pa\u00f1cthariya accepted water (but not boiled and salted foods) from them. Most, but not all, Jyapu accepted all food except boiled rice and lentils from them. The residual group, neither Khae(n) nor Sae(n), are Muslims and Westerners and these are generally treated as untouchable by the highest levels, and water-unacceptable by those below them.For the higher Parbatiya castes (Bahuns and Chetris), the highest twice-born Hindu Newar castes (Brahmans and Chathar\u012byas, and sometimes Pa\u00f1cthariyas) exist in a kind of \"separate but parallel\" status of T\u0101g\u0101dh\u0101ri with respect to the high caste Parbatiya.  The remaining castes all fall under the rubric of \"matwali\" or liquor-drinking groups. From the Khas Brahman-Chhetri point of view, this large middle-ranking group includes the remaining Newar castes and other Tibeto-Burman speaking peoples. Members of this group are touchable and water acceptable. Similarly, Newar untouchables and the clearly water-unacceptable but touchable groups are also untouchable or water-unacceptable to the Khas Brahmans and Chetris.\n\n\n== Inside the castes ==\n1. R\u0101jop\u0101dhy\u0101ya Brahmins are on top of the Hindu Newar social hierarchy. Referred to as 'Deva Brahman'(God Brahmin) or colloquially as 'Dyah Baje'(God Grandfather), these Brahmins with surnames Rajopadhyaya, Sharma, Acharya, among others, serve as family priest (purohit) primarily to the Hindu Sr\u0113\u1e63\u1e6dha clans. They also serve as the Vedic temple priests of some of the most important temples of the Vaishnav sect, including Krishna Mandir and the four cardinal Vishnu temples of Kathmandu Valley; Changu Narayan, Sesh Narayan/Budhanilkantha, Bishankhu Narayan, and Ichanghu Narayan. They also serve as chief priests of the three Taleju Bhawani temples, the ista-devi of Mallas, the Kumbeshvar temple, among others. The Rajopadhyayas speak Newari language and were historically the raj-purohitas and gurus of the Licchavi and Malla kings. They claim descent from Kanyakubja Brahmins, one of the five Pancha-Gauda North Indian Brahmin groupings, and history shows their presence in the Kathmandu valley as early as 4th CE. The Rajopadhyayas still keep a strong tradition of Vedic and Tantric rituals alive, a fact exemplified for instance at the recent Lakhh\u014dma, performed with contributions of the whole town of Bhaktapur. The Brahmins are higher in caste status than the king not because they are more powerful, but because of their superior ritual status. The Brahmins were like all other specialized service providers, except that they were considered higher to others in ritual purity.2. Maithil Brahmins or colloquially Tirhute Brahmin with surnames Jh\u0101 and Mi\u015bra serve as temple priests and are later additions to the Newar nation, their population being slightly less than that of the Rajopadhyaya Brahmins. Most notably, these Maithil Brahmins claim descent from the time of the 1324 A.D. migration of the Maithil-Karnata King Hari Simha Deva from Simraungadh along with other notable clans like the Chathar\u012byas. Some also claim to have been descended from those Brahmins who came to Nepal as late as 17th CE as respected guests and royal priests of the Malla kings. They speak Newari, follow most Newar traditions, and also serve as temple priests and as purohits for some Newars. But unlike the Rajopadhyaya Brahmins, most Newars do not consider them as being true Newar or as their Newar Brahmins, and accord them with lower caste-status than the Rajopadhyayas. Maithil Brahmins do not consider themselves as 'true' Newars either because unlike the Rajopadhyayas, they claim that their arrival to the Nepal Valley is much more recent, and they have always maintained matrimonial and ceremonial ties with the Terai, never fully integrating in the Newar social fabric.3. Sr\u0113\u1e63\u1e6dha or colloquially Sya:sya is the immediate second-ranking group among Shivamargi (Hindu) Newars. They are the most dominant Newar caste that includes the old Newari aristocracy as well as the traditional land-owning and mercantile families. Within the Sresthas there are three hierarchically ranked, traditionally endogamous groups which describe themselves as i. Kshatriya or colloquially Chathar\u012bya, ii. Pa\u00f1chthariya or colloquially Shrestha, and iii. Ch\u0101rthar\u012bya. Among them, only the Chathar\u012bya and Pa\u00f1chthariya are the two historically accepted and renowned social classes among the Sr\u0113\u1e63\u1e6dha themselves.  Despite the varna and endogamous caste differences between Chathar\u012bya and Pa\u00f1chthariya from the inside, non-Sr\u0113\u1e63\u1e6dhas often tend to see them as a singular composite unit from the outside. They accord both the groups with the collective status of 'Sr\u0113\u1e63\u1e6dha' or 'Sya:sya' because of their common socio-cultural and upper-caste and class identifier as the chief landlord/patron Hindu group.\n\nChathar\u012bya or sometimes shortened to Chathar\u012b are the high-caste, aristocratic Sresthas and the clans within this group correspond as Kshatriya varna, and they claim descent from Suryavansha, Chandravansha, and Agnivansha houses of Kshatriya kings from the south, most of whom entered Nepal Valley with the advent of Muslim conquerers in the Indian subcontinent from 11th-13th century, and indeed many trace their roots to Malla and Karnat royalty or the nobility during the Malla era. Many scholars argue that the local term \"Chathar\u012bya\" is a corruption of the word \"Kshatriya\", the traditional warrior and ruling class of traditional Hindu societies. They formed the core of the ruling, administrative and noble class of the Nepal Valley until the demise of the Malla dynasty in the 18th century. They do not call themselves by the name \"Shrestha\", but use their family or clan titles, the main ones being- Pradhan, Malla, Pradhananga, Amatya, Munshi, Maskey, Rajvanshi, Rajbhandari, Rajvaidya, Rajalawat, etc. All these clans presently have Kshatriya status and, along with their purohits, the Rajopadhyaya Brahmins, are the only Newar castes entitled to wear the sacred thread (Janeu) in the upanayana ceremony, and are given the status of tagadhari in the larger Nepali social milieu. Among the Chathariyas, the Acharya or Achaju (alternatively Karmacharya, Guruacharya) and the Joshi hold prominent and respected position within the Newar society as ritual specialists. Karmacharyas serve as traditional non-Brahmin Tantric priests of Taleju, the guardian deity of the Malla kings, as well as various other Tantric temples of Kathmandu valley. They also serve as assistant priests to Rajopadhyayas in ritual ceremonies like the \u015ar\u0101ddha ceremony of Chathariyas and Panchtahriyas. The Joshis serve as the astrologers as well as assistant non-Brahmin priests in various ritual functions. Despite their occupational work linking them to priestly, albeit non-Vedic, work both Karmacharyas/Achajus and Joshis however are seen as \"degraded\" Brahmins due to their lack of Brahmanical percepts and fall ritually as Kshatriya, and hence inter-marry with other Chathariyas.\nPa\u00f1chthariya are those who have been drawn from multiple economic and social backgrounds, especially from successful mercantile and commercial families, and seen as the Vaishyas among the Hindu Newars. Unlike the Chathariya who usually write their specific clan names, Panchthariya Shresthas generally opt to write \"Shrestha\" instead of their traditional family clan names that indicate their specific occupations. Panchthariyas also include Sr\u0113\u1e63\u1e6dhas from traditional mercantile towns like Thimi, Dhulikhel, Banepa, and outside the three royal-towns of Kathmandu, Patan, Bhaktapur. This caste also include those Chathariya clans and families whose caste-status have been lowered as a result of mixed-caste progeny or other means that effectively lowered the caste status from Chathariya. Higher Chathariya clans have also seen Panchthariya as an effective buffer between themselves and those coming from effective hyepergamous traditions of many lower-status groups who may want to be accepted in the Sr\u0113\u1e63\u1e6dha-status.\nCh\u0101rthar\u012bya Shrestha are even lowered in the social status and consists of those from non-Srestha background who try to emulate or establish the Srestha (Chathar\u012bya and Pa\u00f1chthariya) status by pretending their norms or simply, in many cases, adopting the general caste-denoting surname like 'Shrestha' or in other instances Joshi, 'Singh', 'Achaju', or 'Pradhan'. Pa\u00f1chthariya and especially Chathar\u012bya reject the claims of such pretensions and prevent caste endogamy and commonality with such groups. To these historically established and upper Srestha ranks, Ch\u0101rthar\u012bya's efforts remain unacknowledged and hence are not counted among the Srestha fold.4. Jy\u0101pu group, consisting of several sub-castes or clans, viz Maharjan, Dangol, Awale, Suw\u0101l, Duwal, Singh, Kumha/Praj\u0101pati, Khusa/Tanduk\u0101r, etc. and form close to 45% of the entire Newar population. Exclusive religious preference largely disappears from this occupational caste which consists of people who numerically form the majority population among the Newars \u2014the farmers and agriculturalists\u2014 and are collectively called the Jyapu. Notable exception of the religious syncretism is that of the Bhaktapur Jyapus who maintain their exclusive affiliation to Hinduism and invite the Rajopadhyaya as their purohit, where as most Kathmandu and Lalitpur Jyapus invite the Vajracharya. Jyapu literally means \"competent worker\" in Nepal Bhasa language. They have provided significant contribution to Nepali society and have been seen as the backbone of the Newar community. They are believed to be the true descendants of the various original settlers of the Kathmandu Valley\u2014Licchavis, Ahirs, Kirata, Gopalas. Among others, the Jyapus were turned into Shudra class-caste category during the Malla period. But the Jyapus remained united and never allowed themselves to be pushed into the position of serfdom of slavery as many non-Hindu tribes in the plains were forced to do. They had a long history and strong internal social organization. They have been in control of the important means of production, namely the agricultural land, for generations. Jyapus are among the most progressive farmers in Nepal. Today, Jyapus have succeeded in placing themselves at the centre of Newar society, thanks partly to the growing popularity of the Indigenous adivasi discourse. Today, they picture themselves as the most genuine Newars, the epitome of their society and culture. Through their community organisations, they increasingly speak on behalf of all Newars.5. Ek-thariya caste groups include over 12 specialized hereditary occupational caste groups who also follow syncretic Hindu-Buddhist religion. Bh\u0101 (Karanjit), S\u0101yami (Manandhar), K\u0101u (Nakarmi), N\u0101u (N\u0101pit), Chitrak\u0101r, Ranjitkar, Khusa (Tandukar), Balami, among others. Further down the caste hierarchy, caste groups like the Naya/Kasai (Khadgi), Dhobya (Rajak), Kapali, Kulu, Podhya and Chama:khala were previously regarded as \"water-unacceptable\" or \"untouchable\" groups, part of the socially and economically marginalized groups with their own set of priests, rituals and a culture apart.\nSimilarly, the Buddhamargi castes can be broadly divided into four major groups, viz. Gubh\u0101ju-Bar\u00e9, Ur\u0101y, Jy\u0101pu, and the Ekthar\u012bya. Of these four groups, the first two form the core of the Buddhamargi Newars.\n1. Gubh\u0101ju-Bar\u00e9, consists of two sub-groups, viz. the Gubhajus or Vajrach\u0101ryas, and Bares or Sh\u0101kyas. The Gubhaju (Vajracharya) and the Bare (Shakya) form the priestly functionaries. The Bajracharyas, who belong to the first group, are placed at the top of the hierarchy among the Buddhamargi Newars. They are the purohits or family priests. A special subgroup of the Gubhaju is called Buddhacharya who are traditional priests of Swayambhunath temple, the most sacred temple for Buddhamargis. Along with the Shakyas, they have the right of hereditary membership of the bahas or viharas. The Shakyas, who are next to the Bajracharyas in the caste hierarchy, can also be called Vihar priests. However, while the Bajracharyas' exclusive occupation is priesthood, the Shakyas follow the hereditary occupation of Goldsmiths.\n2. Ur\u0101y or Ud\u0101s, consists of nine main subgroups, viz Tuladhar, Bania, Kansakar, Tamot, Sthapit, Shikhrakar, Selalik, Sindur\u0101k\u0101r etc. The Ur\u0101y/Udas group is composed of the castes of hereditary merchants and artisans. The name 'Uray' is said to have been derived from the Sanskrit term \"up\u0101saka\" meaning \"devout layman\". They are a prominent community in the business and cultural life of Kathmandu and have played key roles in the development of trade, industry, art, architecture, literature, and Buddhism in Nepal and the Himalayan region. Some Udasas, like the Tuladhars, are among the most prosperous and wealthy people in Nepal, and used to have property interests in places like Lhasa, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and various other trade centres outside Nepal. They were the primary carriers of trade between Nepal and Tibet.\n\n\n== Marriage customs ==\nMarriage is, as a rule, patrilocal and monogamous. The parents traditionally arrange marriages for their sons and daughters, although, with the modernization of Nepali society, an increasing number of young people choose their own partners.\nAmong the Shresthas, since they are subdivided into two general sub-castes, the higher Chathar\u012bya and the lower P\u0101\u00f1cthariya, one's marriage partner must be from the same grade as well. Rajopadhyaya and higher Chathar\u012bya clans also try to avoid \"Sa-Gotra\" marriages; marrying someone of the same gotra. Traditional families also get advice from family Jyotishi/Joshi for horoscope match-making. For most Newars, partners must belong to different descent-group lineages within the same caste. In some areas the rule of \"seven generations\" of descent is observed; members who fall within the common descent group of seven generations are restricted from intermarriage.\nBuddhist Newars living in a baha\u2014a residential quadrangle around a central court with Buddhist shrines and temples\u2014consider themselves to be of common descent, making intermarriage a taboo.\n\n\n== Caste groups ==\nBelow is a list of 26 Newar castes, their sub-caste groups and clans, along with their traditionals occupations and the most common surnames in their respective hierarchical positions. Also listed is the approximate percentages of the major castes of Newars sampled within Kathmandu Valley.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCaste system in Nepal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Newar caste system at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Kaliakra (Bulgarian: \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0430) is a long and narrow headland in the Southern Dobruja region of the northern Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, 12 kilometres (7 mi) east of Kavarna, 60 kilometres (37 mi) northeast of Varna and 65 kilometres (40 mi) southwest of Mangalia. The coast is steep with vertical cliffs reaching 70 metres (230 ft) down to the sea.\nKaliakra is a nature reserve, where dolphins and cormorants can be observed. It sits on the Via Pontica, a major bird migration route from Africa into Eastern and Northern Europe. Many rare and migrant birds can be seen here in spring and autumn and, like much of this coastline, is home to several rare breeding birds (e.g. pied wheatear and a local race of European shag). The rest of the reserve also has unusual breeding birds; saker falcon, lesser grey shrike and a host of others.\nIt also features the remnants of the fortified walls, water-main, baths and residence of Despot Dobrotitsa in the short-lived Principality of Karvuna's medieval capital. The Bolata Cove with a small sheltered beach lies just north at the mouth of a picturesque canyon, also part of the nature reserve.\n\n\n== Name and history ==\nThe following names have been used for the headland and the fortress throughout their history:\nThracian: Tirizis (Greek: \u03a4\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03b6\u03b9\u03c2)\nLatin: T(i)rissa\nGreek: \u1f0a\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9 or \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae \u0386\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1, Akrai  or Kal\u0113 Akra\nBulgarian: \u041d\u043e\u0441 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0430\nItalian: Capo Caliacra\nTurkish: Kaligra Burnu\nRomanian: Caliacra\nThe name \"Kaliakra\" is of Byzantine Greek origin. It is a combination of \"\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2\" (\"beautiful\") and \"\u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\" (\"headland\" or \"edge\" or \"extremity\") and is traditionally translated as \"Beautiful Headland\".Kaliakra was the site of the naval Battle of Cape Kaliakra on 11 August 1791, part of the Russo-Turkish War (1787\u20131792).\nThe first modern lighthouse on Kaliakra was built in 1866 by the Compagnie des Phares de l\u2019Empire Ottomane; the present one, a 10-metre (33 ft) cylindrical stone masonry tower with lantern and gallery, was erected in 1901, with focal plane height of 68 metres (223 ft) and a white flash (every 5 seconds); it also has a radio navigation emitter and a foghorn.Near Kaliakra, there is a large  mediumwave broadcasting facility, which never went into service as planned. Currently (2009), several wind power facilities are under development in the vicinity. The area now has three championship golf courses designed by the legendary golfers Gary Player and Ian Woosnam.\n\n\n== Ancient fortress ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe earliest naval settlements date back to the 4th century BC, when the area was inhabited by the Thracian tribe of Tiris. They also give his first name - Tirisis.\nThe ancient geographer Strabo, describing Kaliakra, says that here was the capital of King Lizimach, one of the heirs of Alexander of Macedon and ruler of Thrace. He hid in the caves near his nose his innumerable treasures, captured even on the campaigns against Persia. In the Hellenistic era, a second fortress wall was built inland, and in Roman times the Thracian fortress was expanded. In the years 341 - 342, round towers were completed, there is already an outer and inner city. In the second half of the 4th century, a third fortification with 10 m walls, 2.90 m thick, was erected even farther from the end of the nose. During the archeological excavations made in the 20th century, the remains of ancient and early Christian necropolises were discovered on Kaliakra.\nIn the 5-6th century, according to Hierocele, the fortress (now known as Accra Castellium or simply Accra-cape) gained the importance of a fortified nucleus against the oncoming barbarian tribes and was one of the 15 cities in the province of Scythia. In 513, a battle ensued between Kaliakra and the Byzantine emperor Anastasius I. The settlement and fortress developed in the following centuries, but according to some researchers in the 7th century a decline occurred because the Slavs and Proto-Bulgarians showed no interest in settling this place. In the 10th century sources the names Tetrasida and Tetrasiada occur; Tetrisias, Trisa, Tirisa and Tirista.\nThe earliest dated Western European map that mentions the modern name Kaliakra is that of the Italian Petrus Vesconta from 1318. In other Italian maps and 14th century writings, the nose is also described as Capo Calacria or Calacria. The German armored bearer Hans Schiltberger describes the nose as a Kalacerca, derived from the \"\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2\" - beautiful / good and \"\u03c4\u03c3\u03ad\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\" - a hoop, given the three walls of the Kaliakren fortress. The Bulgarian Navy of the First World War included a mine-clearing boat named \"Kalatserka\".\nContemporary decorative arch of Cape Kaliakra\nSaint Nicholas Chapel\nThe greatest heyday of Kaliakra experienced in the second half of the 14th century, when it was the capital of the principality of Carvun (despotism) of the Bulgarian rulers Balik and Dobrotitsa. It covers the northeastern Bulgarian lands, detached from the central government. Dobrotica is also called Dobrudzha, which is the Turkish pronunciation of its name. Written records speak of a powerful, medieval town where the ruler cuts his own coins and turns the fortress into a church center. Today there are remains of the fortress walls on the tip of the headlands; some of the water supply, baths and the residence of the prince are still preserved. Kaliakra's despots were the first of the native rulers to begin building a navy. Dobrotica's gallies participated in successful combat operations in the Black Sea. In 1393 - 1394 the Carvun principality became one of the last Bulgarian possessions to fall under Ottoman rule.\nIn 1402, the Vlach voivode Mircea Stari took over the lands around Kaliakra, but later that year was again occupied by the Ottoman troops. In 1444, the knights of the Polish and Hungarian King Vladislav III Varnenczyk were stopped near Cape Kaliakra in their campaign against the Ottoman Empire. In the old Turkish lawmen, Kaliakra is mentioned as a port with a Kilagra or Celigra Burun customs.\nMemorial to the biggest battle in the Black Sea\nOn July 31, 1791, the largest naval battle in the Black Sea began off the coast of Kaliakra. The Russian squadron, led by Admiral Fyodor Ushakov, repeatedly defeats Hussein Pasha's superior Turkish armada. With this victory ended the Russo-Turkish War from 1787 to 1792. A plaque with a bas-relief of the Russian Admiral was erected on the headland's tip.  On August 10, 2006, the 215th anniversary of this victory, a monument to him was erected. The monument is a figure in full height and is located on a hill, from which it is visible at sea.\nThe rocks where, according to legend, Bulgarian girls were killed.\n\n\n== Legends ==\n\nProbably the most popular legend about the place is one about 40 Bulgarian girls, who preferred to tie their hair together and jump into the Black Sea rather than face the prospect of being captured by the Ottomans. An obelisk dedicated to this legend is placed at the entrance to the cape, called The Gate of the 40 Maidens.Another legend tells the story of Saint Nicholas, the patron of seamen, who was running away from the Ottomans when God made the earth under him longer and longer so he could escape, and the cape was formed this way. The saint was eventually captured and a chapel was built in 1993, symbolizing his grave. A dervish monastery is also said to have existed on the same place during Ottoman rule, which is thought to have preserved the relics of Muslim Bektashi saint Sar\u0131 Salt\u0131k.A third legend is about Lysimachus, a successor of Alexander the Great, who seized the royal treasure and escaped to Kaliakra, dying in a major storm along with his whole fleet.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n== Honour ==\nKaliakra Glacier on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Kaliakra.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nKaliakra transmitter\nCape Emine\nBulgarian Black Sea Coast\nCaliacra County\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\naerial photos by Rumen Rainov",

        "wiki": "The Kamchiya (also Kamchia and Kam\u010dija, Bulgarian: \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0438\u044f) is a 191-kilometre (119 mi) river in eastern Bulgaria, the longest river on the Balkan Peninsula to flow directly into the Black Sea. It starts from the confluence of two rivers springing from Eastern Stara Planina, Golyama Kamchiya (itself formed by the confluence of the rivers Ticha and Vrana) and Luda Kamchiya, flows eastward to the Black Sea and empties into it 25 km south of Varna, in the Resort of Kamchiya.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn antiquity, the river was known as Panisos; later, Slavs gave it the name of Ticha. Its contemporary name is considered to be of Cuman origin. The Romans built the stronghold Erite on its bank. The Kamchia basin played a notable role in the history of the First Bulgarian Empire. Much of the Medieval Bulgarian Navy from the 9th to the 14th century was built at the river mouth thanks to the quality timber of the area. In the 18th century, Lipovans settled along the lower banks.\n\n\n== Geography and ecology ==\nRunning down through Eastern Stara Planina, the Kamchiya meanders through the Longoz or alluvial longose grove, and through the Kamchia (biosphere reserve), a UNESCO-listed biosphere reserve protecting the primeval forest from intensive logging and drainage that had decimated it by mid-20th century. The river mouth forms a sand barrier and often overflows its banks in the valley. The old synclines of the river leave swampy areas called azmatsi. The reserve is 40 km long (stretching throughout the longose grove to the river mouth) and up to 5 km wide.\nThe area around the river mouth is remarkable for its (frequently flooded) old growth forests of a riverine type, up to 450 meter-wide beaches with up to 19 meter-high banks, forested or grass-covered sand dunes, freshwater marshes, and marshy remnants of old riverbeds, cutting deep into the forest. The unusual coexistence of ash, oak, elm, alder and maple trees, sometimes rising up to 40\u201350 m with lianas climbing among the branches, creates the impression of a tropical forest, a real tangle of woods. The summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum) and several buttercup species (Scilla sp.), as well as ferns, grow in the river delta. One can see otter, deer, wild boar and wild cats among the 26 mammal species. There are  ospreys, eagles, and up to 200 other bird species, including 56 protected ones, and 25 fish species, among other wildlife.\n\nThe towns the river flows past include Veliki Preslav and Smyadovo in Shumen Province, and Dalgopol and Dolni Chiflik in Varna Province. The Ticha feeds the dam lake Ticha and Luda Kamchiya feeds the dam lakes Kamchiya and Tsonevo], which supply water to Varna and Burgas. Lake Tsonevo is also a preferred fishing spot for much of Eastern Bulgaria. The Luda Kamchiya gorge, which cuts across Stara Planina provides the easternmost of the three railway routes between northern and southern Bulgaria. The river valley is fertile, lined with orchards and vegetable gardens; much of it is irrigated. The lower Kamchiya is navigable for smaller motor boats.\nA minke whale was seen at the river mouth in 1926 and this was one of two records of any baleen whales in the history along with a stranding of the same species north of Batumi in 1882.\n\n\n== Environment and pollution ==\nA 2006 study conducted by the Institute of Oceanology and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences on the water quality and its impact on the Black Sea coastal zone concluded that Nutrients content (nitrite, phosphate) in Kamchia River downstream does not always correspond to national water quality standards. The comparison of data from different periods of investigation reveals a slight tendency of decreasing of phosphate and nitrites content and BOD. A decreasing tendency was established as a positive sign of water quality evolution last yearsOther environmental issues are that the river is purportedly becoming marshy. The water lily, torfaceous snowdrop, and white Kamchia lily are also disappearing according to the World Wildlife Fund. The Storage Battery Plant in Targovishte is a significant polluter (heavy metals) of the Kamchia River.Cattle breeding is the second major source of water pollution and directly affects sources of drinking water. Due to a serious lack of water purification stations on cattle farms, non-purified waste waters pour into the various water basins. The same holds true for the underground waters, as nitrates, phosphates, and other macroelements used in farming are dissolved and washed away by rains, to appear subsequently in water basins and mineral springs. The Kamchia reservoir, which is the primary source of drinking water for Bourgas and a secondary source for Varna, is an example. Water and sewage experts have stated that the \"Komounari\" hydroelectric project should not divert waters from the highly polluted Gorna Kamchia River into the Kamchia reservoir. This reservoir, as well as other sources of drinking water for Varna, have old and low-capacity purification stations. During droughts, drinking water is drawn from the reservoir that does not meet sanitary standards.The third main pollutant is waste water from everyday household activities in cities and small towns. One of the major problems at the Kamchia reservoir is the lack of purified water provided to the town of Kotel. The city of Varna discharges too much impure water.\nHowever, on a more positive note, as a result of improvements to the Kamchia river, it no longer floods the dense forest. This was responsible for the spread of Dutch elm disease, which had caused great damage to elms and ash trees.\n\n\n== Eponymous honor ==\nKamchiya Glacier on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Kamchiya River.\n\n\n== See also ==\nResort of Kamchyia\nKamchia (biosphere reserve)\n\n\n== References ==",

It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Beloslav Municipality. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 7,937 inhabitants.  Beloslav is located along the eastern edge of Lake Beloslav and on both sides of the canal connecting it with Lake Varna.  The two parts of town are connected by a vehicle and passenger ferry across the canal.  A road bridge is to be built in the near future over the canal east of town carrying a bypass of the E87 international highway now passing through downtown Varna via the Asparuhov most bridge.\nBeloslav is an ancient settlement populated probably about 12,000 years ago.  The first settlers inhabited the cave near today's town, where 12,000-year-old items were found.  Around the 5th century BC the Thracians settled in the region.  The town was also known as Krushevo, Gebedzhe (Turkish: Gebece), Belovo, and Belevo. The Ottoman name is still used today in certain situations.\nBeloslav is a transportation and industrial hub of national significance, part of the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex. Transportation facilities include the railway and ro-ro ferry terminal with lines to Ukraine, Russia and Georgia served by the Sindel-razpredelitelna marshalling yard, the seaports of Varna Power Plant and LesPort of the Port of Varna complex, and a couple of railway stations. The largest (1320 MW capacity plus an 880 MW natural gas-fueled installation under development) thermal power plant in the nation, TEC Varna, part of the CEZ Group, and the Terem Flotski Arsenal shipbuilding/repair yard, comprising also an Oceanic-Creations facility, are located just east of town. TEC Varna materialized the largest cash privatization deal in the nation after 1989.\nBeloslav is an old centre of artistic glassblowing and fireproof glassmaking and currently supplies glass vials to international pharmaceutical companies. In 2007, development of a new business and logistics centre started on the site of a former glass factory; it will also include two new manufacturing facilities and a port terminal for handling natural gas condensate, and will create a total of 2,000 jobs. The northeastern industrial park also contains several construction operations.\nBeloslav is the seat of a municipality, which also includes the following villages:\n\nEzerovo\nRazdelna\nStrashimirovo\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Seaside Garden (Bulgarian: \u041c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430, Morska gradina) is the Bulgarian port city of Varna's largest, oldest and best known public park, also said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans. Located along the city's coast on the Black Sea, it is an important tourist attraction and a national monument of landscape architecture.\nThe site where today the Seaside Garden is located was until the middle of the 19th century a bare field outside the city walls. In 1862 a small garden was arranged on the orders of the city's Ottoman mayor. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 mayor Mihail Koloni suggested the arrangement of a city garden and a seaside park in 1881, and despite suspicions a small sum was granted. As a result the Seaside Garden was expanded to 26,000 m\u00b2 and further developed according to the plan of French engineer Martinice.\nThe person primarily associated and regarded as having done most for the garden's modern appearance is the Czech gardener Anton Nov\u00e1k, who had specialized at the Sch\u00f6nbrunn and Belvedere palaces in Vienna, Austria-Hungary. He was invited to work in Varna by his compatriot Karel \u0160korpil at the request of the municipality in 1894 and arrived in 1895, at the age of 35. One of Varna's best known buildings, the Varna Aquarium, was constructed in the garden in 1906\u20131911.\nDuring his time in Varna Nov\u00e1k did an immense work: he radically rearranged the garden and ordered the planting of valued plants from the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. His contract with the municipality was extended in 1899, when he was built a house still standing next to the entrance to the garden. The garden gradually grew to reach 90,000 m\u00b2 in 1905. Several fountains were added in 1912\u20131913, as well as partially electric lighting. The central alley was decorated with monuments of prominent Bulgarians by a special committee. The seaside casino was built in the 1930s and acquired its modern appearance after a reconstruction in 1960\u20131961.\nThe 1930s saw the planting of species from the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic and France, as well as the construction of nursery gardens. The garden was expanded to the south to reach the house of the Italian consul Assaretto, today the Varna Naval Museum. The garden reached its present borders in the 1950s and the trees in the centre of the central alley were substituted with flower beds in the 1960s, which thus reached 20,000 m\u00b2 in the entire Seaside Garden. In 1939, the architect Georgi Popov designed the garden's modern central entrance with a wide plaza and tall columns.\nAn Alley of Cosmonauts was arranged in the 1960s, with the first cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin planting the first plant, a silver fir, on 26 May 1961 before a large crowd. The Pantheon of the Perished in the Fight Against Fascism was erected in the same year. The Observatory and Planetarium were opened in 1968 on the site of the old open-air theatre and the Varna Zoo was inaugurated in 1961. A swan-shaped sundial was installed in front of the main entrance. The present open-air theatre, flanked by the Alpineum and the children's amusement park, is the venue of the Varna International Ballet Competition since its inception in 1964, and the dolphinarium was erected in 1984. Recently, the Exotic Zoo terrarium was added, and plans for expansion of the Natural History Museum and the Aquarium were announced. In the park you could also visit the Naval Museum where you could find an interesting display of historic naval objects such as the famous bulgarian Drazki torpedo boat.\nThe park is the favourite place for recreation and fun of the citizens of Varna. Apart from the long alleys for promenades, the sea coast with the beach and numerous restaurants, bars and clubs, one could also enjoy a swimming pool complex and a children's playing ground with mini-entertainment park and a small pond with boats. Just before the main alley of the garden is situated the so called \"bridge of wishes\"- a small bridge which is believed to fulfil wishes if you cross it walking backwards and with your eyes closed.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Ny\u0101ya S\u016btras is an ancient Indian Sanskrit text composed by Ak\u1e63ap\u0101da Gautama, and the foundational text of the Nyaya school of Hindu philosophy. The date when the text was composed, and the biography of its author is unknown, but variously estimated between 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE. The text may have been composed by more than one author, over a period of time. The text consists of five books, with two chapters in each book, with a cumulative total of 528 aphoristic sutras, about rules of reason, logic, epistemology and metaphysics.The Ny\u0101ya S\u016btras is a Hindu text, notable for focusing on knowledge and logic, and making no mention of Vedic rituals. The first book is structured as a general introduction and table of contents of sixteen categories of knowledge. Book two is about pramana (epistemology), book three is about prameya or the objects of knowledge, and the text discusses the nature of knowledge in remaining books. It set the foundation for Nyaya tradition of the empirical theory of validity and truth, opposing uncritical appeals to intuition or scriptural authority.The Nyaya sutras cover a wide range of topics, including Tarka-Vidy\u0101, the science of debate or V\u0101da-Vidy\u0101, the science of discussion. The Ny\u0101ya Sutras are related to but extend the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika epistemological and metaphysical system. Later commentaries expanded, expounded and discussed Nyaya sutras, the earlier surviving commentaries being by V\u0101tsy\u0101yana (c.450\u2013500 CE), followed by the Ny\u0101yav\u0101rttika of Uddyotak\u0101ra (c. 6th\u20137th centuries), V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra's T\u0101tparyat\u012bk\u0101 (9th century), Udayana's T\u0101tparyapari\u015buddhi (10th century), and Jayanta's Ny\u0101yama\u00f1jar\u012b (10th century).\n\n\n== Author and chronology ==\nThe Nyaya-sutras is attributed to Gautama, who was at least the principal author. According to Karl Potter, this name has been a very common Indian name, and the author is also reverentially referred to as Gotama, Dirghatapas and Aksapada Gautama. Little is known about Gautama, or which century he lived in. Scholarly estimates, based on textual analysis, vary from the 6th century BCE, making him a contemporary of Buddha and Mahavira, to as late as the 2nd century CE. Some scholars favor the theory that the cryptic text Nyaya-sutras was expanded over time by multiple authors, with the earliest layer from about mid-first millennium BCE that was composed by Gautama. The earliest layer is likely to be Book 1 and 5 of the text, while Book 3 and 4 may have been added last, but this is not certain.\n\nOne may sum up the situation pretty safely by saying that we have not the vaguest idea who wrote the Nyayasutras or when he lived.\nIt is likely, states Jeaneane Fowler, that Nyaya and the science of reason stretch back into the Vedic era; it developed in the ancient Indian tradition that involved \"dialectical tournaments, in the halls of kings and schools of Vedic philosophers\", and Gautama was the one who distilled and systematized this pre-existing knowledge into sutras, or aphoristic compilations called nyayasutras.The Nyaya school of Hinduism influenced all other schools of Hindu philosophy, as well as Buddhism. Despite their differences, these scholars studied with each other and debated ideas, with Tibetan records suggesting that Buddhist scholars spent years residing with Hindu Nyaya scholars to master the art of reasoning and logic. This cooperation has enabled scholars to place the currently surviving version of the Nyayasutras, to a terminus ante quem (completed before) date of about the 2nd century CE, because one of the most famous and established Buddhist scholars of that era, Nagarjuna, explicitly states, \"sutra 4.2.25 is addressed against the Madhyamika system\" of Buddhism. Other ancient Buddhist texts confirm that Nyayasutras existed before them, and the text is considered the primary text of old Nyaya school of Hinduism.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe text is written in sutra genre. A sutra is a Sanskrit word that means \"string, thread\", and represents a condensed manual of knowledge of a specific field or school. Each sutra is any short rule, like a theorem distilled into few words or syllables, around which \"teachings of ritual, philosophy, grammar or any field of knowledge\" can be woven. Sutras were compiled to be remembered, used as reference and to help teach and transmit ideas from one generation to the next.The Nyayasutra is divided into five books, each book subdivided into two chapters each. The structure of the text is, states Potter, a layout of ahnikas or lessons served into daily portions, each portion consisting of a number of sutras or aphorisms. The architecture of the text is also split and collated into prakaranas or topics, which later commentators such as Vatsyayana and Vacaspati Misra used to compose their bhasya, ancient texts that have survived into the modern era. There are several surviving manuscripts of the Nyayasutras, with a slight difference in number of sutras, of which the Chowkhamba edition is often studied.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe first sutra 1.1.1 of the text asserts its scope and the following sixteen categories of knowledge as a means to gain competence in any field of interest:\n\nPerfection is attained by the correct knowledge about true nature of sixteen categories: means of right knowledge (pram\u0101\u1e47a); object of right knowledge (prameya); doubt (samsaya); purpose (prayojana); familiar instance (d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101nta); established tenet (siddh\u0101nta); members of an inference (avayava); reasoning (tarka); ascertainment or results (nir\u1e47aya); discussion (v\u0101da); sophistic disputations (jalpa); cavil (vita\u1e47\u1e0da); fallacies (hetv\u0101bh\u0101sa); quibbles (chala); futile rejoinders (j\u0101ti); and methods of losing an argument (nigrahasth\u0101na).\n\nThese sixteen categories cover many sections of the text. The verse 1.1.2 of the Ny\u0101ya S\u016btra declares the text's goal is to study and describe the attainment of liberation of soul from wrong knowledge, faults and sorrow, through the application of above sixteen categories of perfecting knowledge.\n\n\n=== Means of attaining valid knowledge ===\nThe Nyaya-sutras assert the premise that \"all knowledge is not intrinsically valid\", that \"most knowledge is not valid unless proven\" and \"truth exists whether we human beings know it or not\". However, states Fowler, the text accepts the foundation that \"some knowledge is self evident\" and axiomatic in every field of knowledge, which can neither be proven nor needs proof, such as \"I am conscious\", \"I think\" and \"soul exists\". Furthermore, the text presents its thesis that knowledge is not self-revealing, one must make effort to gain knowledge and this is a systematic process that empowers one to learn correct knowledge, and abandon incorrect knowledge.The Ny\u0101ya sutras asserts and then discusses four reliable means of obtaining knowledge (pram\u0101\u1e47a), viz., Perception, Inference, Comparison and Reliable Testimony.\n\n\n==== Pratyaksha: Perception ====\nThe Nyayasutras assert that perception is the primary proper means of gaining true knowledge. All other epistemic methods are directly or indirectly based on perception, according to the text, and anything that is claimed to be \"true knowledge\" must be confirmed or confirmable by perception. This it terms as the doctrine of convergence, and this doctrine includes direct or implied perception. Gautama defines perception as the knowledge that arises by the contact of one or more senses with an object or phenomenon. Gautama dedicates many sutras to discuss both the object and subject in the process of perception, and when senses may be unreliable. Erratic eyesight or other senses (Avyabhicara) can be a source of doubt or false knowledge, as can prejudgmental or prejudicial state of mind, states the Nyayasutras.The text asserts Pratyaksa leads to Laukika or ordinary knowledge, where the five senses directly and clearly apprehend a reality, and this is true definite knowledge according to the text. It defines indefinite knowledge as one where there is doubt, and the text gives an example of seeing a distant stationary object in the evening and wondering whether it is a post or a man standing in the distance. In some of these cases, states Nyayasutras, correct knowledge is formulated by the principle of cumulative evidence. Manas (mind) is considered an internal sense, in the text, and it can either lead to correct or incorrect knowledge depending on how it includes, excludes or integrates information. These ideas are compiled, in later chapters of the text, into its treatise on Aprama (Theory on Errors).\n\n\n==== Anumana: Inference ====\n\nThe epistemic rationale for inference as a reliable source of knowledge, and Nyaya's theory has been a major contribution to the diverse schools of Hinduism, and other schools looked up to Nyaya scholars for insights on correct knowledge and incorrect knowledge through inference. The sections in Nyayasutras on inference blossomed into a treatise on syllogism over time.Nyayasutras defines inference as the knowledge that follows or derives from other knowledge. It always follows perception, states the text, and is a universal relation or essential principle. One form of inference is a Purvavat, or as Fowler translates, \"from cause to effect or a priori\". Thus, if a path or road is wet or river is swollen, states the text, then \"it has rained\" is a valid knowledge. The sutras assert that the \"universal relationship\" between the two is necessary for correct, reliable knowledge, that is \"if in all cases of A, B is true, then one may correctly infer B whenever A is perceived\". Further, there is a causal relation between the two, whether one knows or not of that cause, but inferred knowledge does not require one to know the cause for it to be valid knowledge, states Nyayasutra. The text states one must not confuse coexistence as a universal relation, and that while deduction and induction both are useful and valid means for gaining true knowledge, it lists rules when this method can lead to false knowledge.\n\n\n==== Upamana: Comparison and analogy ====\nThe word upamana, states Fowler, is a compound of upa (similarity) and mana (knowledge). It is a means of gaining knowledge based on \"similarity, comparison, analogy\", and considered reliable in Nyaya and many schools of Hinduism (but not in Vaisheshika and Charvaka, or Buddhism).The Nyayasutras define upamana as the knowledge of a thing based on \"its likeness to another thing which is familiar\". It differs from Anumana (inference) in lacking a direct or immediate causal relation. It differs from Pratyaksha (perception), states the text, in using a linguistic referent and the foundation of pre-existing knowledge within the individual and what he learnt from his teachers, friends, family and past knowledge inherited from the wise, through a process of social cooperation. The Upamana method is secondary, it relies on perception, combined with linguistic referent and context. Comparison is not isolated pramana means, and sometimes works together with the Anumana and Sabda epistemic methods. Comparison is, in Nyayasutras, the process of permeating or infusing hypothesis, examples and tests, thus leading to objectivity and correct knowledge about something new and what one already presumes to know.\n\n\n==== Shabda: Testimony and reliable sources ====\n\u015aabda (Sanskrit: \u0936\u092c\u094d\u0926, Word), in Nyayasutras, means relying on word, testimony of a reliable source. Sabda-pramana has been an accepted and reliable method to knowledge by all orthodox schools of Hinduism including Nyaya, asserting that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly. He must rely on others, his parents, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining correct knowledge is either spoken or written, but it is through Sabda (words). In addition to words, state the Nyayasutras, Shabda as a means of true knowledge depends on an agreed convention on what words mean, the structure of sentences, establishing context and their import. The source must be reliable and comprehensible, and the receiver of knowledge must be able to understand the knowledge therefrom.The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the Sabda of reliable sources. The schools of Hindu philosophy have debated if, how and when reliability of source can be objectively established. Gautama, in the Nyayasutras, offers a description for a reliable source. Some schools, such as Charvaka, state that this is never possible, and therefore Sabda in the Vedas or anyone else, can never be a proper pramana. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.\n\n\n=== Theory of proper Argument ===\nThe text, in sutras 1.1.32 and 1.1.39, presents its theory of proper arguments, stating that a proper argument must include five components:\npratijna \u2013 the proposition or hypothesis (that which needs to be proved or decided)\nhetu \u2013 the reason (can be positive or negative)\nudaharana \u2013 the general rule (that which is independently confirmed or confirmable)\nupanaya \u2013 the application of the rule (validity test, or example to the instance)\nnigamana \u2013 the conclusion (the hypothesis is either true or false or in doubt)The text defines and aphoristically discusses each of these.An example of a proper argument is: \nThere is a fire on the hill\nBecause there is smoke on the hill\nWhenever there is smoke, there is a fire\nThe hill is smoky\nTherefore, there is a fire on the hill\n\n\n=== Theory of doubt as incomplete knowledge ===\nThe Nyayasutras define and discuss Samsaya (Sanskrit: \u0938\u0902\u0936\u092f, doubt) in sutras 1.1.23, 2.1.1 to 2.1.7, 3.2.1, 4.2.4 among others. This discussion is similar to those found in other schools of Hindu philosophy, expands on the theory of doubt presented by Kanada in the Vaisheshika school, but disagrees with the Charvaka school's theory of doubt and consequent \"there is no empirical knowledge ever\".The theory of doubt, according to the Nyayasutras, starts with the premise that doubt is part of the human learning process and occurs when conflicting possibilities exist with regard to a cognized object. Doubt is neither error nor absence of knowledge, but a form of uncertainty and human struggle with probability when it faces incomplete or inconsistent information. It is a knowledge that is possibly partially valid and partially invalid, but doubt is a form of knowledge that has positive value. Doubt is an invitation to \"proceed to further investigation\", asserts the text. All four means of knowledge discovery (perception, inference, comparison and testimony) may be useful in this investigation, but doubt is both a psychological state and a means to knowledge, not in itself a valid knowledge, according to the sutras.\n\n\n=== Hetvabhasa, theory of errors ===\nThe Nyayasutra defines error as knowledge, an opinion or a conclusion about something that is different from what it really is. Gautama states in the text that the error is always in the process of cognition itself, or the \"subjective self\", and not in the object. It is the duty of the knowledge-seeker to \"test the validity of his knowledge\", both in assumptions or through practice (experience), but neither the object of knowledge nor the knowledge itself is responsible for errors; only the knowledge-seeker and his process of cognition is. The Nyaya theory shares ideas on the theory of errors with Advaita Vedanta, Buddhism and Mimamsa schools of Indian philosophies, states Rao, and these schools likely influenced each other.The text identifies and cautions against five kinds of fallacious reasoning (hetvabhasa) in sutra 1.2.4, discussing each in the sutras that follow, stating that these lead to false knowledge, in contrast to proper reasoning (hetu), which leads to true knowledge. The five fallacies or errors, according to Nyayasutras, are to be avoided, in addition to watching for debating tricks (chala) used by those whose aim isn't true knowledge. The five forms of bogus reasoning identified by the text, states Ganeri, are:\nthe wandering or erratic (Nyayasutra 1.2.5)\nthe contradictory (Nyayasutra 1.2.6)\nthe unproven (Nyayasutra 1.2.8)\nthe counterbalanced (Nyayasutra 1.2.7)\nthe untimely (overgeneralization across time, or sublated, Nyayasutra 1.2.9)\n\n\n=== Theory of causality ===\nThe Nyayasutras dedicate many sections on causality and causal relations (Karana, Sanskrit: \u0915\u093e\u0930\u0923), particularly Book 4. Causes, in Nyaya view states Fowler, are \"antecedents of their effects invariably and unconditionally\". A specific effect is produced by a specific cause (plurality in causes is accepted). A specific cause produces a specific effect and no other (plurality in effect, or contradictory effect is not accepted). There cannot be reciprocity to a cause; either we misunderstand the cause or misapprehend the effect. The text rejects remote or supernatural causes, and rejects that qualities are causes. Causes are immediately antecedent, causes exist before an effect in time, and to know something is to understand the effect and the specific cause(s).The text identifies three types of causes \u2013 inherent or material cause (Samavayi-karana), non-inherent cause (Asamavayi-karana), and efficient cause (Nimitta-karana). These, it states, arise from Dravya (substance), Guna (quality) and Karma (action).\n\n\n=== Theory of negatives ===\nThe text seeds the theory of negative entities, where both being and non-being, presence and absence of something is considered correct and useful knowledge. Absence of a book on a table or absence of particular color in a painting has a place in its epistemic process, in addition to positively verifiable characteristics of the table or a painting.\n\n\n=== Atheism in Nyayasutras ===\nEarly Nyaya school scholars considered the hypothesis of Ishvara as a creator God with the power to grant blessings, boons and fruits. However, the Nyayasutras and early Nyaya scholars rejected this hypothesis, and were non-theistic or atheists.In Nyayasutra's Book 4, Chapter 1 examines what causes production and destruction of entities (life, matter) in the universe. It considers many hypotheses, including Ishvara. Verses 19\u201321 postulate that Ishvara exists and is the cause, states a consequence of the postulate, then presents contrary evidence, and from contradiction concludes that the postulate must be invalid.\n\nLater scholars of Nyaya school reconsidered this question and offered counter arguments for what is God (Ishvara) and various arguments to prove the existence of Ishvara. The 5th century CE Nyaya school scholar Prastapada, for example, revisited the premise of God. He was followed by Udayana, who in his text Nyayakusumanjali, interpreted \"it\" in verse 4.1.21 of Nyaya Sutra above, as \"human action\" and \"him\" as \"Ishvara\", then he developed counter arguments to prove the existence of Ishvara, a reasoning that fueled the debate and disagreements on God in Neo-Nyaya and other Hindu traditions of 2nd millennium CE.\n\n\n=== Soul, self exists, inner freedom ===\n\nA large part of the third book of the Nyayasutras is dedicated to the premise and the nature of a Self (soul, atman) and its relation to knowledge, liberation from sorrow and inner freedom (moksha).\n\n\n=== Philosophy: a form of Yoga ===\nThe sutras 4.2.42 to 4.2.48 of Nyayasutras, states Stephen Phillips, state that \"philosophy is a form of yoga\".The text recommends yogic meditation in quiet places such as a forest, cave or sandy beach in sutra 4.2.42, that the knowledge seeker should purify one's soul by Yamas, Niyamas and spiritualism of yoga in sutra 4.2.46. Meditation is a treasured and recommended practice in the text, and extensively discussed by Nyaya scholars that followed Aksyapada Gautama. Vatsyayana wrote in his commentary on Nyayasutras, for example, that meditation is that which enables the mind to contact one's soul, which is accompanied by a conscious eagerness to get at the truth, and such meditation is an essential practice to gain true knowledge.The Nyayasutras state that one must study the means of correct knowledge and hold discussions with the learned, sincere and unenvious fellow seekers of knowledge state sutras 4.2.47 and 4.2.48. One must, translates Phillips, take into account \"consideration of personal character as well as the nature of beliefs held by the opponent\", in deciding the nature of one's discussions, according to Nyayasutras. In some cases, asserts the text, it is better to avoid arguing with hostile opponents and use methods of knowledge like \"a fence is used to safeguard the growth of seeds\".\n\n\n== Commentaries ==\nThe earliest surviving complete bhasya (review and commentary) on Nyaya Sutras is by Vatsyayana. This commentary itself inspired many secondary and tertiary bhasya. Vatsyayana's commentary has been variously dated to be from the 5th century CE, or much earlier around 2nd century BCE. Another often studied surviving commentary on the text is credited to Vacaspati Mishra from about 9th century CE.\n\nOther historical Indian commentaries and works inspired by Nyayasutras and which have survived into the modern era, include Nyaya-varttika by 6th-century Uddyotakara, Nyaya-bhasyatika by 6th-century Bhavivikta, another Nyaya-bhasyatika by 7th-century Aviddhakarna, Nyaya-bhusana by 9th-century Bhasarvajana, Nyaya-manjari by 9th-century Kashmir scholar Jayanta Bhatta, Nyaya-prakirnaka by 10th-century Karnata scholar Trilocana, and Nyaya-kandali by 10th-century Bengal scholar Sridhara.Numerous other commentaries are referenced in other Indian historical texts, but these manuscripts are either lost or yet to be found. Starting around 11th- to 12th century CE, Udayana wrote a primary work, that built upon and expanded the theories on reason found in Nyayasutras. Udayana's work created the foundation for Navya-Nyaya (new Nyaya) school. The Hindu scholar Gangesa of 13th- or 14th-century, integrated the Gautama's Nyayasutras and Udayana's Navya-Nyaya work, to create the influential Tattvacint\u0101ma\u1e47i text considered a masterpiece by scholars.\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\n\n=== On Hinduism's soul, Buddhism's no-soul debate ===\nThe Nyaya-sutras have been one of the foundations for the historic debate between Hinduism's premise that ultimate reality and atman (soul) exists, and Buddhism's premise that there is voidness and anatta (no-soul). In Nyaya-sutra, the Buddhist premises and arguments to refute those premise are found in many chapters, such as sutras of chapters 3.2, 4.1 and 4.2. The text has been influential in this debate, with the 2nd-century Buddhist scholar Nagarjuna states that the Nyaya school and Buddhism differ on their conception of Self (Atman) and their views on the Vedas, and the sutra 4.2.25 of Nyayasutra is addressed against the Madhyamika system of Buddhism.Nagarjuna's Madhyamika-karika targets Nyaya-sutra, among other Hindu texts, for his critique and to establish his doctrine of no self and voidness. In this text, and Vigrahavya-vartani, he presents his proof of voidness by challenging the Pramanas at the foundation of Nyaya-sutras. In his work Pramana-vihetana, Nagarjuna, takes up each of the sixteen categories of knowledge in Gautama's Nyaya-sutras at the foundation of Nyaya's discussion of \"soul exists and the nature of soul in liberation process\", and critiques them using the argument that these categories are relational and therefore unreal. The Nagarjuna's texts, along with Gautama's Nyaya-sutras states Sanjit Sadhukhan, influenced Vatsyayana's work who called Nagarjuna's doctrine of voidness as flawed, and presented his arguments refuting Nagarjuna's theory on \"objects of knowledge are unreal, like a dream or a form of jugglery and a mirage\", but by first presenting his demonstration that the theory of reason and knowledge in the Nyaya-sutras are valid.The Buddhist thesis that all things are negative in nature (inasmuch as a thing's nature is constituted by its differences from others) is rejected, as is the view that all things are eternal or that all things are noneternal. Both these latter views are untrue to experience.\n\n\n=== On Vedanta traditions ===\nThe Nyayasutras were influential to the Vedanta schools of Hindu philosophy, and provided the epistemological foundations. The terms Nyaya and Mimamsa were synonymous, states Hajime Nakamura, in the earliest Dharmasutras of 1st millennium BCE. Over time, Nyaya, Mimamsa and Vedanta became three distinct and related schools.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDebates in ancient India\nNyaya\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Translations ===\nNandalal Sinha, Mahamahopadhyaya Satisa Chandra Vidyabhusana, The Nyaya Sutras of Gotama, The sacred books of the Hindus, 1930; Motilal Banarsidass, 1990 reprint, ISBN 978-81-208-0748-8; Munshiram Manoharlal reprint, 2003, ISBN 978-81-215-1096-7.\nGanganatha Jha, Nyaya- Sutras of Gautama (4 vols.), Motilal Banarsidass, 1999 reprint, ISBN 978-81-208-1264-2.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJ Ganeri (2001), Indian Logic: A Reader, Routledge, ISBN 978-0700713066\nSue Hamilton, Indian Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 2001) ISBN 0-19-285374-0\nB.K.

It became state property in 1945 and since 1993 the museum occupies all of the building, parts of which it has used since 1895.\nOne of the largest museums in Bulgaria, it features 2,150 m\u00b2 of exhibition area and displays objects from the prehistoric,  Thracian, Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman periods of the region's history, as well as from the times of the medieval Bulgarian and Byzantine Empires, the Ottoman rule and the Bulgarian National Revival (including about 900 medieval and Revival icons).\nThe Museum's arguably most celebrated exhibit is the Gold of Varna, the oldest gold treasure in the world, excavated in 1972 and dating to 4600-4200 BCE, which occupies three separate exhibition halls.\nThe museum also manages two open-air archaeological sites, the large Roman baths in the city centre and the medieval grotto of Aladzha Monastery at Golden Sands Nature Park.\nFour other sites are undergoing conservation and will be added to the museum roster: the 4th-5th-century episcopal basilica on Khan Krum Street; the basilica and monastery of the same period at Dzhanavara; the 9th-10th-century Theotokos monastery and scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at Pchelina; and the Mediaeval fortified settlement of Kastritsi at Euxinograd.\nThe museum has also a library, a children's study museum, a gift shop, and a cafeteria.

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989.

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories.

Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989. It specialises in International Economics and Administration, Law, and Architecture.\n\n\n=== Institutes and colleges ===\nThere are four BAS research institutes: Oceanology, Fisheries, Aero and Hydrodynamics, Metallography.

Over the past few decades, it developed as a festival centre of international standing. Varna is a front-runner for European Capital of Culture for 2019, planning to open several new high-profile facilities such as a new opera house and concert hall, a new exhibition centre, and a reconstruction of the Summer Theatre, the historic venue of the International Ballet Competition.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nVarna Archaeological Museum (founded 1888)\nNaval Museum (founded 1923)\nRoman Baths\nAladzha Monastery\nBattle of Varna Park Museum (founded 1924)\nMuseum of Ethnography\nNational Revival Museum\nHistory of Varna Museum\nHistory of Medicine Museum\nHealth Museum (children's)\nPuppet Museum (antique puppets from Puppet Theatre shows)\nBulgar Settlement of Phanagoria ethnographical village (mockup, with historical reenactments)\nAquarium (founded 1912)\nNicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium\nNaval Academy Planetarium\nMuseum of Natural History\nTerrarium\nVarna Zoo\nDolphinarium (founded 1984)\n\n\n=== Galleries ===\nBoris Georgiev City Art Gallery\nGeorgi Velchev Gallery\nModern Art Centre (Graffit Gallery Hotel)\nPrint Gallery\nNumerous smaller fine and applied arts galleries\n\n\n=== Performing arts professional companies ===\n\nOpera and Philharmonic Society (opera, symphonic and chamber music, ballet, and operetta performances;

        "wiki": "Provadia (Bulgarian: \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0438\u044f) is a town in northeastern Bulgaria, part of Varna Province, located in a deep karst gorge (Provadia syncline) along the Provadiya River not far from the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. It is the administrative centre of Provadia Municipality. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 12,901 inhabitants.Provadia served as a customs point since ancient times. It is well known for salty mineral waters, its mild climate and a total of 70 km of caves in the surrounding mountain walls. It can be reached by train from Sofia or Varna and there are also hourly buses from and to Varna, and a sophisticated road system.\n\n\n== History ==\nProvadia is the site of Solnitsata, Europe's oldest prehistoric town. Excavations on city walls that started in 2005 reveal a town that dates back to between 4,700 BC and 4,200 BC. It is believed to have been the site of salt trading.\n\nHistorical names of the medieval fortress, the ruins of which have been preserved until today, include Provat (Byzantine Greek), Ovech (\u041e\u0432\u0435\u0447, Bulgarian), Provanto (Italian) and Pravad\u0131 (Turkish language). The Greek name and its adaptations stem from the word \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf, provato, \"sheep\", and the medieval Bulgarian name corresponds directly (being derived from \u043e\u0432\u0446\u0430, ovtsa, with the same meaning). The fortress is open for visitors. \nDuring the Middle Ages the town was a key centre of the First Bulgarian Empire with an important monastery at the modern village of Ravna, the church of which was consecrated on 23 April 897, and a major scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School. The rebel leader and subsequently emperor of Bulgaria Ivailo defeated a 10,000-strong Byzantine army near the city in 1279. During the Second Bulgarian Empire it was the seat of a metropolitan in the 14th century. Ovech was captured by the Ottomans in 1388 after a long siege.\nIn the 17th and 18th century Provadia was a commercial centre of the Ottoman Empire and was inhabited by many Jewish and Ragusan merchants. A 16th-17th-century Dubrovnik-style church still stands in the nearby village of Dobrina.\n\n\n== Today ==\nSouth of Provadia lies the largest rock salt mine in Bulgaria, which is believed to be virtually inexhaustible with a salt dome up to 3900 m high, and has been sporadically exploited for some 7500 years but industrially, through leaching, only since the 1960s; now it is part of Solvay Sodi AD in Devnya under the name Provadsol AD. Some of the leaching caverns are used for the storage of natural gas. Provadia is an important hub on both the Druzhba Gas Pipeline and as of 2015 abandoned South Stream. Other industrial facilities include a modern biodiesel installation, a sunflower oil mill, a heavy earth-mover repair plant, shipbuilding machinery and textile factories. The town has a certain potential as a spa centre; its saline mineral water is allegedly similar in composition to the one at Karlovy Vary. \nPlaces of interest include the Lambova Kashta ethnographical complex and ethnographical collections in Dobrina and Manastir villages, as well as cave monasteries and the ruins of the 9-10th-century Ravna Monastery, one of the most important centres of the Preslav Literary School, dubbed \"language laboratory\" by Umberto Eco for its graffiti by common folks in several languages and alphabets.Provadiya Hook in Greenwich Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named for Provadia.\nThe current mayor of the town is Zhoro Ilchev, elected in 2019.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nProvadia is the seat of Provadia municipality (part of Varna Province), which also includes the following 24 villages:\n\n\n== References ==\n\nGenov, Nikolay (2003-08-10). \"Provadiya \u2013 the forgotten paradise near the sea\" (in Bulgarian).

Not sure if it\u2019s because of winter season but it\u2019s for free during this time :) You\u2019re going to get a lot of information",
          "One of the most spectacular settlements of human kind. It takes about fortyfive minutes medium effort walk from the town below to the plateau where the fortress is located. Once there , three important things are possible to be done: to THink, THInk and THINK - about land,",
          "The Ovech Fortress is one of the oldest in Bulgaria. The area is full of historical landmarks. Nearby are Veliki Preslav (the city was the capital of the First Bulgarian Kingdom) and near is also the Madara Rider. The view from the fortress is unique, the whole city of Provadia",
          "Not a lot remains of the original fortress, but you do get some feel for the layout within and how it was positioned high up on the hill. Some has been rebuilt to offer a better glimpse at how it originally must have looked. The surrounding countryside is beautiful, and you get",
          "It was a very nice fortress. It can be reached by steps in the rocks and about 3 to 5 minutes on foot. The fortress is crawled for about 30-40 minutes. There is a unique well in the rock 79 meters deep. It's worth a visit.",
          "This is one of my favourite palaces. Its very beatiful and quite and history there is very rich. I recommend",

          "What I got the hold of in Bulgaria is, they were really good by extracting European funds and they did reconstructions of some historic sites. They also know how to hype up some sights and produce crowds wanting to see them. Come they said. It is a fortress they said. A lot of",

          "Not much left of the fortress. A gate few steps and few foundations. Otherwise nice panoramic views. During summer gets very hot and you have to get up the stairs for about 15 minutes before reaching the plateau. When we got there was nobody at the gate or ticket boot, even was",

          "It is an amazing place to see. A perfect harmony between nature and men. The rocks are carved as walls, churches and towers. There is a well 79 meters and there is still water in it. The place is a bit forgotten by the administration, but the greatness of the it shines through.",
          "The ruins of the ancient fortress of Ovech are located on a plateau, overlooking the town of Provadia. It can be reached either from the town via a path and a high spiral ladder, or from the road to the village of Dobrina, used by those who come by car. There is a dirt road",

          "Impressive fortress, really close to Varna but ok also if you come from Nessebar and Sunny Beach. The entrance was free - nobody was there to ask us for an entrance ticket. I loved the view over there and the wood bridge - an unique place in Bulgaria",
          "The nature around the fort is really interesting with a strange structure of cliffs and valleys. You can drive up quite close on a partly unpaved road, then it still takes some climbing of steps! It is fine for a short walk if you are already in the surroundings, but not really",
          "Perfect place to discover nature, really good views of the city in the valley. Highly recommend this place on people who like long walks and history of old fortress. It's better to go in the spring before weather get too hot or too cold.",

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989. It specialises in International Economics and Administration, Law, and Architecture.\n\n\n=== Institutes and colleges ===\nThere are four BAS research institutes: Oceanology, Fisheries, Aero and Hydrodynamics, Metallography.

Over the past few decades, it developed as a festival centre of international standing. Varna is a front-runner for European Capital of Culture for 2019, planning to open several new high-profile facilities such as a new opera house and concert hall, a new exhibition centre, and a reconstruction of the Summer Theatre, the historic venue of the International Ballet Competition.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nVarna Archaeological Museum (founded 1888)\nNaval Museum (founded 1923)\nRoman Baths\nAladzha Monastery\nBattle of Varna Park Museum (founded 1924)\nMuseum of Ethnography\nNational Revival Museum\nHistory of Varna Museum\nHistory of Medicine Museum\nHealth Museum (children's)\nPuppet Museum (antique puppets from Puppet Theatre shows)\nBulgar Settlement of Phanagoria ethnographical village (mockup, with historical reenactments)\nAquarium (founded 1912)\nNicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium\nNaval Academy Planetarium\nMuseum of Natural History\nTerrarium\nVarna Zoo\nDolphinarium (founded 1984)\n\n\n=== Galleries ===\nBoris Georgiev City Art Gallery\nGeorgi Velchev Gallery\nModern Art Centre (Graffit Gallery Hotel)\nPrint Gallery\nNumerous smaller fine and applied arts galleries\n\n\n=== Performing arts professional companies ===\n\nOpera and Philharmonic Society (opera, symphonic and chamber music, ballet, and operetta performances;

        "wiki": "Google Street View was first introduced in the United States on May 25, 2007, and until November 26, 2008, featured camera icon markers, each representing at least one major city or area (such as a park), and usually the other nearby cities, towns, suburbs, and parks. Many areas that had coverage were represented by icons.\n\n\n== Key additions ==\n\nOn May 25, 2007, Street View was announced.\nOn May 30, 2007, at the Where 2.0 Conference, Immersive Media was identified as the contractor that captured the imagery for four of the five cities initially mapped by Street View, using its patented dodecahedral camera array on a moving car. Immersive Media continued to do image capture for Street View until Google developed its own capability to do so. Since July 2007, Google has used imagery that belongs exclusively to Google.\nOn April 16, 2008, Street View was fully integrated into Google Earth 4.3.\nOn May 12, 2008, Google announced that it was testing face-blurring technology on its photos of the busy streets of Manhattan. The technology uses a computer algorithm to search Google's image database for faces and blurs them, according to John Hanke, director of Google Earth and Google Maps.\nOn June 10, 2008, two other features included in the update were an effective mask of the \"Google Car\" and the application of face-blurring technology on all photos, which effectively lowered the resolution across all photos, even the formerly impressive high resolution images of San Francisco. Also, many nearby metro areas were included, but they did not receive their own camera icons.\nOn July 2, 2008, Google Street View was introduced in France and Italy, providing the first service outside the United States and the debut of Google's new 4th Generation Cameras. On this day, 19 camera icons were added, mostly showing small towns and areas along the Tour de France route and part of northwestern Italy.\nOn August 4, 2008, 28 icons of major metropolitan areas of both Australia and Japan were added to Google Street View. Included in the update were approximately 40 new U.S. hub cities.\nOn November 26, 2008, the Street View button and all the camera icons were deleted. Instead of clicking the \"Street View\" button, this is now accessed using the \"pegman\" button in the left hand corner. When the \"pegman\" icon is dragged over the map blue polylines appear where Street View is available and a small window will show the current Street View. If this is dropped on the map the Street View opens and takes over the whole map window.\nOn December 1, 2008, New Zealand was added to Google Street View. Faces were blurred upon recommendation by the New Zealand Privacy Commission, but vehicle registration plates were not obscured.\nOn April 9, 2009, Street View became available with a full-screen option.\nOn June 5, 2009, Smart Navigation was introduced which allows users to navigate around the panoramas by double-clicking with their cursor on any place or object they want to see.\nIn mid-June 2010, Google added blue dots to its maps that display user-submitted images in all locations around the world, including land areas where Street View is not available and bodies of water. These images can be pulled up on the screen in the same manner as a Street View image with the pegman by dragging it onto the blue dot.\nOn October 30, 2012, Google announced that users could contribute to Street View by creating a panorama-like image from the Galaxy Nexus smartphone to share on Google Maps.\nOn February 14, 2013, Wii Street U was released for the Wii U.\nOn June 27, 2013, Google announced that users could contribute to Street View by creating a panorama-like image from the Galaxy non-Nexus smartphone to share on Google Maps.\nOn April 23, 2014, a new historical Street View option was introduced to new Google Maps. The date of panoramas can be selected from the timeline.\nStarting in August 2017, Google allows users to create their own street view-like blue paths, for the connected photospheres that are sufficiently close to one another.\n\n\n== Timeline of introductions ==\n\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2009 ===\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\n\n\n=== 2011 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2013 ===\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\n\n\n=== 2015 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2017 ===\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\n\n\n=== 2019 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n* Limited coverage.\n\n\n== Coverage by country \u03bfr territory ==\nBelow is a table showing the countries available on Street View and the year they were first added. Plain text indicates that a country has only views of certain businesses and/or tourist attractions.\n\n\n=== Current coverage ===\nBold with an asterisk (*) indicates countries with public street view available\n\n\n=== Future coverage ===\nBelow is list of the countries that do not currently have official coverage where Street View vehicles are currently driving, where Street View is officially planned, or have reported by media to be driving.\nPublic streets in Guernsey and India (Bangalore), as well more places in Germany were filmed but at this time the images are not online due to some privacy concerns.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStreet View coverage map and current driving locations\nAvailable indoor views of public transportation facilities as airports and railway stations and transportation museums\nAvailable inside views of university campuses",

          "This really is a lovely place to visit! Animals are roaming in very large areas (apart from a wolf which I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t want roaming) and all look happy and healthy! Entrance is extremely cheap and so is the food for the animals! I had the opportunity to feed monkeys,",
          "Went here on the spur of the moment with my wife and teenage son. Didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. The entrance fee was very small and work out to be about \u00a36 for all 3 of us, plus about 50p per bag of food for the animals. The animals all seemed happy",
          "This is the best place ever! The animals all seemed well cared for. Brilliant value and enjoyed by all ages, including two teenage boys. Also cool and shady, much appreciated in 35 degrees. Don't miss it!",
          "In general we enjoyed the zoo very much. You could feed all the animals if you wanted or dear The ostrich has quite a pinch. The kangaroo was at least for me a bit of a surprise. They have put a lot of effort making the surrounding nice and with a old type of look. The only",
          "that is an amazing zoo. all animals are so so friendly that you can touch all of them and make new friends :) the ostrich is the boss in the zoo and the reinders are from the fairytale. the baby ostrich is so cute... all animals are happy and well caried in this beautiful zoo.",

          "Relatively small, but very nice, cosy, friendly and relaxing zoo! No exotic animals, but all the 'residents' look happy and healthy, eager to play and to be fed, which is fun by itself. We spent 3 hours there (and made a 100 photos) and enjoyed it very much",
          "Very nice stay. Animals are friendly! Feeding them with food is such a joy for children! You may take some food from home and also buy inside the zoo. Carrots, plums, bananas and bread could be helpful if taken from home. The zoo walk takes around 1.5 hours and afterwards there",
          "Went there with low expectations but it was a blast. If you are nearby be sure not to miss it! Many animals, most of them from rural Bulgaria. Nice atmosphere and the entrace is cheap!",
          "Goriza Zoo is very close to Byala, just 10 minutes by car. The entrance is really cheap and also the food for the animals. There are not many animals ,but they free and looks so close to the nature.",
          "The Gorica Zoo and restaurant is situated in the forest on the main road Varna - Burgas. The zoo would be great choice if your children are up to 9 years old. The food in the restaurant is delicious (Bulgarian cuisine) on the good value.",
          "We always make a point of having lunch here at least once when we are in Bulgaria. The food is good wholesome Bulgarian cooking (the bears paw meatball is one of my favourites) and the service friendly and welcoming. The zoo is always interesting as you get to see local fauna",
          "Gorica Zoo is very small and kind of worn down, but the entrance is a steal (2 leva for adults and 1 for children), so we went anyway. Our two girls enjoyed it for almost an hour, and since you can buy food for the animals they had a good time. Afterwards we had icecream and"

        "wiki": "In the history of film and television, accidents have occurred during shooting, such as cast or crew fatalities or serious accidents that plagued production. From 1980 to 1990, there were 37 deaths relating to accidents during stunts; 24 of these deaths involved the use of helicopters.\n\n\n== 1910s ==\nAcross the Border (1914). On 1 July 1914, while filming on location in Canon City, Colorado, cast member Grace McHugh was filming a scene where her character was crossing the Arkansas River in a boat. When the boat capsized, camera operator Owen Carter immediately jumped into the river to save her. He dragged her onto a sandbar that was reported to be quicksand. The rest of the film crew watched helplessly as they were sucked into the sandbar and drowned.\nThe Birth of a Nation (1915). Future film director Erich von Stroheim fell off a roof and broke two ribs in one scene as an extra.\nThe Girl of the Golden West (1915). Actor House Peters Sr. suffered serious burns to his face and hands when a prop pistol exploded upon being fired.\nThe Captive (1915). During filming of a scene where soldiers were required to break down a locked door, the extras fired at the door using live ammunition to give the scene more realism. The director then ordered the extras to reload with blanks in order to film the next shot in which the door is broken down. But one of the extras inadvertently left a live round in his rifle which discharged, shooting another extra, Charles Chandler, in the head, killing him instantly.\nThe Woman God Forgot (1917). In one scene, extras were required to be thrown over the side of an Aztec pyramid. The 'pyramid' was built of wood and covered in paper on which sand had been glued to create the appearance of stone. The extras were 'sand-papered' as they slid down the side of the structure. Having expected such injuries, a crew member was waiting at the bottom with a bucket of iodine.\nThe Valley of the Giants (1919). Silent-era star Wallace Reid was badly injured in a train crash during filming in Oregon. His injuries caused him severe pain and the studio supplied him with increasing quantities of morphine so he could keep working. Addicted to morphine and also suffering from alcoholism, Reid died in 1923 at the age of 31.\nUnidentified Henry Lehrman comedy (1919): Comedian Billie Ritchie, while working on a short comedy film, was kicked in the stomach by an ostrich and sustained internal injuries.\n\n\n== 1920s ==\nHaunted Spooks (1920). On the set of a publicity shoot that took place while filming, actor and comedian Harold Lloyd picked up what he thought was a prop bomb with the fuse lit but realized too late the bomb was real. It detonated, blowing off the thumb and first finger of his right hand and also temporarily blinding him. For the rest of his career, Lloyd concealed his missing fingers with a prosthetic glove.\nThe Skywayman (1920). Pilots Milton Elliott and Ormer Locklear were killed on 2 August 1920, during filming. Their plane crashed at the DeMille Airfield, along Wilshire Blvd. in Los Angeles, while filming night scenes.\nManslaughter (1922). Stunt man Leo Noomis was required to crash a police motorcycle into the side of a car at 45 miles per hour (72 km/h). Noomis suffered six broken ribs and a fractured pelvis while performing the stunt.\nSouls for Sale (1923). Actress Barbara La Marr injured her ankle during filming and doctors prescribed not only morphine but also cocaine to control the pain and enable her to continue filming. Working on the production left La Marr addicted to drugs, a factor that contributed to her premature death three years later.\nSherlock Jr. (1924). While hanging from a water tower, Buster Keaton pulled a rope that released water from the tower, knocking him to the ground. In the scene, he stood and ran into the distance. During a routine physical examination 11 years later, an X-ray revealed that Keaton's neck had been fractured.\nThe Warrens of Virginia (1924). On 29 November 1923, while working on location in San Antonio, Texas, Martha Mansfield was severely burned when a match, tossed by a cast member, ignited her Civil War costume of hoopskirts and flimsy ruffles. Mansfield was playing the role of Agatha Warren and had just finished her scenes and retired to a car when her clothing burst into flames. Her neck and face were saved when leading man Wilfred Lytell threw his heavy overcoat over her. The hands of the chauffeur of Mansfield's car were badly burned while he tried to remove the actress' burning clothing. The fire was put out, but she sustained substantial burns to her body and died the following day.\nBen-Hur (1925). An early filming attempt of the chariot race was done on location at the Circus Maximus in Rome. It brought about the death of one stuntman when a wheel of his chariot broke.\nThe General (1926). During filming of the epic comedy in Oregon, there were a number of incidents. Several National Guardsmen, employed as extras for the Civil War battle scenes, were injured by mishaps caused by misfired muskets or explosions. Director and star Buster Keaton was knocked unconscious when he stood too close to a cannon firing. Assistant director Harry Barnes was accidentally hit in the face by a blank charge. Train brakeman Fred Lowry sued the production for US$2,900 after his foot was crushed when it was run over by a locomotive wheel during filming of one of the railway scenes.\nWings (1927). During filming of the World War I aerial combat scenes, stunt pilot Dick Grace was required to deliberately crash-land a Fokker D-VII, specially modified to \"crumple\" on impact. When the Fokker struck the ground, the landing gear failed to crumple, making the impact a heavier one than planned. This caused Grace's safety straps to break, sending his head through the instrument panel, leaving him with four crushed vertebrae and a broken neck. Amazingly, Grace spent only six weeks in the hospital and was again performing stunt work within a year.\nNoah's Ark (1928). Three people died, one man lost a leg and a number were injured in a scene where several hundred extras were caught in the \"Great Flood.\" The deaths were instrumental in the introduction of film safety regulations the following year.\nThe Aviator (1929). During aerial scouting for locations, an aircraft crashed, killing cameraman Alvin Knechtel and actor and stunt pilot William Hauber.\nThe Godless Girl (1929). The filming of one scene required cast members Lina Basquette and George Duryea to be trapped in a burning building and both actors had their clothing, hair and exposed skin covered with an asbestos coating. During filming, Duryea, concerned that the pyrotechnic flames were getting too hot and too close, fled from the set but Basquette, eager to impress director Cecil B DeMille, insisted on remaining until the scene was completed despite the intense heat. The actress suffered serious burns and blistering to her forearms and her eyebrows and lashes were singed.\nUnknown film (1929). Strongheart, a German Shepherd film star, was accidentally burned after coming into contact with a hot studio light. The burn became tumorous, leading to his death later that year.\n\n\n== 1930s ==\nHell's Angels (1930). Three pilots were killed during the filming. The sole Sikorsky S-29-A, owned by Roscoe Turner, which portrayed a German Gotha bomber, crashed during filming on 22 March 1929 when stunt pilot Al Wilson put it in a spin for its final scene and was unable to recover. He was ready to bail out and called back to his mechanic Phil Jones (who was in the rear of the plane dumping lampblack to simulate smoke) to jump, but Jones didn't hear him and went down with the plane. Only one brief shot of the spinning Sikorsky was used in the film. Two other stunt pilots, Al Johnson and Clement Phillips, were killed in separate accidents. Producer-director Howard Hughes was badly injured when he personally piloted a low-altitude aerial maneuver after the professional stunt men informed him it could not be done safely or successfully. They were proven right when Hughes crashed and suffered severe head injuries. Hughes underwent plastic surgery to undo the damage to his face, but his left cheekbone could not be repaired.\nSuch Men Are Dangerous (1930). During aerial filming off the coast of Southern California near Santa Monica on 2 January 1930, two Stinson Detroiter aircraft, employed as camera-planes, collided over the ocean. All ten men on board the two planes were killed, including director Kenneth Hawks (brother of Howard Hawks), assistant-director Max Gold, cinematographer Conrad Wells, director of photography George Eastman, cameramen Otto Jordan and Ben Frankel, two property men and both pilots. Only five bodies were recovered. As it was one of the final scenes to be filmed, the movie was still completed on schedule. Families of the men who were lost took legal action against Fox Film Company but the courts ruled in favour of the latter.\nThe Viking (1931). After completion of filming in Canada, producer, co-director and real-life adventurer Varick Frissell decided that more footage of the Labrador ice floes was required. He and a small film crew joined the real ship The Viking on a seal-hunting voyage in order to obtain the footage he wanted. On 15 March, the ship became trapped in ice near Horse Isles and dynamite stored on board (intended for breaking up ice floes) accidentally detonated, destroying the vessel and killing 27 men, including Frissell and cameraman Alexander Penrod.\nThe Little Minister (1934). John Beal nearly lost his sight when an extra accidentally stabbed him in his eye during the filming of the mob scene.\nFour Frightened People (1934). During filming in Hawaii, actress Claudette Colbert was required to stand up to her neck in a real swamp. This scene was shot on her first day on set after having undergone an emergency appendectomy and Colbert and the director disregarded concerns raised by the on-set nurse. Filming in the unsanitary conditions while not yet fully recovered led to Colbert being hospitalized with a severe fever two days later.\nThe Lost Patrol (1934). During filming in high temperatures in Buttercup Valley near Yuma, Arizona, Director John Ford insisted his cast and crew only work in the early mornings and late afternoons to avoid the most intense heat of each day. Under pressure from RKO to speed up filming, Producer Cliff Reid insisted that the midday break be shortened. Ford refused, believing that many of the crew would be at risk of heatstroke in the 120-degree F conditions. Reid tried to prove his point by walking around in the open in the midday heat and soon collapsed with heat exhaustion, requiring hospital treatment.\nThe Crusades (1935). While filming a battle scene in which horses fall into a moat, four stunt riders sustained serious injuries which required hospitalization. All four of their horses were injured so severely they had to be euthanized. It was recommended that the injured stunt-men receive extra pay but director Cecil B DeMille refused, saying that the riders had 'bungled a simple scene'.\nThe Charge of the Light Brigade (1936). During the filming of the charge sequence, a stuntman was killed when he fell off his horse and landed on a broken sword that was lying on the field, unfortunately wedged in such a position that its blade was sticking straight up. Also, due to the use of trip wires, three dozen horses had their legs broken and had to be shot during filming, resulting in the U.S. Congress passing laws to protect animals used in motion pictures.\nSaratoga (1937).  Lionel Barrymore broke his hip after tripping on a cable on the set of that film.\nJesse James (1939). A horse was killed during the scene where it was ridden off a cliff into a river. This incident led to the American Humane Association opening a Hollywood office in 1940 and monitoring the treatment of animals in films.\nThe Wizard of Oz (1939). Margaret Hamilton was badly burned during a scene in which her character, the Wicked Witch of the West, \"vanished\" in a burst of flame and smoke. A delay in activating a trap door left her exposed to the pyrotechnic device. Her stunt double was also injured in a scene involving a smoking broomstick. Buddy Ebsen suffered a severe allergic reaction to his Tin Man makeup that resulted in a collapsed lung and lifelong breathing issues. He was unable to continue working on the production and was replaced by Jack Haley.\nHotel Imperial (1939). Actor Ray Milland was seriously injured while filming a cavalry charge scene through a small village. While making a planned jump over an obstacle, the horse's saddle came loose and Milland fell into a pile of masonry. He spent a week in hospital with concussion, a three-inch gash to his forehead and a badly injured left hand.\n\n\n== 1940s ==\nCitizen Kane (1941). While filming, Orson Welles tripped down a staircase and chipped his anklebone, forcing him to use a wheelchair for the next two weeks. Welles also gashed his own hand during a scene where he destroyed a room. Welles quickly improvised, grabbing a curtain and using it to cover his bleeding hand while he completed the scene, which appears in the film.\nMy Life for Ireland (1941). An anti-British propaganda film made by the Germans. During the epic final-battle scene, several extras were killed when one of them stepped on a live land mine. The footage is said to have been included in the release prints, although no proof of this has been established.\nThey Died with Their Boots On (1941). Three horsemen perished during the cavalry charge, one of whom was extra Jack Budlong, whose horse tripped as he rode alongside Errol Flynn. As he fell forward, he had the foresight to toss his sword ahead of him. Unfortunately, it landed handle down and stuck in place. Budlong was impaled on his own sword, and died in a Los Angeles hospital a few hours later.\nReap the Wild Wind (1942). According to a biographer, actor John Wayne suffered a chronic inner-ear condition for the rest of his life after filming under-water scenes in this production.\nSigned with Their Honour (unfinished, 1943). This was to have been a British war film based on the 1942 novel of the same name by James Aldridge. But during filming in Cheshire, a pair of Gladiator biplanes collided, injuring both pilots who managed to escape by parachute. After this incident, the film project was abandoned.\nThe Royal Mounted Rides Again (1945). Addison \"Jack\" Randall was killed at Canoga Park, California, while riding a horse past the cameras at full speed on 16 July 1945, for a Universal Pictures serial, when he fell from the saddle while trying to retrieve his hat which had blown off his head, and struck a tree. He died shortly thereafter.\nUnconquered (1947). During the filming of the historical adventure, nine extras suffered burns including one man who had his hair partially burnt off because director Cecil B DeMille insisted on using real fireballs and flaming arrows for one of the battle scenes. In another incident, stunt woman Polly Burson was filming a scene that required a canoe to go over a waterfall. She missed the tree limb she was supposed to grab onto and fell into the safety net which was below the water's surface. Landing face down in the net, she nearly drowned and was only barely able to struggle upright in time.\n\n\n== 1950s ==\nThe Conqueror (1956). The exterior scenes were shot on location near St. George, Utah, 137 miles (220 km) downwind of the United States government's Nevada Test Site. In 1953, extensive above-ground nuclear weapons testing had occurred at the test site, as part of Operation Upshot\u2013Knothole. Director Dick Powell died of cancer in January 1963, Pedro Armend\u00e1riz was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 1960, and committed suicide in 1963 after he learned his condition had become terminal. Susan Hayward, John Wayne and Agnes Moorehead all died of cancer in the 1970s. Cast member actor John Hoyt died of lung cancer in 1991. The cast and crew totaled 220 people. By 1981, 91 of them had developed some form of cancer and 46 had died of the disease. Several of Wayne and Hayward's relatives also had cancer scares as well after visiting the set. Michael Wayne developed skin cancer, his brother Patrick Wayne had a benign tumor removed from his breast and Hayward's son Tim Barker had a benign tumor removed from his mouth. It is not clear, however, that the cancer rate for this film crew was significantly higher than in the general population. Further, while the cast members noted developed a wide variety of cancers, according to The New England Journal of Medicine, leukemia is the only form of cancer known to develop from exposure to fallout radiation.\nThe Ten Commandments (1956). Cecil B DeMille overcame a minor heart attack while climbing down by ladder from the top of the Egyptian city gate set during filming the \"take three\" of the  Exodus sequence. In another incident, during filming of a sand-storm scene, an extra carrying a flaming torch tripped over and the torch set fire to the clothing of a young girl standing next to him. The girl only suffered minor burns thanks to the quick thinking of make-up artist Frank Westmore who raced over and tore off her burning costume. During the filming of the same scene, several Egyptian extras were bitten by scorpions and a cobra which had been blown out of their burrows in the sand by the artificially generated storm.\nVaran the Unbelievable (1958). Minor injuries, exhaustion and dehydration are common hazards for suit actors of the kaiju genre, but during the filming of 'Varan' suit actor Haruo Nakajima (who also portrayed Godzilla for 18 years) was severely burned due to a pyrotechnics mishap. This was the only time in his career that his injuries forced him to be replaced for the remainder of the shoot.\nBen-Hur (1959). Joe Canutt, who was Charlton Heston's stunt double, sustained a gash on his chin after being flipped out of his chariot during a chariot race scene.\nThe Horse Soldiers (1959). Fred Kennedy, a veteran stuntman and bit player, was killed in a horse fall on location in Louisiana. Director John Ford was so upset he closed the set and had to film the rest of the scene later in the San Fernando Valley, and in a cut-down version.\n\n\n== 1960s ==\nThe Alamo (1960). Actor Laurence Harvey, who played Colonel W B Travis, was injured when a cannon recoiled while firing, with one of the wheels rolling over his foot, fracturing it.

        "wiki": "Copernicus Airport Wroc\u0142aw (Polish: Port Lotniczy Wroc\u0142aw im. Miko\u0142aja Kopernika) (IATA: WRO, ICAO: EPWR) is an international commercial airport in Wroc\u0142aw in southwestern Poland. The airport is located 10 km (6.2 mi) southwest of the city centre, at Graniczna street 190. It has one runway, one passenger terminal, one cargo terminal and one general aviation terminal. Wroc\u0142aw airport is also often used by US Air Force aircraft. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe airport was built in 1938 as Flugplatz Breslau-Sch\u00f6ngarten Airport for German military purposes before World War II, when the city was still part of Germany. It was the site of a military aviation school, the Luftkriegsschule Breslau-Sch\u00f6ngarten, later renamed Luftkriegsschule 5. Among the Luftwaffe units stationed here just before the war were the Sturzkampfgeschwader 77, Kampfgeschwader 76, and Kampfgeschwader 1 \"Hindenburg\".\nIt was operated briefly by Soviet forces following the war before being used for civilian purposes in 1945. Services were operated to Warsaw, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Pozna\u0144 and Katowice. By 1992 destinations also included Krak\u00f3w, Rzesz\u00f3w, Gda\u0144sk, Szczecin and Koszalin.\n'Port Lotniczy Wroc\u0142aw S. A.' was established as a company in January 1992 and Wroc\u0142aw airport assets operated by the state-owned Polish Airports authority were transferred to the company in January 1993.The first international flights were inaugurated in January 1993, serving Frankfurt, Germany. Significant airport improvements have been completed in the late twentieth century. A new international departures terminal was opened in May 1997 followed by a new domestic terminal in November 1998.\n\n\n=== Developments since the 2000s ===\nA cargo terminal, international arrivals hall, and installation of a new meteorological system were completed in 1999; new fire station and apron extensions in 2000. A new air traffic control tower and duty-free area followed in 2001.On December 6, 2005 the airport was renamed after the famous astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (in Polish: Miko\u0142aj Kopernik), who in Wroc\u0142aw studied and received a scholarship, and in the years 1503-1538 was a scholaster of the Wroc\u0142aw Collegiate Holy Cross and St. Bartholomew on the Cathedral Island. The airport's new name is Copernicus Airport Wroc\u0142aw (Port Lotniczy Wroc\u0142aw im. Miko\u0142aja Kopernika). Terminal extensions were officially opened on the same day, increasing the airport's capacity to 750,000 passengers per year. This capacity was quickly exceeded by several hundred thousand (in the first 9 months of 2007 the airport served 972,505 passengers) so the existing terminal space was expanded by 1,900 m2 (20,451 sq ft) to alleviate some of the congestion, but more importantly make the terminal facilities conform to the requirements of the Schengen Agreement, which was implemented at Poland's airports on 31 March 2008.\nOn 19 July 2006, the architectural firm JSK was chosen to design a significant airport expansion. This includes plans for a new passenger terminal (eventually, after several stages of expansion, the airport will be able to handle 7 million passengers yearly) and assorted taxiway, apron and navigation equipment improvements (ILS). Also, car parking will be expanded to 1,000 spaces. The first stage, increasing the passenger capacity to 3,5 million yearly, officially opened on February 29, 2012. However, the new terminal opened to passengers on Sunday March 11, 2012.\nIn May 2014, the HEMS (Helicopter Emergency Medical Service) base for Air Ambulance (pl: Lotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe) was launched at the airport.\nin 2015 Ryanair announced that it has selected Copernicus Airport Wroc\u0142aw (Port Lotniczy Wroc\u0142aw im. Miko\u0142aja Kopernika) for its aircraft maintenance base. The construction of the hangar to fit 2 C-type aircraft (Boeing 737) was finished in June 2017. The airport has upgraded to ILS system from category I to category II in April 2016.Due to the existence of NATO garrisons nearby (Boles\u0142awiec, \u015awi\u0119tosz\u00f3w, \u017baga\u0144), in which US troops have been stationed as part of the Atlantic Resolve operation since January 2017, Wroclaw airport is very often used by US Air Force transport aircraft (inter alia Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, Lockheed C-130 Hercules, Lockheed C-5 Galaxy). On September 23, 2019, in New York, the presidents of the USA and Poland signed a declaration on the deepening of defense cooperation, in which Wroc\u0142aw Airport was designated as the seat of the US Army air transport base.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe airport operates modern domestic, international and cargo terminals. The international terminal contains a duty free area in the international departures hall. The cargo terminal, located beside the fire station and air traffic control tower, has a storage area of 3,300 m2 (36,000 sq ft), a bonded warehouse, freezer and radioactive materials warehouse.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\nAll the following flights are currently suspended  because of the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\nFollowing are the official airport annual traffic figures.\n\n\n== Ground transportation ==\n\n\n=== Bus and coach ===\nThe airport is served by two MPK Wroc\u0142aw bus lines, which on their routes have many stops in the city. Line 106 (day) or 206 (night) connect to main railway station and main bus station, and line 129 through the estates Strachowice, \u017berniki, Ku\u017aniki, G\u0105d\u00f3w Ma\u0142y, Popowice, R\u00f3\u017canka, Kar\u0142owice, Po\u015bwi\u0119tne with the northern part of the Psie Pole district.\nFrom December 2017 Polbus-PKS started an express bus called \"WRO Airport Express\" connecting the airport with Dominika\u0144ski Square (near the Market Square) and the main bus station, which is located in the basement of the shopping mall \"Wroclavia\" (stand number 7).\n\n\n=== Car ===\nThe airport also is served by traditional taxi corporations, as well as Uber, Bolt, iTaxi and Free Now. The airport offers nearly 4000 parking spaces. There are car rentals at the airport.\n\n\n=== Bike ===\nThere is also a bike path that leads to the airport.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nThere are future plans to build a railway line between the airport and Wroc\u0142aw G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station. A tunnel and a railway station have already been built under the main terminal.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of airports in Poland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Wroc\u0142aw-Strachowice Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website",

It became state property in 1945 and since 1993 the museum occupies all of the building, parts of which it has used since 1895.\nOne of the largest museums in Bulgaria, it features 2,150 m\u00b2 of exhibition area and displays objects from the prehistoric,  Thracian, Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman periods of the region's history, as well as from the times of the medieval Bulgarian and Byzantine Empires, the Ottoman rule and the Bulgarian National Revival (including about 900 medieval and Revival icons).\nThe Museum's arguably most celebrated exhibit is the Gold of Varna, the oldest gold treasure in the world, excavated in 1972 and dating to 4600-4200 BCE, which occupies three separate exhibition halls.\nThe museum also manages two open-air archaeological sites, the large Roman baths in the city centre and the medieval grotto of Aladzha Monastery at Golden Sands Nature Park.\nFour other sites are undergoing conservation and will be added to the museum roster: the 4th-5th-century episcopal basilica on Khan Krum Street; the basilica and monastery of the same period at Dzhanavara; the 9th-10th-century Theotokos monastery and scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at Pchelina; and the Mediaeval fortified settlement of Kastritsi at Euxinograd.\nThe museum has also a library, a children's study museum, a gift shop, and a cafeteria. Its courtyard lapidarium hosts the annual Varna Summer International Jazz Festival.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\nVarna Archaeological Museum website (in Bulgarian and English)",

          "Very uncorrupted archeological museum. There is nice sculptures. It is not expensive and worth it. Bey",
          "There is amazing colection of historical artefacts. And oldest gold in the world. The museun is not very big and you can make your visit for 1- 2-3 hours or stay all day. For history lovers.",
          "After you have bought your ticket, start by going up the stairs and to your left. There you will see a very useful wall-height time line chart. This helps to make sense of the vast collection before you start. You can even go back to the chart just to remind yourself! Very much",
          "An interesting museum, with lots of artifacts in fantastic condition. Nicely set out in what was a high school. Informative and well presented. I did think the 10 Lev (5 Euro) entrance fee was a bit high for Varna, but the quality of the exhibition reflected this...",
          "The museum is everything you'd want from as establishment like like this - well laid out, easy navigation, amazing content, clear labels. I spent two hours absorbed and entertained - an absolute highlight of my time in Varna. Go!",
          "This building was built for the Varna Girls' High School and is perhaps the most beautiful school in the Balkans. It is now a rich archeological museum that is worth seeing.",
          "Interesting collection of ceramics of the Izmik Type . The icons gallery was well documented and sufficiently illuminated for the viewer to appreciate the work . Overall it is a huge building ( supposedly a girls school now used solely for the exhibits ) It is spread out to en",

          "We really loved this museum. My recommendation would be to start from the top & move down to travel back in time. If you have a specific interest in the history of the orthodox people in Bulgaria under ottoman rule, it\u2019s also very very worthwhile!!",
          "an amazing museum to see when you are in Varna, a must see visit. great treasure, perfected situated in the city and a friendly entrance price",
          "An excellent museum that is English/Bulgarian that shows the archeologic and historic past of the region. It is clean, well lit and documented. the staff is friendly and veryu proud to assist. This region dates back prior to the Egyptians and has hosted the Greeks, Romans,",
          "Museum is great, with very rich collection of artifacts. It's worth to visit. Prices are affordable, place inside is huge, so plan at least one and half hour.",
          "It would be really remiss if on a visit to Varna you did not drop in to the Archaeological Museum. It is on the same street as the Cathedral, so is very easy to find. The exhibits here in this former school are attractively laid out and well-lit, with helpful explanatory labels",
          "If you are interested in Archaeology, this is a highlight of your stay in Varna. The halls cover each of the major time periods. The Neolithic period is especially well-curated. I spent over an hour here and I was the only person in the museum!",
          "We were in a private sightseeing tour with a local tour guide. Very glad we went to see the gold exhibit. Given the time, I would have enjoyed touring the entire museum",

          "This is a very good archaeological museum. Well presented displays with English labels on most cases. Interesting distinction between Copper and Bronze age communities.",
          "I was expecting something more when I visited to specifically see the Varna Gold displayed in this museum. It turns out not all of it is here as I think some of it is in Sofia. So slightly disappointed to say the least. No photography allowed of gold. Elsewhere in the museum",
          "Highlight of my Varna trip was this museum. The oldest gold in the world was found in an archeological dig on the outskirts of Varna and can be viewed in the museum. The rich history of this ancient Baltic city is so fascinating and can easily be followed if you read the museum",

          "Our region is so ancient (rich in the past), but unfortunately most of the historical items are located in other currently rich places (out side Bulgaria). Any way in this museum you will discover that the oldest gold items done by the humans on our Earth was found around Varna",

          "The exhibition devoted to antiquity until the Roman Period is FABULOUS ! The sections thereafter are less impressive. Old building, i couldn't find elevators. The explanation boards in English are excellent. The design is very much 1960s. No multimedia or computerized displays,",
          "Two blocks from the main drop off point for central Varna, use underground walkways when available to cross busy streets, around corner from the Cathedral You can take a walking tour from in front of the information office, or do your own tour, but do go in the museum go history",
          "We went to waste time basically, I enjoyed it more then my wife, it had student discounts, 5 Lev a ticket. There was a cafe inside the main sqaure garden and a toilet 1 floor below that. You are not allowed to photograph Inside the museum so no photos attached. Interesting",

          "It's a must-see for everyone who's interested in archeology and history. The museum has one of the best collections of Greek and Roman objects which might even rival that of Athens - all of them are very well preserved and the exposition is arranged in a comprehensible way.",
          "Nice museum with quite a lot of artefacts from many time periods. There was a lot of text to read for all exhibitions if you wanted to know more and the museum is quite large. We came to see the \"oldest gold treasure\" also, but didn't know what it looked like. So when we had",
          "In Varna archaeological museum there are interesting exibitions. One of them is the Varna's necropolis oldest golden treasure found is a burial site from 4569\u20134340 BC. Do not hesitate to visit and enjoy a travel through the local history.",

          "To have a view in Varna's history from the PreHistoric Stone Age to the modern times you have to visit the Archaelogical Museum and have a glimpse to the city's past.",
          "Good for prehistory enthusiasts or casual visitors alike, the museum is one of my favourites. Anybody can appreciate the marvel of almost 7000-year old gold jewellery, but there's enough detail there to keep the true amateur interested. Well worth the 10 Leva fee.",
          "The museum is located in the center, not too far from the Cathedral. It has some very interesting relics. I recommend seeing it, if you are curious about the region's older history.",
          "Your typical museum. Not superfun for kids, but a good excebition. Small cafe in the courtyard. Mainly artifacts. Good ex from the roman period.",
          "I've been coming to Varna for eleven years, and I never fail to go back to the Archaeological Museum. It's not large, and it will take about an hour or ninety minutes to walk through its superb collection of artifacts collected from the region around Varna, when Odessos was a",
          "A great place with many local treasures, it could do with some modernizing especially the signs but its still good enough to really enjoy for half a day.",
          "This is a great museum with great collection of Thracian, Greek & Roman antiquities. The labelling is both in Bulgarian & English. It is both beautifully presented & with few visitors a lovely calm spot to spend some time examine the objects. There is a good display of later",
          "I was blown away by the special exibit of the \"oldest processed Gold found on the Planet\" This was dug up at a site in Lake Varna \" More than 6500 years old\" now this pre-dates even the gold found in Egypt, with some evidence indicating that these ancient people of Varna may",
          "From the earliest neolithic settlements onwards, the museum has enought artefacts to impress just how important this area of the world was in the development of European civilizations. Certainly much of the best stuff was taken off to Sofia for the amazing archeological museum",
          "Visited with my Mum and we knew before arrival this was one of the places we wanted to visit. It's 10 lev (\u00a35) for adult entry, we were told by the tourist information centre in Varna that it was closed Monday's - thank goodness we checked as it was open. The museum is packed",
          "See the oldest gold pieces here. Nice collection for a small city...all pieces found in the area. The 20 Lev fee to take photos is outrageous...use the money and buy a book instead.",
          "A stunning museum, well laid out and with good and accurate displays in English. The undoubted highlights are the early gold ornaments and the impressive display of Icons. That said the museum explains the importance of the area throughout history from the distant copper ages",
          "I visited this museum with my friend. It can be viewed in about 3 to 3.5 hours. It covers the entire span of Bulgarian history with wonderful maps that show the progress of the country. I found that there was nice places to sit in the hallways and rest between viewing the",
          "From the paleolithic age to the Roman Empire it is an astonishing museum with many actractions as the ancient gold jewels treasure (probably the oldest gold in the world)",
          "This large museum does have practically none rest areas or benches. It takes hours to go through the museum which is laid out in oldfashioned style, it is like a \"museum museum\". The main attraction, the world's oldest gold pieces are not very interesting-looking, their thing",
          "Initially we went to see the Thracian Gold - apparently the largest collection in Europe. However there was so much more of interest. Exhibits started from the Palaeolithic age and came forward through the history of settlement in Varna. The exhibits focused on grave findings",
          "We have been to many major museums in a variety of places, but I cannot say enough about this one. They have an unparalleled collection of local pieces in phenomenal condition from both the Thracian period and the Romans. Amazing carvings, artwork, etc but of course what really",
          "Each piece helps one to imagine life six thousand years ago and to appreciate the skill of the artisans in antiquity. The wall maps are good reminders of the migrations of people and of the importance of geography. Orthodox icons and the story of the Bulgars may be found on the",
          "The museum is not big, but its collections are priceless. Here is exhibited the oldest gold treasure in the world, about 6000 years old. It was found in the Varna Necropolis. There are many older artifacts from this region. It is interesting to learn about one of the oldest",
          "As one of if not the oldest seaport on the Black Sea, Odesso/Varna has history spanning over 100,000 years, from hunter/gatherers to the end of the stone age and into the Bronze and Iron Age. There are approximately 65,000 pieces in the museum and it is reputed to be one of the",
          "Assuming that you have some semblance of an aesthetic sense, you just cannot visit Varna without spending at least an hour in this place. The gold exhibits are mouth-watering.",
          "This is a marvellous museum, well laid out and with many artefacts from different eras on display. It's not stuffy or restrictive and sets out the displays in an easy-to-view way in its many rooms. What makes this place unique is the fabulous exhibition of the \"Varna Gold\" -",
          "Poor museum which was very unwelcoming. There is information in English - allow an hour. Wrongly identified as a top ten attraction",
          "What a wonderful place this is. So much information and so much history. Displays are thought provoking and fascinating.",
          "The museum provides an extensive informative display of the history of man into the post Roman period. recording is in Bulgarian and English. Entrance fee was 5 lev which was excellent value.",
          "Given only the Louvre, BM and Met get 5 stars I appear to be very fond of this museum. While literally provincial the long history from paleolithic through Roman and Byzantine times until today gives the town a rich history which is extremely well reflected in ts main museum.",
          "Very nice museum! Descriptions in English! And that gold is incredible. Only suggestions maybe a sitting area.",
          "The main attraction for me was the relics of the Treta (??) who were the original inhabitants of the area before the Greeks , Romans etc invaded. Many go back to 4 or 5000 BC and are remarkably intact including a skeleton of a child they found in a huge burial site near town.",
          "Housed in an imposing high-ceilinged former educational institution, the museum's main attraction is the gold found in burial sites dating back 5000 millenia with the exquisitely worked double rams, rings, pendants and discs. Gold denoted status as these were found in tombs of",
          "Amazing collection, with lots of information in English. Plan to spend some time there to see everything.",
          "The building itself is amazing, it used to be a university and changed it's roles during the wars.( from upstairs reading) Inside it has alot of different areas where it shows different aspects of Bulgarians history. It's a good place to visit if you are interested in history",
          "A very well-displayed collection with some beautiful objects. Very informative with decently translated information boards. Well worth the visit.",
          "good details, nice organization, with english explanations. very interesting details. but the museum is not for the kids actually, they can easily get bored",
          "Ancient history, artefacts, funerals, alien figurines ... tons of curious exhibits. If you love this kind of museum, spare at least two days for this one. I live in Varna and I'm proud of it.",
          "My husband and I spent just over an hour at this museum which had many interesting artefacts mainly from excavations from around the Varna area, including the oldest gold to be found. The exhibits were quite interesting and there was quite a lot of information in English. It",
          "Lots and lots of stuff in cabinets. Which is my sort of thing, so that's fine, but children would get extremely bored and very quickly. To begin with the arrows clearly direct you to each 'room of cabinets' so that you visit them chronologically; each room has a helpful",
          "Occasionally this museum is host to Bulgaria's most famous gold treasure, which is always worth seeing, but it more often touring abroad or in Sofia. Still, the Varna area is where it was found, and sophisticated life has been going on here for thousands of years and is thus",
          "The museum is in different exhibition rooms, you are wandering through the years. Really alot to see and the english explanations were very well written and really interesting to read. I recommend this museum to everyone that is interested in history and archaeology.",
          "service by the stuff is nice one , there is also exhibition not only about Varna , but about other EU cities , which is pleasant surprise",
          "I've spent around 2-3 hours walking around the museum. Its not one of the biggest Ive seen, but still and interesting one. In June 2017, ticket was 10 Bulgarian Lev, for an adult, 20 if you want to take pictures. Staff was bit down, but overall I didnt spent much time talking",
          "The gold found in burial mounds is Europe's oldest, from 5 millennium BC. Beautifully crafted demonstrating artistry and metallurgical skills from an ancient people",
          "I visited the museum on Saturday May 20th 2017 and took my wife along. Even my wife, a person who finds 'Archaeological Museums as interesting as watching paint dry' found the museum was excellent. The museum deals with the history of the earliest finds of 'civilization' in the",
          "It is certainly worth to find an hour or so to visit the unique antiquities housed at the Varna Archaeological Museum. What was really breath-taking and not to be missed are the bronze aged tombs with the first ever discovered processed gold in the world from 5 BC.",
          "I found the museum to be well laid out in chronological order and to contain some really interesting pieces, well presented and well lit.",

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989. It specialises in International Economics and Administration, Law, and Architecture.\n\n\n=== Institutes and colleges ===\nThere are four BAS research institutes: Oceanology, Fisheries, Aero and Hydrodynamics, Metallography.

Over the past few decades, it developed as a festival centre of international standing. Varna is a front-runner for European Capital of Culture for 2019, planning to open several new high-profile facilities such as a new opera house and concert hall, a new exhibition centre, and a reconstruction of the Summer Theatre, the historic venue of the International Ballet Competition.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nVarna Archaeological Museum (founded 1888)\nNaval Museum (founded 1923)\nRoman Baths\nAladzha Monastery\nBattle of Varna Park Museum (founded 1924)\nMuseum of Ethnography\nNational Revival Museum\nHistory of Varna Museum\nHistory of Medicine Museum\nHealth Museum (children's)\nPuppet Museum (antique puppets from Puppet Theatre shows)\nBulgar Settlement of Phanagoria ethnographical village (mockup, with historical reenactments)\nAquarium (founded 1912)\nNicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium\nNaval Academy Planetarium\nMuseum of Natural History\nTerrarium\nVarna Zoo\nDolphinarium (founded 1984)\n\n\n=== Galleries ===\nBoris Georgiev City Art Gallery\nGeorgi Velchev Gallery\nModern Art Centre (Graffit Gallery Hotel)\nPrint Gallery\nNumerous smaller fine and applied arts galleries\n\n\n=== Performing arts professional companies ===\n\nOpera and Philharmonic Society (opera, symphonic and chamber music, ballet, and operetta performances;

          "Beautiful views, mini zoo, very cool for weddings and for takeing pictures. Fairytale castle and grate wine cellar.",
          "People here often say, that it is over priced, but if you understand the back story of this place, than you will end up absolutely amazed. Atmosphere is like fairy tale/fantasy/heaven. It is obviously still in the process of building, but I for one am curious to see it, when it",
          "The whole setting is completely marvellous, well sustained, but the only drawback is that u are not allowed to enter the castle on the inside. Worth the visit.",
          "We were sold this place by our travel rep and booked a trip from Simorets to visit it. I was initially impressed only to then discover the place is littered with rubbish and building materials. You can't go inside the castle. The main reason we wanted to go was to see the wine",
          "We had a senior and adult ticket for\u00a38odd which was a fantastic saving on the walk up price. The castle is amazing considering it's modern, don't miss the wine cellar!, with well tended gardens. Give yourself 2 - 3 hours to get round it all. We had a taxi from sozopol for",
          "Feel like a knight for a day! The castle is a fun attraction for all ages. Our family enjoyed walking the grounds and looking at the armor on display. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. A nice place for photos. Restaurant and coffee shop on site overlooking beautiful",
          "It is hard to believe. It really looks like a fairytale castle. It is definitely a must see for spending holidays in the area.",
          "Beautiful castle, quiet and interesting....from stone . A little zoo and a lake....souvenirs, food and a park....a nice place to go!",
          "My boyfriend loves castles and this was a surprise tour for me and so beautiful and great experience, was disappointed with the wine tasting though. Definitely worth a visit overall.",
          "It was excellent. It's the second time when i come here. My girl it's happy when she come here. I recomand Ravadinovo Castle.",
          "pay entrance price and then, surprise - wc 1 lev :D :D The palace and the garden are beautiful, oases middle of desert, around poor view",
          "Heaven on the earth. Really beautiful. You can spend all day there. The only disadvantage is that the prices for food are a little bit higher compared to other places. I would recommend it!",
          "Extremely overpriced place with no history or background whatsoever! I went there with my family, being misled by other people who told me it's a fantastic place to visit if I am in the area. We actually thought that you can go inside the castle and when we were approaching it,",
          "Don't waste your money or your time. I cannot say anymore about this God awful place . I am quite sure Bulgaria has much more to offer than this.....shame on Tui for including this as part of a very expensive excursion.",
          "Very disappointed, with this place! Reasons: All fountains are off, u pay to walk in an actuall garden! As the castle has no access also ever to any room! There isnt much to see but few trees... the way animal are treated is cruel( parrot abandoned on the sun with no water) poor",
          "Definitely a must visit! The palace and the garden are amazing. Everything is green, there are free animals walking around you. The cafes and restaurants although are a but pricy - EUR 6 for a simple sandwich is too much.",
          "Visited the Ravadinovo Castle during a day trip to Sozovol. Bought combination tickets from Neptune aquapark with entrance to the castle included. The castle it self though impressive is a little bit too \"artificial\" for my liking. The gardens though was impressive and lovely.",
          "Despite all its \"glory\" they cant care of dog, which is held in the back of the castle. All other animals looked good but not this dog, which looks like about 1 year old. He's having eye infection and about 2m long rope around his neck. He is also sleeping in own feces. They",
          "Went here purely for something to do, and the photos looked Nice. That literally is all it is, a photo opportunity. A \u2018fake\u2019 Castle and some fairly pretty gardens, a few dodgy animals stuffed into a corner. There isn\u2019t really anything to do, just walk around and take photos.",
          "We went without doing too much research, though as we approached it was clear that we were coming to a poor mans Disneyland. We were obliged as it is a \u2018tradition\u2019 (so not a marketing ploy) to have our photograph taken as we entered. I hate having my picture taken. We soon",
          "Came here as part of an organised trip. It was fine for what it was. The wine cellar was the most interesting place but didn\u2019t reckon much to the wine. Lovely gardens and different nooks and crannies to explore, the castle itself is not open which is a bit strange. A few cafe",
          "Overall experience was satisfying but we found it expensive for what it offers (ticket 20 leva per person - cash, no card) and you can only visit the exterior of the castle. Few options to eat at the restaurant and poor service. Spent about 100 leva with this visit but it's not",

          "This place is sold as a traditional castle as part of a TUI guided tour. It really doesn\u2019t know what it is meant to be. The only plus side is the gardens are beautiful. However if you fancy seeing animals being kept in horrible conditions and a replica Trevi Fountain that looks",
          "We took an organizaed trip to the castle (because it was pretty hard to get there with public transportation), It was a bit long ride by bus. The place itself is really nice - magical buildings and gardens - you can take a really lots of pictures there as a souvineer from your",
          "This was the first stop on a Tui day trip and I was pleasantly surprised. Of course you cannot see inside the castle itself but the grounds, lake and little hidey holes and grottos scattered around are quite beautiful. We only had 50 minutes at the Castle before moving on and",

But it doesn\u2019t take long to notice things aren\u2019t quite what they seem. The castle itself isn\u2019t open to explore - up close is in a poor",
          "The castle and it's grounds are amazing to look around! The areas in which you can enter at present are limited as it is currently all still under construction however the areas you can currently access are certainly worth the trip to see! We would have spent longer here",
          "This place is bonkers, presumably almost as bonkers as the owner must be. Its a truly bizarre place but if you take it at face value then you'll be impressed by what they're building here (even if looks like it might fall down five minutes after they finish it!) Not one to go",
          "The surroundngs are fabolous, but we were quite disappointed that at the price of 20 BGN it was not possible to get inside the castle. There is a place called \"winery\" which is pretty scary and thematic, but besides we could only walk around without getting in.",
          "This impressive modern castle is visible from a distance as you approach. The entrance fee is reasonable with Senior discount. You have to admire the man who's dream he made reality. A stunning castle with beautiful gardens and outside areas. Well worth a visit.",
          "Arrived at castle to find it was 20 Lev (\u00a310) to get in on walking round outside and not finding entrance to get inside castle we asked to be told inside closed might be open next year found it disappointing think should have been told before paid entrance grounds were lovely",
          "We viseted the Castle in hope that the escape room would be open, but it wasn't. We decided to check the Castle anyways. And we're glad we did! It was so beautiful! All the birds, horses, froggs and lama were great. So many exellent little details everywhere. Winecellar,",
          "On a cloudy day our family spent about 3 hours in Ravadinovo Castle. It was a pleasure both for adults and kids. Green, originally decorated, spacious territory, many hidden treasures to discover and enjoy. Peacocks and other birds impressed us a lot, they add grace to the",
          "The entrance fee is overpriced. Green spaces are good. Main Castle building is not finished. Only visit from the outside is possible. Wine cellar could do much more better.",
          "This is one of those places you can re-visit and enjoy many times. There's something mysterious and magical about it that captivates the imagination. Truly unique. I hope I'm still around and visiting Bulgaria if ever it gets to the stage where you can go inside the castle",
          "This is amazing place specially taking into account that in Sozopol and all surroundings nothing to see. If you are the tourist that do not want just to lie on the beach and just to swim in the sea Ravadinovo is like rescue. I love to walk in Sozopol but there is nothing",
          "Having just visited Sozopol on the way back to Burgas we saw the castle from the main road and made our way to the Castle on a road which is not suggested by Google to get to the castle but non the less made this a bit more of an adventure. Having reached the castle both my",
          "During my holiday i visited the castle twice, and both times I felt that I should have had one more hour. It nice and like a castle from the fairytale. Black, white and blackandwhite swans with \u00e5 lot of other birds was swinning around in the lake. I reccomend good shoes, not",
          "We last visited here in 2013 but decided to take our friends who have never been to Bulgaria before. As there were four of us, they only charged us for 3. It was near the end of the season. As expected, it wowed my friends. It is so over the top but still very beautiful. I",
          "We paid 14 lev each as part of a group, usually it's 20. 14 was too much to see the grounds only, you can't enter the castle. They even charge to use the loo! Some of the animals were badly looked after. The donkey was pleading for help, the rabbits in tiny cages, some of the",
          "We went here last year and found it interesting for an entry free of 9 Lev's.(5 Euros). it was well worth the cost and the driving time from Varna. We had heard that there had been some added attractions so we went back.this year. What a total disappointment the entrance fee",
          "We visited this castle as part of an organised trip. To be honest we hadn't paid in advance for entrance because it is a very poor relation to a fun park with the castle being a very modern build by a ????famous Bulgarian wrestler. There were no other plans made for us in the",
          "The castle grounds are beautiful and were lovely to walk around. I would've reviewed the castle much higher if it weren't for the poor condition of some of the animals there. It truly spoiled the visit to see the animals clearly weren't being looked after properly. Chickens",
          "Positive: A unique castle where one can see numerous examples of modern, soviet era, medieval and other tackiness. Might be a fun place for kids. Negative: - Way overpriced! The entry costs 20 BGN, which gives you just access to the park (not inside the castle, it's",
          "You have to visit this crazy place. A mixture of Disney, Harry Potter and every other castle you can imagine. Grounds are beautiful. Built by an ex-wrestler (I think) with a huge statue of said ex-wrestler dressed as a knight when you enter the grounds!! Well worth a vist.",
          "Stunning . This is one mans dream to build a fairytale and boy has he succeeded.Everything is over the top, big ,bold and in parts stunning . The wine cellar with its dining table is something to be seen . The chapel is quaint and the castle itself picturesque. My only gripe",
          "Worth a visit, but don't be disappointed if you don't get there. Simply a walk around the grounds. Sadly cannot go into the \"castle\"",
          "This used to be a very nice place. I\u2019ve visited a few times over the years, but the more popular it gets the less pleasant the experience. Too crowded...",
          "This is a recently built castle based on a children's fairy tale. Unfortunately you cannot go inside. It is built as a tourist attractions and won design awards in 2016. The structure is in the form of a crest pointing to the four cardinal directions of the world. It has",
          "A little strange place. Too much expensive to visit it. Mandatory photo at the entry with a knight , and of course you should pay if you want to take the photo after it. No chance to make a photo with personal camera with the knight. Additional tax for WC.",
          "You want to see a XVI century castle ? Go to Ravadinovo ! A musketeer is eager to great you ! And ladies in medieval garnements are curious to meet you !",
          "What a rip off. If you have children it could be good but be warned you cannot go in the castle, just walk around the outside. The gardens are ok but nothing fantastic. We were not told this was not a historic castle so were very disappointed.",
          "Nothing historical here, built for tourests 26 yrs ago, however we enjoyed the quiet cool environment, nice gardens and the kids who were around seemed to be enjoying it, About 15 mins from Sozipol 20lev entrance fee, but we went with Dafti Travel who charged 25lev which",
          "I am a big history buff but I knew before visiting that this site was of no historical significance. It is the equivalent of a British Victorian folly - it is like a medieval castle designed by a fan of Game of Thrones crossed with a fan of Disney princesses. The gardens are",
          "This so-called \"castle\" actually was build a few years ago, so don't be fooled this is some authentic place. Unfortunately spending a lot of money on something doesn't necessary equals great quality, so the result is kitschy, tasteless mix of who knows what styles. The nicest",
          "I may be being unkind, but just not my kind of place. It's lovely walking around, the gardens are done very well, but once that is done I wasn't really attracted to stay. Family liked though, guess it is something different with so much beach life around!",
          "Very lovely place and romantic on same time. Amazing things to see. Exotic animals and friendly staff",
          "The story behind the castle and its owner gives you an insight into what this castle is about. It's certainly not your everyday castle you will see in the UK. This is what it is... A fantasy castle made up of memories from childhood and built for the enjoyment of others to",
          "Visited by taxi from Sozopol, cost 15 lev each way. Quirky place with lovely gardens and interesting 'fantasy' architecture and statuary. Lovely gardens and plenty of photo opportunities. Food and drinks are available at several outlets, these are a little pricey but not",
          "This place reminded me of that scene in the Shrel movie when Shrek visits the palace of the King to find it running like a theme park. Weird place, odd vibe. Avoid.",
          "Maybe because we came with low expectations we found the place really nice. It was designed for taking pictures all over, beautiful sites and good ice cream.",
          "Seriously. Don't bother. Unless you like tacky horrendous awful trips out to look a gaudy junk don't bother. It's like someone from a sink hole council estate won the euro millions. If you image what bad taste would be if it was sick this it it. We came as part of a day",
          "Lovely grounds extortionate refreshment and gift prices. Could not go into the make believe castle which was disappointing",
          "Visited the castle on an unusually overcast day with our 6yo. Beautiful gardens, lovely places to eat and some great landscapes. The castle itself is amazing with fabulous statues and castings all around. Good way to spend a few hours. However, my son was looking forward to a",
          "Hired a car whilst on holiday and decided to visit here. Glad we did, it was lovely. Yes there was a bit if construction going on but didn't stop our enjoyment. Guess we spent a couple if hours here. Stopped and had some lunch in one if the wee eating places. We did have a good",
          "In general the castle look better than described, great for 4-10 years old kids. The tickets are little bit overpriced for the Bulgarian reality. People who did the construction work did great job, as well the people who keeps it in good shape now. Very disappointed from the",
          "Visited here recently whilst on a family holiday. If you have the mental image of a traditional castle with lots of history & heritage put that completely out of your head as this is definitely not what your be visiting. The castle itself whilst being essentially fake is made",
          "What an imagination this guy has. A wonderland. Only had an hour here due to excursion times but could have done many more hours. Wandering in the shade or sun. Around lakes. Many birds. magical place",
          "We have heard that this castle has won some price for an outstanding property but it actually it blew our minds. It's literally in the middle of nowhere and you can't believe it was never inhabited by nobles.",
          "A bit too Disneyland and you could not even go inside! The armor replicas were especially poor. Nothing like a real castle.",
          "Fantastic gardens with lakes.Black and white swans and also koi carp in them. The castle is one man's crazy idea of Gothic cum Hogwarts. Every turn has something to selfie with.couples with money get married there and in future it will have some hotel rooms for them.its 5 mins",
          "At first sight you would think Ravadinovo Castle had been here for ever, not so. It is purpose built and must have cost a fortune to build. Very reasonable prices and a short taxi drive from Sozopol.",
          "We visited this monstrosity as part of a day trip and couldn't wait to leave. The best part was the gardens, the house was closed, there were only pay toilets and the poor animals that were present were not well looked after.",
          "In the middle of nowhere, not finished, modern and expensive. Don\u2019t waste your money on a visit! I refuse to waste any more time on it!!!",
          "This is a must visit if you get the chance. Whilst it looks 18th? century it has only been built in the last few years. It is glorious with all sorts of nooks and cranies. The gardens are beautiful and there are lots of photo opportunities. This is a modern day folly that has to",
          "We have been coming here for several years, since it first opened. The gardens and lake are a fantastic place to relax in the sunshine. There are huge changes from when we first came and it just gets better and better",
          "We spent 2-3 hours here and really enjoyed wandering about taking photos. It\u2019s still very much a work in progress with pipes etc in view and building materials laying about but what has been done is lovely and the planting is very pretty. Favourite thing has to be the many",
          "Just a magical place to visit and see for ur selfs. This is the first summer I take my life to the bulgarian sea side and she is in love with 9 out of 10 places that we go to.",
          "And sadly let's Beautiful Bulgaria down! Should have done my research but got stitched right up as a gullible tourist!!! Drove past a couple of years ago and from a distance it looks amazing, however, as soon as you walk up to the gates dreams turn into reality........a",
          "Hats off to the owner, just like that building a medieval castle in a middle of a field. But, quickly summarizing - if You are an adult who has visited any real castle in Europe, there is no need to visit this one. Overpriced - 20lev admission fee per adult plus a 25lev for a",
          "Definitely something more for children than adults. Although it was cute, we wouldn't visit again. The castle was still under construction, but the gardens were beautiful. It definitely has a Disney feel to it, so I wouldn't recommend it for adults unless that's your thing.",
          "The castle was recommended to us by friends, so we decided to take it in when we visited Sozopol. To be honest I expected it to be rather kitsch but it really blew us away! The quality of some of the wood, stone and metalwork is really quite stunning! The place is still a work",
          "The reviews led us to believe this was a lovely castle with beautiful gardens. But on arrival we found a new Disney style castle, still under construction, and sadly wedged between a matching turreted water park and a half built housing estate. The gardens are not very big, are",
          "This place is well worth a visit. The Gardens are beautiful with loads of interesting things to see. It really is magical.",
          "Firstly book online the day before its half the price. On the day it's 20 lev each. Pretty castle but can't go in it. The charge of 1 lev for the toilet after the hefty entry fee is also an insult. 4 of us went 2 of us gave it a 2 rating, 2 a 3 rating. A booklet about the",
          "Worth the visit! The castle looking fantastic.. For 15 leva entrance fee you entering in fairytale..it's not usual castle from hundreds years ago,but looking like one.",
          "This place is unique for Bulgaria and it's so beautiful. It reminds me of the castles around Europe. You can't enter the castle itself, you can go around it, but I think it's more than enough. The gardens and the lake with swans are so beautiful and so peaceful, it's unreal.",
          "We visited this Castle in August 2017 with our children. IN summary it is nice but not worth paying the price. You can't enter the castle inside, but the gardens, cafes and the lake is lovely and offers some great views. We bought a few souvenirs in the tourist shop and one item",
          "Nice place to spend some couple of hours especially if you are much into photos and selfies :) nice scenario, the whole place looks authentic although it is a brand new castle;)",
          "Wonderful park with several thousand exotic trees, plants and flowers. Several deep-water freshwater lakes and waterfowl (white and black swans, pelicans and ducks). a fountain of desires. Bronze and marble sculptural compositions. Horse riding base for small and large horses.",
          "Really like it! A little bit experience but totally worth it. Perfect place for a summer walk. The castle is stunning and the gardens are marvelous.",
          "Absolutely gorgeous. A lot of attention was given to the details in this place. It's unfortunate that some of the writings are not translated but they are quite moving.",
          "When we visited you could not enter to the castle only outside The impression is like a Las Vegas hotel, the only difference is that in Caesar Palace, Venice or the the Mirage , there is no entrance fee and using the WC is free Unless you never been to Las Vegas, it's",
          "This is an example of a lack of history, art and taste. Ugly and expensive likeness of the cheap Hollywood movie decor. Perhaps it's fun for grown-up boys to play around his \"castle\" and \"gardens\" ....",
          "If you are on vacation in Sozopol, this castle is a must. It is located 10 minutes away from the beaches by car and it is magical. I recommend you to go in the morning, when there are still no crowds and you can make awesome pictures. There is free parking, the staff was very",
          "I'm in love with this castle. If u are nearly I recommend to visit it. Its beautifull and cheap. Great solo, for pairs or bigger groups.",
          "I have visited the castle a few times already and everytime that I return there, there is something new to see. I love how they continuously add pieces of art around the gardens. You can see great details, monuments, statues, a very beaufiful fountain, a lake and different",
          "The Ravadinovo Castle is indeed an unusual and nice place to visit with beautiful scenery. Unfortunately not only the entrance fee is 20 leva, but you have to pay additional 1 lev for WC.",
          "Wow what an amazing surprise! In all honestly we decided to visit this place as there seems little to do and see in Bulgaria (or at least according to the internet) and this place flagged up. Who does like a pretty castle and with two young girls it's good to get the out of",
          "Nice castle with very impressive garden. There have nice wine tasting room. Cosy atmosphere in the restaurant near the lake.",
          "This year I was horrified to see a caged fox! And we were all deeply effected by it -in particular my seven year old granddaughter. It spoiled the rest of our visit as we were extremely concerned for its welfare. I have been going to the castle nearly every year since it was",
          "I\u00b4 m little scared that someone can appreciate this \"piece of art\" seriously. I realy liked the owner who was lying in his sofa satisfied with his great masterpiece. Cute.",
          "We were a family of nine visiting the castle in July 2017. The entrance was 20 leva each which we thought was a bit overpriced. But we payed to see the beautiful castle from what we could see from the pictures. Remember cash, due they do not accept credit card. Well the",
          "A tiny fantasy castle still being built (and yes no history, cultural reason or the like), however you'll pay a lot to take the 10 minutes stroll on the premises. Not even open inside. They display a few animals who live under poor conditions. The mood of the people visiting",
          "As a visitor, you can't help but feel like the poor fox locked in its small cage (see picture): tricked and trapped by exploitative merchants.",
          "When I saw the animals at the pond, turkey and some waterbirds, I also saw a fox that was in a small cage with no food or water. Apparently they want to starve the fox to death because when it has escaped from his living enclosure, which is next to the birds, it has killed some",
          "I was very dissapointed when i saw a neurotic fox in a very little cage. This is not how it should be done! The entrance fee of 20 leu is too much for the worth you get.",
          "Came across this place by accident after taking a wrong turning on way to Sozopol, was quite strange to discover this in the middle of nowhere but thought we might as well take a look since we was there A few people on here moaning at the price to get in but we was asked for 10",
          "Before visiting the castle we were thinking that we can see inside the castle but the visit consist only gardens and pool. The castle has been constructed on 1996 and there is still some adding on the paysage.",
          "Our first mistake was not to buy tickets in advance as we paid 50 leva for 4 people and apparently the prettier one got in free! Gauche place but some fun in it all. Safety or lack of it quite ludicrous - e.g. Keep hold of kids near the 5m depth lake which had one hand",
          "The castle and garden are amazing, and well worth a visit. A bit high price to get in, but you get to see things not easily found elsewhere. Maybe best suited for children but adults should be able to enjoy themselves too. The road to the castle was dreadful! Almost destroyed",
          "The unique design and architecture of this modern castle are undeniable. How ever we went there for the Escape room and we were quite unsatisfied. The personal was quite opposite of hospital and the escape room wasn't something special. Reference: go there for the place, but",
          "It is worth seeing especially if you are near there. It is a fairytale atmosphere and we liked it much. The black swans are charming.also the gardens and flowers and the fountain. All is very nice.",
          "This castle is really good and pretty! This castle is really good and pretty!This castle is really good and pretty!",
          "Quite a kitsch place, but it's attractive. It's a big castle we could not get in. The garden is very nice. There is a lake. Peace walks quietly. There are other animals",

          "I was absolutely shocked that it smelled around animals which means no good care at all. Modern built parody of medieval castles.And definitely it's not Bulgaria! Not reasonable entrance fee of 10 BGN., please ask for a receipt .Just beautiful gardens and nothing else.",

          "Beautiful place , free entrance for children under 7 years. Romantic place for couples . Five minutes from sizopol.",
          "The castle was really beautiful. I think it's worth to take a walk around. It isn't finished yet so you can't go inside. There was only one toilet in the whole castle with long queue and you had to pay for it besides the entrance fee.",
          "This Castell is build few years ago in the middle of nowhere. It's extremely ugly mixture of styles in quite small place for this idea. It's not finished and tickets for this are quite high price. I don't recommend this stupid place!",

          "If you want to go back in time for a while or to enter the fairytale world this is the place to go. Nice terrace by the lake and all green and peaceful",
          "This fake castle looks good, but a bit tacky. Kids will definitely like it. Nice grounds. Cafe a bit expensive. Also the entrance fee seems rather high (10lv) considering you can't actually go inside the castle yet - as I understand it's not yet ready. So you're actually paying",
          "Where to start... it's a newly built replica castle, based on your classic fairytale design, with elements of Bulgarian, Thracian and Christian cultures added to the mix. It's a work in progress, so bits are still being built and you can't go inside the building. In theory",
          "We visit this 'castle' every year. Each time more work has been done on the building and grounds and it always looks better. Over time the entrance price has risen and this summer it was 10 lev for and adult. It is worth it. A beautiful castle building, lake and grounds.",
          "10lv entrance without getting a receipt so you already know they scam their employer. About the castle it looks very kitsch. Road towards it is horrible. Sandy and dusty parking. Fix this! Inside the complex it looked ok. U cannot enter the castle only walk around it. The",

          "The castle itself looks like it's from any princess movie, but it is too obvoius that it's just an empty shell.. The animals were a nice see for the kids, who luckily didn't have to use the toilets during our visit (the queue was probably 15-20 minutes). It was sad to see",
          "A crazy dream of some very rich but stupid man. All is mess and full of total nonsense and kitsch all over the place. Disney castle made by bulgarian poor copy-maker",

          "It is beauty, made for fun, for children - young and not so young. One must get off the road Bourgas- Primorsko either at the intersection ot Sozopol and then - sharp right, or (easier) just get off the next one -directly to Ravadinovo. The second one is easier for navigation,",
          "Newly bulit, but old feeling. Finished, but under construction. Characterized by dualities for me. If you have a free time, I think good to spend some hours here. Nice idea to create this building, but I'm curious to evolve in the future.",

          "I love the place. It is made beautifully. Definitely a must see. It is opulent and lush. You get the feeling that you are in a fairy tale. I have been there twice and they are making it better every year. Next year it will be even more amazing as the keep building and adding",

          "Well worth a visit. The grounds are extraordinary, and there are plenty of animals to look at, from swans and chickens to mules and horses. Even if you can't go inside the entry fee of 10lv is well worth it for the outside alone. 9/10, would come again.",

        "wiki": "Dobrich (Bulgarian: \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0447) (Romanian: Bazargic) is the eighth most populated city in Bulgaria, the administrative centre of Dobrich Province and the capital of the region of Southern Dobrudzha. It is located in the northeastern part of the country, 30 km west of the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, not far from resorts such as Albena, Balchik, and Golden Sands. In January 2012, Dobrich was inhabited by 90,375 people within the city limits. The city is named after the Bulgarian medieval lord of the surrounding region - Dobrotitsa. Agriculture is the most developed branch of the economy.\nDobrich Knoll on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Dobrich. A point of interest is the Dobrich TV Tower.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe city is named after the 14th-century Dobrujan ruler Dobrotitsa, from the Slavic root dobr, \"good\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first evidence of settlement in what is now Dobrich dates from the 4th or 3rd century BC. Under the Latin name Abrittum, it was a city of the Roman province of Moesia Inferior, important enough to become a suffragan bishopric of the Metropolitan of the capital, Marcianopolis, but the Catholic diocese faded later. Ruins from 2nd to 4th centuries AD and the 7th to 11th centuries have also been found, including a Bulgar necropolis featuring pagan graves in the centre of the city.\nDuring the 11th century, Pecheneg invasions devastated the interior of Dobruja, leaving many settlements in the region uninhabited at the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nThe settlement was founded for a second time in the 16th century by the Turkish merchant Hac\u0131o\u011flu Pazarc\u0131k, whose name it bore until 1882. According to Ottoman data from 1646\u20131650, there were over 1,000 houses in the city, about 100 shops, three inns, three Turkish baths, twelve mosques and twelve schools. From the 17th to the 19th century, the city developed as a handicraft, trade and agricultural centre, being famous for its weaving, homespun tailoring, coppersmith's trade, leather-work and agricultural products, such as wheat, linseed, wool and cheese. At the beginning of the 19th century, the city's population reached 12,000, many of whom refugees from eastern Bulgaria after the Russo-Turkish Wars. The cultural appearance of the city was also formed. The first Orthodox church was built in 1843. The city was liberated from the Ottoman Empire on 27 January 1878 and renamed Dobrich on 19 February 1882.\nAfter the Treaty of Bucharest of 1913 (confirmed by the Treaty of Neuilly of 1919), Dobrich and the whole of Southern Dobruja were incorporated in Romania for a period until 1940. During that time, the city bore the name Bazargic, which is a transformation of the earlier Turkish name Hac\u0131o\u011flu Pazarc\u0131k, and was centre of Caliacra County (jude\u021b in Romanian). On 25 September 1940, the Bulgarian army marched into the city after signing Treaty of Craiova on September 7, 1940; date celebrated as the city's holiday, later changed to September 25.\nIn 1949, during the period of Communist rule, Dobrich was renamed Tolbukhin (\u0422\u043e\u043b\u0431\u0443\u0445\u0438\u043d) after Marshal of the Soviet Union Fyodor Tolbukhin. On 19 September 1990, a presidential decree restored the city's old name of Dobrich. Despite the renewing of the name Dobrich architecturally maintains an ex-communist outlook even in the 21st century. The vehicle registration plate code for the region has also remained unchanged; it is the abbreviation TX (from \u0422\u043e\u043b\u0431\u0443\u0425\u0438\u043d; \u0422olbukhin).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\n=== Ecology ===\n\n\n==== Air ====\nIn the municipality of Dobrich, the quality of atmospheric air is monitored by the mobile station for emission control of the Regional Inspectorate for the Environment and Water Resources (RIEWR) - Varna. The station is equipped with automatic monitoring devices measuring the quantities of carbon oxide, ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfuric dioxide, and fine dust particles.\nThe municipality is implementing a program for decreasing the quantities of dust particles, which was adopted by the municipal council in 2003.\n\n\n==== Water resources ====\nSurface water resources are insufficient in the region, with often water shortages. The town is supplied with water from drill wells and water catchment areas located near the town. Eight pumping stations provide bacteria-free drinking water which does not need further treatment. The water sources are in constant operation. A security area surrounds each source, and the water distribution is controlled by computers. The municipality boasts a complete water supply network.\n\n\n==== Noise ====\nIn the municipality of Dobrich, there are three sources of noise - the industries, the households, and the construction works. Street noise is measured at over 20 sites. The high levels of noise in the industrial areas affect only the people working there. The levels of noise in the residential areas situated away from the town centre are quite acceptable, and the lowest levels can be found in the town parks.\n\n\n==== Green areas ====\n\nThe municipal Green System Plan examines the status of the existing urban and suburban green areas, as well as the variety of the plant species. The Green System includes the following categories of green areas: public parks and gardens, special parks and gardens, sanitary/protective greening, transportation greening (streets and roads), and limited-usage greening.\n\n\n==== Waste ====\nThe types of waste in the municipality can be defined as household, construction, industrial, and hazardous waste. Waste accumulation is around the average for the country. However, it is twice as much as that in the developed countries. The industrial waste is varied. Due to the economic crisis after 1989, industrial activity in the region subsided. In March 2000, the activities related to waste collection and transportation were taken over by Scheele Bulgaria, a wholly owned subsidiary of Scheele. All waste is dumped in the waste depot near the village of Bogdan, located about 5 km away from the town of Dobrich.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe general condition of Dobrich District cannot be described as good. GDP per capita is only 69% of the national average of BGN 9,359. Unemployment remains relatively high despite the marked revitalisation of the labour market in 2012. Household incomes are rising, but the companies show no optimism for the future.\nThe district has one of the most developed agricultural sectors in the country, generating nearly a quarter of all company revenues in the district. Mostly grain is grown, which also brings some negatives. Grain production does not create many jobs, and to some extent is the cause of nitrate pollution.\nThe population in the district has been decreasing at a faster rate than the national average, but still maintains a relatively positive age structure.\nEducation and health are inadequate. The rate of enrolment in schools has declined, while the number of dropouts is still high. In terms of medical services, there is a pressing need for specialists. Nearly 40% of those in need of treatment in the past 12 months have sought such treatment outside the district.\nThe district has potential for development, but there is a need for bolder reforms in the business environment.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nAgriculture is the most developed branch of the economy. The main reason for this is the environment \u2013 climate, soils and clean lands. 81% of all the land in Dobrich is agricultural, almost 4,000,000 decares. More than 70% of it is cultivated, which makes Dobrich \u21161 cultivated region in the country. Farming, plant-growing and stock-breeding are the most important part of the economy in Dobrich. Dobrudja territory, called the \u201cgranary of Bulgaria\u201d is part of the district. Some of the end products made in Dobrich are: bread and flour products, all kinds of sausages, milk and dairy products, poultry products, margarine and vegetable oils, wine, soft drinks.\nThe biggest bird-farm is located in the district. Other factories of great importance are the milk factory (one of the biggest factories in Bulgaria), the bread factory (one of the biggest factories in Bulgaria). Additional important products from other industries are cement, electric appliances, clothes, confection, furniture, car batteries, containers and there are many other factories from the food and beverage industry.\n\n\n=== Gasification ===\nThe municipal strategy provides that the household, utility and industrial sectors be supplied with gas under a project for gasification. The network of gas pipelines has been extended to 43,808 metres. Currently we are working on the gasification of the residential areas. All municipal establishments from the educational, administrative, healthcare and social service sectors have already been covered by the gas supply network.Communications Dobrich has six offices for postal services. They cover the whole territory of the town thus meeting the needs of the community for such services.\nThe municipality of Dobrich is wired by two local landline telecommunication networks which operate four analogue and one digital exchanges.\n\n\n== Population ==\nIn January 2012, Dobrich was inhabited by 90 375 people within the city limits, while along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages the population was 112 203 inhabitants. The number of the residents of the city (not the municipality) reached its peak in the period 1986-1991 when exceeded 110,000. The following table presents the change of the population after 1887.\n\n\n=== Ethnic and religious composition ===\nAccording to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 73,657 (87.5%)\nTurks: 6,795 (8.1%)\nGypsies: 2,482 (2.9%)\nOthers: 528 (0.6%)\nIndefinable: 708 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 6,860 (7.5%)Total: 91,030\nThe percentage of Orthodox Christians, according to the 2001 census data, is 86%, whereas around 10% of the population are adherents of the Muslim faith.\n\n\n==== Church \"St. George\" ====\n\nThe church is the oldest church from the Revival period in Dobrich. It is located in the center of the town, in the immediate vicinity of the Ethnographic house. The building is a cultural heritage site. It was built in 1864, on the spot of an older Christian church from 1843 that burned down during the Crimean War, together with the lower Bulgarian neighborhood.\nIn an architectural sense, the new church is a three-nave basilica. It was built with the donations of the Bulgarian population in Dobrich and the Dobrich district, in the courtyard of the great Bulgarian Revival figure Ivan Hadzhi Valkov. It is assumed that the church was made by unknown craftsmen who belonged or at least were familiar with the school of the famous Bulgarian master Kolyu Ficheto. The frescoes inside are made by Kozma Blazhenov, a representative of the Debar Art School, who also made the engraved iconostasis. The icons were painted by painters famous at the time \u2013 Nedko Todorovic from Zheravna, Haralambi Todorov from Pirdop and Nikolay Vasilev from Shumen. The church was consecrated in 1889 by Bishop Simeon.\n\n\n==== \u201cHoly Trinity\u201d Church ====\nThe \u201cHoly Trinity\u201d church is located in the center of Dobrich. The older church building that was situated at this place was built in 1859, to the left of the entrance of today\u2019s church. It was later joined by the first school in the town, where the mutual instruction approach was used.  The present church was built in 1911. Architecturally speaking, it is a classic three-nave basilica, a dome and a bell tower. The icons of its iconostasis were painted by Gospodin Zhelyazkov, a student of Repin.\n\n\n==== Armenian Church \u201cSaint Hovhaness\u201d ====\nIt was built in 1894, replacing an old temple from 1830. It was designed by Italian architects. It is a one-nave church with stone foundations and walls and a wooden roof. In the temple you can see original images of Armenian saints painted in the 19th century.\n\n\n=== Towns and villages ===\nThe Municipality of Dobrich has a special status - the territory of the municipality holds only the town of Dobrich with a population of 91030 people.\nTransport system\nThe road and communication network provides access to all parts of the region and to other regions in Bulgaria. Rail provides convenient and cheap travel to the capital city, the Black Sea coast, and to some European countries.\nStreet network\nThe street network has been expanded according to the detailed urban development plans and the particulars of the terrain. A ring road regulates the direct and the outgoing traffic to Varna, Albena, Balchik, General Toshevo, Silistra, Shumen and Russe. The street network of the town (total length 165 km, of which 60 km main streets) takes the incoming and the internal traffic.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\n\n=== The City Park St. George ===\nThe City Park St. George or the city garden as known among people of Dobrich is the most visited place in Dobrich by its citizens and guests. In the far year of 1867 Bildieto (the City Municipal Council) selects a place in the neighborhood of Karabokluka for establishment of the first city garden. An enormous contribution for development of the city-park art has the family of Gradinarovi. Its area is 430 dca and is divided into several sectors \u2013 \u201cThe Old Garden\u201d, Children\u2019s sector \u2013 a zone for games and fun, park lakes zone, zone of rock terrace gardens, sports zone etc. In 1999 the old garden of the city park is announced to be a monument of culture and garden park art.\nThe park is located immediately next to the central pedestrian zone in Dobrich. The park is one of the five oldest city parks in the country. It covers \u2013 the old garden, declared to be a cultural heritage site, a children's area, lakes, terraced rock gardens and a sports area. Even today the visitors can see some plant species imported from Europe at the beginning of the last century. The park hosts also one on the town museums, with a separate room for temporary and visiting exhibitions.\n\n\n=== Nature and Animal Protection Centre ===\n\nThe centre is the only one of its kind not only in Bulgaria but also in Eastern Europe. Founded under a Bulgarian-Swiss project, it boasts an area of 16 hectares, 50-year-old vegetation (trees and bushes), and a convenient access.\nThe zoo houses over 40 animal species - deer, roe, raccoon, alpaca, llamas, mouflons, goats, Przhevalski's horses, brown bears, bison, pheasants, storks, pelicans exotic and water birds, turtles, etc. - which live in conditions very close to their natural habitats.\nA priority for the zoo is the reproduction and re-introduction of endangered animal species.\n\n\n=== Dobrich TV Tower ===\nDobrich TV Tower houses broadcasting equipment for radio, television and telecommunications. It is 146 metres tall and built of reinforced concrete. The tower, which was designed by Petar Andreev, was completed in 1979 and has an observation deck open for tourists. It is also remarkable by its design.\n\n\n== Social institutions ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\nThe activities of the Department of \"Education and Culture\" in secondary education are conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Education Act, the regulations implementing the Education Act and are consistent with the educational policy of Dobrich Municipality. Educational policy in general considers socio-economic characteristics of modern society as well as prospects for future development. In this sense today it is important to reconsider the capacity of Bulgarian schools to respond to the new challenges adequately.\nThe existing school network in the city sufficiently meets the interests of young people as well as the needs of economy.\nAt this stage the territorial model meets the need of accessibility. There is a secondary school in each sub region of the city, which is near the students' place of residence. This allows free and compulsory education for all.\nThe manager's office, \"Humanitarian Activities\" - Section \"Education and Culture\" Dobrich, is the specialized authority for management of municipal kindergartens and schools. It is located at:\nDobrich, st. \"Nezvisimost\"  7\nNeicho Neychev - Head of \"Education and Culture\"\nAt the beginning of 2013/2014, the education network in the city of Dobrich includes 17 kindergartens, 7 elementary schools, 5 middle schools, 3 specialized schools,  7 vocational schools, a sport school, a subsidiary school, 2 private schools, student dormitories, a dormitory and Municipal Youth Center \"Zahari Stoyanov\".\nThe number of pupils in primary schools is 2362 and the number of classes 107.\nIn 5 secondary schools, a sports schools and 3 specialized high schools ar trained 6090 students in 265 classes. Profile subjects in the schools: Humanities, Sciences, Foreign Language and Technology. Profile subjects such as Music, Art and Sport are also available to choose.\nFrom the approved state plan for the admission of pupils on completion of seventh grade in local schools, including 16 classes were implemented 16. After completing basic education are formed 5 classes.\nIn market conditions vocational education in municipality is held in 7 vocational schools located in different areas of the city. During the school year 2013/2014 1598 students are trained in 26 majors and professions in 73 classes. Each professional school has its own building and facilities for practical training. Private schools in the territory of Dobrich are 2 with a total of 95 students in 16 classes.\n\nDistance Learning Centre of Technical University - VarnaProgrammes: Management, Industrial management, Business administration.\n\nUniversity of Shumen \u2018Ep.

          "This zoo is the perfect place to see some wild animals. The place is clean with good people looking for your wellness. You can take some vegitables and feed the animals with them. There's a cafe in front of the zoo so you can have a drink or go to the bathroom before going in.",

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989. It specialises in International Economics and Administration, Law, and Architecture.\n\n\n=== Institutes and colleges ===\nThere are four BAS research institutes: Oceanology, Fisheries, Aero and Hydrodynamics, Metallography.

Over the past few decades, it developed as a festival centre of international standing. Varna is a front-runner for European Capital of Culture for 2019, planning to open several new high-profile facilities such as a new opera house and concert hall, a new exhibition centre, and a reconstruction of the Summer Theatre, the historic venue of the International Ballet Competition.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nVarna Archaeological Museum (founded 1888)\nNaval Museum (founded 1923)\nRoman Baths\nAladzha Monastery\nBattle of Varna Park Museum (founded 1924)\nMuseum of Ethnography\nNational Revival Museum\nHistory of Varna Museum\nHistory of Medicine Museum\nHealth Museum (children's)\nPuppet Museum (antique puppets from Puppet Theatre shows)\nBulgar Settlement of Phanagoria ethnographical village (mockup, with historical reenactments)\nAquarium (founded 1912)\nNicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium\nNaval Academy Planetarium\nMuseum of Natural History\nTerrarium\nVarna Zoo\nDolphinarium (founded 1984)\n\n\n=== Galleries ===\nBoris Georgiev City Art Gallery\nGeorgi Velchev Gallery\nModern Art Centre (Graffit Gallery Hotel)\nPrint Gallery\nNumerous smaller fine and applied arts galleries\n\n\n=== Performing arts professional companies ===\n\nOpera and Philharmonic Society (opera, symphonic and chamber music, ballet, and operetta performances;

        "wiki": "Varna (Bulgarian: \u0412\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430, pronounced [\u02c8varn\u0250]) is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Varna, historically known as Odessos (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2), grew from a Thracian seaside settlement to a major seaport on the Black Sea.\nVarna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and headquarters the Bulgarian Navy and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated the seat of the Black Sea Euroregion by the Council of Europe. In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of European Youth Capital 2017.The oldest gold treasure in the world, belonging to the Varna culture, was discovered in the Varna Necropolis and dates to 4200\u20134600 BC.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nTheophanes the Confessor first mentioned the name Varna, as the city came to be known, with the Slavic conquest of the Balkans in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of Varangian origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching Constantinople in the early Middle Ages. In Swedish, the meaning of v\u00e4rn is \"shield, defense\" \u2013 hence Varna could mean \"defended, fortified place\". The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *u\u032fer- \"to flow, wet, water, river\" (cf. Varuna), or from the Proto-Slavic root varn \"black\", or from Iranian bar or var \"camp, fortress\" (see also Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria).\nAccording to Theophanes, in 680 Asparukh, the founder of the First Bulgarian Empire, routed an army of Constantine IV near the Danube delta and, pursuing it, reached \"the so-called Varna near Odyssos  [sic] and the midlands thereof\" (\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself. By the late 10th century, the name Varna was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrestled back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name Odessos. The latter is often said to be of Carian origin, though no modern scholarship supports this.\n\n\n=== Other places named Varna ===\nVarna Peninsula on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Varna.Varna, Illinois, a small town of 400 people, was named in this city's honour. The War of Varna was going on at the time.\nVarnensky District and its administrative centre in the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia are named in commemoration of the taking of Varna by the Russian army during the 1828\u20131829 Russo-Turkish War.Varna Drive, in Toronto, Canada, is named after Varna. There is also a hamlet in southern Ontario (Huron County) named Varna.\nVarna, an area just outside of Aarhus, Denmark.\nNamed after the city, because a former owner of Marselisborg estate, Baron Christian C. N. Gersdorff, had participated in Russian war service on the Black Sea coast.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nPrehistoric settlements best known for the Chalcolithic necropolis (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous Varna culture and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artifacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent karst springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the Middle Paleolithic or 100,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Thracians ===\nSince late Bronze Age (13th\u201312th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with Thracians. During 8th\u20139th c. BC local Thracians had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from Anatolia, Thessaly, Caucasus and the Mediterranean Sea. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze fibula of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical Cimmerians. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the tumulus dated 8th\u20137th c. BC found near Belogradets, Varna Province.\nThe region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. Pseudo-Scymnus writes: \"...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises.\" This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a Potter's wheel, bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th\u20134th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in Varna Province. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the Odrysian kingdom, Getae or Sapaeans\u2014large Thracian states existing between 5th\u20131st c. BC. Between 336\u2013280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by Alexander the Great.\nArchaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th\u20134th c. BC the region was populated with Scythians who normally inhabited the central Eurasian Steppe (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower Danube). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in \u201canimal style\u201d, which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horse heads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more Getae, which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the Danube Delta.\nCelts started populating the region after their invasion of the Balkan peninsula in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80 km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260\u2013216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.\nBetween the 2nd\u20131st c. BC in present Dobrudja land between Dyonissopolis (Balchik) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their \u201ckings\u201d minted their coins in mints located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.\nThe Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing\u2014especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable pateras and ritons.\nDespite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the Thracian horseman, who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as The Three Graces or the water Nymphs and Zalmoxis by the Getae.\nDuring the centuries, especially by the end of the Hellenistic period (2nd\u20131st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nOdessos or Odessus (Ancient Greek: \u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) is one of the oldest ancient settlements in Bulgaria. Its name appears as Odesopolis (\u1f48\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax; and as Odyssos or Odyssus (\u1f48\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2) in the Synecdemus and in Procopius. It was established in the second quarter of the sixth century BC (585\u2013550 BC) by Miletian Greeks at a present at that time Thracian settlement. The Miletian founded an apoikia (trading post) of Odessos towards the end of the 7th c. BC (the earliest Greek archaeological material is dated 600\u2013575 BC), or, according to Pseudo-Scymnus, in the time of Astyages (here, usually 572\u2013570 BC is suggested), within an earlier Thracian settlement. The name Odessos could have been pre-Greek, arguably of Carian origin. It was the presiding member of the Pontic Pentapolis, consisting of Odessos, Tomi, Callatis, Mesembria, and Apollonia. Odessos was a mixed community\u2014contact zone between the Ionian Greeks and the Thracian tribes (Getae, Krobyzoi, Terizi) of the hinterland. Excavations at nearby Thracian sites have shown uninterrupted occupation from the 7th to the 4th century BC and close commercial relations with the colony. The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in Thracian since at least the 5th century BC. \n\nOdessos was included in the assessment of the Delian league of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by Philip II (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his diadochus Lysimachus, against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to stong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of Mithridates VI of Pontus.\nThe Roman city, Odessus, first included into the Praefectura orae maritimae and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of Moesia (later Moesia Inferior), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, Thermae, erected in the late 2nd century AD (so called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was 100 m (328.08 ft) wide, 70 m (229.66 ft) long, and 25 m (82.02 ft) high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city. There is also the Small (South) Ancient Roman Thermae from the 5th\u20136th century AD. In addition, archaeologists in 2019 discovered ruins of a building of Roman thermae from the 5th century AD.Major athletic games were held every five years, possibly attended by Gordian III in 238.\nThe main aqueduct of Odessos was recently discovered during rescue excavations north of the defensive wall. The aqueduct was built in three construction periods between the 4th and the 6th centuries; in the 4th century the aqueduct was built together with the city wall, then at the end of the 4th to early 5th centuries when a pipeline was laid inside the initial masonry aqueduct. Thirdly in the 6th century an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous polis and under the Roman Empire from Trajan to Salonina, the wife of Gallienus, some of which survive.Odessos was an early Christian centre, as testified by ruins of twelve early basilicas, a monophysite monastery, and indications that one of the Seventy Disciples, Ampliatus, follower of Saint Andrew (who, according to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church legend, preached in the city in 56 CE), served as bishop there. In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as \"holiest city,\" sacratissima civitas. In 442 a peace treaty between Theodosius II and Attila was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the Vitalian revolt. In 536, Justinian I made it the seat of the Quaestura exercitus ruled by a prefect of Scythia or quaestor Justinianus and including Lower Moesia, Scythia, Caria, the Aegean Islands and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, magister militum per Thracias.\n\n\n=== Bulgarian conquest ===\nIt has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity\u2014possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2) by Justinian I\u2014before it moved to Pliska 70 kilometres (43 miles) to the west. Asparukh fortified the Varna river lowland by a rampart against a possible Byzantine landing; the Asparuhov val (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century Bulgar settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (campus tribunalis) established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nControl changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the Middle Ages. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal scriptorium of the Preslav Literary School at a monastery endowed by Boris I who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of Cyrillic script by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of Saints Cyril and Methodius' disciples. Karel \u0160korpil suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern\u2014Armenian, Syrian, Persian\u2014traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, Kaloyan took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on Holy Saturday using a siege tower, and secured it for the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nBy the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between Michael VIII Palaeologus and Genoa that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by Venetian and Ragusan merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby Provadiya). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the Varna perper, by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the Kamchiya river mouth.\nFourteenth-century Italian portolan charts showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between Constantinople and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region Zagora. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by Amadeus VI of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff Principality of Karvuna, then was taken over by the Ottomans in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to Manuel II Palaeologus in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by Tatars in 1414.\n\n\n=== Battle of Varna ===\n\nOn 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the Crusades in European history was fought outside the city walls.  Muslims routed an army of 20,000\u201330,000 crusaders led by Ladislaus III of Poland (also Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by sultan Murad II. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet Warne\u0144czyk (of Varna in Polish; he is also known as V\u00e1rnai Ul\u00e1szl\u00f3 in Hungarian or Ladislaus Varnensis in Latin). The failure of the Crusade of Varna made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a cenotaph of Ladislaus III in Varna.\n\n\n=== Late Ottoman rule ===\n\nA major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the Ottoman Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the Quadrilateral Fortresses (along with Rousse, Shumen, and Silistra) severing Dobruja from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the Russo-Turkish wars. The Russians temporarily took over in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged Siege of Varna, returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.\n\nIn the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation Filiki Eteria. \u0391t the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.\n\nThe British and French campaigning against Russia in the Crimean War (1854\u20131856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital Constantinople with Central Europe; for a few years, the Orient Express ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food\u2014notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket Southern Dobruja\u2014to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the National Revival; Vasil Levski set up a secret revolutionary committee.\n\n\n=== Third Bulgarian State ===\n\nIn 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the First Balkan War and the First World War; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913\u201316 and 1919\u201340). In the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the city in September 1944, helping cement communist rule in Bulgaria.\nOne of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labor movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain producing and viticulture centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, as well as the country's de facto summer capital with the erection of the Euxinograd royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.\nFrom 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 1962, the 15th Chess Olympiad, also known as the World Team Championship, was here. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th Olympic Congress took place in the Palace of Culture and Sports.\nVarna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the west until 1989. One of them, the veteran German Communist Otto Braun died while on a vacation in Varna in 1974.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city occupies 238 km2 (92 sq mi) on verdant terraces (Varna monocline of the Moesian platform) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height 356 m or 1,168 ft) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped Varna Bay of the Black Sea, the elongated Lake Varna, and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the Asparuhov most. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard 20 km (12 mi) north and 10 km (6 mi) south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake 25 km (16 mi) west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.\nThe urban area has in excess of 20 km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature 35\u201355 \u00b0C or 95\u2013131 \u00b0F). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.\nThe city lies 470 km (292 mi) north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are Dobrich (45 km or 28 mi to the north), Shumen (80 km or 50 mi to the west), and Burgas (125 km or 78 mi to the south-west).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nVarna has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfb), with mediterranean influences in summer but specially continental influences in autumn-winter.\nThe specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant. The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October. Temperatures in summer usually vary 27\u201330 \u00b0C (81\u201386 \u00b0F) during the day and between 17\u201318 \u00b0C (63\u201364 \u00b0F) at the night. Seawater temperature during the summer months is usually at the range 24\u201327 \u00b0C (75\u201381 \u00b0F). In winter temperatures are about 6\u20137 \u00b0C (43\u201345 \u00b0F) during the day and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) at night. Snow is possible in the coldest months, but can quickly melt. The highest temperature ever recorded was 41.4 \u00b0C (106.5 \u00b0F) in July 1927 and the lowest \u221224.3 \u00b0C (\u221211.7 \u00b0F) in February 1929.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nVarna is the administrative centre for Varna county (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, oblast, area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430, obshtina, borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: Kamenar, Kazashko, Konstantinovo, Topoli, and Zvezditsa, served by the city public transport system.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nThe municipal chief executive is the Mayor (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442, kmet: the word is cognate with count). Since the end of the de facto one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS (Union of Democratic Forces), ad interim, 1990\u201391; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991\u201399; Kiril Yordanov, independent, 1999\u20132013; Ivan Portnih, GERB, 2013\u2013present.\nThe City council (\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442, obshtinski savet, the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing Reformist Bloc Patriotic Front (Bulgaria), 6; centre-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 5; \"Varna\" Coalition including Attack, 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.\nThe Council chairman is Todor Balabanov (GERB).\n\nVarna regional court is one of the busiest courts in the country. The city also headquarters the district, administrative, and military court, and a court of appeal as well as regional, military, and appellate prosecutor's offices.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and urban planning ===\nThe city is divided by law into five boroughs (\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0438, rayoni), each with its mayor and council: Asparuhovo, Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories. The villages too have \u0430 mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (\u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a, kmetski namestnik).\n\nList of Varna City boroughs and districts\n\n\n=== Policing and crime ===\n\nVarna was rumoured to be the hub of Bulgarian organised crime. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.\nHowever, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called mutri (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007); in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nThere are consulates of the following countries:\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Norway, Russia \u2013 Consulate General, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nVarna is twinned with:\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nThe first population data date back to the mid-17th century when the town was thought to have about 4,000 inhabitants, while the first population census in 1881 counted 24,555. According to the 1883 census, it was the second-largest in Bulgaria after Ruse. Thereafter Varna became Bulgaria's third-largest city and kept this position steadily for the next 120 years, while different cities took turns in the first, second, and fourth places.\nIn January 2012, the city of Varna has a population of 334,781, which makes it the third-largest city in Bulgaria, while the Varna Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 343,643 inhabitants. The unofficial metro area (including Varna municipality and adjacent parts of Aksakovo, Avren, Beloslav, and Devnya municipalities, and excluding adjacent parts of Dobrich Province) has an estimated population of 475,000. Here, the \"Varna-Devnya-Provadiya agglomeration\" is not considered identical to the \"Varna metro area\".\nVarna is one of the few cities in Bulgaria with a positive natural growth (6300 births vs. 3600 deaths in 2009) and new children's day care centers opening (6 expected in 2009).Since December 2006, various sources, including the Bulgarian National Television, national newspapers, research agencies, the mayor's office, and local police, claim that Varna has a population by present address of over 500,000, making it the nation's second-largest city. Official statistics according to GRAO and NSI, however, have not supported their claims. In 2008, Deputy Mayor Venelin Zhechev estimated the actual population at 650,000. In December 2008, Mayor Kiril Yordanov claimed the actual number of permanent residents was 970,000, or that there were 60% unregistered people. In January 2009, the Financial Times said that \"Varna now draws about 30,000 new residents a year.\" The census, carried out in February 2011, enumerated 334,870 inhabitants.\nIf unregistered population plus the commuters from the adjacent municipalities are taken into consideration, the real population of the city during a work day reaches 400,000. Varna attracts 2 to 3 million tourists a year, as the holidaymakers may reach as many as 200,000 daily during the high season. Thus, there are about 600,000 people in the city in July and August.\n\n\n=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===\n\nMost Varnians (\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438, varnentsi) are ethnic Bulgarians (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, Russians and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate expatriates. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the Asparuhovo district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern Dobruja, Bessarabia, and Asia Minor, and later, of refugees from Macedonia, Eastern Thrace and Southern Dobruja following the Second Balkan War and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of Gagauz, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews remained for decades.\nAccording to the 1876 census of the Danube Vilayet in the Ottoman Empire, the population of Varna consisted of a plarality of Bulgarians (50%) and a minority of Muslims (over 40%). A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians (Gagauzes) who identified as Bulgarians.\nAccording to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the Turkish language was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36,25%), for 6721 was the Bulgarian (27,36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21,85%) and Tatar for 837 (3,41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:\nBulgarians: 284,738 (93.8%)\nTurks: 10,028 (3.6%)\nRomani: 3,162 (1.0%)\nOthers: 3,378 (1.1%)\nIndefinable: 2,288 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 31,276 (10.3%)Total: 334,781\nIn Varna Municipality 290,780 declared as Bulgarians, 11,089 as Turks, 3,535 as Romani and 34,758 did not declare their ethnic group.\nAccording to the 2001 census data, the ethnic composition was as follows:\nBulgarians: 296,407 (92.5%)\nTurks: 12,295 (3.8%)\nRomani: 3,748 (1.2%)\nOthers: 4,566 (1.4%)\nIndefinable: 2,406 (0.8%)\nUndeclared: 1,042 (0.3%)Total: 320,464\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEconomically, Varna is among the best-performing and fastest-growing Bulgarian cities. In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450\u20ac) per month.\nThe economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction. Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of Pan-European transport corridor 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation (Navibulgar, Port of Varna, Varna Airport), distribution (Logistics Park Varna), shipbuilding (see also Oceanic-Creations), ship repair, and other marine industries.\nIn June 2007, Eni and Gazprom disclosed the South Stream project whereby a 900-kilometre-long (559-mile) offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's Dzhubga with annual capacity of 63 billion metres (207 billion feet) was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.\nWith the nearby towns of Beloslav and Devnya, Varna forms the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex, home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and Sodi Devnya, the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.\n\nTourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of Golden Sands, Riviera Holiday Club, Sunny Day, Saints Constantine and Helena attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international cruise destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists\nThe highest building in the city is Interhotel Cherno More at 72.2 meters.\nReal estate boomed in 2003\u20132008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer Piccadilly, the famous restaurant chain Happy and pharmacy chain Sanita. Mall Varna ,Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.\nThere is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System.\nIn 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded \"Best city to live\" and \"Protector of History\".\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nVarna is accessible by air (Varna International Airport), sea (Port of Varna Cruise Terminal), railway (Central railway station), bus, and road.\nMajor roads include European roads Varna \u2013 Bucharest E70, Varna \u2013 Istanbul E87 and Varna \u2013 Constanta, Romania; national motorways Varna \u2013 Sofia A2 (Hemus motorway) and Varna \u2013 Burgas A5 (Cherno More motorway). \nThere are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and roll-on/roll-off services to Odessa, Ukraine, Port Kavkaz, Russia, Poti and Batumi, Georgia.\nThe public transport system is managed by \"City Transport Varna\" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50\u20ac) for city zones to 3lv (1.50\u20ac) for routes Varna \u2013 Golden Sands. Along with local buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nCity landmarks include the Varna Archaeological Museum, exhibiting the Gold of Varna, the Roman Baths, the Battle of Varna Park Museum, the Naval Museum in the Italianate Villa Assareto displaying the museum ship Drazki torpedo boat, the Museum of Ethnography in an Ottoman-period compound featuring the life of local urban dwellers, fisherfolk, and peasants in the late 19th and early 20th century.\nYou can see the highlight landmarks using Varna City Card \u2013 it combines all essential cultural locations, gives many discounts to tourists in restaurants and bars, and overall saves money.\n\nThe 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), Varna Aquarium (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boat house and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by Yuri Gagarin and other Soviet and Bulgarian cosmonauts. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.\nThe waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and chalga. In October 2006, The Independent dubbed Varna \"Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria\". The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as July Morning and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti) venues.\n\nThe city beaches, also known as sea baths (\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438, morski bani), are dotted with hot (up to 55\u00b0\u0421/131 \u00b0F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the 2.05 km (1.27 mi) long, 52 m (171 ft) high Asparuhov most bridge is a popular spot for bungee jumping. Outside the city are the Euxinograd palace, park and winery, the University of Sofia Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the Pobiti Kamani rock phenomenon, and the medieval cave monastery, Aladzha.\nTourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.\nFood markets, among others, include supermarket chains Billa, Kaufland and Metro. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.\nLike other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, for the most part calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nNotable old Bulgarian Orthodox temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki Preslav); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the St. Athanasius (former Greek metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century St. Petka Parashkeva chapel; the seamen's church of Saint Nicholas; the Archangel Michael chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. Constantine and Helena church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.\nThe remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed in situ. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.\nThere is an Armenian Apostolic church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving Evangelical Methodist episcopal church offering organ concerts, active Evangelical Pentecostal, Seventh-day Adventist, and two Baptist churches.\nTwo old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a Sephardic and an Ashkenazic one, the latter in Gothic style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent Muslim Roma neighbourhood.\nThere is also a Buddhist centre.\nOn a different note, spiritual master Peter Deunov started preaching his Esoteric Christianity doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899\u20131908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nBy 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes. It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.\nToday, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Baroque, Neoclassicism, Art Nouveau and Art Deco (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).\nStone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.\nDuring the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the Palace of Culture and Sports, built in 1968.\nWith the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (\u043b\u043e\u0437\u044f, lozya), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or villa into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched postmodernist kitsch of the Villa Aqua.\nWith the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of shanty towns, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in Romani neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.\nThe beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 2016, Varna was home to over 37,000 students.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\nUniversity of Economics, founded on 14 May 1920 as the Higher School of Commerce, is the second oldest Bulgarian university after Sofia University. It is the first private one\u2014underwritten by the Varna Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prof. Tsani Kalyandzhiev, University of Zurich alumni and a research chemist in the United States, was university's first rector (principal).\nNikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy is the oldest technical educational institution in Bulgaria. The institution started as a Maritime School, established in 1881 in Ruse. After 1900 the now called Engineering School to the Fleet was moved to Varna and subsequently named as His Majesty's Naval Academy in 1942. In 1949, the Naval School adopted as its patron Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet, who graduated the school in 1926, and received the name N. Y. Vaptsarov People's Naval School.\nMedical University Varna was established in 1961 and is a recognised abroad as a leading institution for quality medical education. The university has attracted students from 44 countries and is partnering with 85 foreign institutions across the globe.\nTechnical University of Varna was found in 1962 and was first established as Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Institute.\nChernorizets Hrabar Varna Free University, found in 1991, was the first private university after 1989. It specialises in International Economics and Administration, Law, and Architecture.\n\n\n=== Institutes and colleges ===\nThere are four BAS research institutes: Oceanology, Fisheries, Aero and Hydrodynamics, Metallography.

Over the past few decades, it developed as a festival centre of international standing. Varna is a front-runner for European Capital of Culture for 2019, planning to open several new high-profile facilities such as a new opera house and concert hall, a new exhibition centre, and a reconstruction of the Summer Theatre, the historic venue of the International Ballet Competition.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nVarna Archaeological Museum (founded 1888)\nNaval Museum (founded 1923)\nRoman Baths\nAladzha Monastery\nBattle of Varna Park Museum (founded 1924)\nMuseum of Ethnography\nNational Revival Museum\nHistory of Varna Museum\nHistory of Medicine Museum\nHealth Museum (children's)\nPuppet Museum (antique puppets from Puppet Theatre shows)\nBulgar Settlement of Phanagoria ethnographical village (mockup, with historical reenactments)\nAquarium (founded 1912)\nNicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium\nNaval Academy Planetarium\nMuseum of Natural History\nTerrarium\nVarna Zoo\nDolphinarium (founded 1984)\n\n\n=== Galleries ===\nBoris Georgiev City Art Gallery\nGeorgi Velchev Gallery\nModern Art Centre (Graffit Gallery Hotel)\nPrint Gallery\nNumerous smaller fine and applied arts galleries\n\n\n=== Performing arts professional companies ===\n\nOpera and Philharmonic Society (opera, symphonic and chamber music, ballet, and operetta performances;

Varna Airport is the third largest airport in Bulgaria. It is located 10 kilometers from the center of Varna near the town of Aksakovo. The airport serves Varna, Golden Sands and northeastern Bulgaria. The busiest season for the airport is from the end of May to the beginning of October.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the airport dates back to 1916 when two sheds for the first hydro-port in Bulgaria were built in the Peinerdzhik area (present-day Chaika residential area). Irregular mail-plane service from Sofia to Varna was held between 1919 and 1920 and it was not until 1947 that a permanent airline between the two cities was established. What had grown into Tihina Airport was situated west of the present-day Asparuhov bridge and was indeed quite primitive for the demands of a modern city. Thus in 1946 a decision was made and a new airport was constructed several kilometres west of the city, near the village (now town) of Aksakovo, with local people enthusiastically working on the site together with the constructors. Construction and improvement continued throughout the years, with a new terminal built in 1972 and a new runway in 1974.In 2013, a new passenger terminal opened and the one constructed in the 20th century was closed down.\nThere are domestic and international flights from Varna to about 70 destinations in 25 countries, with Bulgarian and foreign airlines. The airport is close to the Port of Varna and the railway system. The airport has one asphalt-covered runway 09/27 with ILS CAT I system on 09 edge and a parking apron for 24 aircraft.\nIn June 2006 the Bulgarian Government awarded Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide a 35-year-long concession on both Varna and Burgas airports in return for investments exceeding \u20ac500 million, including a new passenger terminal by 2008.\nFrom 15 October 2011 until 28 February 2012, Varna airport was closed for a reconstruction of the runway. All flights were operated to/from Burgas Airport.In 2016 the airport handled 1,689,595 passengers - a 20.8% increase compared to 2015.\n\n\n== Terminals ==\n\nThe airport has three terminals: Terminal 1, built in 1972 (closed), Terminal 3 (opened in June 2007), which was used during the summer season, and the new Terminal 2, opened in August 2013.\n\n\n=== Terminal 1 ===\nTerminal 1 (closed) was extended several times over the years. The departures area had 21 check-in counters and six security checkpoints. In the terminal there were various outlets: cafes, fast food restaurants, currency exchange, and duty-free shops. There were ten boarding gates. The arrivals area had two luggage belts, as well as currency exchange and a tax-free shop. Terminal 1 still has a VIP room and business lounge. In 2010 the VIP room was renovated. As of 2014, all flights, including no-frills, are managed by Terminal 2. Hence, the old terminal is closed except the VIP area.\n\n\n=== Terminal 2 ===\nTerminal 2 started operations on 18 August 2013. In December 2011 the construction work on the new Terminal 2 began. T2 has a capacity of 1,800,000 passengers per year and 25 check-in desks. It covers an area of 18,000 square metres. T2's buildings are designed so that their capacity can be increased as an extension to the existing architectural part. The first passenger service on T2 was a domestic flight to Sofia operated by the national carrier Bulgaria Air and first international passengers served were on a Belavia flight from Minsk. T2 was designed by London-based architecture firm Pascall+Watson.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Varna Airport:\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n=== Traffic ===\n\n\n== Ground transport ==\nBus line 409 connects the airport with Varna city center and resorts nearby (route: Varna Airport \u2013 Mall Varna \u2013 Varna Bus Station / Grand Mall \u2013 City Center \u2013 Saints Constantine and Helena - Golden Sands).\n\n\n== Incidents and accidents ==\nOn 5 June 1992, Balkan Bulgarian Airlines Tupolev 154B overran runway 27 in bad weather conditions. There were no casualties, but the plane was written off.\nOn 24 May 2013, Air VIA flight 502 from Leipzig/Halle to Varna overran runway 09 at Varna Airport after touchdown. Two passengers were injured during evacuation.\nOn July 8, 2014, Lars Mittank, a German student vacationing in Golden Sands, mysteriously disappeared near Varna Airport. Mittank had been alone in Bulgaria the previous two days and reported to be behaving strangely, and was last seen on security cameras fleeing from the airport into the surrounding forest.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of airports in Bulgaria\nList of airlines of Bulgaria\nList of the busiest airports in Europe by passenger traffic\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Varna Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nVarna Airport Homepage\nHistory of Varna Airport",

        "wiki": "F.lli Pinfari S.r.l was an Italian amusement ride manufacturing company based in Suzzara, Italy. Pinfari was liquidated on 15 July 2004, due to the early 2000s recession and the weakness of the United States dollar. In 2007, its brand and intellectual property were acquired by Interpark Amusements Srl, based in Modena.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe company, commonly known as Pinfari, was established in 1926 building Dodgem cars and buildings. Its first roller coaster was a wild mouse-style ride in 1954 called \"bob-slide\". In 1965 the company introduced a small portable coaster called Zyklon. These coasters proved very popular with traveling fairs and carnivals as wells as permanent amusement parks. Pinfari manufactured Zyklons in several variations and sizes, building over 200 since the ride's introduction. The models were designated Z40, Z47, Z64 and Z78 \u2014 \"Z\" representing Zyklon and the number representing the length of the coaster base in meters (i.e. the footprint of a Z47 is 47 metres (154 ft) by 18.5 metres (61 ft)). In the 1980s Pinfari added loops to the Zyklon model and marketed them as a Looping Zyklon or Looping Star. The model designation added the letter \"L\" sometimes next to the Z and sometimes after (i.e. ZL42, ZL50 or Z47L). The company also manufactured a popular children's coaster called Big Apple, nearly identical in design to Wacky Worms and Brucomela coasters by Preston and Fabbri.\nIn the late 1990s Pinfari introduced a new model to eventually replace the Zyklon, although the Zyklon was still offered in the ride catalog. Known simply as Roller Coaster or Thriller Roller Coaster, these models were designated RC48, RC50 or RC70, with the larger RC70 having two loops and a corkscrew. The company also introduced a large non-looping family coaster designated FC80. The first RC70 was installed at M&D's Theme Park in Scotland. The first and only FC80 was built at Wiener Prater in Austria.Pinfari continued to expand its product line offering a junior inverted coaster in 1999 and a suspended looping coaster, with the first two suspended looping models going to Nigloland in France and Moreno's Park, a traveling show in Brazil.\n\n\n== List of roller coasters ==\nAs of 2019, Pinfari has built 186 roller coasters around the world.\n\n\n== References ==\n\ncirca 1997 F.LLI Pinfari ride catalog\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nProfile of Pinfari at the Roller Coaster DataBase",

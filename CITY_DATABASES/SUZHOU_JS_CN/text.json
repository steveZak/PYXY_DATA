        "wiki": "The Humble Administrator's Garden (Chinese: \u62d9\u653f\u56ed; pinyin: Zhu\u014dzh\u00e8ng yu\u00e1n; Suzhou Wu: Wu Chinese pronunciation: [tso\u0294 tsen \u0266y\u00f8]) is a Chinese garden in Suzhou, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most famous of the gardens of Suzhou. The garden is located at 178 Northeast Street (\u4e1c\u5317\u8857178\u53f7), Gusu District.\nAt 78 mu (\u4ea9) (5.2 ha; 13 acres), it is the largest garden in Suzhou and is considered by some to be the finest garden in all of southern China.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn the garden's site was first built a garden during the Shaoxing period (1131-1162) of the Southern Song Dynasty. Afterwards it changed ownership, and was destroyed or modified continually. It was the residence and garden of Lu Guimeng, a Tang Dynasty scholar. Later in the Yuan Dynasty it became the Dahong Temple's garden.\nIn 1513, Wang Xiancheng, an Imperial Envoy and poet of the Ming Dynasty, created a garden on the site of the dilapidated Dahong Temple which had been burnt during the Ming conquest.  In 1510, he retired to his native home of Suzhou on the occasion of his father's death. He had experienced a tumultuous official life punctuated by various demotions and promotions, and gave up his last official post as magistrate of Yongjia county in Zhejiang province, and began to work on the garden. This garden, meant to express his fine taste, received close attention from the renowned artist, Suzhou native, and friend, Wen Zhengming. The garden was named (first evidence around 1517) after a verse by the famous scholar official of the Jin Dynasty, Pan Yue, in his prose, An Idle Life, \"I enjoy a carefree life by planting trees and building my own house...I irrigate my garden and grow vegetables for me to eat...such a life suits a retired official like me well\". This verse symbolized Wang's desire to retire from politics and adopt a hermit's life in the manner of Tao Yuanming. In the Xianju rhyme-prose, he writes 'This is the way of ruling for an unsuccessful politician'.  It took 16 years until 1526 to complete.  Wen Zhenming wrote an essay Notes of Wang's Humble Administrator's Garden, and painted Landscapes of the Humble Administrator's Garden in 1533 including 31 paintings and poems to commemorate the garden. Wen produced a second album of eight leaves showing sites in the garden in 1551, with different views but the same poems as in 1533.\n\nWang's son lost the garden to pay gambling debts, and it has changed hands many times since.  In 1631 the eastern garden was divided from the rest and purchased by Wang Xinyi, Vice Minister of the Justice Board.  He added many modifications over the next four years, finishing work in 1635.  After completion it was renamed Dwelling Upon Return to the Countryside (\u6b78\u7530\u5712\u5c45).  The central garden was purchased by Jiang Qi, Governor of Jiangsu in 1738. After extensive renovations he renamed it Garden Rebuilt. In 1860, it became the residence of a Taiping prince, Li Xiucheng, and it was remodelled, and the current aspect of the garden is said to be inherited from this period. Also in 1738 the Western Garden was purchased by Ye Shikuan Chief Histographer, and renamed The Garden of Books.  The Garden of Books was purchased by a Suzhou merchant, Zhang L\u00fcqian, in 1877 and renamed The Subsidiary Garden.  In 1949 all three parts of the garden were rejoined by the Chinese government and subsequently opened to the public, then restored in 1952.  In 1997 the garden was given UNESCO World Heritage status.\nCao Xueqin, author of the Dream of the Red Chamber, is supposed to have lived at the garden during his teenage years \u2013 around 1735.  Among Chinese scholars, it is believed that much of the garden in his novel Dream of the Red Chamber was inspired by the scenery of the Humble Administrator's Garden.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe garden contains numerous pavilions and bridges set among a maze of connected pools and islands. It consists of three major parts set about a large lake: the central part (Zhuozheng Yuan), the eastern part (once called Guitianyuanju, Dwelling Upon Return to the Countryside), and a western part (the Supplementary Garden). The house lies in the south of the garden.  In total, the garden contains 48 different buildings with 101 tablets, 40 steles, 21 precious old trees, and over 700 Suzhou-style penjing/penzai. According to Lou Qingxi, compared with the layout from the Zhenghe Period in the Ming Dynasty, the garden \"now has more buildings and islets\", and although lacks a \"lofty\" feeling, it is \"still a masterpiece of meticulous work\". Liu Dunzhen judged that the arrangement of rocks and water in the ponds of the central third may have its origins in the early Qing. The western third retains the late nineteenth-century layout, while the eastern third has seen several renovation since. But Clunas believes that even this is unreasonably optimistic, and he underlines that Liu Dunzhen and others tend to imply that, \"despite the vicissitudes of history, there is continuity at the much more important level of essence\".Xue Zhijian, the curator of the garden and of the Suzhou Garden Museum, explained the exquisite design and aesthetic value of the Humble Administrator's Garden, the largest of Suzhou's gardens. \"This style of Suzhou old style garden has numerous layers,\" Xue says. \"There are four particular components: the stone, the plant, the architecture and the water.\" And these are woven together in endless combinations. \nAt one corner in the Humble Administrator's Garden, rocks cutthrough the wall, making viewers feel like they are exploring a mountain, despite the fact that they are in the middle of the city. The plants here represent various seasons, peonies for spring, lotus for summer, osmanthus in the winter time and plum blooms in winter.Eastern Garden: Composed of a few buildings around a central great lawn and pond combination.  The lawn is ringed by a grove of crape myrtle trees in allusion to the Tang Dynasty State Secretariat which was nicknamed the Crape Myrtle Department.\nCentral Garden: This section is composed of many scenes arranged around the \"Surging Wave\" Pond.  Within the pond three islands recreate the scenery of the fairy islands of the east sea (see Penglai).\nWestern Garden: This part is only half the size of the central part, and is also mainly dominated by water. The pond runs from north to south, and at the central part rises an islet. Although small, it is planned with meticulous care and precision. The buildings, though numerous, do not clutter, small mountains and ponds do not give a cramped impression.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese garden\nSuzhou\nWorld Heritage Sites in China\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBibliography on Gardens in China: Sources in Western Languages",

          "Well maintained and super scenic. We were lucky as it was not super busy. Nice place to relax and walk about just taking in the beauty. Quite a drive from Shanghai but if you have a day it will be nice. Maybe not a must see but one of the better gardens. Loved it.",
          "This is a beautiful but well known garden. Chinese tourists are very keen on this type of thing and are there in great numbers. Advise to get there early",
          "Went in March, no flowers, crowded, and generally not that spectacular. Suzhou was generally a disappointment.",
          "We visited this garden last month and were really disappointed. It was not worth the 90rmb we paid to get in AT ALL. It was incredibly boring - nothing that interesting to see, and so over-crowded. There are much better things to do in Suzhou, like visiting Shan Tang Street (SO",
          "We made a day trip by train from Shanghai to Suzhou, specifically to see this UNESCO World Heritage Site and were not disappointed. The beautifully maintained 12.8-acre garden continually held our interest with pavilions, greenery, flowers, rock formations, water features,",
          "An immaculate and beautiful garden with exquisite buildings, water features, bridges and rock features. Great bonsai garden too.",
          "The place was too crowded. Can't take good pictures \u2026 too many people in the background. The sceneries were very nice though.",
          "A great historic garden. A sea of tranquility in a busy city, although it can get busy. To avoid the crowds get there early. The Bonsai trees are amazing. Spend a morning in the garden and then walk the Pingjiang Road afterwards, its only a couple of mis from the exit. Well",
          "A very large garden (I think that the biggest in Suzhou) and full of buildings, ponds and plants. It is also the most famous which makes it VERY crowded. So, my recommendation is to go early to this garden and later go to another of the smaller gardens (but also worth a visit)",
          "Biggest garden in Suzhou, so expect to take some time to walk around the whole place...maybe 2-3hours if you want to see everything and take pictures everywhere. Also, if you have a infant / baby / toddler who needs to use a stroller...there are many steps / uneven rocky ground",
          "Definitely a must if you are visiting Suzhou. Probably better to get there in Spring but the garden is nice whatever the season.",
          "We where here a golden week in a cue- probably about 3000 people. Maybe because we didn\u2019t came at 7.30 - go early- we didn\u2019t get to see anything",
          "I went to this attraction yesterday. It was horribly overcrowded with thousands of tourists. It might be decent if you go when there aren't many people,but good luck with that.",
          "Went here with a tour group. We don\u2019t understand what the tour guide is saying as i was in chinese. Haha. So we separate from the group and see the place by ourselves and took pictures of the place. Feels like living in an ancient China. Please avoid summer as you can\u2019t take",
          "This is a lovely garden with lovely lake and buildings and covered walkways, beautifull plants, a very relaxing place to visit",
          "It\u2019s amazing how peaceful and quiet it is as soon as you enter a garden in China. Even though, there are many tourists inside you can easily stroll through the footpaths and enjoy the quietness. I found the bonsai garden especially beautiful.",
          "An amazing site, well worth visiting especially during flower blooming season. During my visit it was overcrowded with tourists that somewhat spoiled otherwise beautiful and calming atmosphere of the area.",
          "This is a beautiful garden. It may be a bit crowed so leave time to see everything. The crowds can be a bit annoying if you are looking to relax, but it is worth seeing these beautiful structures.",
          "After going thru the garden, i realized that this administration isn't humble. Instead, greedy would be a more suitable word. After all, the garden is large. Only a greedy person would want more land for gardening. It's an okay garden, but consider how old it is, i would say",
          "There were thousands people in the garden at anytime. That means there is no harmony between human and nature, how could you admire and appreciate the Garden design and all other details? I paid 90 Yuan (around $15) admission to get in and rushed to the exit directly.",
          "Magnificent gardens, clean, lots af people, spectacular pagodas. Lakes and canals, lots of Lotus plants, easy walk along paved walkways.",
          "The great reputation of Suzhou as a paradise on Earth is certainly realized at this fanciful and culturally rich heritage destination. Visitors here can easily see how the historic district was listed with UNESCO. One of the largest gardens in this city of green spaces, the",
          "Nice garden to walk around but nothing amazing. Went on a Thursday afternoon and was quite busy but not too overcrowded. May be better at different times of the year. You could spend a couple of hours here.",
          "We visited the Humble Administrator's Garden as part of a trip that included Beijing, Chengdu, Suzhou, and Shanghai. I've seen the main destinations in Beijing (Forbidden City, Great Wall at Mutianyu & Badaling, Temple of Heaven, Hutongs), but these gardens really stand out in",
          "The garden is a piece of paradise in Suzhou. There are various galleries/ structures, each having a particular significance. The flora around is just excellent. It is very well maintained, being a UNESCO world heritage site but overrun with selfie stick holding tourists on",
          "Suzhou is rich in history and one of those gems is the Humble Administrator\u2019s Garden - what is really nice is that the Chinese people are taking great care of their history and gardens like these. A reminder that you need to provide your passport when buying a ticket. If you",
          "The Humble Administrator's Darden is a Chinese styled garden, even though during the summer there are a lot of people, you can still feel the atmosphere in the garden and the environment there is beautiful and comfortable.",
          "The Humble Administrator's Garden is a marvel and wonder of China. Our family completely enjoyed our visit and in fact we were blown away (even the 9 and 11 year old) by the size, scope, beauty and sense of history and contemplation that the Garden provides. We couldn't stop",
          "Lovely garden with a large selection of bonsi trees A fab place to relax and sit to watch the people go by",
          "I visited on a week day so less crowded than at the weekend. Well worth the admission, the gardens are magnificently laid out with many limestone and plant features. The lotus were blossoming which added to the beauty but best of all was the bonsai garden, some truly spectacular",
          "It was a hot and humid summer day in Suzhou, but no one seemed mind the weather. People everywhere and crowded at some points. The garden is a historic site and a must see, but the weather and jam packed people really reduce the desires to revisit the place.",
          "Must visit when you are in Suzhou. Intricate cobble walkways (look down for the colorful dragonfly, turtle,..), zig-zag foot bridges, bonsai gardens,..... Tranquil and will transport you to a different time period. The place is big enough to avoid the huge tour groups (walk in",
          "Despite the sign which explicitly stated that students receive a 50% discount from the regular 90\u5143 admission fee, the employee at the ticket office wouldn't offer me the deal as I was a foreign student (even though I presented my valid student ID from the Chinese University I",
          "I've been here many times and its always beautiful. I would say that if you want to go, don't go in the summer because its to hot and the long walk will tire you out a lot. look for a lazy day. Try not to visit during any of the holiday seasons, this place gets packed full",
          "Beautiful place to visit, nice shopping in the area. Particularly the tea pots carved out of stone and then dyed by putting them in boiling tea.",
          "I had a difficult time finding the entrance off the main road until I found someone who spoke English (after several tries). Once I got inside, it was worth the effort. It's really a lovely walled garden filled with old architecture, ponds, and foot bridges. Really lovely.",
          "A typical Chinese garden, large professional, well laid out, washrooms inside, nice ponds/rocks & bonsai trees. Do not go on the weekend of a Chinese holiday.....stupidly busy.... Please could use some TLC, fresh paint, and cleaning would spruce it up nicely. I didn't see any of",
          "It really is an amazing garden but the crowds really make it a disappointing experience. If I were to try and go again, I would try and get there as soon as they opened in an attempt to enjoy the park. If it crowded, I suggest trying to find a less crowded corner of the park",
          "Maybe the 95F weather skewed our view, but this is a nice garden, not a must-see site. There were hordes of tourists (almost all Chinese), all taking selfies at every possible opportunity. The path is well-marked.",
          "This is such a famous garden that I feel odd about giving it a not very good review, but it is so hard used that there are bare patches in the grassed areas, stems with the leaves ripped off and little fences crushed underfoot. It is an incredible design and if you can look",
          "The garden is excellent and a UNESCO World heritage site. It has with water bodies, bonsai plants and well maintained walking paths with souvenir shops which are expensive .. Busy place but worth a visit !!",
          "I do not know what people expect when they are visiting a garden in China which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most famous gardens in the world but this garden has it all (no pagodas though)! This garden was built at different periods and each owner has put his",
          "bit of a disappointment tbh, wasn't much to see or do, it had trees, a pond and some pagodas etc did i miss anything else?",
          "This place is super busy so if you are after a quiet tour this is not the place for you. It is however very beautiful. We were there in May and it was lush and green with the fish on show for all in the pond",
          "Well worth a look if you have some spare time, more than 600 years old and represents well the time of the Ming Dynasty. As a fisherman I enjoyed sitting around the ponds observing the native fish. The buildings are photogenic and the gardens well maintained. There was an",
          "It too crowded to see and with the loud speakers used by the tour guides we could not hear our guide. I am glade that she was not using one. Too much information about the history and politics that you do not need to hear if you are not open to adopting the Chinese way of life",
          "This garden is a lush parkland full of lakes, pavilions and bridges in the traditional Chinese 17 Th century style. It is not very humble, rather it is ornate and intriguing. It was a hot 33 degrees when we visited yet there were plenty of cool arbours and forests to relax in.",
          "quite big but well worth a visit. we went there as part of a Wendy Wu tour so had a guide which made t easier",
          "A short stop after the bunker train from Beijing. The Gardens are very nicely laid out and differ from other places mostly due the compact nature. There are many compartments which provide a feeling of peace and quiet despite there being a number of tour groups.",
          "This is another famous garden which is located in SuZhou. This has very good views and echo friendly environment. Remarkable experience and recommended to visit there for spend 3 hours.",
          "It is nice to learn about history of humble administrator\u2019s garden. This was my first time to visit this garden. The garden is big and it takes about 3 hours to see everything. Very classical. My family really enjoyed this trip.",
          "As ever, be mindful of busy periods but this is a beautiful location with plenty to explore both within and outwith the gardens. A real breath of fresh air ...",
          "The gardens are a large property located in a surprisingly dense area of the city. Walking through the gardens with a guide is the best as you have an appreciation not only of the garden landscapw but its historical landscape as well.",
          "The garden is one of the top sights in Suzhou and deservedly so. A mix of pleasant Chinese gardens and tranquil water and pavilions. Because it is a top attraction, it is very busy with tourists but don't let that put you off. Pick a spot and then sit down and take in the sights.",
          "The Humble Garden is within the Suzhou city old town area and so is very convenient to reach. However, it takes around 30 minutes walk from the nearest metro station and hence it is advisable to take the tricycles once you get out of the station. Many cyclists will solicit to",
          "There are many of such but this is the largest in Suzhou. Essentially a garden, a very huge one with lakes, several pavilions, stone structures and trees and plants of many sorts. Interesting traditional architecture too. Apparently each window year has a special and unique",
          "Although crowded with visitors this garden is worth visiting. The bonsai garden was particularly interesting.",
          "By far my favourite spot in Suzhou. Nearby the old city and the museum, I strongly recommend to spend one hour wandering around. Sunset is a good time to do so.",
          "A really busy place. Far too many people often going the wrong way around the park. A unesco site with more than 500 years in the making. There are some really lovely spots with views only China can manufacture. There is a small fee, over 70 years go free. Toilets cold be",
          "Beautiful gardens. Visited with my wife on Monday morning and it was raining. Still crowded,not sure what will be a better time to visit. However I think it is well worthed the time",
          "This is a must see when visiting Suzhou. It is one of the most treasured and revered gardens in China!",
          "Came here with my wife and it was so crowded so I would suggest avoiding coming at the weekend! It is a beautiful garden with some great architecture, trees and raised rock areas but with a big crowd it is spoilt!",
          "This is probably the best garden in all of Suzhou. Takes about 2 hours if you have a slow walk through the gardens. Engage a guide to share more about the place to you",
          "I have been to a lot of Chinese gardens during my time living in China, but none where as beautiful and diverse as this. Disclaimer - I did visit this Garden in early April when the flowers were in full bloom. There is an incredible number of flowers all leaving an incredible",
          "My wife and I recently visited this garden and thoroughly enjoyed the buildings, ponds, trees, and flowers. A tour guide is a must to fully appreciate all the history and significance of each area in the garden. Get there early in the day as the garden becomes quite crowded.",
          "Came here because of its UNESCO status. It\u2019s obviously a popular place because of the crowds & the shops. Entrance fee is more expensive (90 RMB). I love the landscape with very pretty peonies, peach blossom trees, bonsai, wisteria, & shrubbery. It\u2019s like a maze with many paths.",
          "These gardens are nothing like I expected. Rocks, bridges and water play a very big part as do viewing places. I was surprised that all the cities I visited had amazing three dimensional public gardens with all the blossoms coming out late March and brilliant planting designs",
          "Very nice watergarden, much bigger than expected and enormous amounts of tourists on a Sunday with nice weather. Try to avoid the weekends and enjoy the scenery.",
          "Get here early. I arrived just before 7.30am on a Saturday morning and got a ticket and was one of the first through the doors. This meant that you can see the garden in relative peace and quiet and get photos without a million other people. By 9am there were groups coming",
          "If you have the spare time, you can drop over, buy a ticket (not from the various touts outside but from the official ticket booth) and spend the time walking through the gardens, pavilions, some display of old furniture used in the residence etc. And you have visited other",
          "It was definitely worth the trip to see these gardens. It was fun being with a Chinese colleague for this tour. I spent 3 hours here and enjoyed walking the rocks and seeing the structures. We were a little early in the year to see the gardens in bloom.",
          "While full of symbolism and beauty in its own right, spending 3 + hours of your precious time amongst rocks and greenery isn't everyone's coup of tea. It does sound attractive, I know. But think about it twice before spending your time in a maze of greenery such as this. Suzhou",
          "When I was queuing at the ticket counter, the volunteer who was wearing a working ID talked to me and suggested me an official one day tour package, it cost 135Rmb for adult, and 100 for the elderly aged 60-69, over 70 may be cheaper. Just give them an ID card for record. It",
          "I traveled to this garden in the middle of winter. Although it was snowing it was still very beautiful. There are lot's of small streams, walkways, and classic Chinese architecture. It definitely is a must see activity.",
          "One of Suzhou's most famous gardens. It is meticulously and thoughtfully landscaped. Beautiful but for me, a little artificial and difficult to appreciate. There are probably deeper meanings and significance to the way the gardens are landscaped and arranged. Garden is hugely",
          "This garden is a beautiful spot that provides a look back in time to the life of a Chinese official. Plan on spending two hours walking the garden and buildings. Lots and lots of picture opportunities. Fairly busy, but nowhere as bad as the major sites in China. Admission was",
          "Very pretty and quiet. Lovely architecture and beautiful trees. One of the gardens Suzhou is famous for",
          "This is a wonderful garden though it would be more appealing in the Spring. I went in January. But still well worth the visit. The audio guide is not very useful.",
          "As one of the 4 famous gardens in China ,this beautiful garden attracts lots of tourists not only the local Chinese but also foreigners.Beautiful landscapes with a huge pond at the central & a few gorgeous wooden pavilions joining by small stone paths & bridges.Leisure walk",
          "The only bad thing about the garden it\u2019s self is the English audio guide . It\u2019s is literally 20 minutes and it doesn\u2019t have half the attractions but other than that it is a very lovely place but it does get really crowded in the summer",
          "I loved this small but compact piece of garden in Suzhou. I traveled there in January. I am sure the place will look much more beautiful in the Spring. However I feel the 70 RMB ticket price was a bit expensive.",
          "Great gardens. Its really worth to pay a visit. Hope for a sunny day and it will be more beautiful. A just do",
          "Great place to take photos and enjoy the scenery when in Suzhou. Recommended to all when visiting the city to spend some time there.",
          "This is a must visit for Suzhou. Superb classical garden that is World Heritage listed. Follow the suggested route or in reverse or just walk around taking it all in. Love the use of weather-beaten (maybe formerly submerged) rocks. It all combines with grand pavilions lakes and",
          "The garden is a good representation of suzhou garden. The recommended route in the signage is from east to west but you should go from the west to the east and listen to the short briefing of the history of the garden before you start to tour round the garden. Said in the",
          "This city has many beautiful gardens and the humble administrators garden certainly is worth a visit it wasn\u2019t too crowded when I was there and walking through the buildings looking at the furniture was very interesting",
          "It will take you about 3-4 hours to walk around this garden it has alot of different buildings ponds and trees there are alot of places inside to buy souvenirs,",
          "Don't visit during national holidays as it gets very crowded! It is beautifully designed and taken care of. With a large variety of plants and ponds, it is a perfect way to escape the city and relax surrounded by nature.",
          "This was a worthwhile visit, although my wife and I preferred the Master of the Nets Garden. This garden was not so busy, probably a reflection of its lesser popularity. Worthwhile visiting though, if you like your gardens.",
          "Worth a visit. Reasonable audio guide. Plan for an hour. Interesting surrounding neighborhoods as well, with local color.",
          "This was a great getaway from the city by speed train for less than 40 yuans. Peaceful place with a really nice (and huge) Bonzai garden. On the first days of December, the light was really nice on the multi colored falling tree leaves. Don't buy the tickets from resellers as",

Around 200 private gardens reached its peak in the Ming (\u660e\u671d1368\u20131644) and Qing (\u6e05\u671d1644\u20131911) dynasties. There are 69 preserved gardens in Suzhou",
          "This was another beautiful garden, and one of the largest we visited. There were a number of distinct sections, each with a slightly different feel. One area that was different from the other gardens was the Bonsai tree section (pictures below). As with the other gardens we",

          "As part of our tour, we visited the garden. It is very beautiful with lovely greenery and buildings. The atmosphere was one of calm and relaxation. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "One of the largest and finest gardens in Suzhou. A great example of chinese garden design. The garden is very busy with lots of visitors and the paths are rather narrow so be prepared to be pushed around and be very patient. Some areas had so many people that they looked more",
          "great to see some old China very interesting had a guide that spoke English and was fascinating to see some the ancient history of this city",
          "Not a garden with lawns, roses etc but something that has lots of buildings, water and plants. They were all used in the past and give a great understanding of how life was like all those years ago. Get a good guide who will be able to explain the history of the site.",
          "If you visit this expecting stunning gardens with a vast collection of interesting plants and western style manicured lawns and topiary then you will be hugely disappointed. This is an excellent example of how Chinese \"gardens\" are laid out. A series of buildings with a variety",
          "A beautiful and peaceful garden and surrounds. The buildings are in excellent condition and portray life as it was many years ago. It is well worth the visit and get a guide to learn the history of the wonderful place.",
          "This was a very large garden that had a special bonsai section. Many of the internal rooms were intact and gave a very good picture of what it would have been like to live there.",
          "Good moment this garden is famous in China so it\u2019s a priority to visit. And it\u2019s very close from Suzhou museum. Superbe jardin, un des plus beaux de Chine . \u00c0 deux pas du mus\u00e9e de Suzhou.",
          "Others have said ,if in Suzhou you must visit this garden. I'd put it stronger: you must visit Suzhou in order to see this garden. It has a beauty all its own, and the contrast between the Japanese and Chinese approach to gardens is evident as soon as you put your foot in the",
          "A downpour on the day we visited, but a little rain never hurt anyone. We were dressed for it. Very typical Chinese garden, lots of rocks, lotus, and greenery. We found the guided tour helped with history and context.",

          "We visited on a Saturday morning which probably didn't help. Although the gardens and views are amazing it was sometimes difficult to move around or to get the picture you wanted. To think this was someone's back garden in history and the different gardens within it. Great place",
          "If you are in Suzhou you must visit the garden. It might seem pricey but is worth going to so different from Europoean gardens. Amazingly relaxing place.",
          "The 90 RMB for the entrance fee was a bit steep for me. However, the grounds are expansive and nice to stroll around. I would advise not going during the National Holiday week, as it is very crowded then.",
          "The entrance was priced at 90 RMB. That was definitely not worth the money even though some parts of the garden was quite nice.",
          "The gardens were lovely. There are four \"windows\" and each represents four seasons. On a quiet day it's very peaceful however weekends tend to be super crowded with tours.",
          "Have visited several garden in Suzhou. This garden is one of the top 4 garden in Suzhou. The area is big and if you come in the right time, you will see sea of lotus in this garden. Other then that, nothing much special unless you hire a tour guide which will explain to you in",
          "It is a beautiful, parklike compound, of course, but it lacks the detail and surprise found in other traditional Chinese gardens. If one were to visit only one garden, I prefer Yu Garden in Shanghai. We did not visit in time to see the lotus flowers in bloom, and we hear that",
          "If you are in Suzhou, you absolutely have to visit this. Official guided tours are provided at a fee (can't remember the exact amount now). Although the hiring fee for a guide is rather expensive, it's worth every penny. The landscaping is stunning with nuances which we would",
          "Worth the name of the most representative garden of Suzhou. I've been to many spots of Jiangnan style but this one is amazing, feels like each step opens up a gorgeous view. April is a good time to visit.",

          "Together with the Administrator's house, the beautifully laid out gardens with winding pathways, pagodas, ponds and a different view every few yards. Even despite the rain and the crowds this was attractive. A guide will supply history, context and detail, as well as the",
          "Even in the pouring rain, this is still a highlight of Suzhou, but it's also the most expensive ticket in town at a whopping RMB90. Nothing humble about that fee. My advice is to see the Art Museum, the Silk Museum, the North Pagoda and the Suzhou Museum all in the same day.",
          "Gorgeous carved wooden pavilions, meandering paths and beautiful water features, bonsai and small gardens. Well worth a visit, but VERY busy on Saturdays!",
          "A garden should be tranquil, make you relax and rest your soul, at least in my humble opinion. The garden failed to do so on all accounts. It is a nice garden but during the weekend, it just gets too overcrowded and it takes away the whole objective of being there to begin with.",
          "It is a nice garden and large expansive home, but I found walking around outside more enjoyable. The best bet, and not to miss in Suzhou was the Tiger hill which has a nice garden and impressive pagoda.",

          "Although little remains of the original gardens, not surprising considering the age, this is a good representation of a classic Chinese garden. It has many faces, dependent on season, and it's probably better to visit in spring/early summer or Autumn. The bonsai collection is",

          "Was good but find the 90rmb ticket on the higher side. Spend an hour there, was great looking garden",
          "The garden is very nice but despite its huge size it is extremeley packed with big groups of Chinese tourists guided with loud mics, which makes the visit a lot less pleasant.",

          "Having shown up on a Monday, the Suzhou Museum was closed (closed Monday) and thought that I would merely have more time in the gardens. The gardens are worth seeing, definitely, but time of year is very important because it is very hot and not as a much in bloom. I would",
          "Would definitely recommend going here, but 2 hours exploring in 98 degree heat makes me suggest not to go in July. The rock work of the walk ways, architecture, and landscaping are worth taking the heat. Just if you have the opportunity, do it at a cooler time of year.",
          "A most enjoyable outing. Lovely gardens and architecture. A bit crowded in places but we expected that.",
          "A place of tranquility. If you are lucky, you can go here when it's not too crowded. There is nothing humble about this humble Administrator's Garden",

          "We went to the Garden on a Wed (May 31), immediately after the 3 days public holiday and the place was not crowded at all. So, easy to navigate. Not impressed by what we saw. Entrance fee of RMB$90 is not cheap by local standard. After you went to one garden, the other garden",
          "The place is extremely crowded on most days, so get ready to push away a few people with your elbows. However, it is a nice destination for a weekend trip from bubbly Shanghai. The atmosphere is much better here.",
          "I don't pretend to know much about this subject, or about the esthetics in the design of such a tranquil location, but I guess this must be a classic example of a Chinese garden, as It seems much larger than the Yuyuan Garden in Shanghai, which we had visited before on a",

          "It was very nice and a lot of things you can see, but sooo many people.. But I guess it's normal for Chinese attraction. Still I think it's worth to visit if you are in Suzhou.",
          "Don't get me wrong- a very nice garden and very large but also very expensive and crowded. I preferred both the Lion Forest garden and the Master of Nets garden, both smaller and cosier. For me the Administrator's garden was more like a park.",

          "We hit it just right, all the flowers and trees were in bloom, not very crowded, the place is really quiet and beautiful. The stone walkways are intricate in design, the bonsai garden quite nice. Not very expensive to enter. Have a senior rate. Takes a while to go over this",
          "90 RMB is a very expensive price to pay for this. All these parks are the same. It has become a franchise. The model is to build a few cottages, pagodas, a lake, a bunch of rocks stacked up and lots of plants, and there you go: a money making machine. Do not go during weekends",
          "The day that we visited was not a weekend but was the first day of half term so the garden was very busy. Even so there was still plenty to see. The planting is not the same as in England and many of the plants were in pots but were arranged nicely. The other areas were very",

          "Avoid (unless it's 9am on a rainy Monday morning in winter). Undoubtedly beautiful, this garden was ruined by the shops and masses of noisy, selfie-taking tourists and was horrendously overpriced considering you can have the same experience in other places. The garden is quite",
          "Unfortunately, we went when the weather was brilliant so it was extremely crowded. Despite the large amount of tour groups the grounds are large enough to avoid them if required. We didn't have a guide but still felt that we enjoyed it, so save yourself the money.",

          "This is quite a standard classical garden, with lake, willow, flowers and trees. To me, it's a bit too much decorations put together in an area. There are gardens all over China which don't give you a crampy feel.",
          "Definitely not as tranquil as it was designed to be enjoyed as! If you come, aim to arrive as early as possible. We came on a Wednesday morning, and it was so crowded by 11 am, it felt like waiting in a line going everywhere. Tons of tour groups come here as well. I get this is",

          "Classical Chinese garden, beautifully laid out and serene - until the tourists arrive. This is an attraction at which to arrive early to be more-or-less on your own to appreciate the gardens. Add in a few busses of 50 tourist apiece and the calm of the place is destroyed. Very",
          "Many souvenir and food stalls are outside, but once you enter this garden, it's a different world of beautiful gardens and architecture. It wasn't very crowded when we visited on a Thursday morning, which made it easy for us to enjoy strolling. You could easily spend hours",

          "If you have visited any gardens in China you will be familiar with rocks, crazy paving and grass that you are not allowed to walk on. This garden is the same. It cost 70rmb to get in and gives you a massive dose of purpose built public pools, pots and pagodas. If you have",
          "If I had the chance again, I would make sure I arrived at opening time, first thing in the morning... I think it opens at 7.30 It would be worth getting up early for. I visited just after lunch on a Sunday and it was busier than a Main Street in Shanghai. All charm",

          "Almost reminds you of the traditional gardens the Japanese keep. The buildings and layout are nice to take in as a whole package.",
          "It is better to go here when it not too crowded; avoid during public holidays. It is very expenise though so to get your money's worth, you should take your time to have a proper look around.",
          "Came here on the first day of Chinese New year and the place was full of people. Taxi from Hyatt Regency costs us about 40rmb and took about 30 mins. Moving around and taking photos with the compound were challenging with so many people that day. Entrance fee was waived for",
          "Definitely the best-known classical garden in Suzhou. Visit early in the day so you don't have to deal with huge crowds. I visited in early winter and can totally imagine how beautiful this garden will be in spring and summer. It's pretty expansive and complex - will take you",

          "The largest and most beautiful of the city Gardens. It was built in the XVI century, a former judge, Wang San Chen. Over time, its appearance is almost completely changed, because each new owner changed it for yourself. Even in cold winter weather, it is very pleasant to walk on",
          "Well maintained garden. Did not realize that it was a UNESCO world heritage site. intricately carved rooms connected by a maze of canals, bridges and trees. I think the garden covers over 50,000 square meters and it is a lot of walk. I would not recommend going here with small",
          "One of the biggest garden in Suzhou ! Recommend to engage a tour guide to explain on the history, architecture and you will amaze with all the various details in the past!",
          "This garden is truly amazing. Show your student card if you have one as you'll get a 50% discount on admission (bear in mind, the discount only applies to undergraduates \ud83d\ude09). The park has a capacity of around 9000 but there were only 300 or so people when we went so we had ample",
          "A very large ancient garden in old Suzhou. It really deserves the UNESCO Heritage designation. The bonsai alone is worth a visit.",
          "We had never heard of Suzhou until our tour operator put it on our itinerary and we would not have missed this city of canals and gardens for the world. Top of the garden list is this one - started in the 16th Century by a retired local official. It is absolutely beautiful,",
          "One of the many beautiful gardens in Suzhou. This one of of the bigger ones and definitely my favorite of them.",
          "This is supposed to be one of the best 3 gardens in China but I would seriously doubt it. Visiting on a rainy Thursday we found it overcrowded with local visitors and school groups so it was hard to progress through the gardens or even stop to admire anything. We only visted two",
          "It is a huge garden which will allow some walking and admiring the traditional chinese garden design. Nothing spectacular , at least to me, but it was a good afternoon activity to stroll about and take some photos.",

          "A prime example of a classical chinese garden - and a huge one to boot! Spent 2 hours here just walking and enjoying all the beauty. Visited in december, so there it was not crowded - there was only very few people, which was amazing, because it will lose much of it's charm if",
          "I went there with my girlfriend in Dec 2016. But we could not get into the garden because they didn't not sell us a ticket without a Chinese identification and our foreign passports didn't work. I suppose the only way for foreigners to go in is to buy a package that includes",

          "They sell package tickets to the garden that also come with a trip in the channel boats. What they don't tell you is that you also spend more than an hour at a remote shopping mall being pushed to buy cheap silk products. The garden is great despite being very busy with people,",
          "Let me start off by saying gardens are really not my thing, but my wife loves them. That being said I found this place to be so tranquil and serene that it made me appreciate all that it took to build this place so long ago. You stroll your way around the property and can take",
          "It was off season for blooms but still beautiful. The Chinese have a way of immersing you with nature",
          "We were there on a lovely sunny day and the gardens were beautiful. The tickets are 1/2 price if you're over 60 so bring your passport. Forget the serious camera and tripod as there are too many people wandering hither and yon and the Chinese have no sense of courtesy to step",
          "Absolute must for everybody visiting China. A lovely garden constructed with many \"frames\" through which you observe the scenery, and also marvelous exhibition of Bonsai trees",
          "It is amazing just how many different vistas you can get in one garden. When we visited it was busy but luckily is big enough to not be crowded. When the lotus flowers are in bloom it must be absolutely stunning. Well worth a visit.",
          "The morning landscape of Humble Administrator\u2019s Garden is wonderful, especially after the rain. We went there in the morning, and there were few visitors. Some of the flowers had dropped because of the rainy season. We spent about 3 hours to walk around and it was really big,",
          "The Humble Administrator's Garden is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. Granted, this past trip to China last month was the first time I'd ever been out of the United States, but this site was definitely one of the prettiest places to visit in an outstandingly",
          "A fairly small but very scenic and peaceful garden that won't take a lot of time to explore. It's well worth a visit. Unfortunately to get to the entrance you have to walk down a long, narrow street filled with local vendors.",
          "Beautiful Chinese style gardens, fascinating architecture, big bonsai gardens, and a lot of water channels",
          "Plenty of gardens to choose from, however, I heard that this one is the best. It's indeed very beautiful!!! Many sights to feed your eyes in and take photos... I was in November , so a bit off season, the garden was not crowded (only a few groups of local pupils and tourists),",
          "Signage in the park are in Chinese except for the main directions. The pond are poorly maintained. Wild grasses grew in between rocks. The stations are not properly lit. Not worth the money paid to enter.",

          "It was a pleasure to visit this garden. Despite that it is fall time, the garden still has a lot to show. My best piece is the bonsai's garden. It contains one of the best bonsai collection. Each bonsai is a piece of art. For livers of Chinese garden designs, this garden is a",
          "You need a good couple of hours here, maybe three. We felt we were being rushed so told our guide the miss the next visit (Tongli) - proved a good choice as: a) the gardens are really peaceful and lovely; and b) the traffic back to Shanghai on a Sunday evening is truly awful so",
          "Absolutely beautiful, with traditional chinese sculptures, some rooms settled as scenes from ancient China. Dont miss it!",
          "A nice place with great taste of histroy very well preserved .joyful and essence of history and relaxation . Enjoyed it but it costs 70 \u00a5",
          "Unfortunately could only visit in November so not colour left in the flowers. However, the architecture and the garden landscaping were harmonious. A nice way to spend some time in this busy city.",
          "Engaged a tour guide (located on the right at the entrance) at 160 yuan as we were interested to know the history of this garden. Do not engage any freelance tour guide as they may not be professional.",

          "Of all the gardens to see this has to be at the top of the list for Sushou. Would love to see it in the spring with more in bloom .",
          "Lots of tourists crowded the narrow walkways of this beautiful garden on the day I visited. Even in the fall drizzle, though, the garden's magnificence was apparent. Be sure to rent an audioguide to provide commentary if you want to know what you're seeing. There is no printed",
          "went during the week in mid-afternoon, the crowds kept flooding in even though the weather wasn't great! one of the most famous gardens, its sheer size means you can hide in a quiet(er) corners, and simply enjoy the view (try to ignore all the noise and people around you).",
          "It's a beautiful garden and a must-see. But it's too crowded. Try to visit early or at the end of the day. The Bonsai gardens in the back are really nice and there is so much of them to see! Its close to the railstation.",
          "We must have been lucky, went mid afternoon and don't have complaint of other reviewers about crowds! If you are interested in what is a real example of what Chinese consider a beautiful garden then its a great example. It is very old but very well maintained, both buildings",
          "Nice and we'll maintained garden. Crowded, but not more than other places in China. Many different attractions and very suitable for families. Our kids liked it too. Easily possible as a one day trip from Shanghai. No dogs allowed inside.",
          "I think probably always crowded. Even in rain it was difficult to appreciate all the elements of this famous garden because of the crowds.",
          "This was part of a multi-week tour, so we had no choice but to visit. I was disappointed compared to long-ago visit to Yu Garden in Shanghai. Most of the ponds were choked with lotus, and overall not particularly scenic",
          "This garden is beautiful. It is really worth seeing. Make sure you allocate a good couple of hours to do it justice.",
          "Great photo opportunities throughout the property. Beautiful scenes everywhere you walk. Would recommend a visit.",
          "I was informed that this was one of the four most famous and beautiful gardens in China. I believe it. It is a huge manscaped grounds with ponds, bonsai gardens, bridges and little structures so delightfully places that there are gorgeous photo opportunities everywhere. It",
          "This is a lovely garden and a wonderful example of this type of residence! I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has a very interesting lay out and is well worth the visit. As this is a UNESCO World Heritage site, expect large crowds and the inevitable souvenir hawkers at the",
          "We went on a day that everyone else did so it was very busy but a great place to visit and a nice cuppa at the tea house. It was not as colourful as expected but a great day out",
          "I could have easily spent the entire morning in this garden! We just did not have long enough. The home is really beautiful, such a wonder & thank god it survived all the upheavals in China in the past. The gardens are lovely but the real treat are the bonsai's! There is a",
          "Go to the expense and hire a local guide who speaks your language. They are buzzing around everywhere. The press of tourists can be quite overwhelming but worth the fight. This garden is an example of the height of Ming culture. Suzhou is the virtual home of the Ming which",
          "It is worth going to this garden although it does get busy, early morning is the ideal time. An excellent introduction to Chinese garden design with a variety of different planted areas to explore, including some beautiful bonsai. Allow just over an hour. I didn't have an",
          "Allthough the weather was horrible, non stop haivy rain, still this place was busy, but it is easy to understand why. What a great place! The garden is just magnificent",
          "To crowd to get any details of the garden. A little bit hard to get to the place. I get by taxi by showing them the picture and name of this place (in Chinese). It takes me 20 Yuan. I also recommend to take a taxi not the bus, it confusing me and waste the time. Also, If you are",
          "We enjoyed the experience but felt that the gardens were too crowded to full enjoy them, especially for the price",
          "Had a nice wander amongst the old buldings and the ponds, managed to see the only lotus flowers still in bloom on our trip in mid September.",
          "Make sure you reserve at least 1/2 day for this one if you enjoy this type of attraction along with taking lots of photo. This is one of the 3 most famous gardens in China.",
          "We visited in Golden Week in high temperatures and still loved our visit, despite the huge crowds and the heat. The ancient gardens are set around a central pond and include weeping willows, arched bridges and traditional pagodas. There were some places in the shade to have a",
          "Interesting garden with lots of variation. Ponds, lotus flowers and pagodas in a relaxing mix. Nice walk paths and miniature tree area",
          "This is the garden in Suzhou that all tour groups visit. Therefore it is very, very crowded. I would skip this garden and go to Master of the Nets or Canlang Pavilion. Both are beautiful with far less people.",
          "A crowded garden in 90+ heat was maddening. But since my prayers for rainy day and no crowd was not answered, we decided to make the most of it. It is a beautiful Chinese garden, with or without crowd. The beauty was everywhere, on the door, on the window(or in the window),",
          "A disappointment. I expected the gardens to be well maintained and well kept..but they looked like they hadn't seen a gardener in months \ud83d\ude1e",
          "The garden is huge, but on a typical weekend day its over crowded. Entrance ticket is 90 RMB which I think it's very high, atleast looking at the volume of people who get in. The garden has lot of great places to sit and relax. Lot of spots for good photos. Lot of commercial",
          "If you are in Suzhou, one of the thing to visit is all the garden. This one is really huge, take a map once you get there or you may get lost. With all the crowd (due to national holiday) we got lost. But still it is a beautiful garden. Lots of water, greenery, rocks,",
          "The gardens were sooooo full of tourists it was impossible to move and enjoy the park and get nice photos! Perhaps early in the morning would be better.",
          "The ancient buildings are better preserved than those in the Forbidden City(Beijing) and have kept to the original paint work, colour and ornamentation. There are also far more and better preserved artefacts and furniture on display inside these rooms than in anything in the",
          "90 Yuens to visit this garden is quite some money. However, the garden is pretty big and impressive, with lots of classic buildings, rocks, ponds and plants.",
          "Went to the gardens today. I love the way it makes the best use of a smal area, enticing you on to the next part of the garden. Round every corner is a photo opportunity. I loved it.",
          "Visiting the garden even when it is raining is still a nice experience. It is an amazing piece of history and nature tucked away in the middle of Suzhou. I highly recommend getting a guide if possible since there is a lot of small stories and anecdotes about the place you will",
          "We visited the Administrators Garden while in Suzhou, great to see what the Chinese refer to as a garden, we visited similar in Shanghai, water, rocks, fish and plants very simple and effective.",
          "Really beautiful Garden just like the other 3 Gardens I visited. For non-Chinese people. This isn\u2019t a standard Garden. It is more on the scale of a Park with many old Chinese buildings and Chinese old bridges etc. It is really nice to see and imagine the architecture from",
          "Prefered the Shizi Ling as there were much more things to see and move about through the man-made caves.",
          "It is best visited in the Springtime when everything is in bloom, however, it might be very busy during this time. I visited in late March and it was not yet in bloom, however, this was a good time to visit in terms of moderate temperature and not many people.",
          "If like me you find it hard to get excited about a garden this one is actually different ! The story behind the garden is cute especially after the son lost it in a bet ... But it's well laid out and a lot of interesting nooks and crannies to explore",
          "Did this as part of a tour so you only get about an hour at most. Lots of tours there all showing the same things so don't expect tranquil gardens unless you visit early by yourself. It was nice though although manic as per many Chinese attractions due to the number of tours.",
          "I visited here on my most recent trip to Suzhou and the gardens are absolutely beautiful. There are so many traditional buildings, bridges and structures to explore as well as the beautiful landscaping in the garden. The only downside to this garden is that it is generally very",
          "Yes it's crowded, but it's also very beautiful. The audio recording gives background although I found just wandering and looking at the views to be the fun of it all.",
          "A private garden house converted into a tourist attraction. Grossly overrated & too touristy. One has to pay a moderate entrance fee. Keep 45-60 min for the stroll through it. Would have avoided the visit if this information was available",
          "The garden is very large but attracts large numbers of people. There are many corners to go to so fortunately you're not always surrounded by the crowd.",
          "I went there with my American coworkers. The garden is beautifully and thoughtfully crafted. We hired a tour guide who helped to explain some of the hidden meaning behind the design. It was worthwhile to hire someone. We went there during September which is not at the peak",
          "My friend and I went here on a public holiday, which was definitely a wrong timing to really appreciate this place. The entire complex was packed with people, it was hard to even walk without getting hit by other visitors. Of course the trash everywhere was inevitable which was",
          "I have been here several times with other visitors who are on their first visit. It is often very busy, so it is never possible to have the peaceful atmosphere that the setting suggests, but it is still very attractive. You can find some nice spots to sit, and generally the",
          "This is THE most visited site in SuZhou, so it is a bit crowdy. But the view is very picturesque, embodied some of the most fundamental Chinese aesthetic design ideas for building, gardening, and their literature connections.",
          "Suzhou hosts many different gardens to visit and almost all of them are worth visiting. If you need to pick, make sure to have Humble Administrator's Garden on your list. A big and wonderful place comprising all what you see and want to see when enjoying a Chinese garden.",
          "Beautiful parkland with lakes with koi carps. A lovely garden to stroll, take photos , admire and relax.",
          "We enjoyed walking around the garden. There was a lot of people there, but everyone is walking around calmly enjoying their day, so you don't feel like it's an issue with all the people. You can still enjoy the beauty of the place. We felt like we walked into a Chinese movie,",
          "Firstly they should limit the numbers as they do at forbidden city. The place was way overcrowded and felt more like a market at times. The gardens are not well maintained. As we entered the grass was overgrown and weeds were very visible. No pretty flower beds etc. We left",
          "Nice garden. Impressive Bonsai collection. If you want to get out of Shanghai for a day trip, this is a good choice.",
          "This beautiful garden in Suzhou is a must see, it is very beautiful. If possible you may want to visit on a weekday if possible since weekends can be a bit crowded",
          "This is a beautiful garden and one of the largest and most elaborate that I have seen. I have visited it four times over the past 26 years. It is well maintained and stays beautiful. Unfortunately since the Chinese have become tourists in their own country, the garden is",
          "I've been to Humble Administrator's Garden for several times and i have a Suzhou garden card. I love the traditional architectures and atmosphere. I recommend you to visit on weekdays, for there're so many people come here on holidays. The crowd may affect the mood to enjoy",
          "We toured these gardens on a beautiful spring day. There was a perfusion of gorgeous blooms. At each turn, there was an elegant picture perfect scene of flowers, rocks and water. There were many artfully arranged halls with attractive furnishings. We learned about \"borrowed",
          "I found the Humble Administrator's Garden to be easy to find and a very welcome respite from the crowded nearby Shanghai. I took a little day trip to Suzhou. The train ride from Shanghai was only about 35/40 mins long. There were taxis readily available and the driver had no",
          "I visited on a Saturday at mid-day when the temperature was over 100F and 85% humidity. But it was a lovely visit. Perhaps the temperature kept people away because it was not terribly crowded even though it is a UNESCO world heritage site. At $15us it was pricier than I expected",
          "We arrived fairly early on a weekday just after the rain but it was soon getting busy so understand comments about it at weekends. We enjoyed an hour or so of peace and cool with our guide wisely taking us to the further parts of the garden first and then slowly wending our way",
          "Visited here on a beautiful Spring day with wisteria blooming bountifully. The hardscaping and furniture and architecture are world class - no wonder it is a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
          "I got there right at opening at 7:30 and it wasn't too crowded. It's actually pretty large and there's no systematic way to see everything, so I wandered around for about two hours to see the whole thing. For the first hour or so it was very nice: beautiful scenery, peace and",
          "While this is a world-class garden (really beautiful and moving in many ways) it was so packed that it was impossible to really appreciate it. Perhaps in the Spring or Fall or even winter it would be a better time to visit.",
          "We went on a Saturday afternoon; it was much less crowded than the Lion garden, for which we were very grateful. Entrance (for students) is 45\u00a5/$6.8. Opportunities for photos abound, while information about the place is scarce. Try to go when no one else is there. Of course",
          "Single largest garden in Suzhou. Honestly after you went to this one, you can skip all the other ones in the city. Absolutely stunning and a must see. You get to see three styles of Suzhou garden decoration in one place. Quick tips: 1) GO EARLY. Place opens at 8am or 8:30am.",
          "We were quite unlucky to visit during a rainy time, but we had a great time nonetheless. I am actually happy it rained, because I cannot imagine even more people walking around the garden when it is a nice day on a summer weekend. Even on this rainy day it was very crowded and",
          "The largest of its kind in Suzhou, this garden is best representation of landscape architecture in China south of Yangtze. Main characteristics include winding stone bridges and corridors, pavilions in square or hexagonal shapes, water lily ponds, black clay roof tops with",
          "It is really interesting to see how people lives so many years ago and it was far from humble!. Worth a visit",
          "Amazing garden and you get a taste of how it was like to be an emperor in ancient times. But you need an English guide to appreciate the stories behind the place.",
          "Given that it was a rainy day didn't help. The gardens were OK and the ornamental lakes were good but there were seemingly just a lot of buildings with furniture and not much in the way of information.",
          "This. Is a nice calm garden with lots of flowers and greenery. We had a guide and that was helpful to learn about the garden and its history. It was not very crowded when we came. The guide told us that usually they have up to 10000 visitors per day. It tells a lot about Chinese",
          "Though it was a little crowded on a Saturday morning, this garden was filled with well maintained plantings, great art, and well maintained architecture. It definitely is a UNESCO heritage site. It was a true experience of the orient!",
          "Yes, there were a lot of people there - and it was a Sunday, but it did not feel overcrowded and we certainly were able to move around easily and appreciate the peace, beauty and tranquility of these gardens.",
          "The Humble Administrator's Garden is absolutely gorgeous but (at least on the day we went) so packed with people---largely tourists from other parts of China---that it becomes exhausting. I would highly recommend trying to go during a less-busy time. That said, the gardens",
          "I got a taxi from the hotel and wandered around by myself. The gardens were beautiful. A separate enclosure housed numerous variations of bonsai trees. I spotted several large carp in the ponds as I strolled over the little bridges. Lots of little houses with original art and",
          "I visited last week of May and the crowds were not too great, perhaps due to the threat of rain. No problem getting access to photo spots, but one does get people in most shots so you have to be creative in composition. This is an architecture featured garden, informal",
          "I went with a friend and her young (8 yrs) daughter. We hired a guide who spoke English, which was a good idea in the end. I think I got more out of it because of that. The gardens are lovely and very extensive. Just the bonsai area alone is very impressive. It was very",

          "The entrance to the gardens looks like a large building and it does not have any exterior signage in English. This made it hard to find since I was looking for a garden. The gardens are lovely, but you cannot tell they are there from the outside.",
          "The garden is so huge that you could get lost inside. The place is crowded with tourists, that explains it's popularity. There are many places for you to sit down and enjoy the scenery within the gardens. It would take around 1-2 hours for you to complete the garden. allocate",
          "Lovely gardens. Preferred Lion Forest Garden but they are so close you should visit both. Dont miss Pingjiang Road. Small alley street with shops and restaurants. Hard to find bar for a beer. But, we found it! Enjoyed beer overlooking water and nice service. Pictures of",

          "Went early in the day and enjoyed the beauty of the Gardens with a modest amount of people. If you are patient, and plan your trip early in the morning you will enjoy this place and find peace.",
          "We visited the garden after the 1st May high season, and it was a raining day. Still the park was full of people, mostly with large groups which were very loud. The garden is real beautiful with many sites to enjoy.",
          "There's plenty to take in here and its reputation as the premiere Chinese garden is well earned, but if you only have a day in Suzhou, try to get here early as they pack them in like sardines and it can seem like you're just waiting in a line the whole time.",
          "Suzhou is a very beautiful city with many areas to visit and to take photos. The Humble Administrator's Garden is both historic and a stunningly beautiful place to visit in Suzhou. The large pond/lake in this area provides for many great photo opportunities that are not to be",
          "This 4 hectare (10 acre) garden is quite amazing for the amount of different vistas of the various parts of the garden. The juxta position of the buildings (pavilions, walls, covered ways), water, zig-zag bridges, rocks and the different elevations are the work pof an expert",
          "We arrived today at this \"Unesco world heritage\" garden. The entrance fee per adult is 90y, we did not have to pay annentranxe fee for our 6 year old son. We were approached by a English speaking tourist guide. She offered her services, but paying 200y seemed way too expensive.",
          "There were many touts outside the garden that offered cheaper tickets and guided tours. Ignore them. Although there were many tourists inside the gardens, walking around the greenery somehow provided a soothing/calming effect. The audio guides (20RMB) and directional signs",
          "If you go to Suzhou then I suppose this garden is on your to do list. Go ahead and enjoy the park. It's mostly green and old buildings not so much any flowers. It's nice but wow, the grounds clearly trampled from so many visitors. Outside the garden feels like your standard",
          "If you like Chinese gardens, you will like this. But it is, I think, seriously overhyped, and frankly rather overrated. Chinese gardens all look much alike; and there are lots of other Chinese gardens just as impressive, maybe even a bit prettier. Even in Suzhou, there are",
          "This is one of the better and most beautiful of many large homes and gardens which has been restored. I can't help but wonder if there is more to the story of how the owners ended their stay, than is told.",
          "Pretty garden, I suppose. If only there was one square meter left that wasn't overrun by hordes of selfiestick swinging tourists.",
          "This is a beautiful garden. A large area full of flowers, trees, pavilions and bridges. There is a lot to see, so you have to spend 2-3 hours. It was a bit crowdy. Don't buy tickets on the street outside. Entrance was 90 RMB.",
          "comparing to the lingering garden, the garden of the humble ambassador is a much more steal. superficially, the garden is much bigger than you would have expected and the composition of every single installment are works of art. one suggestion is never come here at july and",

          "Before the trip, I was told that if we only have time for one garden, it must be the Humble Administrator's Garden. This proves a correct statement. Its garden layout is classic and elegant. In the traditional Chinese garden design philosophy, the garden is required to present a",
          "I went there once with an English speaking co-worker on our visit to our ODM's factory in Suzhou. It was a Saturday so there were lots of visitors. We hired a private tour guide so we don't miss anything. She showed us all interesting sights, at least that was what she said.",
          "A bit off the beaten track, and not easy to explain to taxi drivers, but if you get the train to Lindun Lu you can follow the signs! Wonderful day out, definitely worth going in the spring for the blossoms and ducklings. It was rather busy, but then this is China and it is to",
          "It was raining and overrun with tours. We were able to see much of it but could not really enjoy it. It was designed for contemplation and that was not possible.",
          "The problem with this garden is that it is acctually in about every tour program of Suzhou which makes it completly overrun by ppl. This unfortunatly destroy a lot of the views and atmosphere",
          "This large garden/park is a popular site for locals and visitor from elsewhere in China. As a consequence it is best to avoid visiting on weekends and public holidays when it can be very crowded. It is a collection of old buildings, lakes, pathways and garden and as such is",

          "If you like gardens you will love this group of small individual gardens within the one garden. Our visit was in early April and blossoms were just peeking, another couple of weeks and the garden would have been in full bloom. The garden was busy and I can only imagine how busy",
          "It rained the day we visited the garden or more accurately, gardens. Despite the showers, it was crowded with Chinese armed with umbrellas. The gardens are pretty extensive, but lovely. Allow a couple of hours to see them all. There are also a couple of banzai gardens as well.",

          "We added Suzhou to our itinerary specifically because of the gardens for which it is famous. We only ended up visiting the most famous one -- the Humble Administrator's Garden. This was late in our trip, so we'd already visited Chinese Gardens at the Summer Palace in Beijing,",
          "The gardens are lovely but during our visit the place was so packed, which finally became a little unpleasant,",
          "Very beautiful with everything sculpted beautifully. Flowers, Banzai trees, pagodas, silk embroidery, ponds, stonework,bamboo all laid out perfectly",
          "I was enthralled. Every window in the large home faced a selected frame of the gardens as a painting. It was so informal then. We ate on the street sitting on Orange crates and had delicious food. They have no idea what they have lost in return for glitter. It was a magical day.",
          "There is really nothing humble about this place - so beautiful and peaceful - love the architecture and the gardens",

          "The most important point to drive home is to come here early. After 9:30 or so in the morning it gets exceedingly crowded with bus tour groups and flocks of school kids.",
          "It's nice, well designed but too crowded. I would suggest to start with the Lion Grove garden and walk back north to the Humble Administrator's Garden to go against the flow. Cheap food & silk along the way.",
          "This is probably one of the most famous gardens in Suzhou. It is also close to the Suzhou museum and the Dongbei pedestrian shopping street. The confluence of these attractions means it is also extremely crowded. This is a gorgeous garden especially for those looking to see a",
          "The garden is over a large plot and has a combination of open spaces and smaller more intimate area. Worth a visit as it is one of the main attractions in Suzhou, this dose however mean it can be quite busy. The size dose however mean that you can find a little space although",
          "This garden is a masterpiece. We visited in the coldest winter for 60 years and growth was obviously stunted, but the garden is still a wonderful sight. It is full of classical features and does not disappoint. The embroidery on show in one of the pavilions was remarkable as",
          "My second visit within 12 months but it is very pleasant since it is spring and the flowers are different. This is a classical garden with Chinese characteristics so it is odd when the authorities put in some western style flowers! The main problem in China for top tourist",
          "As soon as you step on the street leading to this venue, you will be hounded by touts trying to sell you tickets at a lower price. If you persevere and ignore them, the official ticket booth is only a few hundred meters ahead. There are many local tourists who come in droves.",
          "Perhaps the administrator was humble, but the garden is not. Vast expanse of artificial cliffs, lakes, large and small buidings, and not least trees, flowers, etc. Aesthetics to the highest power. Take your time to suck it all in. At least 2 hours, better 3. void chinese",
          "The gardens here are very well kept and would have been an ideal, peaceful paradise in the past. The Chinese Bonsai garden is amazing.",
          "Very tranquill gardens with a viewpoint round each corner. It wasn't very busy and workmen were repairing parts of the garden. We enjoyed looking at the bonsai trees.",
          "A lovely garden with a peaceful vibe. The story behind it is quite interesting; the 'humble' administrator was once a high ranking official for the emperor and he built the garden as a retirement home. The emperor had tasked him with routing out corruption, but he had",
          "I went from Shanghai to Suzhou just to see garden. It is quite nice to walk around. There are also good audio guides to rent, which I can recommend to do. The garden is not very big, so you are easily through within an hour including doing some photos and stops at the stores",

          "I don't have anything to compare this with, but it was nice walking around the garden here and certainly something worthwhile doing while you're in Suzhou. Despite a slightly hefty entrance fee, it can be crowded inside, but because of the way the gardens were designed with",
          "I picked up a map of the garden but soon discarded it in favour of just wandering, sitting, reflecting and enjoying. I have some minor mobility problems and have to use a stick but had no problem getting around. This would be more difficult for wheelchair users. Look out for",
          "Absolutely beautiful gardens, very much worth paying the entrance fee and walking around for an hour or so.",
          "Such cool place whole day went very smoothly , good location for photography ..best time march...nice time to spend herer",
          "Our trip to the garden was nice but very crowded. If you are looking for peaceful serenity this is not the place to go during CNY. It was jam packed and too early for the flowers to be in bloom. Despite our poor timing the garden was still very nice and we enjoyed the crowded",
          "Enjoyed this huge garden, again composed of many gardenets. It must be pretty in flower blooming season. Wish we had more time just to stroll every corner of this garden. Just following the main passage alone took so much time.",

        "wiki": "Lingering Garden (simplified Chinese: \u7559\u56ed; traditional Chinese: \u7559\u5712; pinyin: Li\u00fa Yu\u00e1n; Suzhou Wu: Leu yoe, Wu Chinese pronunciation: [l\u00f8\u028f \u0266y\u00f8]) is a renowned classical Chinese garden. It is located at 338 Liuyuan Rd. Suzhou, Jiangsu province, China (\u7559\u56ed\u8def338\u53f7). It is recognized with other classical Suzhou gardens as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 1997, the garden, along with other classical gardens in Suzhou, was recorded by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.  The garden also stores two UNESCO Intangible World Heritage Arts; Pingtan (\u8bc4\u5f39) and Guqin music.\n\n\n== History ==\nLingering Garden is located outside the Changmen gate (\u960a\u95e8) of Suzhou, Jiangsu province. It was commissioned by Xu Taishi (\u5f90\u6cf0\u65f6), an impeached and later exonerated official in 1593 CE. Stonemason Zhou Shicheng (\u5468\u65f6\u81e3) designed and built the East Garden (\u4e1c\u56ed) as it was initially called. The East Garden became famous in its day when the magistrates of Wu and Changzhou County both praised the design of Shi Ping Peak, a rockery constructed to resemble Tiantai Mountain in Putao.Ownership passed to Liu Su, another official in 1798 CE.  After extensive reconstruction, he renamed it Cold Green Village after a verse, \"clean cold color of bamboo, limpid green light of water\". Keeping with that theme, he added pine and bamboo groves. He was an avid collector of Scholar stones and added 12 more to the garden housing them in the \"stone forest\". It was also at this time the \"Celestial Hall of Five Peaks\" was built. The garden soon acquired the nickname \"Liu Yuan\" from the owner's surname. From 1823 CE the garden was open to public, and became a famed resort.Ownership passed to Sheng Kang, a provincial treasurer of Hubei in 1873 CE. He repaired the damaged caused to the garden by the chaos of the Taiping. After three years the reconstruction was complete in 1876 CE, and the garden was renamed to Liu Yuan (\u7559\u56ed). The name, while homophonous to an older name, connotes leisure and is thus pays tribute to the former owner as well as the resort period of the garden.  It was at this time the \"Auspicious Cloud Capped Peak\" stone was moved to its current location.  The garden was inherited by Sheng Xuanhuai from his father, he abandoned the garden in 1911 and it fell into disrepair\nDuring Sino-Japanese War, the garden was abandoned again, and it even degenerated into breeding zone for army's horses.  After establishment of the People's Republic of China, Suzhou government took over and renovated the garden.  It was reopened to the public in 1954.  In 2001 the garden was added to the UNESCO Word Heritage list, and remains a major tourist destination.\nSince its creation the Lingering Garden has been well received by critics and has inspired artists.  The East Garden is described and praised in Sketches of Gardens and Pavilions by Yuan Hongdao (magistrate of Changzhou County), \"...It is the best of its kind south of the Yangtze River.\" It was also described in the work Notes on the Hou Yue Tang by Jiang Yingke (magistrate of Wu County).  After the East Garden was transformed into the Lingering Garden it was again praised by Yu Yue in his Notes on Lingering Garden, \"The rockeries plants pavilions towers and halls are among the best in Wu County.\"\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe 23,310 m2 garden is divided into four distinctly themed sections; East, Central, West, and North.  The Central area is the oldest part of the garden.  Buildings, the primary feature of any Chinese garden, occupy one third of the total area.  A unique feature this garden is the 700 m covered walk which connects them.  The built elements of the garden are grouped by section.  The ensemble of structures in the central garden encircles a pond and grotto main feature.  The grotto is constructed of yellowstone granite and was created by the noted artist Zhou Binzhong. The eastern section of the garden is arrayed around the cloud-capped peak stone.  A central courtyard is ringing by buildings.  Behind the Old Hermit Scholars' House is the Small Court of Stone Forest, a collection of Scholar stones  and connected minor courtyards. The western section is mostly natural containing only a few pavilions, a large artificial hill, and a Penzai garden.\n\nDetails\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nPerformances\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese garden\nList of Chinese gardens\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nOfficial website of Lingering Garden, 2007, archived from the original on 2016-11-27, retrieved 2008-05-23\nMinistry of Culture, P.R.

        "wiki": "The Lion Grove Garden (simplified Chinese: \u72ee\u5b50\u6797\u56ed; traditional Chinese: \u7345\u5b50\u6797\u5712; pinyin: Sh\u012b Z\u01d0 L\u00edn Yu\u00e1n; Suzhou Wu: Sy tsy lin yoe, Wu Chinese pronunciation: [sz\u0329 tsz\u0329 lin \u0266y\u00f8]) is a garden located at 23 Yuanlin Road in Gusu District (formerly Pingjiang District), Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. The garden is famous for the large and labyrinthine grotto of taihu rocks at its center. The name of the garden is derived from the shape of these rocks, which are said to resemble lions. The garden is recognized with other classical gardens in Suzhou as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\"Of all the famous rock-gardens in history, only one has survived. This is the so-called 'Lion Garden' in Suzhou .\" The Lion Grove Garden was built in 1342 during the Yuan Dynasty by a Zen Buddhist monk, Wen Tianru, in memory of his teacher Abbot Zhongfeng. At that time the garden was part of the Bodhi Orthodox Monastery (\u83e9\u63d0\u6b63\u5b97).  The name of the garden is derived from the lion-shaped taihu rocks, which in turn were built as a reference to the symbolic lion in the Lion's Roar Sutra. According to a garden record of the Yuan dynasty, there were ten thousand bamboo plants and many eccentric rocks in the Lion Forest. Among those rocks, one peak of them looks like a lion, thus, the garden has named The Lion Forest Garden. The name also refers to the Lion Peak of Mount Tianmu in Lin'an City, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, where Abbot Zhongfeng attained nirvana. At that time, the garden was 6,670 m2 and was covered in rock and bamboo. After Wen Tianru's death, the garden fell into disrepair, but in 1589 another Buddhist monk, Mingxing, rebuilt the garden. The magistrate of Hengzhou bought the garden, and his son Huang Xi rebuilt the garden in 1771.\nThe garden's name was then changed to the 'Garden of Five Pines'. Starting in 1850, the garden fell into disrepair once again. In 1917, Shanghai pigment merchant, Bai Runsheng, grandfather of I. M. Pei, purchased the garden and finished the restoration in 1926. Many buildings and rocks in the garden have been preserved since the restoration. After the death of Bei Runsheng in 1945, the Lion Forest Garden was managed by his grandson Bei Hwanzhang. According to official signs posted in the garden, the Bei family \"donated\" the garden to the Chinese government in 1949. This words on the signs seem curious because all private property was nationalized by the Communist Party in the same year. The garden was not opened to the public until 1956.The garden's design attracted the attention of notable visitors, such as the painter Ni Zan, who created the painting Picture Scroll of Lion Grove in 1373. In 1703, the Kangxi Emperor visited the garden, and in 1765, the Qianlong Emperor also visited the garden and left a tablet True Delight personally inscribed by him as a gift. He also had a replica of the garden constructed in the Changchun garden of the Summer Palace and at the Chengde Mountain Resort.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe 1.1 ha garden is divided into two main parts, a housing complex and rockery around a central pond. In addition to the 22 buildings the garden also houses 25 tablets, 71 steles, 5 carved wooden screens, and 13 ancient specimen trees, some dating back to the Yuan Dynasty. The garden is most famous for its elaborate grotto of taihu rocks. This 1154 m2 grotto contains a maze of 9 paths winding through 21 caves across 3 levels. The pond divides the grotto into the east and west sections. The formal entrance to the western section is called the Eight Diagram Tactics located across the Jade Mirror Bridge from the Pointing at Cypress Hall. The taihu stone peaks are located atop this grotto. The most famous attraction in the grotto is the Lion Peak, surrounded by four other stones - sandesh bansal, Xuan Yu, Tu Yue, and Ang Xiao - which collectively form the Famous Five Peaks. There is a folktale about two immortals, Iron-Crutch Li and L\u00fc Dongbin, who wandered into the maze of the Lion Grove and lost their way, after which they settled in a cave to play chess.\n\nRockery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese garden\nSuzhou\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nSuzhou Mingcheng Information Port Co., LTD, The Lion Grove Garden, archived from the original on 2008-11-21, retrieved 2009-04-30China Internet Information Center (June 24, 2004), Shizilin (Lion Grove Garden), retrieved 2009-04-30Terebess LLC (June 24, 2004), The Lion Grove Garden, retrieved 2009-09-24World Cultural Heritage (2004), The Classical Gardens of Suzhou, CIP, p. 217, ISBN 7-214-03763-7, archived from the original on 2009-11-25, retrieved 2020-02-28\nMontreal Architecture Review (2018), Between Dream and Shadow: The Aesthetic Change Embodied by the Garden of Lion Grove, p. 19, retrieved 2020-02-07\n\n\n== External links ==\nAsian Historical architecture (June 24, 2004), The Lion Grove Garden, retrieved 2009-11-04Cultural China (June 24, 2004), The Lion Grove Garden, archived from the original on January 27, 2010, retrieved 2009-11-04University of Alberta (2009), Complete View of the Lion Grove, archived from the original on 2011-07-06, retrieved 2009-11-04\nClassical Gardens of Suzhou, UNESCO's official website on World Heritage site.",

          "This was so much fun. It is a garden full of rock formations that create tunnels and bridges. You can wander around and be 10 feet from someone but with all the maze features not be able get to each other without quite a bit of walking. My son loved this place, it was an",

          "We visited during an afternoon of a public holiday so it was extremely crowded so it was not enjoyable. It was fun climbing up and down the rocks but there did not seem to be any easy way of getting out of the rock maze. We would definitely want to visit again on a weekday to",

          "It was a long day seeing the many spectacular gardens of Suzhou. After a very late lunch the family was tired and very much on garden overload. Still, though, the Lion Grove was nearby and based on what we read, this one was small and not as highly rated as the other gardens.",
          "Of the many Classical Chinese gardens we have visited, this one was our favorite. The complexity of the pathway is astounding. The giant rockery maze is the largest I know of in Suzhou, a city renowned in the People\u2019s Republic as a paradise on Earth because of its fine gardens.",

          "I visited this garden with a Chinese friend. It was really interesting, even in winter. In the Spring I think it will be wonderful. The rock mazes are pretty unique. Highly recommended in Suzhou.",
          "After visiting the Humble Administrator's garden, I thought this would be an anti-climax. In fact it's only about 350 metres away although the signage is poor. As a surprise to me it was quite different, smaller of course but featuring rock formations and rock mazes. It's easy",
          "I went on a weekday, so the crowd wasn't too bad. There were many rocks that are on exhibition, and good that there are both Chinese and English explanations as well. The entrance fee was I think 30RMB.",

          "This garden has many fun nooks and crannies for exploring from all of the unique rock structures, making it quite unique among the gardens in Suzhou. For this reason, however, it can become very congested when there is a crowd, so I would recommend not going here during the",

          "This is one of the only Zen gardens remaining in China, started in the 14th century and now a World heritage site. It is a graceful collection of gardens, ponds, highly decorated halls and rock gardens. It is very beautiful and relaxing - well worth a visit.",

          "Went here expecting to see more ornamental effects, but essentially a lotus pool surrounded by four different types of rocks, brought to the site from other parts of china. Not much information in English or a guidebook available. Notwithstanding, well laid out and lots of",
          "I visited Suzhou in June 2017. The Lion Forest Garden or Lion Grove Garden has very interesting rock formations. But if you are not careful you can hit your head as I did. The Lion Forest Garden and the Humble Administrator's Garden are located near each other - a ten-minute",

          "Really enjoyed the place though small but nice place to take photos and to move around. Going up and down the beautiful rocks and moving in and through the small caves. Preferred this to Humble Administrator's Garden. Worth going!",
          "I was afraid all of the Suzhou gardens would be the same, but it was different from the Humble Administrator's Garden to make it worth the trip if you're in Suzhou. It wasn't as crowded either.",
          "The history of this place is very interesting and the whole garden is huge with a lot of roads. The buildings are beautiful - definitely worth visiting!!!",

          "We actually went to the Lion Forest Garden instead of the Humble Administrator's Garden, because it was half the price! It's smaller, but it was really nice to walk round. If you've been to Yu Yuan in Shanghai it's quite similar. Lots of pretty pavilions and walkways, and a rock",
          "The garden was extremely beautiful, but I went on a weekend and the amount of Chinese tourists was simply crazy. There were tour guides everywhere screaming through their microphones and all the tourists spoil all the shots that I was trying to take. It would have been beautiful",
          "For me it's the best park in Suzhou. The place with deep historical and cultural roots, many tourists but at the same time beautiful and peaceful. The right place to feel the time and garden culture. You can come here when it rains or when it's hot, the park will be different.",
          "Even on a Monday the garden was overrun with tours and competing guides who seem to be seeing who can be louder. It is worth seeing the rock formations.",
          "This being one of the places which should not be missed in Suzhou at any cost. Although there are no lions but it requires a lot of imagination to connect the lake extracted rocks to consider in shape of lions. Beautiful gardens which screams about the ancient China's tradition",
          "It has the typical chinese style yet its own unique charm when it comes to architecture. Each room each garden were built with deep meaning behind. I love the flower trees there. Sometimes the real scenery does look like a painting, just as how people who built it wanted it to",
          "A famous family used to live here and maintain it at a very nice level. It's a good way to experience the traditional Chinese garden inside Lion Forest Garden. And the free tour is highly recommended, without the tour, it's just a normal garden like others.",
          "We went to the Couple's Garden, the Humble Administrator and this one. We liked this the most although it did have crowds. The views framed by the different vantage points were great.",

        "wiki": "Suzhou (Chinese: \u82cf\u5dde; Suzhounese pronunciation: [s\u0259u ts\u00f8\u028f], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [s\u00fa.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u]), alternately romanized as Soochow, is a major city located in southeastern Jiangsu Province of East China, about 100 km (62 mi) northwest of Shanghai. It is a major economic center and focal point of trade and commerce, and the second largest city in the province, after its capital Nanjing. The city is situated on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the shores of Lake Tai and belongs to the Yangtze River Delta region. Administratively, Suzhou is a prefecture-level city with a population of 4.33 million in its city proper, and a total resident population (as of 2013) of 10.58 million in its administrative area. Its urban population grew at an unprecedented rate of 6.5% between 2000 and 2014, which is the highest among cities with more than 5 million people.Founded in 514 BC, Suzhou has over 2,500 years of history, with an abundant display of relics and sites of historical interest. Around AD 100, during the Eastern Han dynasty, it became one of the ten largest cities in the world mostly due to emigration from Northern China. Since the 10th-century Song dynasty, it has been an important commercial center of China. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Suzhou was a national economic, cultural, and commercial center, as well as the largest non-capital city in the world, until the 1860 Taiping Rebellion. When Li Hongzhang and Charles George Gordon recaptured the city three years later, Shanghai had already taken its predominant place in the nation. Since major economic reforms began in 1978, Suzhou has become one of the fastest growing major cities in the world, with GDP growth rates of about 14% in the past 35 years. With high life expectancy and per capita incomes, Suzhou's Human Development Index ratings is roughly comparable to a moderately developed country, making it one of the most highly developed and prosperous cities in China.The city's canals, stone bridges, pagodas, and meticulously designed gardens have contributed to its status as one of the top tourist attractions in China. The Classical Gardens of Suzhou were added to the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1997 and 2000. Suzhou is often dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" or \"Venice of China\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nDuring the Zhou, a settlement known as Gusu after nearby Mount Gusu (simplified Chinese: \u59d1\u82cf\u5c71; traditional Chinese: \u59d1\u8607\u5c71; pinyin: G\u016bs\u016bsh\u0101n) became the capital of the state of Wu. From this role, it also came to be called Wu as well. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu established a new capital nearby at Hel\u00fc City and this grew into the modern city. During the Warring States period, Hel\u00fc City continued to serve as the local seat of government. From the areas it administered, it became known as Wuxian (lit. \"Wu County\") and Wujun (\"Wu Commandery\"). Under the Qin, it was known as Kuaiji after its greatly enlarged commandery, which was named for the reputed resting place of Yu the Great near modern Shaoxing in Zhejiang.\nThe name Suzhou was first officially used for the city in AD 589 during the Sui dynasty. The s\u016b (\u8607 or \u82cf) in its name is a contraction of the old name Gusu. It refers to the mint perilla (shiso). The zhou \u5dde originally meant something like a province or county (cf. Guizhou), but often came to be used metonymously for the capital of such a region (cf. Guangzhou, Hangzhou, etc.). Suzhou is the Hanyu Pinyin spelling of the Putonghua pronunciation of the name. Prior to the adoption of pinyin, it was variously romanized as Soo-chow, Suchow, or Su-chow.\n\n\n== History ==\nSuzhou, the cradle of Wu culture, is one of the oldest towns in the Yangtze Basin. By the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou, local tribes named the Gou Wu are recorded living in the area which would become the modern city of Suzhou. These tribes formed villages on the edges of the hills above the wetlands surrounding Lake Tai.\nSima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian records traditional accounts that the Zhou lord Taibo established the state of Wu at nearby Wuxi during the 11th century BC, civilizing the local people and improving their agriculture and mastery of irrigation. The Wu court later moved to Gusu within the area of modern Suzhou. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu relocated his court nearby and called the settlement Hel\u00fc City after himself. His minister Wu Zixu was closely involved with its planning and it was this site that grew into present-day Suzhou. The height of his tower on Gusu Hill (Gusutai) passed into Chinese legend. In 496 BC, King Hel\u00fc was buried at Tiger Hill. In 473 BC, Wu was defeated and annexed by Yue, a kingdom to its southeast; Yue was annexed in turn by Chu in 306 BC. Remnants of the ancient kingdom include pieces of its 2,500-year-old city wall and the gate through it at Pan Gate.\nThe city was originally laid out according to a symbolic three-by-three grid of nine squares, with the royal palace occupying the central position.During the Warring States period, Suzhou was the seat of Wu County and Commandery. Following the Qin Empire's conquest of the area in 222 BC, it was made the capital of Kuaiji Commandery, including lands stretching from the south bank of the Yangtze to the unconquered interior of Minyue in southern Zhejiang. Amid the collapse of the Qin, Kuaiji's governor Yin Tong attempted to organize his own rebellion only to be betrayed and executed by Xiang Liang and his nephew Xiang Yu, who launched their own rebellion from the city.\nWhen the Grand Canal was completed, Suzhou found itself strategically located on a major trade route. In the course of the history of China, it has been a metropolis of industry and commerce on the southeastern coast of China. During the Tang dynasty, the great poet Bai Juyi constructed the Shantang Canal (better known as \"Shantang Street\") to connect the city with Tiger Hill for tourists. In AD 1035, the Suzhou Confucian Temple was founded by famed poet and writer Fan Zhongyan. It became a venue for the imperial civil examinations and then developed into the modern Suzhou High School in the 1910s.\n\nIn February 1130, the advancing Jin army from the north ransacked the city. This was followed by the Mongol invasion in 1275. In 1356, Suzhou became the capital of Zhang Shicheng, one of the leaders of the Red Turban Rebellion against the Yuan dynasty and the self-proclaimed King of Wu. In 1367, Zhang's Nanjing-based rival Zhu Yuanzhang took the city after a 10-month siege. Zhu \u2013 who was soon to proclaim himself the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty \u2013 demolished the royal city in the center of Suzhou's walled city and imposed crushing taxes on the city and prefecture's powerful families. Despite the heavy taxation and the resettlement of some of Suzhou's prominent citizens' to the area of Hongwu's capital at Nanjing, Suzhou was soon prosperous again. During the early Ming, Suzhou Prefecture supervised the Yangtze shoals which later became Shanghai's Chongming Island. For centuries the city, with its surroundings as an economic base, represented an extraordinary source of tax revenue.When the shipwrecked Korean official Choe Bu had a chance to see much of Eastern China from Zhejiang to Liaoning on his way home in 1488, he described Suzhou in his travel report as exceeding every other city. Many of the area's private gardens were constructed by the gentry of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Taipings captured the city in 1860, however, and many of its former buildings and gardens were \"almost... a heap of ruins\" by the time of their recovery by Charles Gordon's Ever-Victorious Army in November 1863. Nonetheless, by 1880, its population was estimated to have recovered to about 500,000, which remained stable for the next few decades. In the late 19th century, the town was particularly known for its wide range of silks and its Chinese-language publishing industry. The town was first opened to direct foreign trades by the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending the First Sino-Japanese War and by the most favored nation clauses of earlier unequal treaties with the Great Powers. The new expatriates opened a European-and-Chinese school in 1900 and the Suzhou railway station, connecting it with Shanghai, opened on July 16, 1906. Just prior to the World War I, there were 7000 silk looms in operation, as well as a cotton mill and a large trade in rice.\n\nAs late as the early 20th century, much of the city consisted of islands connected by rivers, creeks, and canals to the surrounding countryside. Prior to their demolition, the city walls ran in a circuit of about 10 miles (16 km) with four large suburbs lying outside. The Japanese invaded in 1937, and many gardens were again devastated by the end of the war. In the early 1950s, restoration was done on the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Lingering Garden.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe urban core of Suzhou is informally called the \"Old Town\". It is Gusu District. Suzhou Industrial Park is to the east of the old town, and Suzhou High & New Technology Development Zone is to the west. In 2000, the original Wu County was divided into two districts including Xiangcheng and Wuzhong. They now form the northern and southern parts of the city of Suzhou.In 2012, the original Wujiang City became Wujiang District of Suzhou City.\nSuzhou is one of the most prosperous cities in China. Its development has a direct correlation with the growth of its satellite cities, including Kunshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Zhangjiagang, which together with the city of Suzhou form the Suzhou prefecture. The Suzhou prefecture is home to many high-tech enterprises.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSuzhou is on the Lake Tai Plain south of the Yangtze River, about 100 km (60 mi) to the west of Shanghai and just over 200 km (120 mi) east of Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSuzhou has a four-season humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and cool, cloudy, damp winters with occasional snowfall (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa). Northwesterly winds blowing from Siberia during winter can cause temperatures to fall below freezing at night, while southerly or southwesterly winds during the summer can push temperatures above 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The hottest temperature recorded since 1951 was at 41.0 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) on 7 August 2013, and the lowest at \u22129.8 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958.\n\n\n== Cityscape and environment ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Classical Gardens of Suzhou ===\n\nSuzhou is famous for its over 60 Classical Gardens, collectively a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city has the Most UNESCO-recognized gardens in the world.The Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden are among the four most famous classical gardens in China. The Canglang Pavilion, Lion Grove Garden, Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden, respectively representing the garden styles of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, are called the four most famous gardens in Suzhou. Other gardens inscribed on the World Heritage List include the Couple's Retreat Garden, the Garden of Cultivation, and the Retreat and Reflection Garden.\n\n\n=== Temples ===\nHanshan Temple\nXiyuan Temple\nXuanmiao Temple\nLingyanshan Temple\nChongyuan Temple\nTaipingfang Mosque (\u592a\u5e73\u574a\u6e05\u771f\u5bfa)\n\n\n=== Canals and historic districts ===\n\nThe Suzhou section of the Jiangnan Canal, Grand Canal (China), includes ten city gates and over 20 stone bridges of traditional design and historic areas that have been well preserved, as well as temples and pavilions. \n There are a full 24 waterways in Suzhou near the Grand Canal.In 2015, both 800-year-old Pingjiang Road Historical Block (\u5e73\u6c5f\u8def) and 1,200-year-old Shantang Street Scenic Area (\u5c71\u5858\u8857) were added to the list of China's \"National Historic and Cultural Streets\".Pingjiang Road runs parallel to the Pingjiang River for 1.5 kilometers and is lined with homes and some teahouses. Shantang Street, over twice as long at 3.8 km, is described by the BBC as  retaining \"the alluring qualities of an old canal-side street: whitewashed buildings are completed by red-tasselled lanterns that swing softly in the breeze, adding to the charm of the river bank\".\n\nBoat tours are offered on the waterways of this city that was dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" by Marco Polo because of its criss-crossing canals and stone bridges. The Grand Canal (from Beijing to Zhejiang province) is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Resorts and natural reserves ===\nSuzhou Taihu National Tourism and Vacation Zone (\u82cf\u5dde\u592a\u6e56\u56fd\u5bb6\u65c5\u6e38\u5ea6\u5047\u533a) is in the western part of Suzhou, 15 km (9 mi) from the city center.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nGate to the East is a 301.8 meter, 74-story skyscraper in Suzhou's central business district, built in 2015 at a cost of 700 million USD and is currently the tallest building in Suzhou.\n\n\n=== Pan Gate ===\nPan Gate is on the southwest corner of the Main Canal or encircling canal of Suzhou. Originally built during the Warring States Period in the state of Wu, historians estimate it to be around 2,500 years old. It is now part of the Pan Gate Scenic Area. It is known for the \"three landmarks of Pan Gate\". They are the Ruiguang Pagoda, the earliest pagoda in Suzhou built in 247 BC, the Wu Gate Bridge, the entrance to the gate at that time over the water passage and the highest bridge in Suzhou at the time, and the Pan Gate. The Ruigang Pagoda is constructed of brick with wooden platforms and has Buddhist carvings at its base.\n\n\n=== Baodai Bridge ===\nBaodai Bridge stretches across the Tantai Lake in the suburbs of Suzhou. To raise money to finance the bridge, the magistrate donated his expensive belt, hence the name. The bridge was first built in 806 A.D. in the Tang Dynasty and has 53 arches with a length of 317 meters. It was made out of stone from Jinshan Mountain and is the longest standing bridge of its kind in China. The bridge was included on the list of national monuments (resolution 5-285) in 2001.\n\n\n=== Tiger Hill ===\nThe Tiger Hill is known for its natural environment and historical sites. The hill is so named because it is said to look like a crouching tiger. Another legend states that a white tiger appeared on the hill to guard it following the burial The hill has been a tourist destination for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, as is evident from the poetry and calligraphy carved into rocks on the hill. The Song Dynasty poet, Su Shi said, \"It is a lifelong pity if having visited Suzhou you did not visit Tiger Hill.\"\n\n\n=== Pagodas ===\nYunyan Pagoda (or Huqiu Tower) built in 961 is a Chinese pagoda built on Tiger Hill in Suzhou. It has several other names, including the \"Leaning Tower of China\" (as referred to by historian O.G. Ingles) and the Yunyan Temple Tower. The tower rises to a height of 47 m (154 ft). It is a seven-story octagonal building built with blue bricks. In more than a thousand years the tower has gradually slanted due to forces of nature. Now the top and bottom of the tower vary by 2.32 meters. The entire structure weighs some 7,000,000 kilograms (15,000,000 lb), supported by internal brick columns. However, the tower leans roughly 3 degrees due to the cracking of two supporting columns.Beisi Pagoda or North Temple Pagoda is a Chinese pagoda at Bao'en Temple in Suzhou. It rises nine stories in a height of 76 m (249 ft). It is the tallest Chinese pagoda south of the Yangtze river.\nTwin Pagodas (\u82cf\u5dde\u53cc\u5854) lie in the Dinghui Temple Lane in the southeastern corner of the city proper of Suzhou. They are artistic and natural as they are close at hand. One of them is called Clarity-Dispensing Pagoda and the other Beneficence Pagoda and they are in the same form of building. There are many legends about the one-thousand-year-old pagodas. It is charming that the exquisite and straight Twin Pagoda look like two inserted writing brushes. There was originally a single-storey house with three rooms just like a writing brush holder with the shadows of the two pagodas reclining on its roof at sunset. To the east of the pagoda is a square five-storeyed bell building built in the Ming Dynasty which is exactly like a thick ink stick. So there is a saying that \"the Twin Pagodas are as writing brushes while the bell building as ink stick\".\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city's major museums include the Suzhou Museum (designed by I. M. Pei), Suzhou Silk Museum, and Suzhou Museum of Opera and Theatre.\n\n\n=== Hospitals ===\nAs a result of its recent rapid population increase, healthcare demand in Suzhou is increasing rapidly. In July 2019, Washington University School of Medicine announced a collaboration with Huici Health Management Co., and the Xiangcheng District, to open the new Huici Medical Center, which will include a 1,000-bed hospital for adult and pediatric patients. Once the hospital is unveiled, Washington University doctors in St. Louis will be able to provide long-distance health-care services to patients in China through a telemedicine program.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Suzhou is predominantly Han Chinese. The official language of broadcast, instruction, etc. is Mandarin Chinese, although many speak a local dialect known as Suzhounese, a member of the Wu language family. In addition to American and European expatriates, there is a large Korean community in Suzhou. The Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) estimated that there were 15,000 Koreans in the municipality in 2014. That year 850 Korean companies operated in Suzhou, and the Koreans made up the largest number of students at the Suzhou Singapore International School.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nSuzhou's economy is based primarily on its large manufacturing sector\u2014China's second largest\u2014including iron and steel, IT and electronic equipment, and textile products. The city's service sector is notably well-developed, primarily owing to tourism, which brought in a total of RMB 152 billion of revenue in 2013. Suzhou's overall GDP exceeded RMB 1.3 trillion in 2013 (up 9.6 percent from the year previous).The city is also one of China's foremost destinations for foreign investment, based on its relative proximity to Shanghai and comparatively low operating costs. The municipal government has enacted various measures to encourage FDI in a number of manufacturing (e.g. pharmaceutical, electronic goods, automobile) and service (e.g. banking, logistics, research services) sectors. Included among these measures is a preferential tax policy for limited partnership venture capital enterprises in the Suzhou Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Development zones ===\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park ====\n\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) is the largest cooperative project between the Chinese and Singaporean governments. It is beside Jinji Lake, which lies to the east of the Suzhou Old City. On 26 February 1994, Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew represented China and Singapore respectively in signing the Agreement to jointly develop Suzhou Industrial Park (originally called the Singapore Industrial Park). The project officially commenced on 12 May in the same year. SIP has a jurisdiction area of 288 km2 (111 sq mi), of which, the China-Singapore cooperation area covers 80 km2 (31 sq mi) with a planned residential population of 1.2 million.SIP is home to the Suzhou Dushu Lake Science and Education Innovation District, an area of universities and higher education institutions, including Soochow University and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. Suzhou Industrial Park is also a popular residential district for many foreigners who work and live in Suzhou, as well as 'new Suzhou' residents who migrated to the area in search of work opportunities.\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park Export Processing Zone ====\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park Export Processing Zone was approved to be established by the government in April 2000, with a planning area of 2.9 km2 (1.1 sq mi).

It is served by the Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway (mostly \"conventional\" trains to points throughout China) and the Shanghai-Nanjing intercity railway (high-speed D- and G-series trains providing frequent service primarily between Shanghai and Nanjing). It takes only 25 minutes to reach Shanghai railway station on the fastest G-series trains and less than 1 hour to Nanjing.\nThe Suzhou North railway station, a few kilometers to the north, is on the Beijing\u2013Shanghai high-speed railway (opened 2011), served by high-speed trains to Beijing, Qingdao, etc.\nOther stations on the Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway and the Shanghai\u2013Nanjing intercity railway serve other points in the same corridor within Suzhou Prefecture-level city, such as Kunshan. In and between Suzhou and Kunshan South railway station, Suzhou Industrial Park railway station now also becomes an important station for people visiting and living in the areas.\nThe northern part of the city, including such county-level cities as Zhangjiagang, Changshu and Taicang, presently has no rail service. However, plans exist for a cross-Yangtze railway from Nantong to the Shanghai metropolitan area (the Shanghai\u2013Nantong railway), which will run through most of these county-level cities. Construction work is expected to start in 2013 and to take five and a half years.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nThe Nanjing-Shanghai Expressway connects Suzhou with Shanghai, alternatively, there is the Yangtze Riverine Expressway and the Suzhou-Jiaxing-Hangzhou Expressway.

By the 13th century, Suzhou was already the center of the profitable silk trade.\nSong brocade: Suzhou's Song brocade, with its flashy colors, exquisite patterns, strong and soft texture, is one of China's three famous brocades, together with Nanjing Yun brocade and Sichuan Shu brocade. Suzhou's brocade production can be traced back to the Five Dynasties. It prospered in the Song Dynasty. After the government moved the capital southward, the country's political and cultural center moved to the Yangtze River area. To cope with the special need of artists, a type of very thin brocade for decorating paintings emerged in Suzhou. These brocades and paintings have been preserved.

          "I've seen some museums in China that have objects with dubious authenticity, but these items seem genuine. I made it through the new building quite quickly and was mildly disappointed with the range of silks, paintings and carved jade etc, but then realised i was able to go",

          "The museum exhibits aren't great, however it's worth a trip purely for the architecture of the building. Combine the trip here with Ping jan road and Humble Administrator's garden as they are all in the same area and together they make for a good day out. Expect big queues on",
          "The museum was just ok compared to other museums we have visited in China. The building design was interesting. The walk from the Linden Lu Metro station (Exit 1) was about 20 minutes. I would definitely not stand in a queue or make a special trip to this museum.",
          "Boring museum with not much to offer. There are larger museums in Suzhou that are worth checking out.

          "I love museums but Suzhou Museum somehow left me cold. I know people rave about it and it's free but we found it a little boring. The ceramics and pottery are great but the interior has begun to look a little shabby and it's tough to see anything when the ambience is ruined by",

          "This is one of the few attractions that has free entry for visitors, so expect a long queue especially during peak travel season. The queue is also because the museum practices crowd control which you will appreciate, as if there are too many people in the building, you will be",
          "The Suzhou Museum is quite a popular attraction, though I must say that the lines to get inside can be a bit daunting. If you have kids then best to avoid... and be outdoor instead. Though if you must then you'll quite like the trip down memory lane inside with the artefacts.",
          "Basically go there and enjoy this masterpiece of architecture. The exposition is not the best one that you can find in many other museums around china, quite disappointed. The good thing is that the access it's for free, you will need to queue little bit, but not so long it",
          "The design of the Suzhou Museum is totally different from other ordinary museum. There are no rounded shaped design, just straight lines and hexagonal patterns. Really love the design and also the exhibition inside about Suzhou's history.",

          "Chilled place during the weekdays, admission is also free which was great. There were a lot of interesting items on display and the souvenir shop was not expensive for purchasing stuff. Weekends don't work for me because of the crazy long queues that is why I went on a weekday",

          "Suzhou Museum made it on my list of things to do because I.M. Pei designed it. Little did I know the collection and exhibits are exquisite - a good way to learn Chinese history too! I only had an hour to spend but an ideal visit would be at least 3-4 hours so you can leisurely",
          "Firstly, it is a FREE museum. But you must RESERVE your tickets/time slot online or else line up for a long while. Review: The building itself is a work of art by a renowned architect. (He also did the reverse pyramids in the louvre) Upon entering, the layout is a bit confusing",

          "Designed by world Famous Architect Mr Pei , this is a must see museum when in Sushou. This was recommended to us by a friend who had been their about a month before we arrived. Even the grandchildren enjoyed walking thru and seeing the exhibits and gardens",
          "Nice to visit on weekdays not so many people queue up. Start in the morning is recommended as you need to spend so much time to enjoy all these nice items . If you need to take a break can also order cup of tea at the cafe inside. Book mark as souvenirs will be welcome by all",

          "As most museums in China, this one was free, so it is well worth a visit if you have the time. The building hosting it is pretty modern, from the same architect who build Louvre's pyramids, Leoh Ming Pei and interesting in itself. The museum hosts a decent collection of local",

          "I basically planned my trip to Suzhou to see Pei's labour of love. It didn't disappoint. Lovely lines of the buildings inside and out. I think the building maybe more interesting than the collection which is saying something as the collection is wonderful. The exit through",

          "Suzhou Museum is one of the best museums in East China. I say this not because the museums are better or worse elsewhere in China, but because I've visited too few cities in the north to make a conclusion. To start off, the admission is FREE! You may have to wait for 15",

          "The line starts early as they only let in a restricted number of visitors at once but that made for a lovely experience. Plan for a 2-hour visit through this museum",
          "This is a very famous museum, mostly because it was designed by I.M. Pei. We had to line up for more than two hours in a 90 degree temperature before being able to enter it. The architecture follows that style of the Suzhou gardens. It is simple and reminds one of a zen",
          "If Suzhou is your only stop in China, or if you're a huge fan of Chinese art, this might be a good stop. Otherwise, not worth the queue. To me (admittedly as someone who's not a fan of traditional art), it was very similar to the art museums in other Chinese cities, just smaller.",
          "Excellent museum going through the history of Suzhou and the Jiangsu area. Excellent exhibits with priceless antiques and historical items on display. Has free guided tours of the museum. More difficult to get a tour guide then other tourist areas in Suzhou, so might be a little",

          "the museum is a masterclass in architecture through updating a traditional language to is contemporary form. the collection is not that impressive, however of the China lovers it will make evident the rich and colourful tradition of this country. Do stroll through the gardens",
          "This museum is a hidden gem. It contains relics from the Warring States, 1,000 years BC. Of course, this is China and you'll uncover cultural relics easily on any excavation. You'll appreciate Suzhou and its historical significance a lot more than before.",
          "Really enjoyed the Suzhou Museum. New building to house the exhibited art. This museum uses arts of various kinds from the bronze age to present to tell the history of China and the Wu Era in this Yangtze River delta area. Labeling of exhibits is fantastic, so one gets the",

          "Designed by IM Pei, the building itself is a wonderful thing to look at. The exhibits were equally interesting and historically significant. The museum has free entry so expect large crowds. Top tip: A neat tip to beat the crowds is to book online. Hardly anyone does this,",
          "The Suzhou museum is located very near the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Lion Forest Garden. The building itself is modern and famously designed by the celebrated IM Pei and worth a quick duck-in just for that. The number of exhibits is pretty small, so you can complete",
          "For me, while there are certainly treasures inside, the highlight of the museum is the building itself. World renowned architect, I. M. Pei, is originally from the region and designed this museum as a tribute to the city's unique history. The design is meant to blend his modern",
          "The museum is designed by I. M. Pei and looks very different from his famous work at the Louvre. The architecture combines traditional Suzhou beauty with modern design philosophy. Also, the collection in the museum is interesting and worth seeing. The porcelain collection is",
          "It's free of charge. Nice exhibits if you are interested in Chinese cultures & history. It has a great architecture outside the museum for some photo-taking too.",
          "It's nice to visit it since it's free of charge, but the collection is not that worthy looking. There is a house next to it, it is related to Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. I think it is great to visit for those who are interested in History of China.",
          "You could not come to Suzhou and miss this new(ish) museum. Proof positive that the modern China has not pigeon holed it's past and sees strong links between the Ming and Qing dynasties and the contemporary art and culture of the China today. I appreciate that is a sweeping",
          "The Suzhou museum was designed by IM Pei; this said, you will probably gain a great deal of additional enjoyment if you can hunt down and watch the American Masters program about the building and design of the museum. My favorite part is the rock sculpture out in the garden that",
          "We visited this museum as part of a Sinorama tour group. It was very lovely . .. loved the local artists working there and creating their art. After a wee bit of a tour, we were given free time to explore and take photos. It is a photographer's delight as you visit the",
          "A small museum designed by the famous Chinese American architect I. M. Pei. Suzhou is the childhood home of Pei and so it was home coming for Pei after almost 70 years! The architecture is more impressive than the exhibits inside....",
          "This museum I had to go to twice to get everything photographed as I ran out of space on my phone. Some areas are not supposed to be photographed but they don't mind so much so long as you do not use a flash.",
          "This is a wonderful modern interpretation of the ancient Chinese architecture. The use of modern materials to allow the natural light throughout the entire building is a real credit to the architect.",
          "The architecture is very modern with some good collections since Suzhou was once an important region in several dynasties. There is also some collection from Tiger Hill Pagoda and seasonal exhibition from other museums, though the collections are less than the one in Shanghai.",
          "Very contemporary architecture by I . Pei, With many interesting exhibits. Museum garden is different and good, though not a place to sit and relax.",
          "Modern design perfectly blended in the centre of old Suzhou city, Suzhou Museum is a definite must go place when visiting. They do host good exhibitions, sometimes great ones (if you are lucky). But, just the architecture itself its worth going to see. Love the place.",
          "The use of only grey, black and white are dominant foor the area. The buildings itself do show you al lot of history.A real museum!",
          "The collections are modest in number but of excellent quality. The building is an IM Pei gem, beautiful to look at and very easy to move around in. All museums should be designed in this linear flowing pattern, with simple rooms that let the art shine. A lovely way to spend a",
          "The Suzhou museum is located in the centre of the old town.It is modern building witch nice to see as well.There collection is mostly pottery but gives you a good impression of the historie off Chinese pottery.",
          "The building of the Suzhou Museum was designed very beautifully and the exhibits are good, also mostly described in English. We only visited because it was right next to the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Suzhou Garden Museum, and we were positively surprised.",
          "There are only two buildings by I.M. Pei. The XiangShan Hotel in Beijing is the only other one. However the later modification by the locals leaves only traces of the brilliance of the original design. This museum is the true master piece. It blends the new construction and the",
          "Being a connoisseur of fine art irrespective of genre being that I have spent the past 35 years buying and selling puts me into a better place to know the good points versus the bad even if I do not always understand what I am looking at. Where the Suzhou Museum deserves some",
          "I think the courtyard outside is maybe the coolest thing about the place, but seeing as it's free it doesn't hurt to also take a wander around the place. It has relics from some of the pagodas and other sites, so I would put this more toward the end of your visit so you can",
          "IM Pei designed, traditional outside, traditional and modern inside. Good regional collections and relics. Good to combine with the gardens visit in the old district.",
          "We stopped over here because of the rain and decided to just tour around a little since it is free anyway. Happened to catch one of the free guided tours offered by museum volunteers at different intervals in the day. The guide we got was surnamed Hua and was well-versed in",
          "The collections are really poor for a \"museum\". i think the building is beautiful. there are many vendors around the museum. Watch out for the prices. they may cheat on you",
          "This museum is free, with a fast-moving queue, and lovely spaces that refresh the soul. You should feel free to view as much or as little as you like at any one time, and return often during your visit to Suzhou. Bring fish food for the lovely carp in the pond. The coffee shop",
          "Suzhou has a very long history and was a very important place in history, so I think it should have many items to display, but it's pity that it don't have any of its famous garden, opera, the architecture; and only a little about the silk; which I think are the most important",
          "There were a number of Trip Advisor reviews of the Museum that prompted us to go. The museum is a very pleasant experience, but because it is free I do not recommend going on Holidays - the line will be very long and the exhibits crowded. What my wife and I most enjoyed was",
          "The museum offered a good mix of modern and traditional Chinese culture, as well as well presented history (and demonstration) of Suzhou-styled gardens. The experience was completely spoiled by the ticket touts around the main street though. They try to stop everyone on their",
          "I have lived in Suzhou many years, yet never went. So my friend took me and I was surprised as it is actually free...You may need to wait in line, but the line moves fast...I recommend you check it out, as the place is designed beautiful, really cool and even the standard part",
          "Beautiful architecture and full of culture and history of Suzhou. The painting rooms are not large, but they house a small variety of paintings. There are ceramics and local ethnic exhibitions as well. Well thought out with a modern design based on old traditions. Definitely",
          "Great place and the only attraction in Suzhou that we have found that has free entrance. An amazing structure and full of amazing artefacts going back to 7000BC. Some wonderful art and fabrics and a real eye opener to the culture that has existed for so very long. The Garden and",
          "I love the mix of modern and traditional with the architecture of this building. By the way, the museum was designed by the same man who designed the glass pyramid at the Louve in Paris, as well as the Suzhou railway station. The garden inside is a paradise in the middle of",
          "The architecture of this places was charming and unique. The exhibits however, were nothing to rave about... abit under utilised in my opinion for this beautiful place",
          "Gaining entry is free, no ID is required, and one is spared the usual seemingly pointless exercise of queueing for a free ticket and then again to have said ticket immediately checked. The museum is modern, stylish, and spacious, with water features giving the feel of a",
          "beautiful I. M. Pei designed building. Artifacts that are 4-5 thousand years old! Also in a nice section of the old town!",
          "It is worth a visit if you are going to the humble gardens anyway, plus with free wifi you can have a catch up with messages and so on",
          "Very interesting place especially for history buffs or people who want to educate themselves a bit more. Beautiful architecture and a lovely visit for the summer when Suzhou gets hot!",
          "While the artifacts are interesting and they are accompanied with English transitions, I really felt that this was just a so-so experience. In town for business and trying to get a little local flavor, it was easy to get to by taxi and not very much to enter. It probably took",
          "I would say it will be a better museum without the local Chinese tourist. The artifacts are very well displayed. But you will always get disturbed by storms of local Chinese tourists in tour group while you appreciating the artifacts half way thru. It's the most major",
          "the museum is right next to the humble administrator's garden. It is a free for all museum which holds details of Chinese history. The building is built in a very modern way with making maximum usage of natural light. The pond and the garden inside the museum are very beautiful.",
          "Located next to the humble scholars garden is this superb museum. Designed by I.M. Pei whose family is from Suzhou, the building is a wonderful mix of modernism and traditional local architecture. A good selection of display inside but the highlight is the garden inside the",
          "Loved the detailing of this building, wonderful incorporation of natural lighting and what a wonderful surprise to see how the collection get incorporated into the building. Every corner is a different experience.",
          "I'm a big fan of the Chinese-American architect I.M.Pei. I've visited the Grand Louvre pyramid in Paris, Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong, and the wonderful Miho Museum in Saga, Japan. So, I just had to check out this famous Suzhou landmark and Pei did not disappoint. The",
          "First of all the admission is free! I thought the museum was laid out nicely and it was easy to tell what I was seeing. The location is great - it's right in ancient town Suzhou - the central historical old town part of Suzhou, and not too far from the Humble Administrator's",
          "Most interesting museum. Its architecture is excellent. The exhibits are very accessible and reflect the area of Suzhou.",
          "Built by famous architect I. M. Pei (of the Paris Louvre glass pyramid) this is a beautiful museum with a great collection of traditional Chinese arts and crafts and a beautiful contemporary courtyard.",
          "The admission was free. The main material was presented in both English and Chinese. Covers the history of the Suzhou region well.",
          "Each time we have visitors, we bring them here. Though compact, this I.M. Pei-designed museum has quite a number of historical artifacts, and especially showcases pottery and weaponry in a number of its rooms. We usually 'package' a day trip here with a boat ride, which is",
          "Admission is free and the relics are many and varied: ancient clay pottery to Ming Vases! Very well-laid out and nice presentation of artifacts. They also have a reflection pool (?) in the center courtyard with koi (giant goldfish). Very nice.",
          "Not much to see here, but they did have an exhibit featuring the swords from the area that have recently been gathered, not a bad walk through, but not worth an admission fee. Architecture is quite nice.Tea shop. next to the Humble garden. Tour bus #1, stop is Suzhou museum.",
          "Definitely a must-go for architecture buffs. Nothing much interesting in the exhibits though. Entrance is free and you'd have to line up to get in, but it won't take long anyway.",
          "What makes this place interesting, is the item which was manufactured 7000-8000 years BC. It is also full of other interesting things, for me it provided an experience where I learn where the civilization was born. Not so far from this place, there is Tiger Hill, an important",
          "The city of Suzhou is an excellent addition to a Chinese costal, cultural tour. For any architect concerned with contextual design, Suzhou presents a formidable challenge. A canal city founded 2,500 years ago, old Suzhou (a center of silk cultivation and commerce) represented",
          "A simple classic museum not much of a stuffs rather than some ancient relics. A small museum. Worth a visit for a less time.",
          "It was fine to me. They showed all the tools for farming. Comes with English description for some of the tools but others only showed their chinese names.",
          "The new section of the museum, designed by I.M. Pei is in stark contrast to the older part. It's stark, white and angular. The water feature in the interior courtyard makes an additional impact. The collection is relatively small, but interesting. Don't miss the musical",
          "If you are a museum lover, this will a good outing. A typical museum of course with a Chines twist, the area is very tastefully set out so that we did not really seem overcrowded at any time. The halls of each display or time period were well sourced, labeled and interesting.",
          "It's a pity that such beautiful architecture, designed by world known architect, \u8d1d\u807f\u94ed became so \"run down\", tired, and dirty. In my opinion, Suzhou government should fire the management team, replace them with professionals to properly maintain this important museum of Suzhou.",
          "Was nice experience, you should go visit this super nice museum ! Free admission, free volunteer guide, lots to see in a modern. Excellent! little info, good to know: Opening Hours: 9 am - 5 pm from Tuesday to Sunday (No admission after 4 pm), the museum is closed on Monday",
          "I love the architecture by I.M Pei, but the displays/exhibitions were really nothing to shout about.",
          "I find the display in the museum isn't as attractive or I should say I myself not suit to go this place. If you are history lover or if you have no other place to go, this is still an option for you. The museum is clean and well managed and maintained.",
          "This is the best museum i have been to in suzhou. It is very nice selection of Chinese artifacts and the builing is very modern. The designer is very famous Chinese american. Worth the visit",
          "It's free, which is nice, new and beautiful. Designed by I M Pei. Small, so it doesn't take a huge bite out of your day. Well worth the visit.",
          "This museum was not on our list, (it's on the way to the \" Humble Administrators Garden\") and I am so glad I found it, the many galleries on different floors, lay out the most interesting part of history from musical instruments to Bronze age items, and Porcelain, my favorite",
          "Magnificent layout, color combination and architecture. We went there during weekday evening. The crowd is reasonable. Great place to visit and somemore, it is FREE.",
          "To be fair our visit to the Museum was rushed. We were able to see all the exhibits but visited at a quick pace. Also, the schools were out for the summer and the museum was very crowded. If you are in Suzhou and have the time, I would visit it just to see the building which",
          "The buildings, one by I.M. Pei and one old palace, are interesting in themselves (I especially liked the mountain landscape near the main pond), and the collection has some true gems.",
          "Great museum, beautiful architecture, fascinating artefacts. But on a weekend you need to wait in line with some very local people for one hour (at least). Once inside, the atmosphere is not much better. These factors can have a very negative influence on a otherwise great",
          "This is a beautifully designed museum by I.M.Pei. The layout is really something. Be advised you should arrive early or go around lunchtime to avoid the heavy crowds. I got the headset, but found the descriptions rather pedantic. I don't know if I would recommend them unless you",
          "You can find the cultural heritage from Suzhou, new exhibitions and some history about this beautiful place.",
          "We saw the museum in the rain but that didn't detract from the balance and artistry of the building but rather enhanced it. The artefacts are not the main attraction though some are of interest it is the fusion of architecture and nature and the presence of so much water in the",
          "Average museum with an average exhibits. Chinese people are proud of this museum, but really it is nothing special to see. There are a lot prettier places to spend time rather than this museum.",
          "I.M. Pei's natural geometric balance design of the Suzhou Museum indeed enhanced the beauty and attraction of this Chinese history and arts museum. The skilful use of light and spaces allow visitors to fully appreciate the items on display - at ease. We went there last Sunday",
          "We visited the museum after spending the better part of 2 days touring the classic gardens of Suzhou and really enjoyed seeing how I.M Pei incorporated classic garden design features into the building. The is also some beautiful Chinese art in the building.",
          "nice collection and bulding but foreigner will be lost by the lack of description. We cannot understand the collection even if it is nice and interesting.",
          "Suzhou Museum is located very close to Humble Administrator's Garden. It is designed by I M Pei (Bei Yuming), the very same person who designed John F. Kennedy Library (Boston, MA), National Gallery of Art East Building (Washington DC), Louvre Pyramid (Paris), Bank of China",
          "I enjoyed the array of pottery on display. A testament to the fine center of the arts and knowledge that Suzhou has been for centuries.",
          "This is a very large museum so you have to pick the areas of interest that you like best. You can easily spend a couple of hours there.",
          "Great place for culture, to travel through ages of history. The visit was very pleasant and very enjoyable",
          "My partner and I both had an incredible experience at Suzhou Museum! It was informative and full of several wonderful displays. There was the option to grab an audio box (available in English) for 20yuan and serval free guided tours throughout the day. To top this all off, there",
          "We really enjoyed this museum designed by architect I. M. Pei. We got in free and the exhibits were very well presented and quite informative. The only drawback was that the museum personnel didn't enforce the quietness of the area, so there was quite a bit of noise.",
          "We loved this small museum, it's worth a visit if the weather is cold/rainy/too hot and you were walking around the gardens for all day. The museum reflects all the major characteristics of classical Suzhou gardens and actually shares a wall with Humble administrator's Garden.",
          "IM Pei designed building is interesting, and feels very serene and peaceful. More history than art in this museum, though most items are really both!",
          "The building in which this museum is housed is possibly more famous than the contents inside. The displays themselves are well laid out, but are not very wide in focus. A good place for a quick visit if time permits, with a good regional focus.",
          "This museum is not terribly big but it packs a lot into a lovely I M Pei building that really reflects and respects the traditional architecture of the area. The collection is not huge but there are some wonderful examples of traditional arts and crafts of this ancient city,",
          "The Suzhou Museum is a modern museum dedicated to the people of Suzhou, by I M Pei, the famous architect as a gift. It is unique and has an outdoor section with pools of water, and landscapes. A must-see in Suzhou for fine architecture.",

          "It's a nice museum although certainly not the highlight of our visit. Worthwhile if you have the time.",

          "First of all, the architecture itself is worth the visit. M Pei did a fantastic job, we took some very stunning pictures from our visit. It is a must if you are a photographic enthusiast. The museum is also attached to a historic northern china style residence, which was nice",

        "wiki": "Guangzhou (; Chinese: \u5e7f\u5dde, Cantonese pronunciation: [k\u02b7\u0254\u030c\u02d0\u014b.ts\u0250\u0302u] or [k\u02b7\u0254\u030c\u02d0\u014b.ts\u0250\u0301u] (listen); Mandarin pronunciation: [kw\u00e0\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also known as Canton and formerly romanized as Kwangchow, is the capital and most populous city of the province of Guangdong in southern China. On the Pearl River about 120 km (75 mi) north-northwest of Hong Kong and 145 km (90 mi) north of Macau, Guangzhou has a history of over 2,200 years and was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road, and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub, as well as one of China's three largest cities.Guangzhou is at the heart of the most-populous built-up metropolitan area in mainland China, which extends into the neighboring cities of Foshan, Dongguan, Zhongshan and Shenzhen, forming one of the largest urban agglomerations on Earth, the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Administratively, the city holds sub-provincial status and is one of China's nine National Central Cities. At the end of 2018, the population of the city's expansive administrative area was estimated at 14,904,400 by city authorities, up 3.8% from the previous year. Guangzhou is ranked as an Alpha global city. There is a rapidly increasing number of foreign temporary residents and immigrants from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa. This has led to it being dubbed the \"Capital of the Third World\".The domestic migrant population from other provinces of China in Guangzhou was 40% of the city's total population in 2008. Together with Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen, Guangzhou has one of the most expensive real estate markets in China.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, nationals of sub-Saharan Africa who had initially settled in the Middle East and other parts of Southeast Asia moved in unprecedented numbers to Guangzhou in response to the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis.Long the only Chinese port accessible to  most foreign traders, Guangzhou fell to the British during the First Opium War.  No longer enjoying a monopoly after the war, it lost trade to other ports such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, but continued to serve as a major entrep\u00f4t.  In modern commerce, Guangzhou is best known for its annual Canton Fair, the oldest and largest trade fair in China.  For three consecutive years (2013\u20132015), Forbes ranked Guangzhou as the best commercial city in mainland China.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\n\nGu\u01cengzh\u014du is the pinyin romanisation of the Chinese name \u5ee3\u5dde, which was simplified in mainland China to \u5e7f\u5dde in the 1950s. The name of the city is taken from the ancient Guang Province (Guang Zhou), after it had become the prefecture's seat of government, which is how some other Chinese cities, including Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Fuzhou got their names. The character \u5ee3 or \u5e7f\u2014which also appears in the names of the provinces Guangdong and Guangxi, together called the Liangguang\u2014means \"broad\" or \"expansive\" and refers to the intention to dispense imperial grace broadly in the region with the founding of county of Guangxin in the Han Dynasty.\nBefore acquiring its current name, the town was known as Panyu (\u756a\u79ba), a name still borne by one of Guangzhou's districts not far from the main city. The origin of the name is still uncertain, with 11 various explanations being offered, including that it may have referred to two local mountains. The city has also sometimes been known as Guangzhou Fu or Guangfu after its status as the capital of a prefecture. From this latter name, Guangzhou was known to medieval Persians such as Al-Masudi and Ibn Khordadbeh as Khanfu (\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0641\u0648). Under the Southern Han, the city was renamed Xingwang Fu (\u8208\u738b\u5e9c).The Chinese abbreviation for Guangzhou is \"\u7a57\" (although the abbreviation on car license plates, as with the rest of the province, is \u7ca4), after its nickname \"Rice City\" (\u7a57\u57ce). The city has long borne the nickname City of Rams (\u7f8a\u57ce) or City of the Five Rams (\u4e94\u7f8a\u57ce) from the five stones at the old Temple of the Five Immortals said to have been the sheep or goats ridden by the Taoist culture heroes credited with introducing rice cultivation to the area around the time of the city's foundation. The former name \"City of the Immortals\" (\u4ed9\u57ce/\u4e94\u4ed9\u57ce) came from the same story. The more recent City of Flowers (\u82b1\u57ce) is usually taken as a simple reference to the area's fine greenery.\nThe English name \"Canton\" derived from Portuguese Cant\u00e3o or Cidade de Cant\u00e3o, a muddling of dialectical pronunciations of \"Guangdong\" (e.g., Hakka K\u00f3ng-t\u00fbng). Although it originally and chiefly applied to the walled city, it was occasionally conflated with Guangdong by some authors. It was adopted as the Postal Map Romanization of Guangzhou and remained in common use until the gradual adoption of pinyin. As an adjective, it is still used in describing the people, language, cuisine and culture of Guangzhou and the surrounding Liangguang region. The 19th-century name \"Kwang-chow foo\" derived from Nanjing dialect of Mandarin and the town's status as a prefectural capital.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nA settlement now known as Nanwucheng was present in the area by 1100 BC. Some traditional Chinese histories placed Nanwucheng's founding during the reign of Ji Yan, king of Zhou from 314\u2013256 BC. It was said to have consisted of little more than a stockade of bamboo and mud.\n\n\n=== Nanyue ===\nPanyu was established on the east bank of the Pearl River in 214 BC to serve as a base for the Qin Empire's first failed invasion of the Baiyue lands in southern China. Legendary accounts claimed the soldiers at Panyu were so vigilant that they did not remove their armor for three years. Upon the fall of the Qin, General Zhao Tuo established his own kingdom of Nanyue and made Panyu its capital in 204 BC. It remained independent through the Chu-Han Contention, although Zhao negotiated recognition of his independence in exchange for his nominal submission to the Han in 196 BC. Archaeological evidence shows that Panyu was an expansive commercial centre: in addition to items from central China, archaeologists have found remains originating from Southeast Asia, India, and even Africa. Zhao Tuo was succeeded by Zhao Mo and then Zhao Yingqi. Upon Zhao Yingqi's death in 115 BC, his younger son Zhao Xing was named as his successor in violation of Chinese primogeniture. By 113 BC, his Chinese mother, the Empress Dowager Jiu (\u6a1b) had prevailed upon him to submit Nanyue as a formal part of the Han Empire. The native prime minister L\u00fc Jia (\u5442\u5609) launched a coup, killing Han ambassadors along with the king, his mother, and their supporters. A successful ambush then annihilated a Han force which had been sent to arrest him. The enraged Emperor Wu launched a massive river- and sea-borne invasion: six armies under Lu Bode and Yang Pu took Panyu and annexed Nanyue by the end of 111 BC.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nIncorporated into the Han Dynasty, Panyu became a provincial capital. In AD 226, it became the seat of Guang Prefecture, which gave it its modern name. The Old Book of Tang described Guangzhou as an important port in southern China. Direct routes connected the Middle East and China, as shown in records of a Chinese prisoner returning home from Iraq twelve years after his capture at Talas. Relations were not always peaceful: Arab and Persian pirates sacked the city on 30 October 758 and were massacred by the Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, along with the city's Jews, Christians, and Parsis. The port was reportedly closed for fifty years after the chaos.Amid the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms that followed the collapse of the Tang dynasty, the Later Liang governor Liu Yan used his base at Panyu to establish a \"Great Yue\" or \"Southern Han\" empire, which lasted from 917 to 971. The region enjoyed considerable cultural and economic success in this period. From the 10th to 12th century, there are records that the large foreign communities were not exclusively male, but included \"Persian women\". According to Odoric of Pordenone, Guangzhou was as large as three Venices and rivalled all of Italy in the amount of crafts it produced. He also noted the large amount of ginger available as well as large geese and snakes. Guangzhou was visited by the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta during his 14th-century journey around the world; he detailed the process by which the Chinese constructed their large ships in the port's shipyards.Shortly after the Hongwu Emperor's declaration of the Ming dynasty, he reversed his earlier support of foreign trade and imposed the first of a series of sea bans (haijin). These banned private foreign trade upon penalty of death for the merchant and exile for his family and neighbors. The Yuan-era maritime intendancies of Guangzhou, Quanzhou, and Ningbo were closed in 1384 and legal trade became limited to the tribute delegations sent to or by official representatives of foreign governments.Following the Portuguese conquest of Malacca, Rafael Perestrello travelled to Guangzhou as a passenger on a native junk in 1516. His report induced Fern\u00e3o Pires de Andrade to sail to the city with eight ships the next year, but De Andrade's exploration was understood as spying and his brother Sim\u00e3o and others began attempting to monopolize trade, enslaving Chinese women and children, engaging in piracy, and fortifying the island of Tam\u00e3o. Rumors even circulated that Portuguese were eating the children. The Guangzhou administration was charged with driving them off: they bested the Portuguese at the Battle of Tunmen and in Xicao Bay; held a diplomatic mission hostage in a failed attempt to pressure the restoration of the sultan of Malacca, who had been accounted a Ming vassal; and, after placing them in cangues and keeping them for most of a year, ultimately executed 23 by lingchi. With the help of local pirates, the \"Folangji\" then carried out smuggling at Macao, Lampacau, and St John's Island (now Shangchuan), until Leonel de Sousa legalized their trade with bribes to Admiral Wang Bo (\u6c6a\u67cf) and the 1554 Luso-Chinese Accord. The Portuguese undertook not to raise fortifications and to pay customs dues; three years later, after providing the Chinese with assistance suppressing their former pirate allies, the Portuguese were permitted to warehouse their goods at Macau instead of Guangzhou itself.On October 1646, the Longwu Emperor's brother Zhu Yuyue fled by sea to Guangzhou the last seat of the Ming empire. On 11 December, he declared himself the Shaowu Emperor, borrowing his imperial regalia from local theatre troupes. He led a successful offense against his cousin Zhu Youlang but was deposed and executed on 20 January 1647 when the Ming turncoat Li Chengdong (\u674e\u6210\u6771) sacked the city on behalf of the Qing.The Qing became somewhat more open to foreign trade after gaining control of Taiwan in 1683. The Portuguese from Macau and Spaniards from Manila returned, as did private Muslim, Armenian, and English traders. From 1699 to 1714, the French and British East India Companies sent a ship or two each year; the Austrian Ostend General India Co. arrived in 1717, the Dutch East India Co. in 1729, the Danish Asiatic Co. in 1731, and the Swedish East India Co. the next year. These were joined by the occasional Prussian or Trieste Company vessel. The first independent American ship arrived in 1784 and the first colonial Australian one in 1788. By that time, Guangzhou was one of the world's great ports, organised under the Canton System. The main exports were tea and porcelain. As a meeting place of merchants from all over the world, Guangzhou became a major contributor to the rise of the modern global economy.In the 19th century, most of the city's buildings were still only one or two storeys. The major structures were the Plain Minaret of the Huaisheng Mosque, the Flower Pagoda of the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees, and the guard tower known as the 5-Storey Pagoda. The northern hills, since urbanized, were bare and covered with traditional graves. The brick city walls were about 6 miles (10 km) in circumference, 25 feet (8 m) high, and 20 feet (6 m) wide. Its eight main gates and two water gates all held guards during the day and were closed at night. The wall rose to incorporate a hill on its northern side and was surrounded on the other three by a moat which, along with the canals, functioned as the city's sewer, emptied daily by the river's tides. A partition wall with four gates divided the northern \"old town\" from the southern \"new town\" closer to the river; the suburb of Xiguan (\"West Gate\") stretched beyond and the boats of fishers, traders, and Tanka (\"boat people\") almost entirely concealed the riverbank for about 4 miles (6 km). It was common for homes to have a storefront facing the street and to treat their courtyards as a kind of warehouse. The city was part of a network of signal towers so effective that messages could be relayed to Beijing\u2014about 1,200 miles (1,931 km) away\u2014in less than 24 hours.The Canton System was maintained until the outbreak of the First Opium War in 1839. Following a series of battles in the Pearl River Delta, the British captured Guangzhou itself on 18 March 1841. The Second Battle of Canton was fought two months later. Following the Qing's 1842 treaty with Great Britain, Guangzhou lost its privileged trade status as more and more treaty ports were opened to more and more countries, usually including extraterritorial enclaves. Amid the decline of Qing prestige and the chaos of the Red Turban Rebellion (1854\u20131856), the Punti and Hakka waged a series of clan wars from 1855 to 1867 in which one million people died.\nThe concession for the Guangzhou\u2013Hankou railway was awarded to the American China Development Co. in 1898. It completed its branch line west to Foshan and Sanshui before being engulfed in a diplomatic crisis after a Belgian consortium bought a controlling interest and the Qing cancelled its concession. J.P. Morgan was awarded millions in damages and the line to Wuchang wasn't completed until 1936 and a unified Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway waited until the completion of Wuhan's Yangtze River Bridge in 1957.\n\n\n=== Modern China ===\n\n\n==== Revolutions ====\n\nDuring the late Qing Dynasty, Guangzhou was the site of failed revolts such as the Uprisings of 1895 and 1911 to overthrow the Qing; the 72 rebels whose bodies were found after the latter uprising are remembered and honoured as the city's 72 Martyrs in the Huanghuagang (\"Yellow Flower Mound\") Mausoleum.\nAll these failed revolutionary attempts would eventually lead to the Xinhai Revolution which successfully overthrew the Qing Dynasty to establish a new Han Chinese republic.\n\n\n==== Republic of China ====\nAfter the assassination of Song Jiaoren and Yuan Shikai's attempts to remove the Nationalist Party of China from power, the leader of Guangdong Hu Hanmin joined the 1913 Second Revolution against him but was forced to flee to Japan with Sun Yat-sen after its failure. The city came under national spotlight again in 1917, when Prime Minister Duan Qirui's abrogation of the constitution triggered the Constitutional Protection Movement. Sun Yat-sen came to head the Guangzhou Military Government supported by the members of the dissolved parliament and the Southwestern warlords. The Guangzhou government fell apart as the warlords withdrew their support. Sun fled to Shanghai in November 1918 until the Guangdong warlord Chen Jiongming restored him in October 1920 during the Yuegui Wars. On 16 June 1922, Sun was ousted in a coup and fled on the warship Yongfeng after Chen sided with the Zhili Clique's Beijing government. In the following months Sun mounted a counterattack into Guangdong by rallying supporters from Yunnan and Guangxi, and in January established a government in the city for the third time.\n\nFrom 1923 to 1926 Sun and the Kuomintang used the city as a base to prosecute a renewed revolution in China by conquering the warlords in the north.  Although Sun was previously dependent on opportunistic warlords who hosted him in the city, with the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT developed its own military power to serve its ambition. The Canton years saw the evolution of the KMT into a revolutionary movement with a strong military focus and ideological commitment, setting the tone of the KMT rule of China beyond 1927.\nIn 1924 the KMT made the momentous decision to ally with the Communist Party and the USSR. With Soviet help, KMT reorganized itself along the Leninist line and adopted a pro-labor and pro-peasant stance. The Kuomintang-CCP cooperation was confirmed in the First Congress of the KMT and the communists were instructed to join the KMT. The allied government set up the Peasant Movement Training Institute in the city, of which Mao Zedong was a director for one term. Sun and his military commander Chiang used Soviet funds and weapons to build an armed force staffed by communist commissars, training its cadres in the Whampoa Military Academy. In August, the fledgling army suppressed the Canton Merchants' Corps Uprising. The next year the anti-imperialist May Thirtieth Movement swept the country, and the KMT government called for strikes in Canton and Hong Kong. The tensions of the massive strikes and protests led to the Shakee Massacre.\nAfter the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925 the mood was changing in the party toward the communists. In August the left-wing KMT leader Liao Zhongkai was assassinated and the right-wing leader Hu Hanmin, the suspected mastermind, was exiled to the Soviet Union, leaving the pro-communist Wang Jingwei in charge. Opposing communist encroachment, the right-wing Western Hills Group vowed to expel the communists from the KMT. The \"Canton Coup\" on 20 March 1926 saw Chiang solidify his control over the Nationalists and their army against Wang Jingwei, the party's left wing, its Communist allies, and its Soviet advisors. By May, he had ended civilian control of the military and begun his Northern Expedition against the warlords of the north. Its success led to the split of the KMT between Wuhan and Nanking and the purge of the communists in the Shanghai Massacre. Immediately afterwards Canton joined the purge under the auspice of Li Jishen, resulting in the arrest of communists and the suspension of left wing KMT apparatuses and labor groups. Later in 1927 when Zhang Fakui, a general supportive of the Wuhan faction seized Canton and installed Wang Jingwei's faction in the city, the communists saw an opening and launched the Guangzhou Uprising. Prominent communist military leaders Ye Ting and Ye Jianying led the failed defense of the city. Soon, control of the city reverted to Li Jishen.\nLi was deposed in the War between Chiang and Guangxi Clique. By 1929, Chen Jitang had established himself as the powerholder of Guangdong. In 1931 he threw his weight behind the anti-Chiang schism by hosting a separate Nationalist government in Guangzhou. Opposing Chiang's alleged dictatorship, the separatists included KMT leaders like Wang Jingwei, Sun Fo and others from diverse factions. The peace negotiations amidst the armed stand-off led to the 4th National Congress of Kuomintang being held separately by three factions in Nanjing, Shanghai and Canton. Resigning all his posts, Chiang pulled off a political compromise that reunited all factions. While the intraparty division was resolved, Chen kept his power until he was defeated by Chiang in 1936.\nDuring World War II, the \"Canton Operation\" subjected the city to Japanese occupation by the end of December 1938.\n\n\n==== People's Republic of China ====\nAmid the closing months of the Chinese Civil War, Guangzhou briefly served as the capital of the Republic of China after the taking of Nanjing by the PLA in April 1949. The People's Liberation Army entered the city on 14 October 1949. Amid a massive exodus to Hong Kong and Macau, the Nationalists blew up the Haizhu Bridge across the Pearl River in retreat. The Cultural Revolution had a large effect on the city with much of its temples, churches and other monuments destroyed during this chaotic period.\nThe People's Republic of China initiated building projects including new housing on the banks of the Pearl River to adjust the city's boat people to life on land. Since the 1980s, the city's close proximity to Hong Kong and Shenzhen and its ties to overseas Chinese have made it one of the first beneficiaries of China's opening up under Deng Xiaoping. Beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s have also helped the city's industrialisation and development.\nThe municipality was expanded in the year 2000, with Huadu and Panyu joining the city as urban districts and Conghua and Zengcheng as more rural counties. The former districts of Dongshan and Fangcun were abolished in 2005, merged into Yuexiu and Liwan respectively. The city acquired Nansha and Luogang. The former was carved out of Panyu, the latter from parts of Baiyun, Tianhe, Zengcheng, and an exclave within Huangpu. The National People's Congress approved a development plan for the Pearl River Delta in January 2009; on March 19 the same year, the Guangzhou and Foshan municipal governments agreed to establish a framework to merge the two cities. In 2014, Luogang merged into Huangpu and both Conghua and Zengcheng counties were upgraded to districts.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe old town of Guangzhou was near Baiyun Mountain on the east bank of the Pearl River (Zhujiang) about 80 miles (129 km) from its junction with the South China Sea and about 300 miles (483 km) below its head of navigation. It commanded the rich alluvial plain of the Pearl River Delta, with its connection to the sea protected at the Humen Strait. The present city spans 7,434.4 square kilometres (2,870.4 sq mi) on both sides of the river from 112\u00b0 57\u2032 to 114\u00b0 03\u2032 E longitude and 22\u00b0 26\u2032 to 23\u00b0 56\u2032 N latitude in south-central Guangdong. The Pearl is the 4th-largest river of China. Baiyun Mountain is now locally referred to as the city's \"lung\" (\u5e02\u80ba).The elevation of the prefecture generally increases from southwest to northeast, with mountains forming the backbone of the city and the ocean comprising the front. Tiantang Peak (\u5929\u5802\u9876, \"Heavenly Peak\") is the highest point of elevation at 1,210 metres (3,970 ft) above sea level.\n\n\n=== Natural resources ===\nThere are 47 different types of minerals and also 820 ore fields in Guangzhou, including 18 large and medium-sized oil deposits. The major minerals are granite, cement limestone, ceramic clay, potassium, albite, salt mine, mirabilite, nepheline, syenite, fluorite, marble, mineral water, and geothermal mineral water. Since Guangzhou is located in the water-rich area of southern China, it has a wide water area with lots of rivers and water systems, accounting for 10% of the total land area. The rivers and streams improve the landscape and keep the ecological environment of the city stable.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDespite being located just south of the Tropic of Cancer, Guangzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian monsoon. Summers are wet with high temperatures, high humidity, and a high heat index. Winters are mild and comparatively dry. Guangzhou has a lengthy monsoon season, spanning from April through September. Monthly averages range from 13.9 \u00b0C (57.0 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 22.6 \u00b0C (72.7 \u00b0F). Autumn, from October to December, is very moderate, cool and windy, and is the best travel time. The relative humidity is approximately 68 percent, whereas annual rainfall in the metropolitan area is over 1,700 mm (67 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 17 percent in March and April to 52 percent in November, the city receives 1,628 hours of bright sunshine annually, considerably less than nearby Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Extreme temperatures have ranged from 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) to 39.1 \u00b0C (102.4 \u00b0F). The last recorded snowfall in the city was on 24 January 2016, 87 years after the second last recorded snowfall.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nGuangzhou is a sub-provincial city. It has direct jurisdiction over eleven districts:\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nGuangzhou is the main manufacturing hub of the Pearl River Delta, one of mainland China's leading commercial and manufacturing regions. In 2017, the GDP reached \u00a52,150 billion (US$318 billion), per capita was \u00a5150,678 (US$22,317). Guangzhou is considered one of the most prosperous cities in China.  Owing to rapid industrialisation, it is also considered one of the most polluted cities once. But as city development goes greener, it is now one of the most livable cities in China.\nThe Canton Fair, formally the \"China Import and Export Fair\", is held every year in April and October by the Ministry of Trade. Inaugurated in the spring of 1957, the fair is a major event for the city. It is the trade fair with the longest history, highest level, largest scale in China. From the 104th session onwards, the fair moved to the new Guangzhou International Convention and Exhibition Center (\u5e7f\u5dde\u56fd\u9645\u4f1a\u5c55\u4e2d\u5fc3) in Pazhou, from the older complex in Liuhua. The GICEC is served by two stations on Line 8 and three stations on Tram Line THZ1. Since the 104th session, the Canton Fair has been arranged in three phases instead of two phases.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Local products ===\nCantonese is one of China's most famous and popular regional cuisines, with a saying stating simply to \"Eat in Guangzhou\" (\u98df\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde)\nCantonese sculpture includes work in jade, wood, and (now controversially) ivory.\nCanton porcelain developed over the past three centuries as one of the major forms of exportware. It is now known within China for its highly colorful style.\nCantonese embroidery is one of China's four main styles of the art and is represented in Guangzhou, although its principal centre is at Chaozhou.\nZhujiang Beer, a pale lager, is one of China's most successful brands. It is made in Guangzhou from water piped directly to the brewery from a natural spring.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nGuangzhou Peugeot Automobile Company produced the Peugeot 504 and Peugeot 505 automobiles from 1989 to 1997.\n\nGuangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone\nGuangzhou Nansha Export Processing Zone\nThe Export Processing Zone was founded in 2005. Its total planned area is 1.36 km2 (0.53 sq mi). It is located in Nansha District and it belongs to the provincial capital, Guangzhou. The major industries encouraged in the zone include automobile assembly, biotechnology and heavy industry. It is situated 54 kilometres (34 miles) (70 minutes drive) south of Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport and close to Nansha Port. It also has the advantage of Guangzhou Metro line 4 which is being extended to Nansha Ferry Terminal.\nGuangzhou Free Trade Zone\nThe zone was founded in 1992. It is located in the east of Huangpu District and near to Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone. It is also very close to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport. The major industries encouraged in the zone include international trade, logistics, processing and computer software.\nGuangzhou Science City\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe 2010 census found Guangzhou's population to be 12.78 million. As of 2014, it was estimated at 13,080,500, with 11,264,800 urban residents. Its population density is thus around 1,800 people per km2. The built-up area of the Guangzhou proper connects directly to several other cities. The built-up area of the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone covers around 17,573 square kilometres (6,785 sq mi) and has been estimated to house 22 million people, including Guangzhou's nine urban districts, Shenzhen (5.36m), Dongguan (3.22m), Zhongshan (3.12m), most of Foshan (2.2m), Jiangmen (1.82m), Zhuhai (890k), and Huizhou's Huiyang District (760k). The total population of this agglomeration is over 28 million after including the population of the adjacent Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The area's fast-growing economy and high demand for labour has produced a huge \"floating population\" of migrant workers. Up to 10 million migrants reside in the area least six months each year. In 2008, about five million of Guangzhou's permanent residents were hukouless migrants.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity and language ===\nMost of Guangzhou's population is Han Chinese. Almost all of the local Cantonese people speak Cantonese as their first language, while most migrants speak forms of Mandarin. In 2010, each language was the native tongue of roughly half of the city's population, although minor but substantial numbers speak other varieties as well. In 2018, He Huifeng of the South China Morning Post stated that younger residents have increasingly favored using Mandarin instead of Cantonese in their daily lives, causing their Cantonese-speaking grandparents and parents to use Mandarin to communicate with them. He Huifeng stated that factors included local authorities discouraging the use of Cantonese in schools and the rise in prestige of Mandarin-speaking Shenzhen. Guangzhou has a very unbalanced gender ratio, but its province has a higher imbalance than the rest of the country. While most areas of China have 112-120 boys per 100 girls, the Guangdong province that houses Guangzhou has more than 130 boys for every 100 girls.The influx of Chinese immigrants in Guangzhou also brought an estimated 300,000 prostitutes mostly from Sichuan from central China. Guangzhou now has a huge influx of migrants, with up to 30 million additional migrants living in the area for at least six months out of every year. This huge influx of people from other areas, called the floating population, is due to the city's fast-growing economy and high labor demands. Guangzhou Mayor Wan Qingliang told an urban planning seminar that Guangzhou is facing a very serious population problem stating that, while the city had 10.33 million registered residents at the time with targets and scales of land use based on this number, the city actually had a population with migrants of nearly 15 million. According to the Guangzhou Academy of Social Sciences researcher Peng Peng, the city is almost at its maximum capacity of just 15 million, which means the city is facing a great strain, mostly due to a high population of unregistered people.According to the 2000 National Census, marriage is one of the top two reasons for permanent migration and particular important for female as 29.3% of the permanent female migrants migrate for marriage [Liang et al.,2004]. Many of the economic migrant female marries men from Guangzhou in hopes of a better life. but like elsewhere in the People's Republic of China, the household registration system (hukou) limits migrants' access to residences, educational institutions and other public benefits. In May 2014, legally employed migrants in Guangzhou were permitted to receive a hukou card allowing them to marry and obtain permission for their pregnancies in the city, rather than having to return to their official hometowns as previously.Historically, the Cantonese people have made up a sizeable part of the 19th- and 20th-century Chinese diaspora and many overseas Chinese have ties to Guangzhou. This is particularly true in the United States, Canada, and Australia.\nDemographically, the only significant immigration into China has been by overseas Chinese, but Guangzhou sees many foreign tourists, workers, and residents from the usual locations such as the United States. Notably, it is also home to thousands of African immigrants, including people from Nigeria, Somalia, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 25 million.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Urban mass transit ===\n\nWhen the first line of the Guangzhou Metro opened in 1997, Guangzhou was the fourth city in Mainland China to have an underground railway system, behind Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Currently the metro network is made up of thirteen lines, covering a total length of 476.26 km (295.93 mi). A long-term plan is to make the city's metro system expand to over 500 km (310 mi) by 2020 with 15 lines in operation. In addition to the metro system there is also the Haizhu Tram line which opened on 31 December 2014.The Guangzhou Bus Rapid Transit (GBRT) system which was introduced in 2010 along Zhongshan Road. It has several connections to the metro and is the world's 2nd-largest Bus Rapid Transit system with 1,000,000 passenger trips daily. It handles 26,900 pphpd during the peak hour a capacity second only to the TransMilenio BRT system in Bogota. The system averages one bus every 10 seconds or 350 per hour in a single direction and contains the world's longest BRT stations\u2014around 260 m (850 ft) including bridges.\n\n\n=== Motor transport ===\n\nIn the 19th century, the city already boasted over 600 long, straight streets; these were mostly paved but still very narrow. In June 1919, work began on demolishing the city wall to make way for wider streets and the development of tramways. The demolition took three years in total.In 2009, it was reported that all 9,424 buses and 17,695 taxis in Guangzhou would be operating on LPG-fuel by 2010 to promote clean energy for transport and improve the environment ahead of the 2010 Asian Games which were held in the city. At present, Guangzhou is the city that uses the most LPG-fueled vehicles in the world, and at the end of 2006, 6,500 buses and 16,000 taxis were using LPG, taking up 85 percent of all buses and taxis.Effective January 1, 2007, the municipal government banned motorcycles in Guangdong's urban areas. Motorcycles found violating the ban are confiscated. The Guangzhou traffic bureau claimed to have reported reduced traffic problems and accidents in the downtown area since the ban.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nGuangzhou's main airport is the Baiyun International Airport in Baiyun District; it opened on August 5, 2004. This airport is the second busiest airport in terms of traffic movements in China. It replaced the old Baiyun International Airport, which was very close to the city centre but failed to meet the city's fast-growing air traffic demand. The old Baiyun International Airport was in operation for 72 years. Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport now has three runways, with two more planned. The Terminal 2 has opened on April 26, 2018. Another airport located in Zengcheng District is under planning.Guangzhou is served by Hong Kong International Airport; ticketed passengers can take ferries from the Lianhuashan Ferry Terminal and Nansha Ferry Port in Nansha District to the HKIA Skypier. There are also coach bus services connecting Guangzhou with HKIA.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nGuangzhou is the terminus of the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou, Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen, Guangzhou\u2013Maoming and Guangzhou\u2013Meizhou\u2013Shantou conventional speed railways. In late 2009, the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou high-speed railway started service, with multiple unit trains covering 980 km (608.94 mi) at a top speed of 320 km/h (199 mph).  In December 2014, the Guiyang\u2013Guangzhou high-speed railway and Nanning-Guangzhou railway began service with trains running at top speeds of 250 km/h (155 mph) and 200 km/h (124 mph), respectively. The Guangdong Through Train departs from the Guangzhou East railway station and arrives at the Hung Hom Station in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The route is approximately 182 km (113 mi) in length and the ride takes less than two hours. Frequent coach services are also provided with coaches departing every day from different locations (mostly major hotels) around the city. A number of regional railways radiating from Guangzhou started operating such as the Guangzhou\u2013Zhuhai intercity railway and the Guangzhou-Foshan-Zhaoqing intercity railway.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\nThere are daily high-speed catamaran services between Nansha Ferry Terminal and Lianhua Shan Ferry Terminal in Guangzhou and the Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal, as well as between Nansha Ferry Terminal and Macau Ferry Pier in Hong Kong.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nWithin China, the culture of the Cantonese people is a subset of the larger \"Southern\" or \"Lingnan\" cultural areas. Notable aspects of Guangzhou's cultural heritage include:\n\nCantonese language, the local and prestige variant of Yue Chinese\nCantonese cuisine, one of China's eight major culinary traditions\nCantonese opera, usually divided into martial and literary performances\nXiguan, the area west of the former walled cityGuangzhou Opera House & Symphony Orchestra also perform classical Western music and Chinese compositions in their style. Cantonese music is a traditional style of Chinese instrumental music, while Cantopop is the local form of pop music and rock-and-roll which developed from neighbouring Hong Kong.\n\n\n=== Religions ===\nQing-era Guangzhou had around 124 religious pavilions, halls, and temples. Today, in addition to the Buddhist Association, Guangzhou also has a Taoist Association, a Jewish community, and a history with Christianity and Islam.\n\n\n==== Daoism ====\nTaoism and Chinese folk religion are still represented at a few of the city's temples. Among the most important is the Temple of the Five Immortals, honoring the five immortals credited with introducing rice cultivation at the foundation of the city. The five rams they rode were supposed to have turned into stones upon their departure and gave the city several of its nicknames. Another place of worship is the City God Temple. Guangzhou, like most of southern China, is also notably observant concerning ancestral veneration during occasions like the Tomb Sweeping and Ghost Festivals.\n\n\n==== Buddhism ====\nBuddhism is the most prominent religion in Guangzhou. The Zhizhi Temple was founded in AD 233 from the estate of a Wu official; it is said to comprise the residence of Zhao Jiande, the last of the Nanyue kings, and has been known as the Guangxiao Temple (\"Temple of Bright Filial Piety\") since the Ming. The missionary Bodhidharma is traditionally said to have visited Panyu during the Liu Song or Liang dynasties (5th or 6th century). Around AD 520, Emperor Wu of the Liang ordered the construction of the Baozhuangyan Temple and the Xilai Monastery to store the relics of Cambodian Buddhist saints which had been brought to the city and to house the monks beginning to assemble there. The Baozhuangyan is now known as the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees, after a famous poem composed by Su Shi after a visit during the Northern Song. The Xilai Monastery was renamed the Hualin Temple (\"Flowery Forest Temple\") after its reconstruction during the Qing.\nThe temples were damaged by both the Republican campaign to \"Promote Education with Temple Property\" (\u5edf\u7522\u8208\u5b78) and the Maoist Cultural Revolution but have been renovated since the opening up that began in the 1980s. The Ocean Banner Temple on Henan Island, once famous in the west as the only tourist spot in Guangzhou accessible to foreigners, has been reopened as the Hoi Tong Monastery.\n\n\n==== Christianity ====\nNestorian Christians first arrived in China via the overland Silk Road, but suffered during Emperor Wuzong's 845 persecution and were essentially extinct by the year 1000. The Qing-era ban on foreigners limited missionaries until it was abolished following the First Opium War, although the Protestant Robert Morrison was able to perform some work through his service with the British factory. The Catholic Archdiocese of Guangzhou is housed at Guangzhou's Sacred Heart Cathedral, known locally as the \"Stone House\". A Gothic Revival edifice which was built by hand from 1861 to 1888 under French direction, its original Latin and French stained-glass windows were destroyed during the wars and amid the Cultural Revolution; they have since been replaced by English ones. The Canton Christian College (1888) and Hackett Medical College for Women (1902) were both founded by missionaries and now form part of Guangzhou's Lingnan. Since the opening up of China in the 1980s, there has been renewed interest in Christianity, but Guangzhou maintains pressure on underground churches which avoid registration with government officials. The Catholic archbishop Dominic Tang was imprisoned without trial for 22 years, but his present successor is recognised by both the Vatican and China's Patriotic Church.\n\n\n==== Islam ====\nGuangzhou has had a Muslim community since very early in the history of Islam; the native or nativised adherents of the faith are known as the Hui. Huaisheng Mosque was probably built during the Tang dynasty. Arab and Persian pirates sacked the city in 758 and were massacred by the Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, along with the Jews, Christians, and Parsis.  The modern city includes numerous halal restaurants.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe 18,000 seat Guangzhou International Sports Arena will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.From 12\u201327 November 2010, Guangzhou hosted the 16th Asian Games. The same year, it hosted the first Asian Para Games from December 12 to 19. Combined, these were the largest sporting events the city ever hosted.Guangzhou also hosted the following major sporting events:\n\n1987 The 6th National Games of China\n1991 The 1st FIFA Women's World Cup\n2001 The 2001 National Games of China\n2007 The 8th National Traditional Games of Ethnic Minorities of the People's Republic of China\n2008 The 49th World Table Tennis Championships\n2009 The 11th Sudirman Cup: the world badminton mixed team championshipsCurrent professional sports clubs based in Guangzhou include:\n\nIn the 2010s, Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C. has risen to be a powerhouse in association football in China, having won eight out of nine national titles between 2011 and 2019. The team has also won the AFC Champions League in 2013 and 2015. The club has competed at the 2013 and 2015 FIFA Club World Cup, where it lost 3\u20130 in the semi-final stage to the 2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League winners FC Bayern Munich and the 2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League winners FC Barcelona, respectively.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\n\n=== Eight Views ===\n\nThe Eight Views of Ram City are Guangzhou's eight most famous tourist attractions. They have varied over time since the Song dynasty, with some being named or demoted by emperors. The following modern list was chosen through public appraisal in 2011:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n\n\n=== Tourist attractions ===\nGuangzhou attracts more than 223 million visitors each year, and the total revenue of the tourism exceeded 400 billion in 2018. There are many tourist attractions, including:\n\n\n=== Pedestrian streets ===\nIn every district there are many shopping areas where people can walk on the sidewalks; however most of them are not set as pedestrian streets. \n\nThe popular pedestrian streets are:\n\n\n=== Malls and shopping centers ===\nThere are many malls and shopping centers in Guangzhou. The majority of the new malls are located in the Tianhe district.\n\n\n=== Major buildings ===\n \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Media ==\nGuangzhou has two local radio stations: the provincial Radio Guangdong and the municipal Radio Guangzhou. Together they broadcast in more than a dozen channels. The primary language of both stations is Cantonese. Traditionally only one channel of Radio Guangdong is dedicated to Mandarin Chinese. However, in recent years there has been an increase in Mandarin programmes on most Cantonese channels. Radio stations from cities around Guangzhou mainly broadcast in Cantonese and can be received in different parts of the city, depending on the radio stations' locations and transmission power. The Beijing-based China National Radio also broadcasts Mandarin programmes in the city. Radio Guangdong has a 30-minute weekly English programme, Guangdong Today, which is broadcast globally through the World Radio Network. Daily English news programmes are also broadcast by Radio Guangdong.\nGuangzhou has some of the best Chinese-language newspapers and magazines in mainland China, most of which are published by three major newspaper groups in the city, the Guangzhou Daily Press Group, Nanfang Press Corporation, and the Yangcheng Evening News Group. The two leading newspapers of the city are Guangzhou Daily and Southern Metropolis Daily. The former, with a circulation of 1.8 million, has been China's most successful newspaper for 14 years in terms of advertising revenue, while Southern Metropolis Daily is considered one of the most liberal newspapers in mainland China. In addition to Guangzhou's Chinese-language publications, there are a few English magazines and newspapers. The most successful is That's Guangzhou, which started more than a decade ago and has since blossomed into That's PRD, producing expatriate magazines in Beijing and Shanghai as well. It also produces In the Red.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, also known as Guangzhou University Town (\u5e7f\u5dde\u5927\u5b66\u57ce), is a large tertiary education complex located in the southeast suburbs of Guangzhou. It occupies the entirety of Xiaoguwei Island in Panyu District, covering an area of about 18 square kilometres (7 sq mi). The complex accommodates campuses from ten higher education institutions and can eventually accommodate up to 200,000 students, 20,000 teachers, and 50,000 staff.The Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre higher education campuses:\n\nGuangdong Pharmaceutical University\nGuangdong University of Foreign Studies\nGuangdong University of Technology\nGuangzhou Academy of Fine Arts\nGuangzhou University\nGuangzhou University of Chinese Medicine\nSouth China Normal University\nSouth China University of Technology\nSun Yat-sen University\nXinghai Conservatory of MusicGuangzhou's other fully accredited and degree-granting universities and colleges include:\n\nGuangdong Institute of Science and Technology\nGuangdong Polytechnic Normal University\nGuangdong University of Finance & Economics\nGuangdong University of Finance\nGuangzhou College of South China University of Technology\nGuangzhou Medical University\nGuangzhou Sports University\nJinan University\nSouth China Agricultural University\nSouthern Medical University\nZhongkai University of Agriculture and EngineeringThe two main comprehensive libraries are Guangzhou Library and Sun Yat-sen Library of Guangdong Province.

        "wiki": "The Master of the Nets Garden (Chinese: \u7f51\u5e08\u56ed; pinyin: W\u01cengsh\u012b yu\u00e1n; Suzhouese: Wu Chinese pronunciation: [m\u0251\u0303 sz\u0329 \u0266y\u00f8]) in Suzhou is among the finest gardens in China. It is recognized with other classical Suzhou gardens as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.   The garden demonstrates Chinese garden designers' adept skills for synthesizing art, nature, and architecture to create unique metaphysical masterpieces. The Master of the Nets is particularly regarded among garden connoisseurs for its mastering the techniques of relative dimension, contrast, foil, sequence and depth, and borrowed scenery.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Master of the Nets garden, then called Ten Thousand Volume Hall, was first constructed in 1140 by Shi Zhengzhi the Deputy Civil Service Minister of the Southern Song Dynasty government. Shi Zhengzhi was inspired by the simple and solitary life of a Chinese fisherman depicted in philosophical writings. After his death the garden passed through numerous ownership and subsequently fell into disarray until around 1785 when it was restored by Song Zongyuan, a retired government official of the Qing Dynasty. He drastically redesigned the garden and added multiple buildings, but retained the spirit of the site.  He often referred to himself as a fisherman and renamed it the Master of the Nets Garden, as an allusion to the simple life of a fisherman.\nOwnership passed to Qu Yuancun, a scholar well-versed in the classics and literature, in 1795. He added and remodelled buildings, planted trees, and arranged stones. The garden acquired the nickname of Qu's Garden during this period as well as its first acclaim by critics.  Ownership passed to Li Hongyi, an imperial official and master calligrapher in 1868.  About half of the steles in the garden are inscribed by him.  Ownership passed to He Chang in 1940, who restored both the garden and returned the name back to Master of Nets Garden.  He stipulated in his will the garden should be donated to the government.  In 1958 his daughter He Zehui gave the garden to the Suzhou government.\nDuring the late 18th century it was recognized for its herbaceous peonies.  In his Notes on the Master of Nets Garden, Qian Daxin stated, \"A good integration of the delights of the village and town.\" Modern critic Chen Congzhou feels that the Master of the Nets Garden is the best representation of all classical Chinese garden art, as stated in Famous Classical Gardens of China.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe 5,400 m\u00b2 garden is divided into east and west sections. The eastern part consists of residential quarters, while the gardens are located in the western part.  Eastern section is the residential area it is a linear sequence of four halls one tower and three courtyards.  The western garden is an ensemble of buildings around the 334 m\u00b2 Rosy Cloud Pool.  Plants and rocks are used to create views which represent several seasons.  It also includes three side courts to the east and south.  The two dominant elements of the composition are the Barrier of Cloud grotto, a cypress tree dating from the Ming Dynasty, and pine several centuries old.  The areas to the south of the Rosy Cloud Pool were used for social activities and the areas to the north were used for intellectual activities.  The buildings are laid out in a style called close to the water which is used to give the Rosy Clouds Pool the illusion of great size.  Small buildings are set on rocks or piers directly over the water surface while large buildings are separated from the pool by yards planted with trees to obscure their size.\n\nDetails\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAstor Court (inspired by the Master of the Nets Garden)\nChinese garden\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nSuzhou China (2009), The Master-of-Nets Garden, retrieved 2009 \nMinistry of Culture, P.R.

          "This is a truly wonderful Chinese garden and one well worth the day trip from Shanghai. Our guide (Warren) was brilliant and knowlegeable. It wasn't too crowded on our visit (mid-October) and the weather was perfect. Don't miss the artists' room. Highly recommended.",
          "We visited early in the morning but it was still crowded pretty quickly. If you can ignore the people it is a beautiful space; a very classic Chinese garden with the harmony of buildings, water and rock plus a remarkable nine hundred year old tree. It is one of the four classic",
          "It is a well visited historic house and garden. The history includes a time when a famous artist was in residence but unless you have a guide a lot of the history will be missed because there is minimal information in English which is a pity.",

          "This beautiful Garden has a Night Show. Your imagination can work it's magic as you traverse it's paths. You can see how this garden might have been used in it's heyday because a guide takes visitors to different rooms and pavilions, to listen to performers play, sing, and dance",

          "While sometimes, it's hot and sometimes hard to hear, the performances of traditional Chinese cultural music, dance, opera, and plays are spectacular. The garden is harder to see at night, but the performances were well worth the limited view.",

          "Smaller garden, quite a bit of history. Not something I would have planned to see if not included in the tour. Our guide really brought out some interesting stories. There as a short drama performance that was 20 min long that was below average. Most of crowd left before the",

          "We made a quick stop to this garden with our tour guide Sunny, and it was incredible. All of the gardens offer a different look into the past of this 2,500 year old city. The architecture and the water add great views in every twist and turn. I definitely recommend stopping at",

          "Of course, it is beautyful quiet place. But - not only worth to see, also worth to understanding. In the pieces of beauty are hidden symbols of chinese tradiction, gems of traditional landscape, yin-yang artefacts... it is a lot of unclear transmissions everywhere in the garden.",
          "We took a tour of the garden with a guide which was very informative. We may have missed much of the detail without him. It was interesting to hear how the house was divided up. After a few days in Beijing, I felt that we had arrived in China at last (the contrast is quite",
          "Our tour guide described this place as a sort of respite for a particular artist and scholar, and indeed it has the hallmark of a learning centre. The gardens themselves are as usual quite inspiring, as a scholar would wish. In addition to the traditional water park, there was",

          "Much smaller than the \"humble administrator's\" garden, this one feels much more intimate and gives you a feel for what a family garden, albeit a wealthy family, feels like. The rooms are beautiful and furnished (not originals) to give you a feel for what they might have looked",

          "This garden is actually the home of a Chinese noble. The rooms are integrated with the garden so that appropriate views are available from each window. The garden is small in comparison with others in the area so it's a little easier to comprehend. It is also has a little less",
          "For only $100, you get access to the garden and the set of (10?) evening performances. The performances go continuously from 7:30-10pm and there is an English speaking guide if you need. While the performances are short, it's a good way to get a taste of local arts & culture.",
          "You pay 40 RMB to go into someone's old home. Yeah it has a small pond and lots of artificial rock formations but so what? You can see the same in larger scale everywhere in China for free. Lots of rooms inside, all the same. Definitely not worth more than 10 RMB and certainly",
          "Just a beautiful garden in Suzhou. It is one of the smaller gardens, but it isn't as crowded as the other ones. Since it is small and can be enjoyed in a hour or so, at a slow pace, take the time to walk around and soak up the scenery. If you can, pack a picnic and enjoy it",
          "This garden certainly is worth a visit, even after seeing the Humble Administrator's garden. It has some unique stone carvings (or original pieces of stone - not sure which)! The buildings are similar in style to some of the other gardens we have visited but have a beauty of",
          "The garden in whole is not so big, although it still worth to pay a visit, that you could finish it in an hour or so. If many tourists are visiting at the same time, some areas will be quite congested as the corridors are not wide in general. Although they have night session",
          "These ancient gardens are beautiful! The gardens are open mid-March to November; we attended in early April when the gardens had only been open a few days for the season. The gardens included local artists performing Kinqu operas, folk songs, dance, and music with traditional",

          "Upon reviews from other travelers on Trip advisor I saw this Garden at night purely for the night show. The cost was 100RMB which was a bit stiff for the performances. The street getting to the Garden is dodgy especially at night, one may be tempted to turn back thinking you",
          "We walked to the garden after lunch in this small town of Suzhou. It was Sunday and the locals were out and abound. This garden is a Unesco world Heritage site and theYin and Yan, the universal harmony is everywhere in the rock sculptures, buildings, and the pools. I loved the",

          "The garden is very nice, and peacefull. I wen there with 2 chinese colleagues, so I had not to look for the place. But as few people speak chinese, I'd recommend to have the address written on a paper to find the entry of the garden.",
          "The gardens have a relaxing feel to them. The pavilions are amazing. There are rocks in all sorts of shapes. Traditional Chinese furniture is available to see. The rooms are designed so they all have access to the main garden. Definitely worth a stop",

          "We saw the Lie Lingering Gardens and this one was just as beautiful with wonderful architecture, many rooms of furnishings, water, horticulture, bonsai, and history. Located right in the heart of old town in a small alley type street with lots of vendors. A definite must see.",
          "Master of the Nets Garden was a part of our tour. Hard to believe it was constructed in 1140 and very well preserved. It was very easy to walk around and view the many different well kept buildings. Many Kodak moments. Can definitely see why it was recognized as a World",

          "Very simple this is the most beautiful of all the UNESCO regocnized gardens in Suzhou ... Its is also not too overrun and more campact than the larger gardens which makes it easier to photograph and admire the different aspects of a classical Chinese garden",
          "This is a relatively small garden or set of gardens within a walled complex of courtyards. The Peony Study that served as the inspiration for Astor Court and Ming Garden at MOMA in NYC is beautiful and very surprising. Worth a visit just for that.",
          "Tad pricey for a peak season ticket, but very much enjoyed the garden. Picturesque courtyards, paintings to gaze upon, a chance to get lost in your thoughts, and altogether tranquil.",
          "This is a more interesting garden than some of the others as it is set over a small site with courtyards crating a variety of different spaces. There are many rocks and areas you can climb about making this a good family garden. To find the garden you have to go through a small",
          "Small garden not easy to find but follow the lane past the local stalls selling local art and gifts and you will find the entrance to one is Suzhou's hidden gems.",
          "Part of our tour but a worthwhile stop. Very easy and relaxing walk around the garden. Right in the area of all the China Town shopping so a peaceful break from the crowds. Worth a stop.",
          "A much smaller garden than Humble Administrator's, intimate and superbly elegant. Also not crowded, even on a Sunday. There are small buildings in the garden, designed to serve as frames for the views.",
          "I loved the story about the brothers that lived there and kept tigers. Sad for the tigers, but the drawings are amazing!",
          "We had a stop over in the master of nets garden we had a boat trip down the small river around the village we had lunch here as we were on on tour of china we were very lucky as there was just the two of us",

          "The architecture and design of this house and garden makes each view unique and quite pretty. The \"bonsai stones\" were very cool and this is well worth a visit when in Suzhou.",
          "Just a wonderful peaceful place to visit. Lovely water feature in centre of the property. Was part of a package tour",
          "This site is more than a garden. It is really a visit to an old Chinese mansion. There are a few beautiful traditional buildings around the pond. The buildings also have traditional Chinese furniture in the rooms. I really liked the various rock formations around the property.",
          "Another typical garden, but it's nice, small, and handy as is within the downtown core. Tucked away on a side street. Good for maybe an hour spent, then on to some other attraction. Oddly enough, across the waterway is the frontage of a \"military hospital #10\", and see if",
          "As my first visit to a chinese garden this was the highlight of my trip. Such a tiny space that provides so many views, corners courtyards and angles. Well worth spending time on.",
          "Master of nets is the most charming small garden in Suzhou worth visiting. Despite its small size the circular arrangement of the compartments gives the impression of being at different places all the way. I advise to visit on a week day, otherwise it's very crowded to enjoy it",

          "Lots of history here. Wikipedia does a better saccount of why this is on your must do list in China The Master of the Nets garden, then called Ten Thousand Volume Hall, was first constructed in 1140 by Shi Zhengzhi the Deputy Civil Service Minister of the Southern Song Dynasty",
          "Visited here late July evening, very hot, but worthwhile. The place itself is not huge and could be walked around in perhaps 1/2 hour and still see all the sights in details, but that would miss the point. The visit includes cultural shows that includes differing types of",

          "Suzhou is usually taken as a day-trip from Shanghai when all other options are expired. Honestly, it may have been the weather, and it may have been having been non-stop travelling for two weeks through China by train, but the Master of the Nets Garden didn't overwhelm me. I'd",
          "Of all the gardens in Souzhou this is the nicest, perhaps because being a bit off the tourist trail it does not get overwhelmed with visitors, a factor which sadly destroys the atmosphere of the more celebrated gardens. It's hidden, not very well signposted and even its",
          "A very beautiful old garden. I could have spent a long time here just sitting down and taking it all in. The Chinese really know how to make an impressive garden.",
          "Had a very nice atmosphere and was nice to see how this would relate back when people didn't have electronics to keep them entertained.",
          "the Master of Nets Garden is my favorit garden in Suzhou. it is a bit of a walk from the touristic centre and not so many people go there. It is much smaller then the Administrators' but it it is so much nicer. You can spend tranquille time and walk through the garden",
          "Suzhou is famous for its gardens, this one is a small, very small fascinating garden. A classical garden in miniature, enjoy the bonsai, the nature and the small house.",
          "Not at all like our North American gardens - very Zen and beautiful. One of the most beautiful gardens I visited in China. Not to be missed!",
          "This is a great introduction to the classical gardens of Suzhou. It seemed to me a little smaller and more approachable than others. The approach via the narrow little alley makes the exquisite beauty of the garden all the more entrancing.",
          "For me this is the most beautiful place on earth when it comes to garden and parks, this place is amazing.",
          "The garden part was only part of this garden, there were extensive buildings to wander through as well. I'm not convinced about the theory of viewing the moon in the mirror though the central lake was beautiful.",
          "Very small garden, of which half is actually more a house. When we were there, there were barely any other visitors (just before closing time on a weekday), which made the visit more enjoyable. Definitely worth to go when you are in Suzhou.",
          "very scenic and lots of architectural detail added. pleasure to walk around it and understand the history.",
          "The entrance to this garden is dark and dodgy which made me had second thoughts about visiting it at night, but night time turned out to be the best time to visit this cozy garden. Most of the other gardens in Suzhou close at night, so this visit gives the building and pavilions",
          "This garden is tucked away, down an alley, and hard to find without a guide. But, it is worth the effort. Beautiful gardens, beautiful story and history, and absolutely peaceful. This is definitely worth the trip. I combined touring Suzhou with a stop in Tongli. A nice",

          "Interesting for Chinese garden lovers. It was fine. We went as part of a organised trip. We may have enjoyed it more if it was cooler 36c.",
          "This was an enchanting place. Lots of little nooks & crannies made it possible to avoid the most crowded places. Well worth a visit",
          "Just fine if compared with other better gardens in Suzhou. Would recommend to collect the electronic guide or take a real guide with you, but not so worth wasting money. Better enjoy the bar and discos at shiquan jie",
          "You would never find this without a guide, it's just tucked away off the main road. It is beautifully laid out with living quarters, water features, twists and turns off which you do come to expect once you have visited a Chinese garden. Not as spectacular as the Hi gardens in",
          "To get the most from your visit you should have a guide who can tell you about the history as you go from room to room and garden to garden. Nice ancient buildings,ponds,gardens and bonsai. It wont take your breath away,but its well worth visiting for a couple of hours if you",
          "Hard to believe that you are in the middle of the old town Suzhou, even at the entrance. They are very quiet and traditional gardens and if you wanted to sit in corner and watch the world go by, no one would disturb you. Like all Chinese gardens, there are lovely plants, water",
          "A typical Chinese garden... No need to go to Suzhou specifically to visit one unless you have a special interest. The sections are small and the whole ex-residence feels crammed. English translations are lame as expected, which can't be said for the overall low maintained feel",
          "I toured this in daytime with guide - elbowed through the crowds - and thought it was just OK. Then I noticed that they have concerts at night, and I went again. Incredible difference! Some of the rotating performers seem a bit hammy, but the serious musicians on traditional",

          "Not a huge garden, but very beautiful. It is a World Heritage Site also. You have to walk through an alley way with little shops. We enjoy browsing around in the little shops on our way to the garden. Very similar to other gardens we have seen in China. Not a must see, but if",
          "It's reasonable in size to stroll. A beautiful and quieter garden as compared with all the others. Not a particular place for young children,",
          "It was pleasant walking down the walled alleyway to come upon this World Heritage Site as proclaimed on the plaque by the entrance. A small, private garden with a lake, library, and other walled gardens within the grounds, it makes for a tranquil visit, and a nice slice of",
          "We were with a friend who had never been to China before. The evening in the garden was a great way for her to enjoy several performances in a short time with the lovely bonus of seeing the garden at night. The organization was rather haphazard and finding the garden at night",
          "If you're already in Suzhou, this probably is worth visiting. The night performances we experienced were very amateur, but the night tour of the garens was quite nice. Note this attraction is fairly overpriced (100 CNY per person).",
          "Beautiful and tranquil gardens, not too crowded on a weekday. I really enjoyed it here, and found many places to take great photos of the reflections and scenery.",
          "Lovely home and garden, just what I wanted to see. Not over the top, but traditional home with beautiful gardens, corridors, and pavilions. Might be small, but certainly the best, even during a rain storm.",
          "The Master of the Nets Garden in Suzhou is, according to their brochure, one of the finest gardens in China. Brochures trend to exaggerate, but in this case, it is indeed a very fine garden. We spent several hours wandering around and enjoyed it very much. The complex was",

          "The garden feels very placid and tranquil compared with other parts of the city, so a nice place to get away from it all. The gift store is great, you are able to see some of the work that the artist created while living in the garden. I actually chose to forego the Yuyuan",
          "The garden is tucked away out of sight and, in consequence, does not get the teeming masses of visitors that spoil some attractions. It is an elegant home of classic architecture and the walled formal courtyards and gardens for which Suzhou is famous. Well worth a visit,",
          "Beautifully laid out gardens with a treasure around every corner. As other reviewers have mentioned, it can get very crowded so try it see it early in the morning as once it's busy there is no let up until it closes! It does have a few jaded corners but we thought that added to",

          "This was the second garden we saw in Suzhou. It is a lovely smaller garden, and by Chinese standards is quite good. The buildings, which form an integral part of the garden are somewhat dilapidated and the garden areas need some TLC. It was very overcrowded on the day we",
          "Went early (7.30) so had the place to ourselves - plenty of time to linger in the different pavilions. Such a gentle atmosphere and endless textures and shadows and beautiful glimpses to enjoy.",
          "We visited early in the season which left the garden in its bare bones state. I prefer flowers but have learned Chinese gardens are often rocks and water features. It was a nice oasis in the crowded city.",
          "We were lucky to visit it in the morning when no one was around. The weather was not the best (a bit cold and grey), but that keeps the crowd away.",

          "We paid 30rmb each to enter this renowned small garden and didn't regret it. There's really no need to see bigger places as this, in miniature, does and gives you everything you need - relics from the Qing dynasty alongside great photo opportunities in the landscaped gardens,",

          "When you are inside it is hard to believe you are in the middle of old town Suzhou, it is so peaceful. Built on traditional lines, it makes good use of water, plants, and framed views. Well worth a visit when you are in Suzhou.",
          "This garden is more intimate than the other gardens. It was my favourite. It also has a shop where you can buy paintings on rice paper or silk. Really nice!",
          "Very close to the bustling Shi Qian Road but quite and tranquil garden worthwhile to visit when you come to Suzhou. Not easy to find as off the road within a normal living area.",
          "This was a private garden originally built in the 12th century but remodelled in the 18th century. It was donated to the government of Sozhou in 1958. It is a beautiful small garden. However, as it was built as a hidden garden, only for the use of the owner, it is not easy to",

          "Small as others have described, but contains all the essential elements of a classical Chinese garden. The signs excellently explain the meaning behind the garden design. We went on our own and found it very peaceful and relaxed, compared to the Humble Administrator's Garden",
          "We visited this garden as part of a tour and felt a little rushed - I wish we'd been able to spend more than the 30 minutes they took us through the house and garden in. The house/indoor areas I didn't find all the compelling, but the outdoor garden was beautiful. It isn't",
          "Although the Master-of-Nets Garden is contained in a relatively small area the design gives an illusion of greater space. The charming pavilions offer a peek into the lives of the people centuries ago. The walkways weave through lovely planting beds and water areas. As we",
          "The garden is a quick tour but you can see how a traditional Chinese home look. The antiques are not much to see. Bathroom and ground very clean",
          "This was once a home to a rich family, now it's an attraction where people can wander at their leisure -- relax, meditate, and take in the beauty of the surrounding gardens. A peaceful gem in the middle of a busy city. There was a flutist playing in the pagoda for a little",
          "We were expecting a beautiful big garden as many others we visited but it was disappointing to pay for this place to see a small garden with people talking loud, no care of the plants and nothing that would tell us what was the history behind it. Save your money and go",
          "Without too much time to spend in Suzhou, we wanted to choose a nice garden (there are so many in Suzhou) to explore, and we're glad we chose this one. It's small enough to explore thoroughly and big enough to spend a good amount of time in. Definitely recommended!",
          "One of The best preserved gardens in Suzhou, it's hidden in the old city. It doesn't only show you a garden where everything is in perfect yin-yang balance, but also a slice of life of hundred years ago. In the garden each spot is like a painting. One more beautiful than the",

          "We arrived late in the afternoon after most of the tourists had gone. The downside was that it was getting late; the upside was that we mostly had the place to ourselves. There is a room in this garden upon which the garden room at the Metropolitan Museum in New York is based",

          "This was the second garden that we visited on our gate1, 16 day China adventure. This garden like the other was very beautiful. It made me think of what a Garden of Eden would be like here on earth. There were bridges, and ponds, magnificent florals and plant life, and the",
          "This one of the classical Chinese gardens in Suzhou that is well worth a visit. It is smaller, and much more compact that the more famous Humble Administrator Garden. It has a very different intimate feel. The garden is one of the few that can be visited in the evening, with",
          "I just visited the Master-of-Nets Garden yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed the visit. The crowds were not bad at all around 11am although the humidity was extreme. I enjoyed the fact that these gardens had many hidden hooks and crannies, and that you could feel relaxed although",

          "Though relatively small in size, this is an exquisite garden which has all 4 elements essential to a Chinese garden -- rocks, plants, water, and buildings. I greatly enjoyed my visit to this garden, so if you're ever in Suzhou, China, consider a visit.",
          "This beautiful garden is a little haven of calm. The architecture is wonderful and very typically Chinese. I could have spent hours looking around the gardens even though it's not a huge area. I also bought some wonderful silk Chinese paintings in the art gallery. A lovely day",
          "A very interesting garden - wonderful art, rock formations, tea rooms, a place of relaxation for the landed aristocracy.",
          "Across our trip around China we say many interesting gardens. I would say it is really worthwhile having a guide to explain about all the different rooms and various areas. So pleasant to have some tranquil space amid the hustle and bustle",

          "We were able to tour this with a group of college students, and even though it was raining it was charming with interesting things to experience. I thought it was worth it, even after having seen many other sites.",
          "The Garden of the Master of the Nets is one of several classical Chinese gardens located in Suzhou - a convenient day trip from Shanghai whether by car or train. It is smaller and more intimate than some of the other popular gardens. But it is our favourate since it attracts",
          "Almost hidden down a small alleyway this is a gem. A small elegant garden, its point of difference is how living areas have been amalgamated into the garden/external landscape. Like all gardens in Suzhou it comes with history and a delightful story.",
          "Visited after 4pm. so peaceful and quiet. Lovely little coffee/tea house and lots of nooks and crannies",
          "Nice gardens with a water pond and rock formations, nice place to visit while in Suzhou to get away from the hustle and bustle",
          "This is a smaller garden of many in Suzhou and worth seeing if in this area of the city. It is a classical Chinese garden with features normally found in such gardens. It also included a small tea shop and sitting area to view a portion of the garden as the master of the bets",
          "This was a fascinating garden, mercifully free of the crowds that throng the other attractions nearby.A beautiful place.",
          "A surprisingly quiet experience in the midst of the city. Tricky to find, which might explain the lack of crowds. Thoughtfully presented.",
          "Just gorgeous. Thresholds are very high and a lady fell and broke her arm coming out of the restroom. Really be careful walking through the building and garden.",
          "It is a very beautiful garden and you can easily enjoy it on your own. But when our guide explained all the symbolic in the different rooms and the gardens it gave a much better understanding. It is very beautiful and I can only imagine how wonderful it could be to have to",
          "I visited this garden with a tour group. If I had traveled alone, I would have gone to the Humble Administrator's garden. Unsure why we came here. Perhaps because we spent so much time at the Silk Factory...which is why I detest organized tours. However this garden was lovely",
          "Suzhou is 2 hours away from Shanghai and I hired a private guide and a driver for this trip. The garden is absolutely beautiful and worth 1-2 hours to visit and pictures.",
          "This garden was top of my list of gardens to visit in Suzhou, and it did not disappoint. March is not a busy time so it was possible to get photos without people in it. There was a school group sitting drawing various scenes, happy to show their excellent work, and practice",
          "This garden is the other garden we visited in Suzhou. Even though quite small there are very nice gardens in a very quiet location with not a lot of visitors. We had some difficulty in finding this garden and it is necessary a 15-20 minutes walking from the more central part of",

          "If you want a quick sample of one of Suzhou's famous gardens, then visit the Master-of-Nets rather than the Humble Administrators Garden. It is more sparse but also more intimate and much less crowded. It is a little tricky to find, down a stall lined ally off Ten Wells Street",
          "We visited the gardens and were surprised it really was away from much tourism. Some market shops but they didn't bargain much or chase after you...which was nice for a change. The garden was lovely but I was expecting more in the way of gardens. Seeing the ancient home",
          "The whole point of these gardens, in my mind, is the peaceful beauty. And since this is China, that doesn't exist outside of very early hours. If I had to do this again I wouldn't come to Suzhou on a weekend (Fri-Sun) and would have come to this (or other) gardens early on a",
          "You can really imagine what it must have looked like when Chinese officials retired here. The evening entertainment is a great way to see the garden without so many visitors.",
          "A must see for any garden , pond enthusiast.. Plan for 1-2 hours so that you can see it all. Lots to see",
          "I went here today. This is my second visit to this garden. Today I was lucky, it was not crowded and no tour groups! My first visit involved heavy crowds though (be prepared). Every detail in this garden was perfectly planned. My first visit The architecture of the home is",
          "This was a very nice garden and it was peaceful however it was packed with people. The period furniture and decorations really put you back in the time it was build. I can just imagine sitting in the garden contemplating life. The house and garden is not really that big so",
          "Went at night for the show...you go from one performance to another in different parts of the park..we had a good time..fun...you have to rush from one to the other if u want a seat..they are limited but each performance is only 5 or 10 minutes",

          "It has everything the larger gardens have but on a smaller more intimate scale. It is well maintained by the local people. There are some great views to be had round each corner / the sort you see in postcards but can never find for yourself. Well worth a visit",
          "This was a lovely little place, made up of many small buildings around a central pond. My husband, our adult daughter & I enjoyed strolling through the grounds. Everything is beautifully maintained & a joy to see. We went from building to building in a circle around the pond &",

          "During the day this is a nice stroll - but pick the late springtime when the weather is not too hot. At night, they have performances of classical chinese music. Set amidst the garden rooms and pavilions, it really takes the listener back to the era of imperial China. When",
          "This garden felt far bigger than it is due to the clever use of space. It has nice pavilions with interesting furniture. One of my favourite gardens in Suzhou.",
          "I really enjoyed the story of these gardens and the layouts were beautiful. It was very crowded when we went but I found it very peaceful and calming none the less.",
          "A place to restore the senses, this Netmaster's Garden was so calm and peaceful when juxtaposed with the huge, skyscraper-dominated cities of China (Souzhou was described as a \"small city\" by our local expert - population about 8million, similar to London!). To enter, it was",

          "I can recommend a visit to this garden, it is a typical Chinese garden but if you only have time to visit one garden in Suzhou there are more beautiful gardens than this one. If you have very limited time and only go to Suzhou to visit the gardens then I recommend you to visit",
          "Well, I haven't been to them all yet (only four or five), but I like this better than the Humble Administrator's Garden. It's smaller, less crowded, and less dry. I've been here six times, and I always find something new I haven't seen, or a room I haven't yet been too. When the",
          "This is an exquisite example of a Chinese Garden. There was no stone or plant placed without meaning and purpose. I recommend if you are in Suzhou, stop in and spend a couple hours. There is a little restaurant where you can sip a cup of tea and enjoy the beauty.",
          "We reached Suzhou in the evening so we decided to go for the night performances in Master-of-Nets Garden, saving the Humble Administrator Garden for the next day. To get to the place, you'll have to go through an alleyway. We had to wander in the dark for a couple of minutes",
          "I saw this one after spending most of the day in two others, namely the \"Humble Administrator\" and the \"Lion Forest.\" May have been because I now was tired, but this garden did not have as much of an impact. Still beautiful, of course, and had many peaceful nooks where one",
          "This garden was filled with flowers both real and silk for an upcoming festival. It was absolutely beautiful. So much meaning from the stones to the flowers and trees. Not to be missed.",
          "A bit difficult to find as it is off the main street. Nice compact garden to spend the afternoon in. Well thought out layout, interesting to learn of the background of each room's design. But if you come on your own, tough luck, in-house guide speaks mandarin only.",
          "Seen many of them and this one is my favourite. Nice, charming and interesting layout. There's always something around the next corner. Good stores nearby too.",
          "Suzhou is famous for all its gardens but this one is the best. It is very big and worth exploring. Best place in Suzhou to take pictures.",
          "I dont understand the bad reviews i saw about suzhou everything was beautiful and worth seeing and i would say if you are doing a tour save all your money for Suzhou and buy everything here.",
          "This garden is another example of the intricacies of Chinese garden aesthetics. Most interesting about it is the history of the naming of the garden, which involves a Confucian proverb and a retiring government official, who left his office rather than be sullied by corruption.,",
          "This one is my favorite in Suzhou. Really nice atmosphere and very pretty to see. It is quite small but still not overcrowded and very calm. Lovely to visit.",
          "A very relaxing place. It's a welcome rest from the craziness of Shiquan Street (which it is off of). There's a little tourist trap area outside it, but the gardens are very inviting.",
          "it's a nice and small garden with places to sit and admire and both the house and gardens to wander - just watch out for the stalls outside, the dude who claims to be the cheapest in suzhao will rip you off and lie about how he makes the pictures he sells. As always, buyer",
          "I really enjoyed this Garden. It's just the right size and it's really beautifully crafted. I happened to be in Suzhou on a rainy day, it was the best thing that could have happened. This Garden was EMPTY! We had it all to ourselves!! And it is spectacular! There is a small",
          "Master-of Nets-Garden is the smallest residential garden in Suzhou but is reputed to be one of the finest gardens in China. Because of its use of space, it appears much larger than it is. The rooms of the house are impeccable preserved. The garden is exquisite. It is relatively",
          "Our guide recommended we see this garden. Sometimes you can overdose on themes, but Chinese gardens do not do that to us. This one had wonderful pathways and art in unexpected spots. We are going to place stones around some trees at home like we saw here!",
          "In fact I do not like Chinese gardens. Compared to the splendid Japanese gardens they are not refined. But this one, compact, not too big, is the best I saw. If you are of old age you pay nothing or 50%. Show an identity paper",
          "One of Suzhou's famous gardens - tucked away from the tourist bus crowds, it feels intimate and relaxing",
          "We went in at 4.30pm not realizing it was just about to close (they didn't tell us). We were there for about 10 minutes when they started rounding us up to leave - we had paid so we stayed until 5 but they were closing off sections already. Other than that it was really",
          "This garden is apparently a World Cultural Heritage site so it holds some significance in Chinese culture and history. Definitely a must see while in Suzhou.",
          "This one being a world heritage site, I think my expectations were plain high. A very well preserved specimen of the old world Chinese home/garden, but Suzhou itself didn't seem worth a visit. I read many a travel guides and most emphasized that Suzhou is a must visit if you are",
          "This is a very nice garden, a bit more intimate than some, but totally worth checking out. Be sure to bring your camera for some nice photo opportunities.",
          "I think it was more the wrong time when we went because it was not what I expected. it was actually really dull. So in the future I think I'll be happy to just look at photos, especially for what we paid for.",
          "This privately owned garden was a bit disappointing after reading the hype about it being one of the most beautiful and perfectly proportioned in all of Suzhou. It was OK walking around the grounds but not worth a special trip out of your way to get there.",
          "Learning that the Garden opens at night with a variety of traditional Chinese art performance, I and my friend were highly excited. What could be more wonderful enjoying traditional art performance in a classical garden! It is such a great idea! We arrived there at almost 8 pm",
          "I am told that Master of the Nets is the best example of classical Chinese gardens. Perhaps I missed the point. Compared with the Humble Administrators Garden, the lake is smaller and is crowded by surrounding buildings. The taxi driver could not find it, and I spent an hour",
          "We went at night after we got into Suzhou on the train from Shanghai. It has 8 little performances that you get with your ticket that range from musical to theatrical. While you can't see as much of the garden at night, it is still beautiful. Don't forget to follow one of the",
          "We decided to visit this garden to see the night show. As it is a small garden, we felt the loss of daylight was not a significant deterrant, and it was quite beautiful to see it from the perspective of being lit at night. The night show consisted of I believe ten seperate",

          "We went to this garden in the morning and it was a pleasant experience (RMB30 for admission). This garden is relatively small, but makes up for its size in the details of the lovely landscape arrangements. There are many rock formations similar to the ones in lion forest garden",
          "Went here early in the morning. Not many people around. It was sublime. I liked it more than the bigger Humble Administrators' garden as it really showed good use of small space. I'll try to visit in early spring sometime to see it at its best.",
          "We visited at night to see and hear the different musicians play traditional Chinese music from various parts of the garden. It was like being in a fairyland. Not to be missed",
          "The Master of Nets garden would be great if it were not in a town full of fantastic classical gardens. It is more of a pond surrounded by buildings than a garden in Western eyes, but it has its merits. The only problem is that once you see the Humble Administrator's Garden,",

          "Around a tiny lake, it is the quintessential Chinese garden, in which you have to sit and try to see the place with the eyes of its creator, trying to connect with the plants, the stones, the water. It looks much bigger than it actually is. A great place to meditate and",

          "It sounds corny, but to \"get\" these places you have to hang out and chill for a while. If you go with a guide, then by all means follow her/him around and pick up what you can ... but the forced pace and constant yammering of a tour is the opposite of what the gardens were",

          "We were taken to this garden as part of our 3 week tour of China. Suzhou was one of our must see places for our trip to China. This garden was beautiful and serene. While there were a fair amount of tour groups here, we were able to have a visit that allowed us to appreciate",
          "During the evening, the Master of Nets Garden is open to the public to not only see the site itself, but listen to traditional Chinese music performed by artists in ancient garb. The gardens are dim, with lights reflecting off the ponds, and guides dressed in colorful silk gowns",

          "Another visit we made while we were in Suzhou was to visit this small garden As it is a small garden everything is proportional: the smallest bridge in the world, a small lake with small fish... it\u00b4s very nice. The pavilions have a normal size. We had a great time in this garden.",
          "It was a nice garden. Not crowded. They were doing a lot of work which moderated the experience somewhat. I wasn't great, though, but worth checking out if convenient.",
          "The Master of the Nets Garden is one of the most beautiful gardens in Suzhou. The maze like effect and the beautiful layout are truly memorable. However, I still give it a low rating. The reason being, at least in summer, it is so crowded with tour groups with guides screaming",
          "A taste of the Chinese classical performances like musical instruments and plays made the night an unique experience ofr my children, and for many non-chinese visitors. Visitors joined a group upon arrival, and went in a circuit to watch the various short performances in turn",

          "This garden has a wonderful evening cultural show. There are several pieces of music, singing and dancing throughout the evening. You follow one of the young ladies dressed in traditional dress and carrying a red lantern. She then moves the group from pavillion to pavillion."

        "wiki": "Suzhou (Chinese: \u82cf\u5dde; Suzhounese pronunciation: [s\u0259u ts\u00f8\u028f], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [s\u00fa.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u]), alternately romanized as Soochow, is a major city located in southeastern Jiangsu Province of East China, about 100 km (62 mi) northwest of Shanghai. It is a major economic center and focal point of trade and commerce, and the second largest city in the province, after its capital Nanjing. The city is situated on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the shores of Lake Tai and belongs to the Yangtze River Delta region. Administratively, Suzhou is a prefecture-level city with a population of 4.33 million in its city proper, and a total resident population (as of 2013) of 10.58 million in its administrative area. Its urban population grew at an unprecedented rate of 6.5% between 2000 and 2014, which is the highest among cities with more than 5 million people.Founded in 514 BC, Suzhou has over 2,500 years of history, with an abundant display of relics and sites of historical interest. Around AD 100, during the Eastern Han dynasty, it became one of the ten largest cities in the world mostly due to emigration from Northern China. Since the 10th-century Song dynasty, it has been an important commercial center of China. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Suzhou was a national economic, cultural, and commercial center, as well as the largest non-capital city in the world, until the 1860 Taiping Rebellion. When Li Hongzhang and Charles George Gordon recaptured the city three years later, Shanghai had already taken its predominant place in the nation. Since major economic reforms began in 1978, Suzhou has become one of the fastest growing major cities in the world, with GDP growth rates of about 14% in the past 35 years. With high life expectancy and per capita incomes, Suzhou's Human Development Index ratings is roughly comparable to a moderately developed country, making it one of the most highly developed and prosperous cities in China.The city's canals, stone bridges, pagodas, and meticulously designed gardens have contributed to its status as one of the top tourist attractions in China. The Classical Gardens of Suzhou were added to the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1997 and 2000. Suzhou is often dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" or \"Venice of China\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nDuring the Zhou, a settlement known as Gusu after nearby Mount Gusu (simplified Chinese: \u59d1\u82cf\u5c71; traditional Chinese: \u59d1\u8607\u5c71; pinyin: G\u016bs\u016bsh\u0101n) became the capital of the state of Wu. From this role, it also came to be called Wu as well. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu established a new capital nearby at Hel\u00fc City and this grew into the modern city. During the Warring States period, Hel\u00fc City continued to serve as the local seat of government. From the areas it administered, it became known as Wuxian (lit. \"Wu County\") and Wujun (\"Wu Commandery\"). Under the Qin, it was known as Kuaiji after its greatly enlarged commandery, which was named for the reputed resting place of Yu the Great near modern Shaoxing in Zhejiang.\nThe name Suzhou was first officially used for the city in AD 589 during the Sui dynasty. The s\u016b (\u8607 or \u82cf) in its name is a contraction of the old name Gusu. It refers to the mint perilla (shiso). The zhou \u5dde originally meant something like a province or county (cf. Guizhou), but often came to be used metonymously for the capital of such a region (cf. Guangzhou, Hangzhou, etc.). Suzhou is the Hanyu Pinyin spelling of the Putonghua pronunciation of the name. Prior to the adoption of pinyin, it was variously romanized as Soo-chow, Suchow, or Su-chow.\n\n\n== History ==\nSuzhou, the cradle of Wu culture, is one of the oldest towns in the Yangtze Basin. By the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou, local tribes named the Gou Wu are recorded living in the area which would become the modern city of Suzhou. These tribes formed villages on the edges of the hills above the wetlands surrounding Lake Tai.\nSima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian records traditional accounts that the Zhou lord Taibo established the state of Wu at nearby Wuxi during the 11th century BC, civilizing the local people and improving their agriculture and mastery of irrigation. The Wu court later moved to Gusu within the area of modern Suzhou. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu relocated his court nearby and called the settlement Hel\u00fc City after himself. His minister Wu Zixu was closely involved with its planning and it was this site that grew into present-day Suzhou. The height of his tower on Gusu Hill (Gusutai) passed into Chinese legend. In 496 BC, King Hel\u00fc was buried at Tiger Hill. In 473 BC, Wu was defeated and annexed by Yue, a kingdom to its southeast; Yue was annexed in turn by Chu in 306 BC. Remnants of the ancient kingdom include pieces of its 2,500-year-old city wall and the gate through it at Pan Gate.\nThe city was originally laid out according to a symbolic three-by-three grid of nine squares, with the royal palace occupying the central position.During the Warring States period, Suzhou was the seat of Wu County and Commandery. Following the Qin Empire's conquest of the area in 222 BC, it was made the capital of Kuaiji Commandery, including lands stretching from the south bank of the Yangtze to the unconquered interior of Minyue in southern Zhejiang. Amid the collapse of the Qin, Kuaiji's governor Yin Tong attempted to organize his own rebellion only to be betrayed and executed by Xiang Liang and his nephew Xiang Yu, who launched their own rebellion from the city.\nWhen the Grand Canal was completed, Suzhou found itself strategically located on a major trade route. In the course of the history of China, it has been a metropolis of industry and commerce on the southeastern coast of China. During the Tang dynasty, the great poet Bai Juyi constructed the Shantang Canal (better known as \"Shantang Street\") to connect the city with Tiger Hill for tourists. In AD 1035, the Suzhou Confucian Temple was founded by famed poet and writer Fan Zhongyan. It became a venue for the imperial civil examinations and then developed into the modern Suzhou High School in the 1910s.\n\nIn February 1130, the advancing Jin army from the north ransacked the city. This was followed by the Mongol invasion in 1275. In 1356, Suzhou became the capital of Zhang Shicheng, one of the leaders of the Red Turban Rebellion against the Yuan dynasty and the self-proclaimed King of Wu. In 1367, Zhang's Nanjing-based rival Zhu Yuanzhang took the city after a 10-month siege. Zhu \u2013 who was soon to proclaim himself the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty \u2013 demolished the royal city in the center of Suzhou's walled city and imposed crushing taxes on the city and prefecture's powerful families. Despite the heavy taxation and the resettlement of some of Suzhou's prominent citizens' to the area of Hongwu's capital at Nanjing, Suzhou was soon prosperous again. During the early Ming, Suzhou Prefecture supervised the Yangtze shoals which later became Shanghai's Chongming Island. For centuries the city, with its surroundings as an economic base, represented an extraordinary source of tax revenue.When the shipwrecked Korean official Choe Bu had a chance to see much of Eastern China from Zhejiang to Liaoning on his way home in 1488, he described Suzhou in his travel report as exceeding every other city. Many of the area's private gardens were constructed by the gentry of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Taipings captured the city in 1860, however, and many of its former buildings and gardens were \"almost... a heap of ruins\" by the time of their recovery by Charles Gordon's Ever-Victorious Army in November 1863. Nonetheless, by 1880, its population was estimated to have recovered to about 500,000, which remained stable for the next few decades. In the late 19th century, the town was particularly known for its wide range of silks and its Chinese-language publishing industry. The town was first opened to direct foreign trades by the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending the First Sino-Japanese War and by the most favored nation clauses of earlier unequal treaties with the Great Powers. The new expatriates opened a European-and-Chinese school in 1900 and the Suzhou railway station, connecting it with Shanghai, opened on July 16, 1906. Just prior to the World War I, there were 7000 silk looms in operation, as well as a cotton mill and a large trade in rice.\n\nAs late as the early 20th century, much of the city consisted of islands connected by rivers, creeks, and canals to the surrounding countryside. Prior to their demolition, the city walls ran in a circuit of about 10 miles (16 km) with four large suburbs lying outside. The Japanese invaded in 1937, and many gardens were again devastated by the end of the war. In the early 1950s, restoration was done on the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Lingering Garden.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe urban core of Suzhou is informally called the \"Old Town\". It is Gusu District. Suzhou Industrial Park is to the east of the old town, and Suzhou High & New Technology Development Zone is to the west. In 2000, the original Wu County was divided into two districts including Xiangcheng and Wuzhong. They now form the northern and southern parts of the city of Suzhou.In 2012, the original Wujiang City became Wujiang District of Suzhou City.\nSuzhou is one of the most prosperous cities in China. Its development has a direct correlation with the growth of its satellite cities, including Kunshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Zhangjiagang, which together with the city of Suzhou form the Suzhou prefecture. The Suzhou prefecture is home to many high-tech enterprises.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSuzhou is on the Lake Tai Plain south of the Yangtze River, about 100 km (60 mi) to the west of Shanghai and just over 200 km (120 mi) east of Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSuzhou has a four-season humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and cool, cloudy, damp winters with occasional snowfall (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa). Northwesterly winds blowing from Siberia during winter can cause temperatures to fall below freezing at night, while southerly or southwesterly winds during the summer can push temperatures above 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The hottest temperature recorded since 1951 was at 41.0 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) on 7 August 2013, and the lowest at \u22129.8 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958.\n\n\n== Cityscape and environment ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Classical Gardens of Suzhou ===\n\nSuzhou is famous for its over 60 Classical Gardens, collectively a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city has the Most UNESCO-recognized gardens in the world.The Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden are among the four most famous classical gardens in China. The Canglang Pavilion, Lion Grove Garden, Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden, respectively representing the garden styles of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, are called the four most famous gardens in Suzhou. Other gardens inscribed on the World Heritage List include the Couple's Retreat Garden, the Garden of Cultivation, and the Retreat and Reflection Garden.\n\n\n=== Temples ===\nHanshan Temple\nXiyuan Temple\nXuanmiao Temple\nLingyanshan Temple\nChongyuan Temple\nTaipingfang Mosque (\u592a\u5e73\u574a\u6e05\u771f\u5bfa)\n\n\n=== Canals and historic districts ===\n\nThe Suzhou section of the Jiangnan Canal, Grand Canal (China), includes ten city gates and over 20 stone bridges of traditional design and historic areas that have been well preserved, as well as temples and pavilions. \n There are a full 24 waterways in Suzhou near the Grand Canal.In 2015, both 800-year-old Pingjiang Road Historical Block (\u5e73\u6c5f\u8def) and 1,200-year-old Shantang Street Scenic Area (\u5c71\u5858\u8857) were added to the list of China's \"National Historic and Cultural Streets\".Pingjiang Road runs parallel to the Pingjiang River for 1.5 kilometers and is lined with homes and some teahouses. Shantang Street, over twice as long at 3.8 km, is described by the BBC as  retaining \"the alluring qualities of an old canal-side street: whitewashed buildings are completed by red-tasselled lanterns that swing softly in the breeze, adding to the charm of the river bank\".\n\nBoat tours are offered on the waterways of this city that was dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" by Marco Polo because of its criss-crossing canals and stone bridges. The Grand Canal (from Beijing to Zhejiang province) is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Resorts and natural reserves ===\nSuzhou Taihu National Tourism and Vacation Zone (\u82cf\u5dde\u592a\u6e56\u56fd\u5bb6\u65c5\u6e38\u5ea6\u5047\u533a) is in the western part of Suzhou, 15 km (9 mi) from the city center.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nGate to the East is a 301.8 meter, 74-story skyscraper in Suzhou's central business district, built in 2015 at a cost of 700 million USD and is currently the tallest building in Suzhou.\n\n\n=== Pan Gate ===\nPan Gate is on the southwest corner of the Main Canal or encircling canal of Suzhou. Originally built during the Warring States Period in the state of Wu, historians estimate it to be around 2,500 years old. It is now part of the Pan Gate Scenic Area. It is known for the \"three landmarks of Pan Gate\". They are the Ruiguang Pagoda, the earliest pagoda in Suzhou built in 247 BC, the Wu Gate Bridge, the entrance to the gate at that time over the water passage and the highest bridge in Suzhou at the time, and the Pan Gate. The Ruigang Pagoda is constructed of brick with wooden platforms and has Buddhist carvings at its base.\n\n\n=== Baodai Bridge ===\nBaodai Bridge stretches across the Tantai Lake in the suburbs of Suzhou. To raise money to finance the bridge, the magistrate donated his expensive belt, hence the name. The bridge was first built in 806 A.D. in the Tang Dynasty and has 53 arches with a length of 317 meters. It was made out of stone from Jinshan Mountain and is the longest standing bridge of its kind in China. The bridge was included on the list of national monuments (resolution 5-285) in 2001.\n\n\n=== Tiger Hill ===\nThe Tiger Hill is known for its natural environment and historical sites. The hill is so named because it is said to look like a crouching tiger. Another legend states that a white tiger appeared on the hill to guard it following the burial The hill has been a tourist destination for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, as is evident from the poetry and calligraphy carved into rocks on the hill. The Song Dynasty poet, Su Shi said, \"It is a lifelong pity if having visited Suzhou you did not visit Tiger Hill.\"\n\n\n=== Pagodas ===\nYunyan Pagoda (or Huqiu Tower) built in 961 is a Chinese pagoda built on Tiger Hill in Suzhou. It has several other names, including the \"Leaning Tower of China\" (as referred to by historian O.G. Ingles) and the Yunyan Temple Tower. The tower rises to a height of 47 m (154 ft). It is a seven-story octagonal building built with blue bricks. In more than a thousand years the tower has gradually slanted due to forces of nature. Now the top and bottom of the tower vary by 2.32 meters. The entire structure weighs some 7,000,000 kilograms (15,000,000 lb), supported by internal brick columns. However, the tower leans roughly 3 degrees due to the cracking of two supporting columns.Beisi Pagoda or North Temple Pagoda is a Chinese pagoda at Bao'en Temple in Suzhou. It rises nine stories in a height of 76 m (249 ft). It is the tallest Chinese pagoda south of the Yangtze river.\nTwin Pagodas (\u82cf\u5dde\u53cc\u5854) lie in the Dinghui Temple Lane in the southeastern corner of the city proper of Suzhou. They are artistic and natural as they are close at hand. One of them is called Clarity-Dispensing Pagoda and the other Beneficence Pagoda and they are in the same form of building. There are many legends about the one-thousand-year-old pagodas. It is charming that the exquisite and straight Twin Pagoda look like two inserted writing brushes. There was originally a single-storey house with three rooms just like a writing brush holder with the shadows of the two pagodas reclining on its roof at sunset. To the east of the pagoda is a square five-storeyed bell building built in the Ming Dynasty which is exactly like a thick ink stick. So there is a saying that \"the Twin Pagodas are as writing brushes while the bell building as ink stick\".\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city's major museums include the Suzhou Museum (designed by I. M. Pei), Suzhou Silk Museum, and Suzhou Museum of Opera and Theatre.\n\n\n=== Hospitals ===\nAs a result of its recent rapid population increase, healthcare demand in Suzhou is increasing rapidly.

Suzhou's overall GDP exceeded RMB 1.3 trillion in 2013 (up 9.6 percent from the year previous).The city is also one of China's foremost destinations for foreign investment, based on its relative proximity to Shanghai and comparatively low operating costs. The municipal government has enacted various measures to encourage FDI in a number of manufacturing (e.g. pharmaceutical, electronic goods, automobile) and service (e.g. banking, logistics, research services) sectors. Included among these measures is a preferential tax policy for limited partnership venture capital enterprises in the Suzhou Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Development zones ===\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park ====\n\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) is the largest cooperative project between the Chinese and Singaporean governments.

Suzhou's brocade production can be traced back to the Five Dynasties. It prospered in the Song Dynasty. After the government moved the capital southward, the country's political and cultural center moved to the Yangtze River area. To cope with the special need of artists, a type of very thin brocade for decorating paintings emerged in Suzhou. These brocades and paintings have been preserved.

          "There seems to be some confusion between the Silk museum and the factory that has silk items to sell - The Silk museum is a real museum with very good displays that explain how silk was discovered and the history of silk farming and weaving in China. In addition to the history",
          "I was here as part of a tour group, so our guide gave us some explanations, but there are also some explanatory panels in English. This museum gave a complete explanation of the process for creating silk, from the mulberry plants outside the entrance, through to the pupas and",

          "Not sure where else you can go (in the world?) to learn both the history of silk making and see it being done live. Truly eye opening! Yes, there is a shop at the end, but there was ZERO pressure to buy anything and it was actually nice to see some of the items that were",

          "Really interesting museum to visit and learn about the silk history in China, also amazing old mechanism that was used for the silk industry, one with two woman still operating it. Would be great if someone was there to help explain what and how it works, but impressive to see",

          "I was taken here as part of a tour. They take tourist here to shop, the \"workers\" in the factory are just actors. Its actually a shiny shop with lots of silk product that have questionable quality. I ended up buying a pillow So they will leave us alone.",

        "wiki": "The Tiger Hill Pagoda, more officially the Yunyan Pagoda (Chinese: \u4e91\u5ca9\u5bfa\u5854; pinyin: Y\u00fan y\u00e1n s\u00ec t\u01ce; Suzhou Wu: Yuin nge zy thaeh, Wu Chinese pronunciation: [\u0266\u028fn \u014be\u031e zz\u0329 t\u02b0\u0251\u0294] or Chinese: \u864e\u4e18\u5854; pinyin: H\u016d qi\u016b t\u01ce; Suzhou Wu: Hou chieu thaeh, Wu Chinese pronunciation: [hou t\u0255\u02b0\u028f t\u02b0\u0251\u0294]), also sometimes translated as Huqiu Tower, is a Chinese pagoda situated on Tiger Hill in Suzhou city, Jiangsu Province of Eastern China. It is nicknamed the 'Leaning Tower of China'.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe primary pagoda of the former Yunyan Temple, which was founded in 327 and rebuilt for the last time in 1871. The temple suffered damage in successive wars and most of the temple was destroyed during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Some elements of the temple such as the formal entrance, the Yunyan Pagoda, and several other buildings and smaller shrines have survived, and now stand as landmarks throughout Tiger Hill Park. \nConstruction of the pagoda began in 907 CE, during the later period of the Five Dynasties period, at a time when Suzhou was ruled by the Wuyue Kingdom. Construction was completed in 961 CE during the Song Dynasty.The uppermost stories of the pagoda were built as an addition during the reign of the Chongzhen Emperor (1628\u20131644), the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Yunyan Pagoda rises to a height of 47 m (154 ft). The pagoda has seven stories and is octagonal in plan, and was built with a masonry structure designed to imitate wooden-structured pagodas prevalent at the time. \n\n\n=== Leaning tower ===\nIn more than a thousand years the pagoda has gradually slanted due to forces of nature. Now the top and bottom of the tower vary by 2.32 meters. The entire structure weighs some 7,000,000 kilograms (15,000,000 lb), supported by internal brick columns. However, the pagoda leans roughly 3 degrees due to the cracking of two supporting columns.The pagoda leans because the foundation is originally half rock and the other half is on soil. In 1957, efforts were made to stabilize the pagoda and prevent further leaning. Concrete was also pumped into the soil forming a stronger foundation. \nDuring the reinforcement process, a stone casket containing Buddhist scriptures was found. The container had an inscription noting the completion date of the pagoda as the seventeenth day of the twelfth month of the second year of the Jianlong era (961 CE).\n\n\n== Present day ==\nThe Yunyan Pagoda is a designated Major National Historical and Cultural Site in Jiangsu.  As of September 2010 public access to the top of the tower is no longer allowed.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== References ===\nIngles, O.G. \"Impressions of a Civil Engineer in China,\" The Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs (Number 7, 1982): 141\u2013150.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSong Dynasty architecture\nMajor national historical and cultural sites (Jiangsu)",

          "Nice hill in the middle of town. We were going to hike up (its about a 20 min hike) but after seeing you need to pay 60 CNY and that we could see the tower from the bottom we decided against it. Our guide said the view was not that great from up above. It is a leaning tower.",

          "I was positively surprised how nice & big this place was. We spent around 2-3 hours walking around through bamboo, slowly going up to the pagoda & afterwards ending admiring the area around north exit. Definitely worth to visit. Just be careful that from north exit you\u2019ll",

          "This place worth a visit! There is not so many visitors during our visit. Entrance 40 RMB. Main attraction is the inclined tower. There was also an art exhibition about the two towers Pisa and Tiger Hill. You can walk around see old Chinese houses and the tower that's it.",

          "Apparently, the Emporer saw a white tiger while up on this hill, many moons ago, and so it's now called Tiger Hill. The tower was built as a tomb, in honor of this emporer (or his wife?), and there are many tiger's engraved in stones, etc, around the gardens. It leans a bit",

          "We went on a quiet afternoon (Chinese New Year Eve) and it was very nice. It is not the most stroller friendly place so take note if bringing a stroller. There are some very nice paths good for strollers but often turn into stairs. There is a nice path surrounding the park that",

          "Very nice. You have to spend a couple of hours. The best part, the bonsai garden from the bottom. The pagoda inclined as the pisa tower. The stone to test the swords.... The best of Suzhou, no doubt ... much better than the canals of the old city ...",

          "The famous leaning tower of China is a wonderful landmark and is set in some very beautiful gardens. Round the back of the hill is a tea plantation and a bamboo forest. It might be best to take an informed local with you to get the best of it, or read up on your Suzhou history.",
          "This is basically a giant outdoor museum with lots of beautiful wildlife. You have to walk a lot so be prepared. We happened to go when it was pouring so plan ahead because it rains a lot in Suzhou. There are great photo spots as well. Specifically in front of the Yun Yan Pagoda",
          "Be ready to climb a few stairs to reach the pagoda. Similar to the Humble Administrators Garden - signs introducing key areas are in English and Chinese. Enjoyable visit but I would recommend the Humble Administrators Garden over Tiger Hill if you are short on time.",
          "A relaxing walk to unwind with some different landscapes and well priced (student discounted entrance fee is 40\u5143). Wouldn't consider it a must see, however if you have time (1-2 hours) it's not very strenuous and has some nice sights.",

          "The visit on \u864e\u4e18 (Tiger Hill) would be best experienced with a tour guide. The guides would be able to share anecdotes on the smaller attractions around the pagoda, known as the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Asia. This is a nice place if you have time to learn about the history of",
          "We visited Tiger Hill in Suzhou last week. Suzhou has several temples, gardens and historic sites to see. Tiger Hill is one of them. It has a large, pagoda style building in a wooded setting. At the base we learned we could see the area from a horse drawn carriage at 30 RMB",
          "Nice to see! Some nice pictures! Go outside and enjoy the garden! Chinese Touristen are not interested in!",

          "Although it's a cold morning with 8 degree temperature, there're beautiful flowers on last day of Lunar New year with a good walk around the gardens and to the pagoda. Took plenty of pictures and had pleasant memories of the place. Will be back.",

          "Built on a hill, this park contains many gardens and walkways. Probably crowded in the high season but certainly worth visiting. Plan to spend time just wandering around. There is a tea house in the park (which is quite large) and many other things to see. Very well maintained",

          "It's a long walk through the park to get to get to,the Tower but is well worth it. The guide told us interesting stories including that there is a cave underneath the tower with a King who is buried there along with 3000 swords! They did drain the lake and found a cave under",
          "It is a 14 metre climb to the top to see the pagoda which the locals call Chinese Pisa. It is over 1000 years old and is amazing to see. The gardens and surrounding buildings are very interesting. It is very crowded on the weekends.",

          "Visited there and it is a hill with a lot of visitors. Quite difficult to walk with kind trolleys. Of course place to visit with quests. Some one recommended a boat trip from Tiger Hill to SIP. Next time we will try that one.",
          "I visited Suzhou in June 2017. After visiting four classical Chinese gardens (Humble Administrator's Garden, Lion Forest Garden, Master-of-Nets Garden, Lingering Garden), I took a taxi to Tiger Hill. The Tiger Hill complex is a very interesting place but be prepared to do a",

          "The Song Dynasty poet, Su Shi said, \"It is a lifelong pity if having visited Suzhou you did not visit Tiger Hill.\" I would agree with this statement. The gardens were wonderful and peaceful and the tower on the top of the hill leans precariously. Many myths and legends surround",
          "The park is beautiful and the pagoda has a slight inclination due to the inappropriate foundation. The myth behind the name (tiger hill) is probably the most interesting feature. However, if you are in Suzhou you probably shouldn't miss it.",
          "If the place is not crowded it's a nice place to spend an afternoon. It is hilly, and you can have some nice views",
          "I loved the garden, the pagoda, the folklore. It was, fortunately, not too busy. Flowers line the path up to the pagoda, a local group of young women performing, the ritual of springtime be it in China or back home. It was a most pleasurable experience and one that should be",

          "When in Suzhou, this is a must see sight. We hired a tour guide, which is highly recommended because there aren't any literatures to provide background. As other reviewers shared the grounds are beautiful. The tour guide shared not to take photo with the pagoda as it is a tomb",
          "This is one of my favorite garden and pagoda in Suzhou. unfortunately tickets are too expensive but must seen. there is small temples inside small lakes.. all the information about important things are written but in chinese. pagoda inside looks like pizza tower in italy.",

          "I took a taxi from my hotel to Tiger hills. It dropped me off at the ticket booth where I picked up a ticket and then spent a good chunk of the afternoon walking around the part exploring the beautiful grounds. There is a tea house there as well as gift shops, visita points,",

          "There is so much to explore and see here from the tower itself to the various buildings housing rock sculptures and bonsai to the bonsai gardens and the water features. Bring walking shoes, or have a horse drawn carriage or electric tram cart you around. There is a lot to see.",

          "Went there during the holiday and got disappointed! There are sooooo many people in this place that made us decide not to climb the hill.",
          "Although it was super crowded, it was incredibly beautiful. It was much larger than I anticipated and spent much more time there than I thought I would. There were many different cool sections to look at and historical artifacts to view as well. I would recommend this to",
          "Another wet day but the walk around this attraction was worth it. Nice gardens and some good photo ops. Pagoda looking a bit \"tired\" (not well maintained).",
          "Not only the pagoda itself, but the whole park is extremely beautiful. Good place not very crowded with tourists (in Chinese standards).",
          "My favourite place in Suzhou. So beautiful and green. An excellent place to wonder around and kid friendly. Interesting history and quite a bit of information around to read. Costs 60 to enter and well worth it.",
          "Been there on 03.12.2016. Entrance fee 70 yuan. It has ancient garden decorations and some beautiful lake within the hill. The most interesting spot will be the pagoda at the top of the hill. Takes around 2 hours for the visit. Compared to Humble administrator's garden, this",
          "I went in December and a ticket cost 60 RMB (ticket prices may vary based on season). It was a good trip because there was a guide (explained in chinese) who can be requested at the area along the right lane after entry. This helps to give you insights about the pagoda and the",
          "The smalk walk up the incline is nice, weaving through various gardens and stones. The tower is nice but entry isn't permitted as it is tilted. The view from the hill top was a bit disappointing with too much urbanization around. All in all a nice place but not worth the entry",
          "Absolutely gorgeous location. The gardens are wonderful and nice mix of history involved within the attraction as well. One of my favorite places in Suzhou",
          "I would definitely recommend this place far more better than the traditional crowded gardens in Suzhou. It is BIGGER, you can spend half day here if you want, take lunch with you and sit somwhere and make a picnic. The place has forests inside, so you can enjoy a calm walk, but",
          "I simply love this attraction. We went during the off-peak season so not too crowded. Nice little walk/climb up the small hill to see the Sword Pool and then the leaning pagoda.",
          "Loved the garden here - the whole hill a small forest garden with historic buildings and relicts. The tower itself is also worth seeing.",
          "This is the first time we were visiting this hill. We were here in November and the weather was comfortable. The fall color just emerging and a little fog on the day we were there. We had hired a tour guide, speaking Mandarin, and took the tram up to the hill and walk from the",
          "Tiger Hill was very interesting. Best part was walking Shantang St to get there. Really got a chance to see old Suzhou. You miss so much with the boat or bus trip. Walking helps you experience the people.",

          "My husband and I went on bus 146 all the way. It's either 1 or 2 RMB to get there depending on the month. The entrance fee was 60 RMB. We entered the gate by the bus terminal. We entered and then took the boat ride half way around the area. There is some construction work going",
          "Wonderful park with many ancient relics, interesting legends connected with different places and 1100-year old inclined pagoda",
          "In my plan for you in Suzhou to visit this place because old history and nice nature is also very nice for people interested in historical place",
          "This was interesting because it was different. A huge leaning pagoda on top of the hill with various other sights on the way up plus local history. Seemed to suit locals as well as tourists",
          "The Tiger Hill has lots of trees, and it just like a forest. We went there in the afternoon but no sun that day. So we felt a little bit cold when we walk around. There were few roads to go to the hill, so my friend and I decided to walk separately. I chose the road that few",
          "There are several aspects of Suzhou, China that convince you that there does not exist an appropriate adjective nor collection of adjectives that helps describe the beauty of this place, and Tiger Hill is one very clear example of this. From the pagoda to the beautiful old",

          "An international Historic Site that gives a great feel for what ancient Suzhou must have been like. It was definitely worth visiting, but since it's all outdoors, you should not go unless the weather is good. It's a large site, and takes quite a bit of time to cover. It would",
          "Its hard to believe this predates the Leaning Tower Of Pisa yet you never here of it unless you are in Sushou. Well worth the visit to walk thru the gardens and climb the hill to see the pagoda . One can only imagine what it was like in bygone years when the monks worship at",
          "Tiger Hill is huge with plenty of steps - but there are plenty of open places where you can take rests. as one of the previous viewers have stated, best to hire a guide who can explain all the historical significant of all the attractions because most of the signs (that provide",

          "There were a few guides(Mandarin speaking) near the entrance that offered their service for 50 yuan, we decided to give it a try. Best 50 yuan spent!! (We also encountered a couple of English speaking guides leading different group in the park, so they are out there.) He led us",

          "Another attraction that one should visit. Of course, lots of tourists but not an issue. Prepare for a short hike to reach the top but nothing straneous. I recommend going EARLY to avoid the crowd, heat and more time to enjoy the hike, nature in the early hours and better",
          "We were unsure exactly what tiger hill was but set out based on trip advisor recommendations. This was easily the best thing we did in Suzhou. We would see this over the Humble Administrators Garden",

          "Amazing amazing place to visit, seeing the leaning tower and just walking around the grounds, so magical!!",
          "This is the Chinese equivalent to the leaning tower of Pisa. The temple at the top of the hill is also leaning, but it was stopped before it get to the point where it could collapse by the government who wanted to protect the building. The nature around is very pretty and the",
          "This site has 2500 years history but as almost every time in China you can't feel it Well for Chinese Suzhou is said to be heaven on earth The area is covering around 3 hectares with some nice parks. The main attraction is the pending pagoda. Quite impressive but you can't",

          "we paid 20RMB to get driven by a cart. will advise you do that otherwise it is a LONG walk. We had a guided tour which helped to understand the significance of some places. I took great pictures. i can understand why many famous poets have written about this place. it was worth",
          "Came here with few expectations but the tower is incredibly ornate for something 2000 years old and it's definitely Leaning !",
          "It's a super nice scenery, but it's a bit boring compared to what is written thereon It is a good walk in the woods with much history and myths",
          "Tiger hill is incredible. Steeped in history and incredibly beautiful. One of the few places in Suzhou where you can get lost and find empty spaces of tranquility and beauty.",
          "This is among the better choices for water and garden type visit. Has historical value as well. Provides for a nice walk among the greens. Keep 1-2 hrs if you have time. Wear comfortable shoes",
          "A place for honeymoon. Many pretty flowers here. Similar to Vietnam but with Chinese names. Also, a good place to take photos for souvenir.",
          "Chinese Version of the leaning tower...a place to relax and brisk walk to see the flowers and bansai... man made waterfall and others.. Worth the walk but the only thing will be slightly off the city area... Have to have someone to bring around else the Black market will be",
          "My first time to visit Tiger Hill, unfortunately on a day of almost 40C heat. Still it was a very interesting walk, and quite a pretty place with things to see. I am not a fan of tour guides, but we had someone join in English (it is included in the ticket if you have a Mandarin",

          "We went to Suzhou for a weekend getaway. It's a nice city, with lots of typical Chinese Gardens. Tiger Hill was nice, very busy on Sat-Sun, even melting/steaming hot weather didn't stop crowd of tourists. In general we had very good impression, I'd like to get back in late",

          "Tiger Hill is a large park with the leaning pagoda as the center piece. It is a good place to spend half a day and enjoy the grounds and a picnic. A lot of walking is required to see the entire area and there are many steps. It is good for a family outing.",

          "This place is a must see place for turists that comes to Suzhou, this has a great story and a beautiful area with a lots of myths.",
          "This would have been a highlight of my stay in the area, however there was scaffolding obscuring all of the main structure while I was there. I'm not too sure how long the works will be ongoing for, but worth a trip once its completed!",
          "We neither saw the tiger nor the hill! Our taxi driver indicated that the pagoda is under construction and then proceeded along the road and dropped us off at the entrance to a classical garden which was NOT part of Tiger Hill. We only realised that later. What we saw was the",
          "The pagoda is under renovations, but even without the scaffolding, it's not much to see as far as ornate designs on the outside. The attraction is the beautiful grounds that weave around the hill. A great place to explore and relax. You can take an electric car around and up the",
          "Second time come to Suzhou this beautiful city. I Visit tiger hill and some new shopping area. Cycle along Jinji lake and enjoy the scenery of food at Li gong Di.",
          "A very impressive historical place. Especially the tower that has been constructed without using any cement or clay but is glued together by the white of eggs centuries ago. Not to talk about fights that made it a bloody place long ago.",
          "The main pagoda of this attraction was under renovation (covered with bamboo scaffolding) when we visited in mid-August 2015, as that was a major boo boo after taking the trouble to travel out of the city to this attraction. Stop by the tea house for a great view",
          "Pagoda at the hill is just the cherry of the amazing walkway experience with small artificial valley with rich natural and environmental scenes you could only imagine in Lord of the Rings film (without sunshine though).",
          "Unfortunately the pagoda is undergoing restoration so we couldn't climb it. A perfectly pleasant walk up to it and very interesting history",
          "This is a fantastic place to visit in Suzhou, The time i visited the pagoda under renovation,so cant see the whole tower, its similar the leaning tower of Pisa, the garden is good and this place is really old. There is a old beautiful Buddhist temple, and a water stream and",
          "A must go place but only if you have someone to describe the history. With the Buddhism , and communist riots, the history of nodding stones, and the deep well, which they always say has precious material in it....lol!",
          "I recommend visiting the Tiger Hill after going into a crowded part of the city like a shopping street or the historic city. The difference from the noise and crowdedness of the city to the serene and at least less crowded garden is really astonishing. Aside from that the",
          "It's a nice place to spend your time. You can walk around yourself or take one of the little tour cars to take you up to the hill after which you can walk back down yourself. Beautiful gardens, only the leaning pagoda is under construction. That was a pity.",
          "This is good place to spend few hours. Slightly away from city. Had few hours with me and could see a sneak preview of china culture and past. Well maintained and has a few good photo spots. You can a good walk in serene nature and enjoy couple of waterfalls too.",
          "We came here based upon previous reviews. After wwiting out the rain we tokk tourist bus 1 (very convenient) to its terminus. The entrance price is 80, not 60 as I had thought, a minor disappointment. The park itself is very picturesque. It breaks off into many small",
          "Take time to explore the many varied gardens and landscapes on this site... an experience of a lifetime!",
          "After doing the museum and the humble garden yesterday this was a breath of fresh air and I would recommend it over the other two. Really nice buildings, nice scenery and generally quite relaxing. The only negative is the main tower is still closed and covered in scaffolding but",
          "The view is very beautiful and all surrounding are silent. I recommend you visit there at the morning in the day with the nice weather, not sunny not rainy. Also there is a small temple there.",
          "I have to say that I was most looking forward to seeing the famous leaning pagoda at tiger hill, though my first view after purchasing my ticket was of the pagoda on its rocky hill, surrounded by scaffolding! The rest of the scenic area is still a nice wander, seeing thousand",
          "I really liked the Spring of Simplicity and Honesty, which is a well that first appeared as a spring to an exhausted monk carrying water up the entire length of the hill. The hill has been a tourist destination for hundreds of years. There are evidence of this from the poetry",
          "Tiger Hill is one of the better spots in Suzhou. The view is nice but a bit hazy due to the pollution.",
          "The garden itself is nothing special compared to the other offerings around Suzhou. The pagoda at the top is really a sight, though. Hard to understand how buildings that big can lean so much and stay upright.",
          "the mo.st amazing place in Suzhou. the tower is slightly leaning and is a wonderful sight. The best part here are the fruit vendors, selling different varities of local stuff. Do try them. there is a small market as you enter with lot of stuff for sale including food stalls",
          "Following the footsteps of my father who climbed up the Tiger Hill over six decades ago, I pilgrimaged to the sacred place in my heart. It's easy to get there by almost any bus stop at Quanqianjie North within 25 minutes. With the crowds moving forward, I saw huge rocks and the",

Without knowing the full story background, we found that we can't really",
          "This is one of the largest and most relaxing historical gardens in Suzhou. Enjoy walking around and going up and down through the various \"rooms\". The spring is a must see. Currently the pagoda is under conservation repair.",
          "The complex of the hill is so beautiful, vast and full of interesting things. The pagoda is eye catching while the garden is very nice. Loved this place.",
          "Sorry the pagoda was wreathed in scaffolding. The bonsai garden is superb - absolutely a must see. The trees are well cared for and beautifully presented.",
          "visited Tiger hill from Shanghai as a day visit to Suzhou in our 10 day trip in China. It is not really a hill. You can go closer to the attraction by bus. Then walk . nice with flowers of different varieties. Best season to visit is April - May. during the period place is",
          "Even the famous tower was blocked due to remodeling, it was a great place with thousands of stories. But do not want to visit the public toilets!",
          "We could not see anything because there was a restoration going on and we wasted time to go there. So travellers going there in the coming months check if restoration is finished.",
          "From the moment we arrived at Tiger Hill we were impressed and after our escorted tour of China's highlights we both felt this was the best garden we visited. When you arrive you first come across a waterfall and the gardens throughout are beautiful and well tended. We",
          "After lunch and a short rest, we took the bus Y1 to visit Tiger Hill. The entrance fee is now 80RMB. The impressive attractions on the hill is Pagoda of the Yunyan Temple and Sword Pool. Pagoda of the Yunyan Temple, also known as Tiger Hill Pagoda, is seen as the leaning tower",
          "A great half day tour for adults and kids alike. Walking around the Pagoda,tree's and a short boat ride.Small food halls,horse and cart rides etc.",
          "Unfortunately the tower had been bamboo scaffolded and there was no admittance to go inside.The tower is pending, just similar to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It is a great place to stroll and enjoy for half a day - better go early in the morning because it will be crowded in the",
          "Tiger Hill is really huge! Of course the greatest disappointment is that the iconic pagoda was undergoing maintenance when we were there. Hence, we took a walk in the other parts of the park. The greenery was very lush, and sets my mind in peace...this place is a rare gem that",
          "We entered via the north gate which is quieter. It is possible to take a boat ride on a circular route arounf the island the pagoda stands on. having looked at the map we decided to go all the way round and then walk in and exit via the south gate. It got busy very quickly.",
          "Tiger Hill is large and comfortable with history, gardens and a big ol' pagoda that unfortunately was encased in bamboo scaffolding. Not to worry. There is a nice tea house near the top, cafe's at the bottom, great views of Suzhou, and a colony of egrets threatening to poop",
          "I went here with my tour group Tiger hill can be describe as a collection of major and minor historical landmarks. These landmarks would be undecipherable without the help of a guide. We walk through the site with a guide and we feast on the historical stories of the various",
          "Visit it, and you will not be disappointed. Early in the morning, still quiet and not crowded. Take a look at the Pagoda, enjoy the lakes, river, paths, grass, trees, flowers. Find a peace within yourself.",
          "Great forested hill with bamboo and other assorted trees. If you like to stroll in a forested area, Tiger hill is a place you should not missed if you visit Suzhou. There's also a Pagoda that is historical and there are more to see !",
          "It takes 30 mins out of the city and our guide (QuinQuin booked through Trip advisor) brought us here, as my husband had a list of places that he believed we would be most interested and she confirmed that they were of merit. We visited the Humble Administrators Garden first",
          "our group had a guide, so it all made sense. very historic site. very interesting and scenic . I enjoyed our stop here. and would read up on the story a bit more to understand the importance of it .",
          "We stopped in here on the way to Suzhou City (for business). Very relaxing and interesting location and worth the stop. We had the benefit of a local guide with us who was able to fill in the gaps for English speaking tourists, but I would suggest even without this, it would",
          "It was the afternoon of our last day in Suzhou, and after an enjoyable morning at the Pan Men scenic area in the south of the city we had time left for one more \"attraction\" in the city so decided to visit Tiger Hill. Until the Pagoda of the Rock is reopened , unless you really",
          "We had a long climb to get up to the pagoda on top of the hill; but it was worth it. When we came to the pagoda, there was scaffolding on it. The entire structure is masonry and designed to imitate wood construction. The pagoda weighs 15,000,000 pounds. It did appear to need",
          "The Tiger Hill has a lot of significance to the Chinese crowds, but not so much to all of the foreign tourists. The best spot is of course the Leaning Pagoda, the oldest leaning tower in the world. I would give it a second go, only if I had no other things to do in Suzhou. It is",
          "Tiger hill has not tiger but it's a nice place to go. Story has it that there are swords being hidden in the lake and there was even a sword that was crafted to cut through a stone and there is even a stone there as prove. Not sure if it's true but it does sound incredible. Got",
          "The complex looks deceptively small when you enter. We went over a weekend morning & it was not very crowded. Could be because the main pagoda is still under repair & surrounded by scaffolding mostly. You can climb the stairs up straight to the pagoda or take a slower",
          "It happened to be a nice sunny day on the day we went to Tiger Hill. Unfortunately, the pagoda tower on top of the hill is under maintenance and has scaffolding going half way up the tower. Nevertheless, the garden surrounding the hill was lovely and we enjoyed a walk around the",
          "Beautiful gardens around Pagoda. Wear comfortable shoes as there are some steps. Construction around base of Pagoda but visit still worthwhile. Look out for the funny Chinglish translations in the garden.",
          "I thought Tiger Hill was a very interesting experience. One of my favourite parts is the bonsai tree garden. All the little trees are very cute! You can take a trolley up the mountain if you are quite lazy, or short on time, but the hill is a nice walk.",
          "Tiger Hill was stunning. The entrance was 60 RMB and that came with a free guide but they only speak Chinese. I would imagine you would take MUCH longer here if you had the tour. I wandered around for about 2 hours and took lots of pictures. I am fairly sure I saw about an",
          "I gave this place 4 stars simply by virtue of being something different to do in a city that is mostly gardens. It actually is a really cool pagoda, but it is kind of a pain to from the city for what will surely be a short trip; a few photos and thats it. That being said, it is",
          "The best in this case is to go there by car and come back to Shantang Street. The park is nice, they have their own Pisa Tower. Nice architecture buildings on the way up, nice gardens and flowers.. After your visit, get out of the gate and turn left, you will see a small boat",
          "This towers is ok, but there isn't really anything attractive around it, and the walk there was horrible. I am not sure why Suzhou is portrayed as a nice, garden town. Very puzzled and disappointed.",
          "Please don't go there in summer- it is stifling. The main attraction is the ancient pagoda and the surrounds are good for a picnic provided you sit on the ground. Nothing much else there.",
          "Been here a couple of years ago, but visited again as had a friend visiting from home. Some parts are under renovation, so it can be dusty and muddy. It's a nice place to spend a couple of hours, but do note that there are a number of uphill paths. We especially like the two",
          "Loved this place the best, pagoda is closed for visitors, but the surrounding hill garden with the river, boats, bamboo forest, and walkways through the trees were lovely. You can ride around the pagoda hill by horse drawn buggie or electric cart. 60RMB. Last stop on the Tour",
          "It is called the Asia's Eiffel Tower according to my guidebook. The youth hostel staff suggested me to visit there because this place is for all-seasoned sightseeing place and it would be a valuable scenery which only could be seen there. This place has not only the Tower but",
          "In china trips you get used to visiting many temples and pagodas that at the end you just feel .. Another pagoda?!! well it was fine, with a bended architecture, nice to have photos there.",
          "Situated within a short taxi ride from the center of Suzhou, this park (or hill, also known as Surging Sea Hill) with a history of more than 2500 years is definitely worth a visit. It is large and to fully appreciate all that it has to offer would take considerable amount of",
          "I really liked this as the pagoda is like the leaning tower of Pisa and for china , has not been restored so does give you the impression of what it might have really been like. The english signs about the park are hilarious and the market on the way out is very good value.",
          "We liked the outdoor experience that involved moderate walking. Take care to observe and visit the pagoda at the top of the Hill. It is best to visit Tiger Hill with a local tour guide.",
          "It's the most attractive and old pagoda of Suzhou. Worth a visit of you are in Suzhou. You can spend a whole day or an hour it depends on how much time u have got to spend on this place. The place has wide area of park ( a forest type actually ) and a bonsai garden with a vast",
          "To me, the main attraction of Tiger Hill was the leaning Pagoda (called Cloud Rock Leaning Pagoda (Yunyan Ta) in Trip Advisor) (see in Trip Advisor Suzhou attractions). But the rest of Tiger Hill is a beautiful park with historical meaning. We had a local guide take us there",
          "This is a very busy day !!! You must remember when you visit any Chinese attraction it is not quiet make sure you have good walking shoes on as it's not for the faint hearted this is one hell of a walk !!! But when you reach the top the sights are fantastic !!! The boat trip is",
          "We very much enjoyed this beautiful park! The \"leaning tower\" is beautiful as are many other buildings. We spent an entire dat here. We used bus #949 to reach the site and we returned to our hotel using bus no. 1. A great day outing!",
          "loved the scenic view of wooden gondolas on the river, and the bright Chinese lanterns. It was all so interesting.",
          "Lots of history and legends associated with this place, plus a remarkable leaning pagoda ... also the access point for a cruise on the Grand Canal.",
          "Tiger Hill is certainly worth seeing. The ancient tower and surrounding area gives you a sense of Chinese history and culture. One of the better spots in Suzhou.",
          "When I stood in front of pagoda on Tiger Hill and looked at it I had feeling it must be breaking the laws of physics. Pagoda's leaning angle was too high for my brain to digest it because brain said: such high, more than one thousand years old structure made of bricks with small",
          "This is a bit of historical preservation in the middle of old Suzhou with a city wall that dates back over 2500 years and a leaning, seven-story, eight-sided tower that is around 1100 years old. There are small forests and pathways to meander about. You can easily forget that",
          "It is a peaceful place, take your time while walking around the gardens. Not far out of Shanghai, worth the trip if you have time.",
          "Tiger Hill located not far from Suzhou town, just grab a taxi to get there and spent me about 20CNY one way. The entrance fee is quite expensive, 80CNY per person, you can pay some extra money to hire a guide if you want to understand more about the history of this place. Make",
          "We really enjoyed this area. There was much to see -- bamboo groves, tea orchards (?), beautiful buidlings and of course the leaning pagota from the 900s. We spent a couple of hours enjoying the sights. This requires alot of walking! The area around Tiger Hill was a little",
          "I loved visiting Tiger Hill. We missed out on a lot of the history due to our guide not speaking English, but it was wonderful to walk around and just enjoy the space. Make sure to visit the bonsai trees - it was my favorite part of the day. The garden was so peaceful and not",
          "This is a parkland area which is very popular, and so very busy. The hill has been a tourist attraction for hundreds, if not thousands of years, as is evident from the poetry and calligraphy carved into rocks. Well worth the visit if you're in Suzhou.",
          "The pagoda is the oldest in area and the gardens and rooms are very interesting. It is a big place a lot of walking",
          "We were here by Sept 2014. We take a golf car to the top of the hill then walking down slowly. There is a temple with 500 years history on the top side. The air is so fresh and clean. A lot of Anion here. While walking down the hill, we listened lot of stories here from",
          "It was not crowded so we had a nice time just walking around and taking pictures. There was also a performance of Chinese dancers that most probably told some story but we were late so it was just a nice sight for us.",
          "Although this is outside the old city, it is definitely worth the detour. The leaning pagoda is impressive! It can be crowded at the top but we found the park on the hill a very pleasant experience.",
          "Met my expectations. Nice gardens and if you go on a quiet day then plan extra time to soak in serenity and all the little gardens and paths to explore. One trip here is enough but if you tie this in with a water town then you get a full flavor of Suzhou.",
          "It is very large garden. It is easy to get there. I take bus no. 146 to the final stop. the ticket fee is RMB 80 at this moment. It took 2-3 hours to walk in this garden.",
          "The tower was very pretty and the gardens were really well kept. Wasn't the greatest thing I saw in China/Souzou but it was a great place to take a break. We stopped here (i was on a tour) and we had an hour to explore. It was more than enough time. We actually ended up",
          "This is a great location overlooking the old Suzhou city. It is worthwhile to take an open electric bus (30 kuai) around the perimeter of the grounds to get a sense of the grounds an things to see. There is also an open electric bus to the top. It was 93 F when we were",
          "A must-see in Suzhou. The pagoda/tower is amazing, as are all of the little gardens and landmarks dotted about the hill. Take your time to wander where you please, it's a very relaxing experience. I highly recommend going to the little old tea-house at the back of the hill for",
          "I loved walking everywhere on Tiger Hill.the water that was flowing down from the high mountains was so clear and amazing to drink the tea that was made with it. Indeed worthwhile to order the dish from from the famous lotus powder and to have a cup of tea in the restaurant up",
          "My favourite attraction in Suzhou is this Tiger Hill with beautiful spring flowers, temple and the spectacular oriental leaning tower! Missing this place as if I had never been to Suzou!",
          "It was an ancient royal burial site (2500 years ago) with an leaning tower nearby. and over the years, many famous painters and poets have visited here and left many writings and stories. It is a mixture of natural beauty, Southern Chinese garden/landscaping arts and Chinese",
          "Many hidden treasures are in the back of the garden. The arch gates, stone mountains, artistically made plants, and flowers, blend nicely together. Such tranquility made you feel that you could still have some peacefulness and stillness in the corner.",
          "One of my favourite garden in Suzhou, enjoy a nice point of view from the tower. Do not forget to go to the far back of the garden where you will discover a very nice and peacefull lake with a tea house and old chinese playing cards or dominos. Very nice and peacefull.",
          "In the Tiger Hill, you can find trees, flowers, stones, and a leaning tower. Yes, a leaning tower. I was surprised to see a leaning tower aside from Pisa Tower in Italy. But apparently China has one too, but I guess lots of people don't know that since I only knew when I saw it.",
          "Tiger Hill was a great part of my Suzhou experience. The Pagoda and the history of the site is very interesting. I thought that the story of 1000 workers being killed after constructing a hidden mausoleum on the site to keep the location secret was intriguing (though a bit",
          "it is one of the rare cases when the original old building is neither rebuilt nor even decorated to look better: it just stands firm (though with some visible slant) in its old-styled dignity. There is huge park around with quiet walkways, ponds and channels with local style",
          "I was surprised to see another leaning tower besides Pisa! It is a historical site and you get to see nice surrounding with a perfectly well kept place.",
          "Regarded as the \"first scenic spot in the State of Wu\", and comes with much history and many legends. See the Sword Pond, the famous leaning pagoda (supposedly it has been leaning since its completion in 959-961AD!!). There are some views of Suzhou from the top but it is the",
          "beautiful garden with great view over Suzhou, however not the 'best' garden I've seen! Great little market at the entrance where you can buy the tourist stuff. Good atmosphere!",
          "This place is filled with good history and nice pagoda. Love the way the pagoda is tilted. Got nice garden as well. Thy also have an English speaking self help guide for you.",
          "This place is absolutely beautiful. This was by far my favourite. The gardens are amazing and are surrounded by trees and wonderful landscape. This is a must see place if you are in Suzhou. I loved the leaning Pagoda, it kind of reminded me of the leaning tower of Pisa",
          "Tiger Hill gets less coverage than the gardens of Suzhou, which have been afforded UNESCO protected status, but you should also make time for Tiger Hill, which offers a good overview of the charms of this part of China. In this one site you can see beautiful, landscaped gardens-",
          "This was my favourite site in Suzhou. It is a huge lush park with well marked trails through trees and gardens. I spent about three hours wandering and enjoying the views. There are many tourists but since the park is so large it is easy to avoid the feeling of being in a",
          "It's a nice hike unless there's a lot of loud people chatting. Suzhou elder citizens do not have much to do during the day so they sit around and chat really, really, really, like REALLY loud.",
          "Should occupy 90 minutes of casual walking; plants are well maintained; the garden is interesting; and the park seems to absorb crowds very well.",
          "Fantastic penjing collection in the Suzhou style, March had a Spring flower display along with a huge teapot covered in moss. Interesting woodland walk to the Moon Pavilion where there were bird fanciers taking the most amazing shots of tiny birds, which they were happy to",
          "Really cool leaning tower, and various places for children to play. Beautiful gardens even in winter",
          "Its a shame anything nice in China is walled off and an entrance charged. This would be a lovely place but its so busy on Weekends you literally cannot walk to the top of the hill, without climbing around the path.",
          "Coworker recommended I visit Tiger Hill on an off day- I was treated to a great winter day to see a beautiful piece of history. Not too many people in January- great views. Lots of hills/steps, so be sure to wear good shoes. This site is great for a picnic- wish I had brought a",
          "It was worth a visit but hard to get a picture without someone walking into your picture because it was so crowded. Also, I found that visitors don't really care if you are having your picture taken as they waste no time walking right in front of you! Be ware of spit too.",
          "This is the first place all visitors come to Suzhou to see. First, for its scenic garden and the Wedding Street (many boutiques) and is very popular with locals and tourists.",
          "Great views, various fun artifacts around to look around, it is just pretty worthwhile to just wonder around and enjoy the scenery and try to find the fabled objects of legend. ps best enjoyed in late spring, before summer's suns and tourists pps that photo atop this page is",
          "nice place to stroll around especially in the late afternoon when the sun goes down and the locals flock to the area to sit and enjoy the natural environment",
          "I enjoyed all the spots around Tiger Hill. The story itself is fascinating. I wouldn't compare it to the Leaning Tower of Pisa but it its definitely worth taking the time to visit. I was on a tour so we had a lot of information ahead of time. I did not find the pool where the",
          "This is a must see if you are in this area. Equal to the leaning tower of Pisa. The park and garden area are beautiful, but the pergola is the must see. Amazing architecture that has with stood all that time has thrown at it.",
          "The park is very picturesque and peaceful. When we were there they had an out door show which was ok. We walked up to the pagoda on top of the hill but it was not open to the public. Leaving the park you run the gauntlet of the usual bric a brac stalls selling the usual",

          "Fascinating and well maintained piece of cultural history. Learning of the origins and history of Tiger Hill was a very well spent hour. The leaning tower has it's challenges and it is good that public access is denied. The gardens are superb.",
          "If you tune out the crowd, you can imagine how it was maybe like in the time of the old emperors and rulers. Quite a walk on the main trail, but you can still walk (or maybe even jog?) further around the hill. Good dose of nature and history.",
          "Would have enjoyed it more if we would have been able to understand where and how about the site. There was little in English... our problem for not being able to read more than that. The other gardens in Suzhou, we never desired or needed a local. Beautiful site. Love the",
          "my husband went with work colleagues and said this was an oasis in the city of Suzhou. with a magnificent 'slightly leaning' temple. with lots of beautiful gardens with bamboo and bonsai trees, waterfalls. a great day out.",
          "I didn't know there was another leaning tower, so I learnt something straight away! The tower has had some restoration to it which unfortunately means the top,doesn't match the rest. The top is also,straight whilst the rest is still leaning. Built long before Pisa so the Chinese",
          "We visited Tiger Hill Pagoda and grounds on a beautiful spring day, trees were green or in blossom, the bottom part of the hill had thousands of flowers, Tulips, Daffodils, etc there were solo musicians playing in amongst the garden, it looked wonderful. The walk up to the",
          "Tiger Hill is a pagoda on a top of a greeny hill. I don't think it is very interestning and don't expect to find a chinese style garden there. The way to the Tiger Hill was the nicest part of visiting this place. You can walk a long Shang Tang old town street, all the way a",
          "There is a long steady climb (up Tiger Hill) to reach the pagoda at the top but it really is a beautiful climb, beautifully landscaped surroundings & greta views from the peak.",
          "The garden had a rock theme to it. Only plants were trees and some greeneries. No flowers. Very crowded since it was a very nice day. I liked the garden but did not like the crowds. Trash were thrown every where. No one seems to care about littering.",
          "This beautiful place has everything in one place. If you don't have a lot of time to sightsee, you should see Tiger Hill. You get a pagoda, a temple, a canal you can take a boat ride on, gardens, buildings that have lots of history, bonsai collection , ponds all with different",
          "I loved this place. The story is inspiring. There is just so much history here. Hard to remember all of the details. I wrote them down and tried to keep an accurate record, be sure and go here.",
          "This spot is very interesting when we know about the history behind. How this Pagoda could be more lean every year. The place is quit large to have sight seeing here and there. It has hilly road, stony, and a bit stairs. Not reccomed for elderly due to the walk path. As other",
          "If you only have 48 hours in Suzhou, like I did, it's ok to skip this spot. The pagoda is nice and the grounds are lovely, but it's just so far out of the city. I was traveling alone, and it was nearly impossible to find a cab at around 4:30PM to head back to the station.",
          "It is one of the must to tourist spots in Suzhou. The pagoda is not too big or great but the garden on the hill is nice worth a trip. Excellent place to take pictures.",
          "A very enjoyable visit. A large pagoda on top of the hill, on a slight lean. Don't be in a hurry and explore. A different feel and views on either side of the hill. A favourite attraction in Suzhou.",
          "Different from other attractions, but quite far from the city. There were nice food beside the road call \u6d77\u68e0\u7cd5 another i forgot the name. Beautiful and calming scenery. Not recommended to those who can't walk a lot of steps. Many caligraphy worth as a piece of the local",
          "We actually walked there from the train station although that is about 3 km walk so probably a taxi is more efficient if you want to walk around more gardens in Suzhou. This place is definitely worth the visit. It's quite large and very pretty. The pagoda is also beautiful to",
          "It is pricey to see but they sometimes put on a show of some sort. It is supposed to have thousands of ancient swords buried there but you don't see them. A boat ride around the moat is cheap and fun.",
          "This was quite far from our hotel but it was worth going to. It took us about two hours to tour. The entrance fee was too expensive",
          "it is maybe the oldest site of Suzhou and certainly worth a visit to see the almost falling progoda and watertown nearby.",
          "I visit this place with my friends. Not so many things to see on this place so no need to spent lots of time to explore the whole spot. But its quiet good to visit or just spending time on holiday to know more about China, especially if you visit Suzhou.",
          "This was not on our planned itinery but a friend took us for a few hours. There is some walking involved but this is truly very different from the usual gardens that you will undoubtedly visit. The area is some 3 acres to the North West. The climax is the Yunyan Pagoda, 7",
          "Tiger Hill is a beautiful spot where you have the option to take different hiking paths and get away from the crowds. There are great views from many areas, some beautiful plantings of bamboo and trees, and a whole area of bonsai trees. The leaning pagoda retains it's ancient",
          "What can I say but I was overwhelmed with the beauty of the whole area. But beware of the steps if you have any breathing problems",
          "I agree that this place is over priced, the only interesting thing in the are is only the pagoda that really look old, others is nothing, I don't know why government charge so high price for this kind of place, I wouldn't go there anymore",
          "Tiger Hill is a true tourist attraction, but in the best sort of way. It has lots of space in a nice park and incorporates traditional performances of dance, music, and opera. At the top of the hill is the wonderful ancient pagoda that architecturally shows the influence of",
          "It is a bit disappointing that anything worth a visit in China costs you money and sometimes quite a lot. 60 RMB for a hill with a pagoda and a bonsai garden is just a bit steep. I cannot quite imagine we would have to pay to get into a park anywhere in Europe; in China it seems",
          "Other than the pagoda there are some nice gardens around Tiger Hill. Worth a stop off but doubt you would need to spend long there.",
          "We took a taxi to Tiger Hill from the North Pagoda (18RMB). It was drizzling- that didn't dampen our enthusiasm as much as the large tour groups did. At every attraction, the guide of the group would hog the attraction pushing anybody nearby and ensuring that his/her group was",
          "Easy to reach via tourist bus. A big hill to explore, but for me, it was nothing special except the stone pagoda at the top of the hill. Many small garden & pavilion here and there, and there are a big garden with bonsai all over it. Less crowded so I can enjoy the view",
          "Most people climb Tiger Hill up the main avenue, we were directed via the right taking a more zig-zag route. This was much more interesting, impressive and less crowded. We came across a large area with hundreds of bonsai.",
          "This tower is truly outstanding, and the surrounding area is beautiful. There's a climb to the top, but the view is worth it.",
          "The grounds are beautiful. A lot of history. Very interesting sword in stone story. The big golden Buddha is nice. Good view of Suzhou in the fall and winter from the high elevation. The only thing to note is there is a lot of walking up stairs; if you can't walk up a lot of",
          "It was hot, dusty, dirty and nothing of any interest; Rubbish strewn about. The tiger hill pagoda is not particularly inspiring. There are so many more interesting places in the area. I wouldn't waste time on this one",
          "I went to Tiger Hill for the very first time, though I had heard about the place many times before. This place was built during the Spring Autumn Period of China (771 - 476 BC). It was just mind boggling looking at the leanning tower and comparing it with the Leaning Tower of",
          "The ancient tower, the history, the spacious park. At festival times there is interesting entertainment. Watching the people is interesting.",

          "Tiger hill should be on your itinerary for Suzhou. It is actually an artificial hill - a tomb in fact, and has some lovely views and areas. There is a super bridge over a stream that, despite being crowded with Chinese tourists, was really breathtaking. At the top of it is",
          "An example of architecture and planning which we Westerners do not seem to do as well. But then it is old.",
          "Typical garden from Suzhou city and it is part of Suzhou history. If visit Suzhou must go there. Around of the Tiger Hill there is a small village that can find a lot of tradicional souveniers.",
          "Worth a visit to enjoy the views? Scenery was indeed absolutely spectacular.",
          "The whole surrounding of the Garden is wonderful and it is very comfortable to walk either",
          "There is so much to see here. Lovely flowers and buildings. There were an awful lot of people here but it is possible to find a bit of space occasionally. Definately a \"must visit\" though!",
          "Great place to get away. Like most of the sites in Suzhou you need to get away from the beaten path to find some space. Relaxing space away from the city center",
          "Very interesting place, absolutely worth visiting. Electronic guides in english language can be borrowed in the information.",
          "A pleasant escape from the business of Downtown Suzhou. Lots of other visitors but more space to roam!",
          "This was the third lot of gardens we had been to and we were over the milling crowds, however this garden was exceptionally beautiful.",
          "Plan to spend a whole day here as there is much to see. Again I would go during the week as the weekends are much more crowded!",
          "Great time to visit is in spring when blooms are coming out.",
          "Getting to the area is a little difficult due to the traffic...but just close your eyes and let the cab driver weave in and out walkers, motorcycles and other drivers. Before you know it, you'll be at the entrance gate (the fee is about $8.00 to get into the site). Make sure",
          "It requires quite a bit of walk up the stairs. It's a pity that tourists are not allowed to get inside the Leaning Tower unlike the Italian one in Pisa.",
          "Nice and big green area, especially nice when in the spring with all the flowers. Interesting historic buildings.",
          "In Suzhou, Tiger Hill is very visible with the leaning Pagoda! Extensive gardens and a good walk up to the summit very pleasing.",
          "a good hike up the hill... but it would be great to have more English signboards so the none-Chinese speaking tourists can appreciate the Tiger Hill history more.",
          "Impressive garden, give the boat ride or the horse ride a try (fun for the kids), the gardens are very beautiful in the right season (spring / summer), less attractive during winter time. The huge bonsai garden is amazing.",
          "I recommend visiting Tiger Hill on a weekday. On weekends the crowds can make the experience a bit difficult. Also avoid summer, as this is a hill, although not very steep, you still have a long uphill walk. There is much history to the site. If you can go with a tour group",
          "It was lovely to walk around and see nature while in the city. I enjoyed the water, trees, and seeing the leaning pagoda. A lovely experience",
          "The tower looked to be the center attraction. It was at the start, but after walking to it, I found it was the rest of the park that I really liked. There are all kinds of unique smaller gardens all throughout the park. My favorite thing I saw in Suzhou.",
          "This was interesting, but just in a walk by and take a picture and leave way.",
          "Well, I've expected to see nice views from the top of the hill - but there were trees all around, so no views. Pagoda looks nice, but for people who have seen other things in China - it is nothing amazing. You could see it to spend your free time, but if you are visitor with",
          "This is a lovely, peaceful place to visit whether you want to climb the steps to the temple or just meander the scenic grounds. Even during the ultra-busy Chinese holiday week, Tiger Hill provided a quiet respite from the crowds.",
          "Chinese Heritage site. Interesting to see the unique temple architecture. Nice views.",
          "Our visit to Suzhou was a side trip from our stay in Shanghai. We want to visit a water-town and decide to choose Suzhou as we could also visit some gardens, being some of them on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Tiger Hill was one of our choices due the existence of the Pisa",
          "We visited Tiger Hill during the spring festival, on a weekend - needless to say it was pretty crowded - but really enjoyed the half a day we spent there. Its kind of a botanical gardens type scenic area. Being the start of spring there were still many trees without leaves,",
          "I visited this place with my business collegues. The weather was increadbly hot and humid, for this reason we had a small electrical car to climb to hill. And then we walked down by visiting all parts of this area. There is also Budha Templete inside. It is really interesting",
          "We chose to check out Tiger Hill on New Year's (Metal Rabbit) Eve and the weather happened to be wonderful! After a month of freezing cold and chilling wind, our Tiger Hill day happened to bring the promise of spring. There wasn't a huge amount of people or any crowds anywhere:",
          "Last fall, while visiting our son in Shanghai, China, he took us on a fun and educational day trip to the lovely town of Suzhou. By train, you can get to Suzhou in less than an hour, if you take one of the newer, faster trains or in a little more than an hour, if you take a"

        "wiki": "Suzhou (Chinese: \u82cf\u5dde; Suzhounese pronunciation: [s\u0259u ts\u00f8\u028f], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [s\u00fa.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u]), alternately romanized as Soochow, is a major city located in southeastern Jiangsu Province of East China, about 100 km (62 mi) northwest of Shanghai. It is a major economic center and focal point of trade and commerce, and the second largest city in the province, after its capital Nanjing. The city is situated on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the shores of Lake Tai and belongs to the Yangtze River Delta region. Administratively, Suzhou is a prefecture-level city with a population of 4.33 million in its city proper, and a total resident population (as of 2013) of 10.58 million in its administrative area. Its urban population grew at an unprecedented rate of 6.5% between 2000 and 2014, which is the highest among cities with more than 5 million people.Founded in 514 BC, Suzhou has over 2,500 years of history, with an abundant display of relics and sites of historical interest. Around AD 100, during the Eastern Han dynasty, it became one of the ten largest cities in the world mostly due to emigration from Northern China. Since the 10th-century Song dynasty, it has been an important commercial center of China. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Suzhou was a national economic, cultural, and commercial center, as well as the largest non-capital city in the world, until the 1860 Taiping Rebellion. When Li Hongzhang and Charles George Gordon recaptured the city three years later, Shanghai had already taken its predominant place in the nation. Since major economic reforms began in 1978, Suzhou has become one of the fastest growing major cities in the world, with GDP growth rates of about 14% in the past 35 years. With high life expectancy and per capita incomes, Suzhou's Human Development Index ratings is roughly comparable to a moderately developed country, making it one of the most highly developed and prosperous cities in China.The city's canals, stone bridges, pagodas, and meticulously designed gardens have contributed to its status as one of the top tourist attractions in China. The Classical Gardens of Suzhou were added to the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1997 and 2000. Suzhou is often dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" or \"Venice of China\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nDuring the Zhou, a settlement known as Gusu after nearby Mount Gusu (simplified Chinese: \u59d1\u82cf\u5c71; traditional Chinese: \u59d1\u8607\u5c71; pinyin: G\u016bs\u016bsh\u0101n) became the capital of the state of Wu. From this role, it also came to be called Wu as well. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu established a new capital nearby at Hel\u00fc City and this grew into the modern city. During the Warring States period, Hel\u00fc City continued to serve as the local seat of government. From the areas it administered, it became known as Wuxian (lit. \"Wu County\") and Wujun (\"Wu Commandery\"). Under the Qin, it was known as Kuaiji after its greatly enlarged commandery, which was named for the reputed resting place of Yu the Great near modern Shaoxing in Zhejiang.\nThe name Suzhou was first officially used for the city in AD 589 during the Sui dynasty. The s\u016b (\u8607 or \u82cf) in its name is a contraction of the old name Gusu. It refers to the mint perilla (shiso). The zhou \u5dde originally meant something like a province or county (cf. Guizhou), but often came to be used metonymously for the capital of such a region (cf. Guangzhou, Hangzhou, etc.). Suzhou is the Hanyu Pinyin spelling of the Putonghua pronunciation of the name. Prior to the adoption of pinyin, it was variously romanized as Soo-chow, Suchow, or Su-chow.\n\n\n== History ==\nSuzhou, the cradle of Wu culture, is one of the oldest towns in the Yangtze Basin. By the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou, local tribes named the Gou Wu are recorded living in the area which would become the modern city of Suzhou. These tribes formed villages on the edges of the hills above the wetlands surrounding Lake Tai.\nSima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian records traditional accounts that the Zhou lord Taibo established the state of Wu at nearby Wuxi during the 11th century BC, civilizing the local people and improving their agriculture and mastery of irrigation. The Wu court later moved to Gusu within the area of modern Suzhou. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu relocated his court nearby and called the settlement Hel\u00fc City after himself. His minister Wu Zixu was closely involved with its planning and it was this site that grew into present-day Suzhou. The height of his tower on Gusu Hill (Gusutai) passed into Chinese legend. In 496 BC, King Hel\u00fc was buried at Tiger Hill. In 473 BC, Wu was defeated and annexed by Yue, a kingdom to its southeast; Yue was annexed in turn by Chu in 306 BC. Remnants of the ancient kingdom include pieces of its 2,500-year-old city wall and the gate through it at Pan Gate.\nThe city was originally laid out according to a symbolic three-by-three grid of nine squares, with the royal palace occupying the central position.During the Warring States period, Suzhou was the seat of Wu County and Commandery. Following the Qin Empire's conquest of the area in 222 BC, it was made the capital of Kuaiji Commandery, including lands stretching from the south bank of the Yangtze to the unconquered interior of Minyue in southern Zhejiang. Amid the collapse of the Qin, Kuaiji's governor Yin Tong attempted to organize his own rebellion only to be betrayed and executed by Xiang Liang and his nephew Xiang Yu, who launched their own rebellion from the city.\nWhen the Grand Canal was completed, Suzhou found itself strategically located on a major trade route. In the course of the history of China, it has been a metropolis of industry and commerce on the southeastern coast of China. During the Tang dynasty, the great poet Bai Juyi constructed the Shantang Canal (better known as \"Shantang Street\") to connect the city with Tiger Hill for tourists. In AD 1035, the Suzhou Confucian Temple was founded by famed poet and writer Fan Zhongyan. It became a venue for the imperial civil examinations and then developed into the modern Suzhou High School in the 1910s.\n\nIn February 1130, the advancing Jin army from the north ransacked the city. This was followed by the Mongol invasion in 1275. In 1356, Suzhou became the capital of Zhang Shicheng, one of the leaders of the Red Turban Rebellion against the Yuan dynasty and the self-proclaimed King of Wu. In 1367, Zhang's Nanjing-based rival Zhu Yuanzhang took the city after a 10-month siege. Zhu \u2013 who was soon to proclaim himself the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty \u2013 demolished the royal city in the center of Suzhou's walled city and imposed crushing taxes on the city and prefecture's powerful families. Despite the heavy taxation and the resettlement of some of Suzhou's prominent citizens' to the area of Hongwu's capital at Nanjing, Suzhou was soon prosperous again. During the early Ming, Suzhou Prefecture supervised the Yangtze shoals which later became Shanghai's Chongming Island. For centuries the city, with its surroundings as an economic base, represented an extraordinary source of tax revenue.When the shipwrecked Korean official Choe Bu had a chance to see much of Eastern China from Zhejiang to Liaoning on his way home in 1488, he described Suzhou in his travel report as exceeding every other city. Many of the area's private gardens were constructed by the gentry of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Taipings captured the city in 1860, however, and many of its former buildings and gardens were \"almost... a heap of ruins\" by the time of their recovery by Charles Gordon's Ever-Victorious Army in November 1863. Nonetheless, by 1880, its population was estimated to have recovered to about 500,000, which remained stable for the next few decades. In the late 19th century, the town was particularly known for its wide range of silks and its Chinese-language publishing industry. The town was first opened to direct foreign trades by the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending the First Sino-Japanese War and by the most favored nation clauses of earlier unequal treaties with the Great Powers. The new expatriates opened a European-and-Chinese school in 1900 and the Suzhou railway station, connecting it with Shanghai, opened on July 16, 1906. Just prior to the World War I, there were 7000 silk looms in operation, as well as a cotton mill and a large trade in rice.\n\nAs late as the early 20th century, much of the city consisted of islands connected by rivers, creeks, and canals to the surrounding countryside. Prior to their demolition, the city walls ran in a circuit of about 10 miles (16 km) with four large suburbs lying outside. The Japanese invaded in 1937, and many gardens were again devastated by the end of the war. In the early 1950s, restoration was done on the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Lingering Garden.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe urban core of Suzhou is informally called the \"Old Town\". It is Gusu District. Suzhou Industrial Park is to the east of the old town, and Suzhou High & New Technology Development Zone is to the west. In 2000, the original Wu County was divided into two districts including Xiangcheng and Wuzhong. They now form the northern and southern parts of the city of Suzhou.In 2012, the original Wujiang City became Wujiang District of Suzhou City.\nSuzhou is one of the most prosperous cities in China. Its development has a direct correlation with the growth of its satellite cities, including Kunshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Zhangjiagang, which together with the city of Suzhou form the Suzhou prefecture. The Suzhou prefecture is home to many high-tech enterprises.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSuzhou is on the Lake Tai Plain south of the Yangtze River, about 100 km (60 mi) to the west of Shanghai and just over 200 km (120 mi) east of Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSuzhou has a four-season humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and cool, cloudy, damp winters with occasional snowfall (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa). Northwesterly winds blowing from Siberia during winter can cause temperatures to fall below freezing at night, while southerly or southwesterly winds during the summer can push temperatures above 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The hottest temperature recorded since 1951 was at 41.0 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) on 7 August 2013, and the lowest at \u22129.8 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958.\n\n\n== Cityscape and environment ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Classical Gardens of Suzhou ===\n\nSuzhou is famous for its over 60 Classical Gardens, collectively a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city has the Most UNESCO-recognized gardens in the world.The Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden are among the four most famous classical gardens in China. The Canglang Pavilion, Lion Grove Garden, Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden, respectively representing the garden styles of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, are called the four most famous gardens in Suzhou. Other gardens inscribed on the World Heritage List include the Couple's Retreat Garden, the Garden of Cultivation, and the Retreat and Reflection Garden.\n\n\n=== Temples ===\nHanshan Temple\nXiyuan Temple\nXuanmiao Temple\nLingyanshan Temple\nChongyuan Temple\nTaipingfang Mosque (\u592a\u5e73\u574a\u6e05\u771f\u5bfa)\n\n\n=== Canals and historic districts ===\n\nThe Suzhou section of the Jiangnan Canal, Grand Canal (China), includes ten city gates and over 20 stone bridges of traditional design and historic areas that have been well preserved, as well as temples and pavilions. \n There are a full 24 waterways in Suzhou near the Grand Canal.In 2015, both 800-year-old Pingjiang Road Historical Block (\u5e73\u6c5f\u8def) and 1,200-year-old Shantang Street Scenic Area (\u5c71\u5858\u8857) were added to the list of China's \"National Historic and Cultural Streets\".Pingjiang Road runs parallel to the Pingjiang River for 1.5 kilometers and is lined with homes and some teahouses. Shantang Street, over twice as long at 3.8 km, is described by the BBC as  retaining \"the alluring qualities of an old canal-side street: whitewashed buildings are completed by red-tasselled lanterns that swing softly in the breeze, adding to the charm of the river bank\".\n\nBoat tours are offered on the waterways of this city that was dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" by Marco Polo because of its criss-crossing canals and stone bridges. The Grand Canal (from Beijing to Zhejiang province) is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Resorts and natural reserves ===\nSuzhou Taihu National Tourism and Vacation Zone (\u82cf\u5dde\u592a\u6e56\u56fd\u5bb6\u65c5\u6e38\u5ea6\u5047\u533a) is in the western part of Suzhou, 15 km (9 mi) from the city center.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nGate to the East is a 301.8 meter, 74-story skyscraper in Suzhou's central business district, built in 2015 at a cost of 700 million USD and is currently the tallest building in Suzhou.\n\n\n=== Pan Gate ===\nPan Gate is on the southwest corner of the Main Canal or encircling canal of Suzhou. Originally built during the Warring States Period in the state of Wu, historians estimate it to be around 2,500 years old. It is now part of the Pan Gate Scenic Area. It is known for the \"three landmarks of Pan Gate\". They are the Ruiguang Pagoda, the earliest pagoda in Suzhou built in 247 BC, the Wu Gate Bridge, the entrance to the gate at that time over the water passage and the highest bridge in Suzhou at the time, and the Pan Gate. The Ruigang Pagoda is constructed of brick with wooden platforms and has Buddhist carvings at its base.\n\n\n=== Baodai Bridge ===\nBaodai Bridge stretches across the Tantai Lake in the suburbs of Suzhou. To raise money to finance the bridge, the magistrate donated his expensive belt, hence the name. The bridge was first built in 806 A.D. in the Tang Dynasty and has 53 arches with a length of 317 meters. It was made out of stone from Jinshan Mountain and is the longest standing bridge of its kind in China. The bridge was included on the list of national monuments (resolution 5-285) in 2001.\n\n\n=== Tiger Hill ===\nThe Tiger Hill is known for its natural environment and historical sites. The hill is so named because it is said to look like a crouching tiger. Another legend states that a white tiger appeared on the hill to guard it following the burial The hill has been a tourist destination for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, as is evident from the poetry and calligraphy carved into rocks on the hill. The Song Dynasty poet, Su Shi said, \"It is a lifelong pity if having visited Suzhou you did not visit Tiger Hill.\"\n\n\n=== Pagodas ===\nYunyan Pagoda (or Huqiu Tower) built in 961 is a Chinese pagoda built on Tiger Hill in Suzhou. It has several other names, including the \"Leaning Tower of China\" (as referred to by historian O.G. Ingles) and the Yunyan Temple Tower. The tower rises to a height of 47 m (154 ft). It is a seven-story octagonal building built with blue bricks. In more than a thousand years the tower has gradually slanted due to forces of nature. Now the top and bottom of the tower vary by 2.32 meters. The entire structure weighs some 7,000,000 kilograms (15,000,000 lb), supported by internal brick columns. However, the tower leans roughly 3 degrees due to the cracking of two supporting columns.Beisi Pagoda or North Temple Pagoda is a Chinese pagoda at Bao'en Temple in Suzhou. It rises nine stories in a height of 76 m (249 ft). It is the tallest Chinese pagoda south of the Yangtze river.\nTwin Pagodas (\u82cf\u5dde\u53cc\u5854) lie in the Dinghui Temple Lane in the southeastern corner of the city proper of Suzhou. They are artistic and natural as they are close at hand. One of them is called Clarity-Dispensing Pagoda and the other Beneficence Pagoda and they are in the same form of building. There are many legends about the one-thousand-year-old pagodas. It is charming that the exquisite and straight Twin Pagoda look like two inserted writing brushes. There was originally a single-storey house with three rooms just like a writing brush holder with the shadows of the two pagodas reclining on its roof at sunset. To the east of the pagoda is a square five-storeyed bell building built in the Ming Dynasty which is exactly like a thick ink stick. So there is a saying that \"the Twin Pagodas are as writing brushes while the bell building as ink stick\".\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city's major museums include the Suzhou Museum (designed by I. M. Pei), Suzhou Silk Museum, and Suzhou Museum of Opera and Theatre.\n\n\n=== Hospitals ===\nAs a result of its recent rapid population increase, healthcare demand in Suzhou is increasing rapidly.

Once the hospital is unveiled, Washington University doctors in St. Louis will be able to provide long-distance health-care services to patients in China through a telemedicine program.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Suzhou is predominantly Han Chinese. The official language of broadcast, instruction, etc. is Mandarin Chinese, although many speak a local dialect known as Suzhounese, a member of the Wu language family. In addition to American and European expatriates, there is a large Korean community in Suzhou. The Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) estimated that there were 15,000 Koreans in the municipality in 2014. That year 850 Korean companies operated in Suzhou, and the Koreans made up the largest number of students at the Suzhou Singapore International School.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nSuzhou's economy is based primarily on its large manufacturing sector\u2014China's second largest\u2014including iron and steel, IT and electronic equipment, and textile products. The city's service sector is notably well-developed, primarily owing to tourism, which brought in a total of RMB 152 billion of revenue in 2013. Suzhou's overall GDP exceeded RMB 1.3 trillion in 2013 (up 9.6 percent from the year previous).The city is also one of China's foremost destinations for foreign investment, based on its relative proximity to Shanghai and comparatively low operating costs. The municipal government has enacted various measures to encourage FDI in a number of manufacturing (e.g. pharmaceutical, electronic goods, automobile) and service (e.g. banking, logistics, research services) sectors. Included among these measures is a preferential tax policy for limited partnership venture capital enterprises in the Suzhou Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Development zones ===\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park ====\n\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) is the largest cooperative project between the Chinese and Singaporean governments.

It is located at 3 Canglangting Street in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, China.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Canglang Pavilion was built in 1044 CE by the Song dynasty poet Su Shunqin (1008\u20131048), on the site of a pre-existing imperial flower garden c 960 CE. It is the oldest of the UNESCO gardens in Suzhou, keeping its original Song dynasty layout. The name is derived from a verse in the poem Fishermen by Qu Yuan (ca. 340 BCE-278 BCE), a poet from the southern state of Chu during the Warring States period, in his book Songs of the South, \"If the Canglang River is dirty I wash my muddy feet; If the Canglang River is clean I wash my ribbon\". This verse alludes to an honest official who removes himself from politics rather than act in a corrupt manner. Su Shunqing choose this to express his feelings after his removal from office.\nAfter his death the garden passed through many owners and fell into disuse until 1696 CE when it was restored by Song Luo, the governor of Jiangsu Province. In 1827 ownership was transferred to governor Tao Zhu and again in 1873 ownership was transferred to governor Zhang Shusheng.  In 1955 the garden was opened to the public and in 2000 it was added to the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Monuments.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe 1.6 ha garden is divided into two main sections. The garden is sited on a branch of the Fengxi Stream which forms a lotus pond. The garden has 108 windows each one with a unique design.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese garden\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nSuzhou Mingcheng Information Port Co., LTD, The Surging Wave Pavilion, retrieved 2009 \nChina Internet Information Center (June 24, 2004), Canglang (Surging Wave) Pavilion, retrieved 2009 \nYuan (\u8881), Xuehan (\u5b66\u6c49); Gong, Jianyi (2004). \u300a\u82cf\u5dde\u53e4\u5178\u56ed\u6797\u300b [The Classical Gardens of Suzhou].

        "wiki": "The Classical Gardens of Suzhou are a group of gardens in Suzhou region, Jiangsu province, China, which have been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.\nSpanning a period of almost one thousand years, from the Northern Song to the late Qing dynasties (11th-19th century), these gardens, most of them built by scholars, standardized many of the key features of classical Chinese garden design with constructed landscapes mimicking natural scenery of rocks, hills and rivers with strategically located pavilions and pagodas.The elegant aesthetics and subtlety of these scholars' gardens and their delicate style and features are often imitated by various gardens in other parts of China, including the various Imperial Gardens, such as those in the Chengde Mountain Resort.  According to UNESCO, the gardens of Suzhou \"represent the development of Chinese landscape garden design over more than two thousand years,\" and they are the \"most refined form\" of garden art.These landscape gardens flourished in the mid-Ming to early-Qing dynasties, resulting in as much as 200 private gardens.  Today, there are 69 preserved gardens in Suzhou, and all of them are designated as protected \"National Heritage Sites.\"  In 1997 and 2000, eight of the finest gardens in Suzhou along with one in the nearby ancient town of Tongli  were selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site to represent the art of Suzhou-style classical gardens.Famous Suzhou garden designers include Zhang Liang, Ji Cheng, Ge Yuliang, and Chen Congzhou.\n\n\n== The gardens ==\n\n\n== Comprehensive monitoring plan ==\nThe site is monitored following a comprehensive monitoring plan and there is provision for both the routine maintenance and\nprogrammed conservation projects for all of the gardens. The Suzhou Municipal Administrative Bureau of Gardens is responsible for this.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nChinese garden\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClassical Gardens of Suzhou - UNESCO World Heritage",

        "wiki": "Suzhou (Chinese: \u82cf\u5dde; Suzhounese pronunciation: [s\u0259u ts\u00f8\u028f], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [s\u00fa.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u]), alternately romanized as Soochow, is a major city located in southeastern Jiangsu Province of East China, about 100 km (62 mi) northwest of Shanghai. It is a major economic center and focal point of trade and commerce, and the second largest city in the province, after its capital Nanjing. The city is situated on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the shores of Lake Tai and belongs to the Yangtze River Delta region. Administratively, Suzhou is a prefecture-level city with a population of 4.33 million in its city proper, and a total resident population (as of 2013) of 10.58 million in its administrative area. Its urban population grew at an unprecedented rate of 6.5% between 2000 and 2014, which is the highest among cities with more than 5 million people.Founded in 514 BC, Suzhou has over 2,500 years of history, with an abundant display of relics and sites of historical interest. Around AD 100, during the Eastern Han dynasty, it became one of the ten largest cities in the world mostly due to emigration from Northern China. Since the 10th-century Song dynasty, it has been an important commercial center of China. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Suzhou was a national economic, cultural, and commercial center, as well as the largest non-capital city in the world, until the 1860 Taiping Rebellion. When Li Hongzhang and Charles George Gordon recaptured the city three years later, Shanghai had already taken its predominant place in the nation. Since major economic reforms began in 1978, Suzhou has become one of the fastest growing major cities in the world, with GDP growth rates of about 14% in the past 35 years. With high life expectancy and per capita incomes, Suzhou's Human Development Index ratings is roughly comparable to a moderately developed country, making it one of the most highly developed and prosperous cities in China.The city's canals, stone bridges, pagodas, and meticulously designed gardens have contributed to its status as one of the top tourist attractions in China. The Classical Gardens of Suzhou were added to the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1997 and 2000. Suzhou is often dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" or \"Venice of China\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nDuring the Zhou, a settlement known as Gusu after nearby Mount Gusu (simplified Chinese: \u59d1\u82cf\u5c71; traditional Chinese: \u59d1\u8607\u5c71; pinyin: G\u016bs\u016bsh\u0101n) became the capital of the state of Wu. From this role, it also came to be called Wu as well. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu established a new capital nearby at Hel\u00fc City and this grew into the modern city. During the Warring States period, Hel\u00fc City continued to serve as the local seat of government. From the areas it administered, it became known as Wuxian (lit. \"Wu County\") and Wujun (\"Wu Commandery\"). Under the Qin, it was known as Kuaiji after its greatly enlarged commandery, which was named for the reputed resting place of Yu the Great near modern Shaoxing in Zhejiang.\nThe name Suzhou was first officially used for the city in AD 589 during the Sui dynasty. The s\u016b (\u8607 or \u82cf) in its name is a contraction of the old name Gusu. It refers to the mint perilla (shiso). The zhou \u5dde originally meant something like a province or county (cf. Guizhou), but often came to be used metonymously for the capital of such a region (cf. Guangzhou, Hangzhou, etc.). Suzhou is the Hanyu Pinyin spelling of the Putonghua pronunciation of the name. Prior to the adoption of pinyin, it was variously romanized as Soo-chow, Suchow, or Su-chow.\n\n\n== History ==\nSuzhou, the cradle of Wu culture, is one of the oldest towns in the Yangtze Basin. By the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou, local tribes named the Gou Wu are recorded living in the area which would become the modern city of Suzhou. These tribes formed villages on the edges of the hills above the wetlands surrounding Lake Tai.\nSima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian records traditional accounts that the Zhou lord Taibo established the state of Wu at nearby Wuxi during the 11th century BC, civilizing the local people and improving their agriculture and mastery of irrigation. The Wu court later moved to Gusu within the area of modern Suzhou. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu relocated his court nearby and called the settlement Hel\u00fc City after himself. His minister Wu Zixu was closely involved with its planning and it was this site that grew into present-day Suzhou. The height of his tower on Gusu Hill (Gusutai) passed into Chinese legend. In 496 BC, King Hel\u00fc was buried at Tiger Hill. In 473 BC, Wu was defeated and annexed by Yue, a kingdom to its southeast; Yue was annexed in turn by Chu in 306 BC. Remnants of the ancient kingdom include pieces of its 2,500-year-old city wall and the gate through it at Pan Gate.\nThe city was originally laid out according to a symbolic three-by-three grid of nine squares, with the royal palace occupying the central position.During the Warring States period, Suzhou was the seat of Wu County and Commandery. Following the Qin Empire's conquest of the area in 222 BC, it was made the capital of Kuaiji Commandery, including lands stretching from the south bank of the Yangtze to the unconquered interior of Minyue in southern Zhejiang. Amid the collapse of the Qin, Kuaiji's governor Yin Tong attempted to organize his own rebellion only to be betrayed and executed by Xiang Liang and his nephew Xiang Yu, who launched their own rebellion from the city.\nWhen the Grand Canal was completed, Suzhou found itself strategically located on a major trade route. In the course of the history of China, it has been a metropolis of industry and commerce on the southeastern coast of China. During the Tang dynasty, the great poet Bai Juyi constructed the Shantang Canal (better known as \"Shantang Street\") to connect the city with Tiger Hill for tourists. In AD 1035, the Suzhou Confucian Temple was founded by famed poet and writer Fan Zhongyan. It became a venue for the imperial civil examinations and then developed into the modern Suzhou High School in the 1910s.\n\nIn February 1130, the advancing Jin army from the north ransacked the city. This was followed by the Mongol invasion in 1275. In 1356, Suzhou became the capital of Zhang Shicheng, one of the leaders of the Red Turban Rebellion against the Yuan dynasty and the self-proclaimed King of Wu. In 1367, Zhang's Nanjing-based rival Zhu Yuanzhang took the city after a 10-month siege. Zhu \u2013 who was soon to proclaim himself the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty \u2013 demolished the royal city in the center of Suzhou's walled city and imposed crushing taxes on the city and prefecture's powerful families. Despite the heavy taxation and the resettlement of some of Suzhou's prominent citizens' to the area of Hongwu's capital at Nanjing, Suzhou was soon prosperous again. During the early Ming, Suzhou Prefecture supervised the Yangtze shoals which later became Shanghai's Chongming Island. For centuries the city, with its surroundings as an economic base, represented an extraordinary source of tax revenue.When the shipwrecked Korean official Choe Bu had a chance to see much of Eastern China from Zhejiang to Liaoning on his way home in 1488, he described Suzhou in his travel report as exceeding every other city. Many of the area's private gardens were constructed by the gentry of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Taipings captured the city in 1860, however, and many of its former buildings and gardens were \"almost... a heap of ruins\" by the time of their recovery by Charles Gordon's Ever-Victorious Army in November 1863. Nonetheless, by 1880, its population was estimated to have recovered to about 500,000, which remained stable for the next few decades. In the late 19th century, the town was particularly known for its wide range of silks and its Chinese-language publishing industry. The town was first opened to direct foreign trades by the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending the First Sino-Japanese War and by the most favored nation clauses of earlier unequal treaties with the Great Powers. The new expatriates opened a European-and-Chinese school in 1900 and the Suzhou railway station, connecting it with Shanghai, opened on July 16, 1906. Just prior to the World War I, there were 7000 silk looms in operation, as well as a cotton mill and a large trade in rice.\n\nAs late as the early 20th century, much of the city consisted of islands connected by rivers, creeks, and canals to the surrounding countryside. Prior to their demolition, the city walls ran in a circuit of about 10 miles (16 km) with four large suburbs lying outside. The Japanese invaded in 1937, and many gardens were again devastated by the end of the war. In the early 1950s, restoration was done on the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Lingering Garden.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe urban core of Suzhou is informally called the \"Old Town\". It is Gusu District. Suzhou Industrial Park is to the east of the old town, and Suzhou High & New Technology Development Zone is to the west. In 2000, the original Wu County was divided into two districts including Xiangcheng and Wuzhong. They now form the northern and southern parts of the city of Suzhou.In 2012, the original Wujiang City became Wujiang District of Suzhou City.\nSuzhou is one of the most prosperous cities in China. Its development has a direct correlation with the growth of its satellite cities, including Kunshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Zhangjiagang, which together with the city of Suzhou form the Suzhou prefecture. The Suzhou prefecture is home to many high-tech enterprises.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSuzhou is on the Lake Tai Plain south of the Yangtze River, about 100 km (60 mi) to the west of Shanghai and just over 200 km (120 mi) east of Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSuzhou has a four-season humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and cool, cloudy, damp winters with occasional snowfall (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa). Northwesterly winds blowing from Siberia during winter can cause temperatures to fall below freezing at night, while southerly or southwesterly winds during the summer can push temperatures above 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The hottest temperature recorded since 1951 was at 41.0 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) on 7 August 2013, and the lowest at \u22129.8 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958.\n\n\n== Cityscape and environment ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Classical Gardens of Suzhou ===\n\nSuzhou is famous for its over 60 Classical Gardens, collectively a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city has the Most UNESCO-recognized gardens in the world.The Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden are among the four most famous classical gardens in China. The Canglang Pavilion, Lion Grove Garden, Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden, respectively representing the garden styles of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, are called the four most famous gardens in Suzhou. Other gardens inscribed on the World Heritage List include the Couple's Retreat Garden, the Garden of Cultivation, and the Retreat and Reflection Garden.\n\n\n=== Temples ===\nHanshan Temple\nXiyuan Temple\nXuanmiao Temple\nLingyanshan Temple\nChongyuan Temple\nTaipingfang Mosque (\u592a\u5e73\u574a\u6e05\u771f\u5bfa)\n\n\n=== Canals and historic districts ===\n\nThe Suzhou section of the Jiangnan Canal, Grand Canal (China), includes ten city gates and over 20 stone bridges of traditional design and historic areas that have been well preserved, as well as temples and pavilions. \n There are a full 24 waterways in Suzhou near the Grand Canal.In 2015, both 800-year-old Pingjiang Road Historical Block (\u5e73\u6c5f\u8def) and 1,200-year-old Shantang Street Scenic Area (\u5c71\u5858\u8857) were added to the list of China's \"National Historic and Cultural Streets\".Pingjiang Road runs parallel to the Pingjiang River for 1.5 kilometers and is lined with homes and some teahouses. Shantang Street, over twice as long at 3.8 km, is described by the BBC as  retaining \"the alluring qualities of an old canal-side street: whitewashed buildings are completed by red-tasselled lanterns that swing softly in the breeze, adding to the charm of the river bank\".\n\nBoat tours are offered on the waterways of this city that was dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" by Marco Polo because of its criss-crossing canals and stone bridges. The Grand Canal (from Beijing to Zhejiang province) is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Resorts and natural reserves ===\nSuzhou Taihu National Tourism and Vacation Zone (\u82cf\u5dde\u592a\u6e56\u56fd\u5bb6\u65c5\u6e38\u5ea6\u5047\u533a) is in the western part of Suzhou, 15 km (9 mi) from the city center.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nGate to the East is a 301.8 meter, 74-story skyscraper in Suzhou's central business district, built in 2015 at a cost of 700 million USD and is currently the tallest building in Suzhou.\n\n\n=== Pan Gate ===\nPan Gate is on the southwest corner of the Main Canal or encircling canal of Suzhou. Originally built during the Warring States Period in the state of Wu, historians estimate it to be around 2,500 years old. It is now part of the Pan Gate Scenic Area. It is known for the \"three landmarks of Pan Gate\". They are the Ruiguang Pagoda, the earliest pagoda in Suzhou built in 247 BC, the Wu Gate Bridge, the entrance to the gate at that time over the water passage and the highest bridge in Suzhou at the time, and the Pan Gate. The Ruigang Pagoda is constructed of brick with wooden platforms and has Buddhist carvings at its base.\n\n\n=== Baodai Bridge ===\nBaodai Bridge stretches across the Tantai Lake in the suburbs of Suzhou. To raise money to finance the bridge, the magistrate donated his expensive belt, hence the name. The bridge was first built in 806 A.D. in the Tang Dynasty and has 53 arches with a length of 317 meters. It was made out of stone from Jinshan Mountain and is the longest standing bridge of its kind in China. The bridge was included on the list of national monuments (resolution 5-285) in 2001.\n\n\n=== Tiger Hill ===\nThe Tiger Hill is known for its natural environment and historical sites. The hill is so named because it is said to look like a crouching tiger. Another legend states that a white tiger appeared on the hill to guard it following the burial The hill has been a tourist destination for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, as is evident from the poetry and calligraphy carved into rocks on the hill. The Song Dynasty poet, Su Shi said, \"It is a lifelong pity if having visited Suzhou you did not visit Tiger Hill.\"\n\n\n=== Pagodas ===\nYunyan Pagoda (or Huqiu Tower) built in 961 is a Chinese pagoda built on Tiger Hill in Suzhou. It has several other names, including the \"Leaning Tower of China\" (as referred to by historian O.G. Ingles) and the Yunyan Temple Tower. The tower rises to a height of 47 m (154 ft). It is a seven-story octagonal building built with blue bricks. In more than a thousand years the tower has gradually slanted due to forces of nature. Now the top and bottom of the tower vary by 2.32 meters. The entire structure weighs some 7,000,000 kilograms (15,000,000 lb), supported by internal brick columns. However, the tower leans roughly 3 degrees due to the cracking of two supporting columns.Beisi Pagoda or North Temple Pagoda is a Chinese pagoda at Bao'en Temple in Suzhou. It rises nine stories in a height of 76 m (249 ft). It is the tallest Chinese pagoda south of the Yangtze river.\nTwin Pagodas (\u82cf\u5dde\u53cc\u5854) lie in the Dinghui Temple Lane in the southeastern corner of the city proper of Suzhou. They are artistic and natural as they are close at hand. One of them is called Clarity-Dispensing Pagoda and the other Beneficence Pagoda and they are in the same form of building. There are many legends about the one-thousand-year-old pagodas. It is charming that the exquisite and straight Twin Pagoda look like two inserted writing brushes. There was originally a single-storey house with three rooms just like a writing brush holder with the shadows of the two pagodas reclining on its roof at sunset. To the east of the pagoda is a square five-storeyed bell building built in the Ming Dynasty which is exactly like a thick ink stick. So there is a saying that \"the Twin Pagodas are as writing brushes while the bell building as ink stick\".\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city's major museums include the Suzhou Museum (designed by I. M. Pei), Suzhou Silk Museum, and Suzhou Museum of Opera and Theatre.\n\n\n=== Hospitals ===\nAs a result of its recent rapid population increase, healthcare demand in Suzhou is increasing rapidly. In July 2019, Washington University School of Medicine announced a collaboration with Huici Health Management Co., and the Xiangcheng District, to open the new Huici Medical Center, which will include a 1,000-bed hospital for adult and pediatric patients. Once the hospital is unveiled, Washington University doctors in St. Louis will be able to provide long-distance health-care services to patients in China through a telemedicine program.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Suzhou is predominantly Han Chinese. The official language of broadcast, instruction, etc. is Mandarin Chinese, although many speak a local dialect known as Suzhounese, a member of the Wu language family. In addition to American and European expatriates, there is a large Korean community in Suzhou. The Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) estimated that there were 15,000 Koreans in the municipality in 2014. That year 850 Korean companies operated in Suzhou, and the Koreans made up the largest number of students at the Suzhou Singapore International School.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nSuzhou's economy is based primarily on its large manufacturing sector\u2014China's second largest\u2014including iron and steel, IT and electronic equipment, and textile products. The city's service sector is notably well-developed, primarily owing to tourism, which brought in a total of RMB 152 billion of revenue in 2013. Suzhou's overall GDP exceeded RMB 1.3 trillion in 2013 (up 9.6 percent from the year previous).The city is also one of China's foremost destinations for foreign investment, based on its relative proximity to Shanghai and comparatively low operating costs. The municipal government has enacted various measures to encourage FDI in a number of manufacturing (e.g. pharmaceutical, electronic goods, automobile) and service (e.g. banking, logistics, research services) sectors. Included among these measures is a preferential tax policy for limited partnership venture capital enterprises in the Suzhou Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Development zones ===\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park ====\n\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) is the largest cooperative project between the Chinese and Singaporean governments. It is beside Jinji Lake, which lies to the east of the Suzhou Old City. On 26 February 1994, Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew represented China and Singapore respectively in signing the Agreement to jointly develop Suzhou Industrial Park (originally called the Singapore Industrial Park). The project officially commenced on 12 May in the same year. SIP has a jurisdiction area of 288 km2 (111 sq mi), of which, the China-Singapore cooperation area covers 80 km2 (31 sq mi) with a planned residential population of 1.2 million.SIP is home to the Suzhou Dushu Lake Science and Education Innovation District, an area of universities and higher education institutions, including Soochow University and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. Suzhou Industrial Park is also a popular residential district for many foreigners who work and live in Suzhou, as well as 'new Suzhou' residents who migrated to the area in search of work opportunities.\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park Export Processing Zone ====\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park Export Processing Zone was approved to be established by the government in April 2000, with a planning area of 2.9 km2 (1.1 sq mi). It is in Suzhou Industrial Park set up by China and Singapore. Inside the Export Processing Zone, all the infrastructures are of high standard.\n\n\n==== Suzhou New District ====\n\nThe Suzhou New District was established in 1990. In November 1992, the zone was approved to be the national-level hi-tech industrial zone. By the end of 2007, foreign-invested companies had a registered capital worth of US$13 billion, of which US$6.8 billion was paid in. SND hosts now more than 1,500 foreign companies. Some 40 Fortune 500 companies set up 67 projects in the district.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nSuzhou Dongwu currently play in China League Two, the third division of Chinese football. The 13,000 seat Suzhou Industrial Park Sports Arena will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nSuzhou is on the Shanghai-Nanjing corridor which carries three parallel railways. Suzhou railway station, near the city center, is among the busiest passenger stations in China. It is served by the Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway (mostly \"conventional\" trains to points throughout China) and the Shanghai-Nanjing intercity railway (high-speed D- and G-series trains providing frequent service primarily between Shanghai and Nanjing). It takes only 25 minutes to reach Shanghai railway station on the fastest G-series trains and less than 1 hour to Nanjing.\nThe Suzhou North railway station, a few kilometers to the north, is on the Beijing\u2013Shanghai high-speed railway (opened 2011), served by high-speed trains to Beijing, Qingdao, etc.\nOther stations on the Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway and the Shanghai\u2013Nanjing intercity railway serve other points in the same corridor within Suzhou Prefecture-level city, such as Kunshan. In and between Suzhou and Kunshan South railway station, Suzhou Industrial Park railway station now also becomes an important station for people visiting and living in the areas.\nThe northern part of the city, including such county-level cities as Zhangjiagang, Changshu and Taicang, presently has no rail service. However, plans exist for a cross-Yangtze railway from Nantong to the Shanghai metropolitan area (the Shanghai\u2013Nantong railway), which will run through most of these county-level cities. Construction work is expected to start in 2013 and to take five and a half years.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nThe Nanjing-Shanghai Expressway connects Suzhou with Shanghai, alternatively, there is the Yangtze Riverine Expressway and the Suzhou-Jiaxing-Hangzhou Expressway. In 2005, the Suzhou Outer Ring was completed, linking the peripheral county-level cities of Taicang, Kunshan, and Changshu. China National Highway 312 also passes through Suzhou.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nSuzhou is served by three airports, Sunan Shuofang International Airport (co-owned by Wuxi and Suzhou), Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport ( one hour drive ), Shanghai Pudong International Airport ( two hours drive ).\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nPort of Suzhou, on the right bank of the Yangtze River, dealt with 428 million tons of cargo and 5.86 million TEU containers in 2012, which made it the busiest inland river port in the world by annual cargo tonnage and container volume.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Suzhou Rail Transit currently has four lines in operation and five other lines under construction. The masterplan consists of nine independent lines. Line 1 started operation on April 28, 2012, Line 2 started operation on December 28, 2013, and Line 4 started operation in 2017. As of March 2020, Line 5, Line 6, Line 7 and Line 8 and Line S1 are under construction at the same time.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nSuzhou Tram system has two routes in the Suzhou New District.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nSuzhou has public bus routes that run into all parts of the city. Fares are flat rated, usually 1 Yuan for a non-air-conditioned bus and 2 Yuan for an air-conditioned one. The Suzhou BRT, a 25-kilometre (16 mi) bus rapid transit system opened in 2008, operates 5 lines using elevated busways and bus-only lanes throughout the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nOpera: Kunqu originates in the Suzhou region, as does the much later Suzhou Opera. Ballad-singing, or Suzhou pingtan, is a local form of storytelling that mixes singing (accompanied by the pipa and sanxian) with portions in spoken dialect.\nSilk: throughout China's Imperial past, Suzhou silk has been associated with high-quality silk products, supplying silks to ancient royal families. By the 13th century, Suzhou was already the center of the profitable silk trade.\nSong brocade: Suzhou's Song brocade, with its flashy colors, exquisite patterns, strong and soft texture, is one of China's three famous brocades, together with Nanjing Yun brocade and Sichuan Shu brocade. Suzhou's brocade production can be traced back to the Five Dynasties. It prospered in the Song Dynasty. After the government moved the capital southward, the country's political and cultural center moved to the Yangtze River area. To cope with the special need of artists, a type of very thin brocade for decorating paintings emerged in Suzhou. These brocades and paintings have been preserved. Whenever people talked about brocade, they mentioned the Song Dynasty, and thus Song brocade got its name and has been well-known ever since.\nHandicrafts: Suzhou embroidery, fans, Chinese musical instruments, scroll mounting, lanterns, mahogany furniture, jade carving, silk tapestry, traditional painting pigments of Jiangenxutang Studio, the New Year's wood-block prints of Taohuawu Studio.\nPaintings\nCalligraphic art\nCuisine: Yangcheng Lake large crab\nSuzhou Silk Hand Embroidery Art\nSuzhou is the original place of \"Jasmine\", a song sung by Chinese singers or actresses thousands of times on the occasions of almost every important meetings or celebrations. Jasmine is the symbol of Suzhou as well as Tai Hu Lake.\nSuzhou Gardens: Gardens in Suzhou have an ancient history. The first garden in Suzhou belonged to the emperor of Wu State in Spring and Autumn Period (600 BC). More than 200 gardens existed in Suzhou between the 16th and 18th centuries. Gardens in Suzhou were built according to the style of Chinese Paintings. Every view in a garden can be seen as a piece of Chinese Painting and the whole garden is a huge piece of Chinese Paintings. At present, the Humble Administrator's Garden, built in 16th, is the largest private garden in Suzhou. It belonged to by Wang Xianchen, an imperial censor.\nSuzhou embroidery together with embroidery of Hunan, Sichuan and Guangdong are called as the \"Four Famous Embroideries\".

        "wiki": "Suzhou (Chinese: \u82cf\u5dde; Suzhounese pronunciation: [s\u0259u ts\u00f8\u028f], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [s\u00fa.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u]), alternately romanized as Soochow, is a major city located in southeastern Jiangsu Province of East China, about 100 km (62 mi) northwest of Shanghai. It is a major economic center and focal point of trade and commerce, and the second largest city in the province, after its capital Nanjing. The city is situated on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the shores of Lake Tai and belongs to the Yangtze River Delta region. Administratively, Suzhou is a prefecture-level city with a population of 4.33 million in its city proper, and a total resident population (as of 2013) of 10.58 million in its administrative area. Its urban population grew at an unprecedented rate of 6.5% between 2000 and 2014, which is the highest among cities with more than 5 million people.Founded in 514 BC, Suzhou has over 2,500 years of history, with an abundant display of relics and sites of historical interest. Around AD 100, during the Eastern Han dynasty, it became one of the ten largest cities in the world mostly due to emigration from Northern China. Since the 10th-century Song dynasty, it has been an important commercial center of China. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Suzhou was a national economic, cultural, and commercial center, as well as the largest non-capital city in the world, until the 1860 Taiping Rebellion. When Li Hongzhang and Charles George Gordon recaptured the city three years later, Shanghai had already taken its predominant place in the nation. Since major economic reforms began in 1978, Suzhou has become one of the fastest growing major cities in the world, with GDP growth rates of about 14% in the past 35 years. With high life expectancy and per capita incomes, Suzhou's Human Development Index ratings is roughly comparable to a moderately developed country, making it one of the most highly developed and prosperous cities in China.The city's canals, stone bridges, pagodas, and meticulously designed gardens have contributed to its status as one of the top tourist attractions in China. The Classical Gardens of Suzhou were added to the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1997 and 2000. Suzhou is often dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" or \"Venice of China\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nDuring the Zhou, a settlement known as Gusu after nearby Mount Gusu (simplified Chinese: \u59d1\u82cf\u5c71; traditional Chinese: \u59d1\u8607\u5c71; pinyin: G\u016bs\u016bsh\u0101n) became the capital of the state of Wu. From this role, it also came to be called Wu as well. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu established a new capital nearby at Hel\u00fc City and this grew into the modern city. During the Warring States period, Hel\u00fc City continued to serve as the local seat of government. From the areas it administered, it became known as Wuxian (lit. \"Wu County\") and Wujun (\"Wu Commandery\"). Under the Qin, it was known as Kuaiji after its greatly enlarged commandery, which was named for the reputed resting place of Yu the Great near modern Shaoxing in Zhejiang.\nThe name Suzhou was first officially used for the city in AD 589 during the Sui dynasty. The s\u016b (\u8607 or \u82cf) in its name is a contraction of the old name Gusu. It refers to the mint perilla (shiso). The zhou \u5dde originally meant something like a province or county (cf. Guizhou), but often came to be used metonymously for the capital of such a region (cf. Guangzhou, Hangzhou, etc.). Suzhou is the Hanyu Pinyin spelling of the Putonghua pronunciation of the name. Prior to the adoption of pinyin, it was variously romanized as Soo-chow, Suchow, or Su-chow.\n\n\n== History ==\nSuzhou, the cradle of Wu culture, is one of the oldest towns in the Yangtze Basin. By the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou, local tribes named the Gou Wu are recorded living in the area which would become the modern city of Suzhou. These tribes formed villages on the edges of the hills above the wetlands surrounding Lake Tai.\nSima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian records traditional accounts that the Zhou lord Taibo established the state of Wu at nearby Wuxi during the 11th century BC, civilizing the local people and improving their agriculture and mastery of irrigation. The Wu court later moved to Gusu within the area of modern Suzhou. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu relocated his court nearby and called the settlement Hel\u00fc City after himself. His minister Wu Zixu was closely involved with its planning and it was this site that grew into present-day Suzhou. The height of his tower on Gusu Hill (Gusutai) passed into Chinese legend. In 496 BC, King Hel\u00fc was buried at Tiger Hill. In 473 BC, Wu was defeated and annexed by Yue, a kingdom to its southeast; Yue was annexed in turn by Chu in 306 BC. Remnants of the ancient kingdom include pieces of its 2,500-year-old city wall and the gate through it at Pan Gate.\nThe city was originally laid out according to a symbolic three-by-three grid of nine squares, with the royal palace occupying the central position.During the Warring States period, Suzhou was the seat of Wu County and Commandery. Following the Qin Empire's conquest of the area in 222 BC, it was made the capital of Kuaiji Commandery, including lands stretching from the south bank of the Yangtze to the unconquered interior of Minyue in southern Zhejiang. Amid the collapse of the Qin, Kuaiji's governor Yin Tong attempted to organize his own rebellion only to be betrayed and executed by Xiang Liang and his nephew Xiang Yu, who launched their own rebellion from the city.\nWhen the Grand Canal was completed, Suzhou found itself strategically located on a major trade route. In the course of the history of China, it has been a metropolis of industry and commerce on the southeastern coast of China. During the Tang dynasty, the great poet Bai Juyi constructed the Shantang Canal (better known as \"Shantang Street\") to connect the city with Tiger Hill for tourists. In AD 1035, the Suzhou Confucian Temple was founded by famed poet and writer Fan Zhongyan. It became a venue for the imperial civil examinations and then developed into the modern Suzhou High School in the 1910s.\n\nIn February 1130, the advancing Jin army from the north ransacked the city. This was followed by the Mongol invasion in 1275. In 1356, Suzhou became the capital of Zhang Shicheng, one of the leaders of the Red Turban Rebellion against the Yuan dynasty and the self-proclaimed King of Wu. In 1367, Zhang's Nanjing-based rival Zhu Yuanzhang took the city after a 10-month siege. Zhu \u2013 who was soon to proclaim himself the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty \u2013 demolished the royal city in the center of Suzhou's walled city and imposed crushing taxes on the city and prefecture's powerful families. Despite the heavy taxation and the resettlement of some of Suzhou's prominent citizens' to the area of Hongwu's capital at Nanjing, Suzhou was soon prosperous again. During the early Ming, Suzhou Prefecture supervised the Yangtze shoals which later became Shanghai's Chongming Island. For centuries the city, with its surroundings as an economic base, represented an extraordinary source of tax revenue.When the shipwrecked Korean official Choe Bu had a chance to see much of Eastern China from Zhejiang to Liaoning on his way home in 1488, he described Suzhou in his travel report as exceeding every other city. Many of the area's private gardens were constructed by the gentry of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Taipings captured the city in 1860, however, and many of its former buildings and gardens were \"almost... a heap of ruins\" by the time of their recovery by Charles Gordon's Ever-Victorious Army in November 1863. Nonetheless, by 1880, its population was estimated to have recovered to about 500,000, which remained stable for the next few decades. In the late 19th century, the town was particularly known for its wide range of silks and its Chinese-language publishing industry. The town was first opened to direct foreign trades by the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending the First Sino-Japanese War and by the most favored nation clauses of earlier unequal treaties with the Great Powers. The new expatriates opened a European-and-Chinese school in 1900 and the Suzhou railway station, connecting it with Shanghai, opened on July 16, 1906. Just prior to the World War I, there were 7000 silk looms in operation, as well as a cotton mill and a large trade in rice.\n\nAs late as the early 20th century, much of the city consisted of islands connected by rivers, creeks, and canals to the surrounding countryside. Prior to their demolition, the city walls ran in a circuit of about 10 miles (16 km) with four large suburbs lying outside. The Japanese invaded in 1937, and many gardens were again devastated by the end of the war. In the early 1950s, restoration was done on the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Lingering Garden.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe urban core of Suzhou is informally called the \"Old Town\". It is Gusu District. Suzhou Industrial Park is to the east of the old town, and Suzhou High & New Technology Development Zone is to the west. In 2000, the original Wu County was divided into two districts including Xiangcheng and Wuzhong. They now form the northern and southern parts of the city of Suzhou.In 2012, the original Wujiang City became Wujiang District of Suzhou City.\nSuzhou is one of the most prosperous cities in China. Its development has a direct correlation with the growth of its satellite cities, including Kunshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Zhangjiagang, which together with the city of Suzhou form the Suzhou prefecture. The Suzhou prefecture is home to many high-tech enterprises.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSuzhou is on the Lake Tai Plain south of the Yangtze River, about 100 km (60 mi) to the west of Shanghai and just over 200 km (120 mi) east of Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSuzhou has a four-season humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and cool, cloudy, damp winters with occasional snowfall (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa). Northwesterly winds blowing from Siberia during winter can cause temperatures to fall below freezing at night, while southerly or southwesterly winds during the summer can push temperatures above 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The hottest temperature recorded since 1951 was at 41.0 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) on 7 August 2013, and the lowest at \u22129.8 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958.\n\n\n== Cityscape and environment ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Classical Gardens of Suzhou ===\n\nSuzhou is famous for its over 60 Classical Gardens, collectively a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city has the Most UNESCO-recognized gardens in the world.The Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden are among the four most famous classical gardens in China. The Canglang Pavilion, Lion Grove Garden, Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden, respectively representing the garden styles of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, are called the four most famous gardens in Suzhou. Other gardens inscribed on the World Heritage List include the Couple's Retreat Garden, the Garden of Cultivation, and the Retreat and Reflection Garden.\n\n\n=== Temples ===\nHanshan Temple\nXiyuan Temple\nXuanmiao Temple\nLingyanshan Temple\nChongyuan Temple\nTaipingfang Mosque (\u592a\u5e73\u574a\u6e05\u771f\u5bfa)\n\n\n=== Canals and historic districts ===\n\nThe Suzhou section of the Jiangnan Canal, Grand Canal (China), includes ten city gates and over 20 stone bridges of traditional design and historic areas that have been well preserved, as well as temples and pavilions. \n There are a full 24 waterways in Suzhou near the Grand Canal.In 2015, both 800-year-old Pingjiang Road Historical Block (\u5e73\u6c5f\u8def) and 1,200-year-old Shantang Street Scenic Area (\u5c71\u5858\u8857) were added to the list of China's \"National Historic and Cultural Streets\".Pingjiang Road runs parallel to the Pingjiang River for 1.5 kilometers and is lined with homes and some teahouses. Shantang Street, over twice as long at 3.8 km, is described by the BBC as  retaining \"the alluring qualities of an old canal-side street: whitewashed buildings are completed by red-tasselled lanterns that swing softly in the breeze, adding to the charm of the river bank\".\n\nBoat tours are offered on the waterways of this city that was dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" by Marco Polo because of its criss-crossing canals and stone bridges. The Grand Canal (from Beijing to Zhejiang province) is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Resorts and natural reserves ===\nSuzhou Taihu National Tourism and Vacation Zone (\u82cf\u5dde\u592a\u6e56\u56fd\u5bb6\u65c5\u6e38\u5ea6\u5047\u533a) is in the western part of Suzhou, 15 km (9 mi) from the city center.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nGate to the East is a 301.8 meter, 74-story skyscraper in Suzhou's central business district, built in 2015 at a cost of 700 million USD and is currently the tallest building in Suzhou.\n\n\n=== Pan Gate ===\nPan Gate is on the southwest corner of the Main Canal or encircling canal of Suzhou. Originally built during the Warring States Period in the state of Wu, historians estimate it to be around 2,500 years old. It is now part of the Pan Gate Scenic Area. It is known for the \"three landmarks of Pan Gate\". They are the Ruiguang Pagoda, the earliest pagoda in Suzhou built in 247 BC, the Wu Gate Bridge, the entrance to the gate at that time over the water passage and the highest bridge in Suzhou at the time, and the Pan Gate. The Ruigang Pagoda is constructed of brick with wooden platforms and has Buddhist carvings at its base.\n\n\n=== Baodai Bridge ===\nBaodai Bridge stretches across the Tantai Lake in the suburbs of Suzhou. To raise money to finance the bridge, the magistrate donated his expensive belt, hence the name. The bridge was first built in 806 A.D. in the Tang Dynasty and has 53 arches with a length of 317 meters. It was made out of stone from Jinshan Mountain and is the longest standing bridge of its kind in China. The bridge was included on the list of national monuments (resolution 5-285) in 2001.\n\n\n=== Tiger Hill ===\nThe Tiger Hill is known for its natural environment and historical sites. The hill is so named because it is said to look like a crouching tiger. Another legend states that a white tiger appeared on the hill to guard it following the burial The hill has been a tourist destination for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, as is evident from the poetry and calligraphy carved into rocks on the hill. The Song Dynasty poet, Su Shi said, \"It is a lifelong pity if having visited Suzhou you did not visit Tiger Hill.\"\n\n\n=== Pagodas ===\nYunyan Pagoda (or Huqiu Tower) built in 961 is a Chinese pagoda built on Tiger Hill in Suzhou. It has several other names, including the \"Leaning Tower of China\" (as referred to by historian O.G. Ingles) and the Yunyan Temple Tower. The tower rises to a height of 47 m (154 ft). It is a seven-story octagonal building built with blue bricks. In more than a thousand years the tower has gradually slanted due to forces of nature. Now the top and bottom of the tower vary by 2.32 meters. The entire structure weighs some 7,000,000 kilograms (15,000,000 lb), supported by internal brick columns. However, the tower leans roughly 3 degrees due to the cracking of two supporting columns.Beisi Pagoda or North Temple Pagoda is a Chinese pagoda at Bao'en Temple in Suzhou. It rises nine stories in a height of 76 m (249 ft). It is the tallest Chinese pagoda south of the Yangtze river.\nTwin Pagodas (\u82cf\u5dde\u53cc\u5854) lie in the Dinghui Temple Lane in the southeastern corner of the city proper of Suzhou. They are artistic and natural as they are close at hand. One of them is called Clarity-Dispensing Pagoda and the other Beneficence Pagoda and they are in the same form of building. There are many legends about the one-thousand-year-old pagodas. It is charming that the exquisite and straight Twin Pagoda look like two inserted writing brushes. There was originally a single-storey house with three rooms just like a writing brush holder with the shadows of the two pagodas reclining on its roof at sunset. To the east of the pagoda is a square five-storeyed bell building built in the Ming Dynasty which is exactly like a thick ink stick. So there is a saying that \"the Twin Pagodas are as writing brushes while the bell building as ink stick\".\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city's major museums include the Suzhou Museum (designed by I. M. Pei), Suzhou Silk Museum, and Suzhou Museum of Opera and Theatre.\n\n\n=== Hospitals ===\nAs a result of its recent rapid population increase, healthcare demand in Suzhou is increasing rapidly. In July 2019, Washington University School of Medicine announced a collaboration with Huici Health Management Co., and the Xiangcheng District, to open the new Huici Medical Center, which will include a 1,000-bed hospital for adult and pediatric patients. Once the hospital is unveiled, Washington University doctors in St. Louis will be able to provide long-distance health-care services to patients in China through a telemedicine program.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Suzhou is predominantly Han Chinese. The official language of broadcast, instruction, etc. is Mandarin Chinese, although many speak a local dialect known as Suzhounese, a member of the Wu language family. In addition to American and European expatriates, there is a large Korean community in Suzhou. The Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) estimated that there were 15,000 Koreans in the municipality in 2014. That year 850 Korean companies operated in Suzhou, and the Koreans made up the largest number of students at the Suzhou Singapore International School.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nSuzhou's economy is based primarily on its large manufacturing sector\u2014China's second largest\u2014including iron and steel, IT and electronic equipment, and textile products. The city's service sector is notably well-developed, primarily owing to tourism, which brought in a total of RMB 152 billion of revenue in 2013. Suzhou's overall GDP exceeded RMB 1.3 trillion in 2013 (up 9.6 percent from the year previous).The city is also one of China's foremost destinations for foreign investment, based on its relative proximity to Shanghai and comparatively low operating costs. The municipal government has enacted various measures to encourage FDI in a number of manufacturing (e.g. pharmaceutical, electronic goods, automobile) and service (e.g. banking, logistics, research services) sectors. Included among these measures is a preferential tax policy for limited partnership venture capital enterprises in the Suzhou Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Development zones ===\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park ====\n\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) is the largest cooperative project between the Chinese and Singaporean governments. It is beside Jinji Lake, which lies to the east of the Suzhou Old City. On 26 February 1994, Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew represented China and Singapore respectively in signing the Agreement to jointly develop Suzhou Industrial Park (originally called the Singapore Industrial Park). The project officially commenced on 12 May in the same year. SIP has a jurisdiction area of 288 km2 (111 sq mi), of which, the China-Singapore cooperation area covers 80 km2 (31 sq mi) with a planned residential population of 1.2 million.SIP is home to the Suzhou Dushu Lake Science and Education Innovation District, an area of universities and higher education institutions, including Soochow University and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. Suzhou Industrial Park is also a popular residential district for many foreigners who work and live in Suzhou, as well as 'new Suzhou' residents who migrated to the area in search of work opportunities.\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park Export Processing Zone ====\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park Export Processing Zone was approved to be established by the government in April 2000, with a planning area of 2.9 km2 (1.1 sq mi). It is in Suzhou Industrial Park set up by China and Singapore. Inside the Export Processing Zone, all the infrastructures are of high standard.\n\n\n==== Suzhou New District ====\n\nThe Suzhou New District was established in 1990. In November 1992, the zone was approved to be the national-level hi-tech industrial zone. By the end of 2007, foreign-invested companies had a registered capital worth of US$13 billion, of which US$6.8 billion was paid in. SND hosts now more than 1,500 foreign companies. Some 40 Fortune 500 companies set up 67 projects in the district.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nSuzhou Dongwu currently play in China League Two, the third division of Chinese football. The 13,000 seat Suzhou Industrial Park Sports Arena will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nSuzhou is on the Shanghai-Nanjing corridor which carries three parallel railways. Suzhou railway station, near the city center, is among the busiest passenger stations in China. It is served by the Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway (mostly \"conventional\" trains to points throughout China) and the Shanghai-Nanjing intercity railway (high-speed D- and G-series trains providing frequent service primarily between Shanghai and Nanjing). It takes only 25 minutes to reach Shanghai railway station on the fastest G-series trains and less than 1 hour to Nanjing.\nThe Suzhou North railway station, a few kilometers to the north, is on the Beijing\u2013Shanghai high-speed railway (opened 2011), served by high-speed trains to Beijing, Qingdao, etc.\nOther stations on the Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway and the Shanghai\u2013Nanjing intercity railway serve other points in the same corridor within Suzhou Prefecture-level city, such as Kunshan. In and between Suzhou and Kunshan South railway station, Suzhou Industrial Park railway station now also becomes an important station for people visiting and living in the areas.\nThe northern part of the city, including such county-level cities as Zhangjiagang, Changshu and Taicang, presently has no rail service. However, plans exist for a cross-Yangtze railway from Nantong to the Shanghai metropolitan area (the Shanghai\u2013Nantong railway), which will run through most of these county-level cities. Construction work is expected to start in 2013 and to take five and a half years.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nThe Nanjing-Shanghai Expressway connects Suzhou with Shanghai, alternatively, there is the Yangtze Riverine Expressway and the Suzhou-Jiaxing-Hangzhou Expressway. In 2005, the Suzhou Outer Ring was completed, linking the peripheral county-level cities of Taicang, Kunshan, and Changshu. China National Highway 312 also passes through Suzhou.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nSuzhou is served by three airports, Sunan Shuofang International Airport (co-owned by Wuxi and Suzhou), Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport ( one hour drive ), Shanghai Pudong International Airport ( two hours drive ).\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nPort of Suzhou, on the right bank of the Yangtze River, dealt with 428 million tons of cargo and 5.86 million TEU containers in 2012, which made it the busiest inland river port in the world by annual cargo tonnage and container volume.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Suzhou Rail Transit currently has four lines in operation and five other lines under construction. The masterplan consists of nine independent lines. Line 1 started operation on April 28, 2012, Line 2 started operation on December 28, 2013, and Line 4 started operation in 2017. As of March 2020, Line 5, Line 6, Line 7 and Line 8 and Line S1 are under construction at the same time.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nSuzhou Tram system has two routes in the Suzhou New District.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nSuzhou has public bus routes that run into all parts of the city. Fares are flat rated, usually 1 Yuan for a non-air-conditioned bus and 2 Yuan for an air-conditioned one. The Suzhou BRT, a 25-kilometre (16 mi) bus rapid transit system opened in 2008, operates 5 lines using elevated busways and bus-only lanes throughout the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nOpera: Kunqu originates in the Suzhou region, as does the much later Suzhou Opera. Ballad-singing, or Suzhou pingtan, is a local form of storytelling that mixes singing (accompanied by the pipa and sanxian) with portions in spoken dialect.\nSilk: throughout China's Imperial past, Suzhou silk has been associated with high-quality silk products, supplying silks to ancient royal families. By the 13th century, Suzhou was already the center of the profitable silk trade.\nSong brocade: Suzhou's Song brocade, with its flashy colors, exquisite patterns, strong and soft texture, is one of China's three famous brocades, together with Nanjing Yun brocade and Sichuan Shu brocade. Suzhou's brocade production can be traced back to the Five Dynasties. It prospered in the Song Dynasty. After the government moved the capital southward, the country's political and cultural center moved to the Yangtze River area. To cope with the special need of artists, a type of very thin brocade for decorating paintings emerged in Suzhou. These brocades and paintings have been preserved. Whenever people talked about brocade, they mentioned the Song Dynasty, and thus Song brocade got its name and has been well-known ever since.\nHandicrafts: Suzhou embroidery, fans, Chinese musical instruments, scroll mounting, lanterns, mahogany furniture, jade carving, silk tapestry, traditional painting pigments of Jiangenxutang Studio, the New Year's wood-block prints of Taohuawu Studio.\nPaintings\nCalligraphic art\nCuisine: Yangcheng Lake large crab\nSuzhou Silk Hand Embroidery Art\nSuzhou is the original place of \"Jasmine\", a song sung by Chinese singers or actresses thousands of times on the occasions of almost every important meetings or celebrations. Jasmine is the symbol of Suzhou as well as Tai Hu Lake.\nSuzhou Gardens: Gardens in Suzhou have an ancient history. The first garden in Suzhou belonged to the emperor of Wu State in Spring and Autumn Period (600 BC). More than 200 gardens existed in Suzhou between the 16th and 18th centuries. Gardens in Suzhou were built according to the style of Chinese Paintings. Every view in a garden can be seen as a piece of Chinese Painting and the whole garden is a huge piece of Chinese Paintings. At present, the Humble Administrator's Garden, built in 16th, is the largest private garden in Suzhou. It belonged to by Wang Xianchen, an imperial censor.\nSuzhou embroidery together with embroidery of Hunan, Sichuan and Guangdong are called as the \"Four Famous Embroideries\". Suzhou tapestry method is done in fine silks and gold thread. Other art forms found in this area are sculpture, Song brocade, jade and rosewood carving.\nThe Suzhou Museum has a rich collection of relics from many eras. The collection includes revolutionary records, stele carving, folk customs, drama and verse, Suzhou embroidery, silk cloth, gardens, coins and Buddhist artifacts.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nSuzhou High School\nSuzhou No.1 High School\nSuzhou No.10 High School\nSuzhou Experimental High School\nLiangfeng High School\nChangshu High School\nZhenze Middle School\nKunshan Senior High School\nTaicang Senior High School\nSIP Experimental Middle School\nSuzhou Wuxian High School (\u82cf\u5dde\u5434\u53bf\u4e2d\u5b66)\n\n\n=== Universities and colleges ===\nSoochow University\nUniversity of Science and Technology of Suzhou\nRenmin University of China Suzhou Campus\nChangshu Institute of Technology\nJiangsu University of Science & Technology Zhangjiagang Campus\nXi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University\nDuke Kunshan University\n\n\n==== Under construction ====\nNanjing University Suzhou Campus\nNorthwestern Polytechnical University Taicang Campus\n\n\n=== Postgraduate institutions ===\nSoutheast University-Monash University Joint Graduate School\nSuzhou Graduate Town (National University of Singapore and Fudan Joint Graduate School, Nanjing University Graduate School, etc.)\n\n\n=== Others ===\nDulwich College Suzhou\nDulwich International High School Suzhou\nJapanese School of Suzhou\nKedge Business School\nOverseas Chinese Academy of Suzhou (\u82cf\u5dde\u5de5\u4e1a\u56ed\u533a\u6d77\u5f52\u4eba\u624d\u5b50\u5973\u5b66\u6821)\nSkema Business School \u2013 Chinese campus of the French business school\nSuzhou EtonHouse International School\nSuzhou Foreign Language School\nSuzhou Korean School\nSuzhou Singapore International School\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of twin towns and sister cities in China\nPort of Suzhou\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== General references ==\n Baynes, T.

        "wiki": "Suzhou (Chinese: \u82cf\u5dde; Suzhounese pronunciation: [s\u0259u ts\u00f8\u028f], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [s\u00fa.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u]), alternately romanized as Soochow, is a major city located in southeastern Jiangsu Province of East China, about 100 km (62 mi) northwest of Shanghai. It is a major economic center and focal point of trade and commerce, and the second largest city in the province, after its capital Nanjing. The city is situated on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the shores of Lake Tai and belongs to the Yangtze River Delta region. Administratively, Suzhou is a prefecture-level city with a population of 4.33 million in its city proper, and a total resident population (as of 2013) of 10.58 million in its administrative area. Its urban population grew at an unprecedented rate of 6.5% between 2000 and 2014, which is the highest among cities with more than 5 million people.Founded in 514 BC, Suzhou has over 2,500 years of history, with an abundant display of relics and sites of historical interest. Around AD 100, during the Eastern Han dynasty, it became one of the ten largest cities in the world mostly due to emigration from Northern China. Since the 10th-century Song dynasty, it has been an important commercial center of China. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Suzhou was a national economic, cultural, and commercial center, as well as the largest non-capital city in the world, until the 1860 Taiping Rebellion. When Li Hongzhang and Charles George Gordon recaptured the city three years later, Shanghai had already taken its predominant place in the nation. Since major economic reforms began in 1978, Suzhou has become one of the fastest growing major cities in the world, with GDP growth rates of about 14% in the past 35 years. With high life expectancy and per capita incomes, Suzhou's Human Development Index ratings is roughly comparable to a moderately developed country, making it one of the most highly developed and prosperous cities in China.The city's canals, stone bridges, pagodas, and meticulously designed gardens have contributed to its status as one of the top tourist attractions in China. The Classical Gardens of Suzhou were added to the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1997 and 2000. Suzhou is often dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" or \"Venice of China\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nDuring the Zhou, a settlement known as Gusu after nearby Mount Gusu (simplified Chinese: \u59d1\u82cf\u5c71; traditional Chinese: \u59d1\u8607\u5c71; pinyin: G\u016bs\u016bsh\u0101n) became the capital of the state of Wu. From this role, it also came to be called Wu as well. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu established a new capital nearby at Hel\u00fc City and this grew into the modern city. During the Warring States period, Hel\u00fc City continued to serve as the local seat of government. From the areas it administered, it became known as Wuxian (lit. \"Wu County\") and Wujun (\"Wu Commandery\"). Under the Qin, it was known as Kuaiji after its greatly enlarged commandery, which was named for the reputed resting place of Yu the Great near modern Shaoxing in Zhejiang.\nThe name Suzhou was first officially used for the city in AD 589 during the Sui dynasty. The s\u016b (\u8607 or \u82cf) in its name is a contraction of the old name Gusu. It refers to the mint perilla (shiso). The zhou \u5dde originally meant something like a province or county (cf. Guizhou), but often came to be used metonymously for the capital of such a region (cf. Guangzhou, Hangzhou, etc.). Suzhou is the Hanyu Pinyin spelling of the Putonghua pronunciation of the name. Prior to the adoption of pinyin, it was variously romanized as Soo-chow, Suchow, or Su-chow.\n\n\n== History ==\nSuzhou, the cradle of Wu culture, is one of the oldest towns in the Yangtze Basin. By the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou, local tribes named the Gou Wu are recorded living in the area which would become the modern city of Suzhou. These tribes formed villages on the edges of the hills above the wetlands surrounding Lake Tai.\nSima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian records traditional accounts that the Zhou lord Taibo established the state of Wu at nearby Wuxi during the 11th century BC, civilizing the local people and improving their agriculture and mastery of irrigation. The Wu court later moved to Gusu within the area of modern Suzhou. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu relocated his court nearby and called the settlement Hel\u00fc City after himself. His minister Wu Zixu was closely involved with its planning and it was this site that grew into present-day Suzhou. The height of his tower on Gusu Hill (Gusutai) passed into Chinese legend. In 496 BC, King Hel\u00fc was buried at Tiger Hill. In 473 BC, Wu was defeated and annexed by Yue, a kingdom to its southeast; Yue was annexed in turn by Chu in 306 BC. Remnants of the ancient kingdom include pieces of its 2,500-year-old city wall and the gate through it at Pan Gate.\nThe city was originally laid out according to a symbolic three-by-three grid of nine squares, with the royal palace occupying the central position.During the Warring States period, Suzhou was the seat of Wu County and Commandery. Following the Qin Empire's conquest of the area in 222 BC, it was made the capital of Kuaiji Commandery, including lands stretching from the south bank of the Yangtze to the unconquered interior of Minyue in southern Zhejiang. Amid the collapse of the Qin, Kuaiji's governor Yin Tong attempted to organize his own rebellion only to be betrayed and executed by Xiang Liang and his nephew Xiang Yu, who launched their own rebellion from the city.\nWhen the Grand Canal was completed, Suzhou found itself strategically located on a major trade route. In the course of the history of China, it has been a metropolis of industry and commerce on the southeastern coast of China. During the Tang dynasty, the great poet Bai Juyi constructed the Shantang Canal (better known as \"Shantang Street\") to connect the city with Tiger Hill for tourists. In AD 1035, the Suzhou Confucian Temple was founded by famed poet and writer Fan Zhongyan. It became a venue for the imperial civil examinations and then developed into the modern Suzhou High School in the 1910s.\n\nIn February 1130, the advancing Jin army from the north ransacked the city. This was followed by the Mongol invasion in 1275. In 1356, Suzhou became the capital of Zhang Shicheng, one of the leaders of the Red Turban Rebellion against the Yuan dynasty and the self-proclaimed King of Wu. In 1367, Zhang's Nanjing-based rival Zhu Yuanzhang took the city after a 10-month siege. Zhu \u2013 who was soon to proclaim himself the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty \u2013 demolished the royal city in the center of Suzhou's walled city and imposed crushing taxes on the city and prefecture's powerful families. Despite the heavy taxation and the resettlement of some of Suzhou's prominent citizens' to the area of Hongwu's capital at Nanjing, Suzhou was soon prosperous again. During the early Ming, Suzhou Prefecture supervised the Yangtze shoals which later became Shanghai's Chongming Island. For centuries the city, with its surroundings as an economic base, represented an extraordinary source of tax revenue.When the shipwrecked Korean official Choe Bu had a chance to see much of Eastern China from Zhejiang to Liaoning on his way home in 1488, he described Suzhou in his travel report as exceeding every other city. Many of the area's private gardens were constructed by the gentry of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Taipings captured the city in 1860, however, and many of its former buildings and gardens were \"almost... a heap of ruins\" by the time of their recovery by Charles Gordon's Ever-Victorious Army in November 1863. Nonetheless, by 1880, its population was estimated to have recovered to about 500,000, which remained stable for the next few decades. In the late 19th century, the town was particularly known for its wide range of silks and its Chinese-language publishing industry. The town was first opened to direct foreign trades by the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending the First Sino-Japanese War and by the most favored nation clauses of earlier unequal treaties with the Great Powers. The new expatriates opened a European-and-Chinese school in 1900 and the Suzhou railway station, connecting it with Shanghai, opened on July 16, 1906. Just prior to the World War I, there were 7000 silk looms in operation, as well as a cotton mill and a large trade in rice.\n\nAs late as the early 20th century, much of the city consisted of islands connected by rivers, creeks, and canals to the surrounding countryside. Prior to their demolition, the city walls ran in a circuit of about 10 miles (16 km) with four large suburbs lying outside. The Japanese invaded in 1937, and many gardens were again devastated by the end of the war. In the early 1950s, restoration was done on the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Lingering Garden.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe urban core of Suzhou is informally called the \"Old Town\". It is Gusu District. Suzhou Industrial Park is to the east of the old town, and Suzhou High & New Technology Development Zone is to the west. In 2000, the original Wu County was divided into two districts including Xiangcheng and Wuzhong. They now form the northern and southern parts of the city of Suzhou.In 2012, the original Wujiang City became Wujiang District of Suzhou City.\nSuzhou is one of the most prosperous cities in China. Its development has a direct correlation with the growth of its satellite cities, including Kunshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Zhangjiagang, which together with the city of Suzhou form the Suzhou prefecture. The Suzhou prefecture is home to many high-tech enterprises.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSuzhou is on the Lake Tai Plain south of the Yangtze River, about 100 km (60 mi) to the west of Shanghai and just over 200 km (120 mi) east of Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSuzhou has a four-season humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and cool, cloudy, damp winters with occasional snowfall (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa). Northwesterly winds blowing from Siberia during winter can cause temperatures to fall below freezing at night, while southerly or southwesterly winds during the summer can push temperatures above 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The hottest temperature recorded since 1951 was at 41.0 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) on 7 August 2013, and the lowest at \u22129.8 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958.\n\n\n== Cityscape and environment ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Classical Gardens of Suzhou ===\n\nSuzhou is famous for its over 60 Classical Gardens, collectively a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city has the Most UNESCO-recognized gardens in the world.The Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden are among the four most famous classical gardens in China. The Canglang Pavilion, Lion Grove Garden, Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden, respectively representing the garden styles of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, are called the four most famous gardens in Suzhou. Other gardens inscribed on the World Heritage List include the Couple's Retreat Garden, the Garden of Cultivation, and the Retreat and Reflection Garden.\n\n\n=== Temples ===\nHanshan Temple\nXiyuan Temple\nXuanmiao Temple\nLingyanshan Temple\nChongyuan Temple\nTaipingfang Mosque (\u592a\u5e73\u574a\u6e05\u771f\u5bfa)\n\n\n=== Canals and historic districts ===\n\nThe Suzhou section of the Jiangnan Canal, Grand Canal (China), includes ten city gates and over 20 stone bridges of traditional design and historic areas that have been well preserved, as well as temples and pavilions. \n There are a full 24 waterways in Suzhou near the Grand Canal.In 2015, both 800-year-old Pingjiang Road Historical Block (\u5e73\u6c5f\u8def) and 1,200-year-old Shantang Street Scenic Area (\u5c71\u5858\u8857) were added to the list of China's \"National Historic and Cultural Streets\".Pingjiang Road runs parallel to the Pingjiang River for 1.5 kilometers and is lined with homes and some teahouses. Shantang Street, over twice as long at 3.8 km, is described by the BBC as  retaining \"the alluring qualities of an old canal-side street: whitewashed buildings are completed by red-tasselled lanterns that swing softly in the breeze, adding to the charm of the river bank\".\n\nBoat tours are offered on the waterways of this city that was dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" by Marco Polo because of its criss-crossing canals and stone bridges. The Grand Canal (from Beijing to Zhejiang province) is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Resorts and natural reserves ===\nSuzhou Taihu National Tourism and Vacation Zone (\u82cf\u5dde\u592a\u6e56\u56fd\u5bb6\u65c5\u6e38\u5ea6\u5047\u533a) is in the western part of Suzhou, 15 km (9 mi) from the city center.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nGate to the East is a 301.8 meter, 74-story skyscraper in Suzhou's central business district, built in 2015 at a cost of 700 million USD and is currently the tallest building in Suzhou.\n\n\n=== Pan Gate ===\nPan Gate is on the southwest corner of the Main Canal or encircling canal of Suzhou. Originally built during the Warring States Period in the state of Wu, historians estimate it to be around 2,500 years old. It is now part of the Pan Gate Scenic Area. It is known for the \"three landmarks of Pan Gate\". They are the Ruiguang Pagoda, the earliest pagoda in Suzhou built in 247 BC, the Wu Gate Bridge, the entrance to the gate at that time over the water passage and the highest bridge in Suzhou at the time, and the Pan Gate. The Ruigang Pagoda is constructed of brick with wooden platforms and has Buddhist carvings at its base.\n\n\n=== Baodai Bridge ===\nBaodai Bridge stretches across the Tantai Lake in the suburbs of Suzhou. To raise money to finance the bridge, the magistrate donated his expensive belt, hence the name. The bridge was first built in 806 A.D. in the Tang Dynasty and has 53 arches with a length of 317 meters. It was made out of stone from Jinshan Mountain and is the longest standing bridge of its kind in China. The bridge was included on the list of national monuments (resolution 5-285) in 2001.\n\n\n=== Tiger Hill ===\nThe Tiger Hill is known for its natural environment and historical sites. The hill is so named because it is said to look like a crouching tiger. Another legend states that a white tiger appeared on the hill to guard it following the burial The hill has been a tourist destination for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, as is evident from the poetry and calligraphy carved into rocks on the hill. The Song Dynasty poet, Su Shi said, \"It is a lifelong pity if having visited Suzhou you did not visit Tiger Hill.\"\n\n\n=== Pagodas ===\nYunyan Pagoda (or Huqiu Tower) built in 961 is a Chinese pagoda built on Tiger Hill in Suzhou. It has several other names, including the \"Leaning Tower of China\" (as referred to by historian O.G. Ingles) and the Yunyan Temple Tower. The tower rises to a height of 47 m (154 ft). It is a seven-story octagonal building built with blue bricks. In more than a thousand years the tower has gradually slanted due to forces of nature. Now the top and bottom of the tower vary by 2.32 meters. The entire structure weighs some 7,000,000 kilograms (15,000,000 lb), supported by internal brick columns. However, the tower leans roughly 3 degrees due to the cracking of two supporting columns.Beisi Pagoda or North Temple Pagoda is a Chinese pagoda at Bao'en Temple in Suzhou. It rises nine stories in a height of 76 m (249 ft). It is the tallest Chinese pagoda south of the Yangtze river.\nTwin Pagodas (\u82cf\u5dde\u53cc\u5854) lie in the Dinghui Temple Lane in the southeastern corner of the city proper of Suzhou. They are artistic and natural as they are close at hand. One of them is called Clarity-Dispensing Pagoda and the other Beneficence Pagoda and they are in the same form of building. There are many legends about the one-thousand-year-old pagodas. It is charming that the exquisite and straight Twin Pagoda look like two inserted writing brushes. There was originally a single-storey house with three rooms just like a writing brush holder with the shadows of the two pagodas reclining on its roof at sunset. To the east of the pagoda is a square five-storeyed bell building built in the Ming Dynasty which is exactly like a thick ink stick. So there is a saying that \"the Twin Pagodas are as writing brushes while the bell building as ink stick\".\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city's major museums include the Suzhou Museum (designed by I. M. Pei), Suzhou Silk Museum, and Suzhou Museum of Opera and Theatre.\n\n\n=== Hospitals ===\nAs a result of its recent rapid population increase, healthcare demand in Suzhou is increasing rapidly. In July 2019, Washington University School of Medicine announced a collaboration with Huici Health Management Co., and the Xiangcheng District, to open the new Huici Medical Center, which will include a 1,000-bed hospital for adult and pediatric patients. Once the hospital is unveiled, Washington University doctors in St. Louis will be able to provide long-distance health-care services to patients in China through a telemedicine program.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Suzhou is predominantly Han Chinese. The official language of broadcast, instruction, etc. is Mandarin Chinese, although many speak a local dialect known as Suzhounese, a member of the Wu language family. In addition to American and European expatriates, there is a large Korean community in Suzhou. The Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) estimated that there were 15,000 Koreans in the municipality in 2014. That year 850 Korean companies operated in Suzhou, and the Koreans made up the largest number of students at the Suzhou Singapore International School.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nSuzhou's economy is based primarily on its large manufacturing sector\u2014China's second largest\u2014including iron and steel, IT and electronic equipment, and textile products. The city's service sector is notably well-developed, primarily owing to tourism, which brought in a total of RMB 152 billion of revenue in 2013. Suzhou's overall GDP exceeded RMB 1.3 trillion in 2013 (up 9.6 percent from the year previous).The city is also one of China's foremost destinations for foreign investment, based on its relative proximity to Shanghai and comparatively low operating costs. The municipal government has enacted various measures to encourage FDI in a number of manufacturing (e.g. pharmaceutical, electronic goods, automobile) and service (e.g. banking, logistics, research services) sectors. Included among these measures is a preferential tax policy for limited partnership venture capital enterprises in the Suzhou Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Development zones ===\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park ====\n\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) is the largest cooperative project between the Chinese and Singaporean governments. It is beside Jinji Lake, which lies to the east of the Suzhou Old City. On 26 February 1994, Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew represented China and Singapore respectively in signing the Agreement to jointly develop Suzhou Industrial Park (originally called the Singapore Industrial Park). The project officially commenced on 12 May in the same year. SIP has a jurisdiction area of 288 km2 (111 sq mi), of which, the China-Singapore cooperation area covers 80 km2 (31 sq mi) with a planned residential population of 1.2 million.SIP is home to the Suzhou Dushu Lake Science and Education Innovation District, an area of universities and higher education institutions, including Soochow University and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. Suzhou Industrial Park is also a popular residential district for many foreigners who work and live in Suzhou, as well as 'new Suzhou' residents who migrated to the area in search of work opportunities.\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park Export Processing Zone ====\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park Export Processing Zone was approved to be established by the government in April 2000, with a planning area of 2.9 km2 (1.1 sq mi). It is in Suzhou Industrial Park set up by China and Singapore. Inside the Export Processing Zone, all the infrastructures are of high standard.\n\n\n==== Suzhou New District ====\n\nThe Suzhou New District was established in 1990. In November 1992, the zone was approved to be the national-level hi-tech industrial zone. By the end of 2007, foreign-invested companies had a registered capital worth of US$13 billion, of which US$6.8 billion was paid in. SND hosts now more than 1,500 foreign companies. Some 40 Fortune 500 companies set up 67 projects in the district.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nSuzhou Dongwu currently play in China League Two, the third division of Chinese football. The 13,000 seat Suzhou Industrial Park Sports Arena will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nSuzhou is on the Shanghai-Nanjing corridor which carries three parallel railways. Suzhou railway station, near the city center, is among the busiest passenger stations in China. It is served by the Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway (mostly \"conventional\" trains to points throughout China) and the Shanghai-Nanjing intercity railway (high-speed D- and G-series trains providing frequent service primarily between Shanghai and Nanjing). It takes only 25 minutes to reach Shanghai railway station on the fastest G-series trains and less than 1 hour to Nanjing.\nThe Suzhou North railway station, a few kilometers to the north, is on the Beijing\u2013Shanghai high-speed railway (opened 2011), served by high-speed trains to Beijing, Qingdao, etc.\nOther stations on the Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway and the Shanghai\u2013Nanjing intercity railway serve other points in the same corridor within Suzhou Prefecture-level city, such as Kunshan. In and between Suzhou and Kunshan South railway station, Suzhou Industrial Park railway station now also becomes an important station for people visiting and living in the areas.\nThe northern part of the city, including such county-level cities as Zhangjiagang, Changshu and Taicang, presently has no rail service. However, plans exist for a cross-Yangtze railway from Nantong to the Shanghai metropolitan area (the Shanghai\u2013Nantong railway), which will run through most of these county-level cities. Construction work is expected to start in 2013 and to take five and a half years.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nThe Nanjing-Shanghai Expressway connects Suzhou with Shanghai, alternatively, there is the Yangtze Riverine Expressway and the Suzhou-Jiaxing-Hangzhou Expressway. In 2005, the Suzhou Outer Ring was completed, linking the peripheral county-level cities of Taicang, Kunshan, and Changshu. China National Highway 312 also passes through Suzhou.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nSuzhou is served by three airports, Sunan Shuofang International Airport (co-owned by Wuxi and Suzhou), Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport ( one hour drive ), Shanghai Pudong International Airport ( two hours drive ).\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nPort of Suzhou, on the right bank of the Yangtze River, dealt with 428 million tons of cargo and 5.86 million TEU containers in 2012, which made it the busiest inland river port in the world by annual cargo tonnage and container volume.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Suzhou Rail Transit currently has four lines in operation and five other lines under construction. The masterplan consists of nine independent lines. Line 1 started operation on April 28, 2012, Line 2 started operation on December 28, 2013, and Line 4 started operation in 2017. As of March 2020, Line 5, Line 6, Line 7 and Line 8 and Line S1 are under construction at the same time.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nSuzhou Tram system has two routes in the Suzhou New District.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nSuzhou has public bus routes that run into all parts of the city. Fares are flat rated, usually 1 Yuan for a non-air-conditioned bus and 2 Yuan for an air-conditioned one. The Suzhou BRT, a 25-kilometre (16 mi) bus rapid transit system opened in 2008, operates 5 lines using elevated busways and bus-only lanes throughout the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nOpera: Kunqu originates in the Suzhou region, as does the much later Suzhou Opera. Ballad-singing, or Suzhou pingtan, is a local form of storytelling that mixes singing (accompanied by the pipa and sanxian) with portions in spoken dialect.\nSilk: throughout China's Imperial past, Suzhou silk has been associated with high-quality silk products, supplying silks to ancient royal families. By the 13th century, Suzhou was already the center of the profitable silk trade.\nSong brocade: Suzhou's Song brocade, with its flashy colors, exquisite patterns, strong and soft texture, is one of China's three famous brocades, together with Nanjing Yun brocade and Sichuan Shu brocade. Suzhou's brocade production can be traced back to the Five Dynasties. It prospered in the Song Dynasty. After the government moved the capital southward, the country's political and cultural center moved to the Yangtze River area. To cope with the special need of artists, a type of very thin brocade for decorating paintings emerged in Suzhou. These brocades and paintings have been preserved. Whenever people talked about brocade, they mentioned the Song Dynasty, and thus Song brocade got its name and has been well-known ever since.\nHandicrafts: Suzhou embroidery, fans, Chinese musical instruments, scroll mounting, lanterns, mahogany furniture, jade carving, silk tapestry, traditional painting pigments of Jiangenxutang Studio, the New Year's wood-block prints of Taohuawu Studio.\nPaintings\nCalligraphic art\nCuisine: Yangcheng Lake large crab\nSuzhou Silk Hand Embroidery Art\nSuzhou is the original place of \"Jasmine\", a song sung by Chinese singers or actresses thousands of times on the occasions of almost every important meetings or celebrations. Jasmine is the symbol of Suzhou as well as Tai Hu Lake.\nSuzhou Gardens: Gardens in Suzhou have an ancient history. The first garden in Suzhou belonged to the emperor of Wu State in Spring and Autumn Period (600 BC). More than 200 gardens existed in Suzhou between the 16th and 18th centuries. Gardens in Suzhou were built according to the style of Chinese Paintings. Every view in a garden can be seen as a piece of Chinese Painting and the whole garden is a huge piece of Chinese Paintings. At present, the Humble Administrator's Garden, built in 16th, is the largest private garden in Suzhou. It belonged to by Wang Xianchen, an imperial censor.\nSuzhou embroidery together with embroidery of Hunan, Sichuan and Guangdong are called as the \"Four Famous Embroideries\". Suzhou tapestry method is done in fine silks and gold thread. Other art forms found in this area are sculpture, Song brocade, jade and rosewood carving.\nThe Suzhou Museum has a rich collection of relics from many eras. The collection includes revolutionary records, stele carving, folk customs, drama and verse, Suzhou embroidery, silk cloth, gardens, coins and Buddhist artifacts.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nSuzhou High School\nSuzhou No.1 High School\nSuzhou No.10 High School\nSuzhou Experimental High School\nLiangfeng High School\nChangshu High School\nZhenze Middle School\nKunshan Senior High School\nTaicang Senior High School\nSIP Experimental Middle School\nSuzhou Wuxian High School (\u82cf\u5dde\u5434\u53bf\u4e2d\u5b66)\n\n\n=== Universities and colleges ===\nSoochow University\nUniversity of Science and Technology of Suzhou\nRenmin University of China Suzhou Campus\nChangshu Institute of Technology\nJiangsu University of Science & Technology Zhangjiagang Campus\nXi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University\nDuke Kunshan University\n\n\n==== Under construction ====\nNanjing University Suzhou Campus\nNorthwestern Polytechnical University Taicang Campus\n\n\n=== Postgraduate institutions ===\nSoutheast University-Monash University Joint Graduate School\nSuzhou Graduate Town (National University of Singapore and Fudan Joint Graduate School, Nanjing University Graduate School, etc.)\n\n\n=== Others ===\nDulwich College Suzhou\nDulwich International High School Suzhou\nJapanese School of Suzhou\nKedge Business School\nOverseas Chinese Academy of Suzhou (\u82cf\u5dde\u5de5\u4e1a\u56ed\u533a\u6d77\u5f52\u4eba\u624d\u5b50\u5973\u5b66\u6821)\nSkema Business School \u2013 Chinese campus of the French business school\nSuzhou EtonHouse International School\nSuzhou Foreign Language School\nSuzhou Korean School\nSuzhou Singapore International School\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of twin towns and sister cities in China\nPort of Suzhou\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== General references ==\n Baynes, T.

        "wiki": "The Garden of Cultivation (Chinese: \u827a\u5703; pinyin: Y\u00ec P\u01d4) is one of the best preserved examples of a Ming Dynasty classical garden in Suzhou. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Classical Gardens of Suzhou on the World Heritage List. \"Due to its special history, this Garden was virtually unknown before it was listed as a UN World Cultural Heritage site.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Garden of Cultivation was built in 1541 CE by Yuan Zugeng (\u8881\u7956\u5e9a, 1519-1590), at that time it was called the Hall of Delights.  In 1620 CE it was purchased by Wen Zhenheng (1574-1638), grandson of the Wen Zhengming the designer of the Humble Administrator's Garden, \"a celebrated master painter in China's history, and [who] served as the prime minister in the late Ming Dynasty\".  Wen Zhenheng was a noted garden designer and critic in his own right. He rebuilt the garden to test his aesthetic theories and renamed it Herb Garden for the numerous herbs incorporated in the design.  In 1659 CE, It was rebuilt again by Jiang Cai, \"a respected scholar and minister of Foreign Affairs during the late Ming Dynasty, who protested against corruption by exiling himself\" and renamed Jingting Mountain Villa.  Jiang Cai added a grove of fig trees.  His son Jiang Shijie inherited the garden and renamed it Cultivation Garden after added the chapel of Guanyin.  In 1839 CE it was transferred to the Qixiang Office of the Saint and Silk company.  In 2000 it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.The garden received great acclaim in the Qing Dynasty because \"all three owners...were scholars known for their integrity\".  Wang Wan wrote, \"enclosing walls keep the worldly uproars outside; seclusion makes the inside of the house resemble a country villa; branches of date trees are heavy with fruit over the house; the pond surface is decorated with green duckweed and red lotus.\"\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe 3,967m2 garden is divided into an eastern section of residence and a western garden section.  Altogether the garden has 13 pavilions, 17 tablets, and 8 stelae.  The Western section is composed of several pavilions around the main  Lotus Pond, a rockery, and a smaller garden addition named The Garden of Sweet Grasses.  The structure of the garden is formed along a north to south axis which ties the three main elements of rockery, pool, and hall together.  This style of composition is also used in the Mountain Villa with Embraced Beauty.  The overall design is the simplest expression of a classical garden, there is one dominant composition, the Longevity Hall, and its associated view. The 700 m2 Lotus Pond is square with two water tails to give the illusion of infinite size.  These tails are crossed by Fish Viewing Bridge and Ferrying Beauty Bridge The former is a three-step arched bridge adjacent to the Fry Pavilion.  The latter is a natural stone bridge at the entry to the Sweet Grass Garden.  The Garden of Sweet Grasses is a scaled down version of the main garden and consists of the Sweet Grass House and Bathing Gull Pond as well as a smaller rockery.  This area is the herb (sweet grass) garden added by Wen Zhenheng.  It is meant to evoke his principal of \"to leave residents free from worries, make tenants unwilling to leave, and enable visitors to throw off their tiredness\".  The garden is very typical of the Ming Dynasty design aesthetic because of its clear composition in plan and the elegance and simplicity of its elements.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese garden\nSuzhou\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nSuzhou Mingcheng Information Port Co., LTD. \"The Garden of Cultivation\".

        "wiki": "The China\u2013Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u2014\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u82cf\u5dde\u5de5\u4e1a\u56ed\u533a; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u570b\u2014\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u8607\u5dde\u5de5\u696d\u5712\u5340; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\u2014X\u012bnji\u0101p\u014d S\u016bzh\u014du G\u014dngy\u00e8 Yu\u00e1n Q\u016b), or Suzhou Industrial Park for short, abbreviated as SIP, is a county-level administrative area located in Suzhou, Jiangsu with a little Singaporean influence.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 1992, the idea of developing a modern industrial township with Singapore experience was broached. During his tour of southern China that year, China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping said: \"Singapore enjoys good social order and is well managed. We should tap on their experience, and learn how to manage better than them.\"\nAfter rounds of discussions and site surveys, both governments decided to join hands in developing a modern industrial park in the east of Suzhou. The China\u2013Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park (CS-SIP) was thus born on February 26, 1994 when Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew signed the Agreement on the Joint Development of Suzhou Industrial Park in Suzhou.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSIP has a total jurisdiction area of 288 km2, of which, the China-Singapore cooperation area covers 80 km2 with a planned residential population of 1.2 million. The China-Singapore Joint Steering Council led by Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi and Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng will hold meeting every year to give directions for the development of SIP.Jinji Lake (literally Golden Rooster Lake) is a small fresh water lake located in the central part of Suzhou Industrial Park. It occupies an area of 7.18 square kilometres and its average depth is about 2.5 to 3 metres. There are two man-made islands in the lake.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nReports surfaced in 2019 that the park was being affected by the US-China trade war, with exports having declined 10 per cent over the first seven months of 2019 when compared to 2018 figures, while imports have fallen 15 per cent over the same period. \n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and higher education ===\n\nThere is Suzhou Dushu Lake Higher Education Town, one of the government's key projects. Located east of Dushu Lake, it has a total area of 25 km2, and expects to have around 400,000 people by 2016, 100,000 of whom will be students. Its goal is to offer good education, advanced technology, and a pleasant living environment. The area is home to many universities (undergraduate as well as graduate schools) including local Chinese universities and universities from other countries. This community focuses on producing educated and creative people. The area offers facilities including libraries, entertainment venues, parks, a sports centre and accommodation. Wenxing Plaza and Hanlin Plaza are popular locations of many small restaurants and shops. Dushu Lake Library is an experimental library of the National Digital Library. Major universities include Suzhou University, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and Renmin University of China, Suzhou Campus.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe SIP ran into trouble when local officials began building Suzhou New District (SND) industrial park to compete with it. As the Suzhou city government had only a minority 35 percent stake in the SIP, while they had a major stake in SND, the city government largely ignored SIP and concentrated on promoting the SND instead.\nThe project was supposed to transfer Singapore's management skills to Chinese bureaucrats and to teach China how to build and run \"business-friendly\" commercial parks. But it ended up straining the close relations between Singapore and China and bringing home to Singaporeans the often unpredictable, and sometimes underhand, business culture of the Communist mainland.Singapore's senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew conceded that the project had not turned out as planned and had made him more cautious about investments in China. He pointed to the difficulties that arose in signing agreements with the central government that were then implemented by local officials who \"have their own imperatives\".After incurring losses of some US$90 million over 5 years, the Singapore consortium lowered its stake to 35 percent, raising the Chinese consortium's stake to 65 percent from 35 percent and reducing the Singaporean share from a planned 70 km2 to just 8 km2.  The Chinese side appointed Wang Jinhua, vice-mayor of Suzhou and the former manager of the New District, as the new chief executive.\nIn 2001, one year after Singapore lowered its stake, the park made its first profit of $3.8 million.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nJinji Lake\nDushu Lake\nGate to the East\nSuzhou Ferris Wheel\nSuzhou Industrial Park Railway Station\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSuzhou Industrial Park Webpage",

        "wiki": "Suzhou (Chinese: \u82cf\u5dde; Suzhounese pronunciation: [s\u0259u ts\u00f8\u028f], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [s\u00fa.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u]), alternately romanized as Soochow, is a major city located in southeastern Jiangsu Province of East China, about 100 km (62 mi) northwest of Shanghai. It is a major economic center and focal point of trade and commerce, and the second largest city in the province, after its capital Nanjing. The city is situated on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the shores of Lake Tai and belongs to the Yangtze River Delta region. Administratively, Suzhou is a prefecture-level city with a population of 4.33 million in its city proper, and a total resident population (as of 2013) of 10.58 million in its administrative area. Its urban population grew at an unprecedented rate of 6.5% between 2000 and 2014, which is the highest among cities with more than 5 million people.Founded in 514 BC, Suzhou has over 2,500 years of history, with an abundant display of relics and sites of historical interest. Around AD 100, during the Eastern Han dynasty, it became one of the ten largest cities in the world mostly due to emigration from Northern China. Since the 10th-century Song dynasty, it has been an important commercial center of China. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Suzhou was a national economic, cultural, and commercial center, as well as the largest non-capital city in the world, until the 1860 Taiping Rebellion. When Li Hongzhang and Charles George Gordon recaptured the city three years later, Shanghai had already taken its predominant place in the nation. Since major economic reforms began in 1978, Suzhou has become one of the fastest growing major cities in the world, with GDP growth rates of about 14% in the past 35 years. With high life expectancy and per capita incomes, Suzhou's Human Development Index ratings is roughly comparable to a moderately developed country, making it one of the most highly developed and prosperous cities in China.The city's canals, stone bridges, pagodas, and meticulously designed gardens have contributed to its status as one of the top tourist attractions in China. The Classical Gardens of Suzhou were added to the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1997 and 2000. Suzhou is often dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" or \"Venice of China\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nDuring the Zhou, a settlement known as Gusu after nearby Mount Gusu (simplified Chinese: \u59d1\u82cf\u5c71; traditional Chinese: \u59d1\u8607\u5c71; pinyin: G\u016bs\u016bsh\u0101n) became the capital of the state of Wu. From this role, it also came to be called Wu as well. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu established a new capital nearby at Hel\u00fc City and this grew into the modern city. During the Warring States period, Hel\u00fc City continued to serve as the local seat of government. From the areas it administered, it became known as Wuxian (lit. \"Wu County\") and Wujun (\"Wu Commandery\"). Under the Qin, it was known as Kuaiji after its greatly enlarged commandery, which was named for the reputed resting place of Yu the Great near modern Shaoxing in Zhejiang.\nThe name Suzhou was first officially used for the city in AD 589 during the Sui dynasty. The s\u016b (\u8607 or \u82cf) in its name is a contraction of the old name Gusu. It refers to the mint perilla (shiso). The zhou \u5dde originally meant something like a province or county (cf. Guizhou), but often came to be used metonymously for the capital of such a region (cf. Guangzhou, Hangzhou, etc.). Suzhou is the Hanyu Pinyin spelling of the Putonghua pronunciation of the name. Prior to the adoption of pinyin, it was variously romanized as Soo-chow, Suchow, or Su-chow.\n\n\n== History ==\nSuzhou, the cradle of Wu culture, is one of the oldest towns in the Yangtze Basin. By the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou, local tribes named the Gou Wu are recorded living in the area which would become the modern city of Suzhou. These tribes formed villages on the edges of the hills above the wetlands surrounding Lake Tai.\nSima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian records traditional accounts that the Zhou lord Taibo established the state of Wu at nearby Wuxi during the 11th century BC, civilizing the local people and improving their agriculture and mastery of irrigation. The Wu court later moved to Gusu within the area of modern Suzhou. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu relocated his court nearby and called the settlement Hel\u00fc City after himself. His minister Wu Zixu was closely involved with its planning and it was this site that grew into present-day Suzhou. The height of his tower on Gusu Hill (Gusutai) passed into Chinese legend. In 496 BC, King Hel\u00fc was buried at Tiger Hill. In 473 BC, Wu was defeated and annexed by Yue, a kingdom to its southeast; Yue was annexed in turn by Chu in 306 BC. Remnants of the ancient kingdom include pieces of its 2,500-year-old city wall and the gate through it at Pan Gate.\nThe city was originally laid out according to a symbolic three-by-three grid of nine squares, with the royal palace occupying the central position.During the Warring States period, Suzhou was the seat of Wu County and Commandery. Following the Qin Empire's conquest of the area in 222 BC, it was made the capital of Kuaiji Commandery, including lands stretching from the south bank of the Yangtze to the unconquered interior of Minyue in southern Zhejiang. Amid the collapse of the Qin, Kuaiji's governor Yin Tong attempted to organize his own rebellion only to be betrayed and executed by Xiang Liang and his nephew Xiang Yu, who launched their own rebellion from the city.\nWhen the Grand Canal was completed, Suzhou found itself strategically located on a major trade route. In the course of the history of China, it has been a metropolis of industry and commerce on the southeastern coast of China. During the Tang dynasty, the great poet Bai Juyi constructed the Shantang Canal (better known as \"Shantang Street\") to connect the city with Tiger Hill for tourists. In AD 1035, the Suzhou Confucian Temple was founded by famed poet and writer Fan Zhongyan. It became a venue for the imperial civil examinations and then developed into the modern Suzhou High School in the 1910s.\n\nIn February 1130, the advancing Jin army from the north ransacked the city. This was followed by the Mongol invasion in 1275. In 1356, Suzhou became the capital of Zhang Shicheng, one of the leaders of the Red Turban Rebellion against the Yuan dynasty and the self-proclaimed King of Wu. In 1367, Zhang's Nanjing-based rival Zhu Yuanzhang took the city after a 10-month siege. Zhu \u2013 who was soon to proclaim himself the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty \u2013 demolished the royal city in the center of Suzhou's walled city and imposed crushing taxes on the city and prefecture's powerful families. Despite the heavy taxation and the resettlement of some of Suzhou's prominent citizens' to the area of Hongwu's capital at Nanjing, Suzhou was soon prosperous again. During the early Ming, Suzhou Prefecture supervised the Yangtze shoals which later became Shanghai's Chongming Island. For centuries the city, with its surroundings as an economic base, represented an extraordinary source of tax revenue.When the shipwrecked Korean official Choe Bu had a chance to see much of Eastern China from Zhejiang to Liaoning on his way home in 1488, he described Suzhou in his travel report as exceeding every other city. Many of the area's private gardens were constructed by the gentry of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Taipings captured the city in 1860, however, and many of its former buildings and gardens were \"almost... a heap of ruins\" by the time of their recovery by Charles Gordon's Ever-Victorious Army in November 1863. Nonetheless, by 1880, its population was estimated to have recovered to about 500,000, which remained stable for the next few decades. In the late 19th century, the town was particularly known for its wide range of silks and its Chinese-language publishing industry. The town was first opened to direct foreign trades by the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending the First Sino-Japanese War and by the most favored nation clauses of earlier unequal treaties with the Great Powers. The new expatriates opened a European-and-Chinese school in 1900 and the Suzhou railway station, connecting it with Shanghai, opened on July 16, 1906. Just prior to the World War I, there were 7000 silk looms in operation, as well as a cotton mill and a large trade in rice.\n\nAs late as the early 20th century, much of the city consisted of islands connected by rivers, creeks, and canals to the surrounding countryside. Prior to their demolition, the city walls ran in a circuit of about 10 miles (16 km) with four large suburbs lying outside. The Japanese invaded in 1937, and many gardens were again devastated by the end of the war. In the early 1950s, restoration was done on the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Lingering Garden.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe urban core of Suzhou is informally called the \"Old Town\". It is Gusu District. Suzhou Industrial Park is to the east of the old town, and Suzhou High & New Technology Development Zone is to the west. In 2000, the original Wu County was divided into two districts including Xiangcheng and Wuzhong. They now form the northern and southern parts of the city of Suzhou.In 2012, the original Wujiang City became Wujiang District of Suzhou City.\nSuzhou is one of the most prosperous cities in China. Its development has a direct correlation with the growth of its satellite cities, including Kunshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Zhangjiagang, which together with the city of Suzhou form the Suzhou prefecture.

It has several other names, including the \"Leaning Tower of China\" (as referred to by historian O.G. Ingles) and the Yunyan Temple Tower. The tower rises to a height of 47 m (154 ft). It is a seven-story octagonal building built with blue bricks. In more than a thousand years the tower has gradually slanted due to forces of nature. Now the top and bottom of the tower vary by 2.32 meters. The entire structure weighs some 7,000,000 kilograms (15,000,000 lb), supported by internal brick columns. However, the tower leans roughly 3 degrees due to the cracking of two supporting columns.Beisi Pagoda or North Temple Pagoda is a Chinese pagoda at Bao'en Temple in Suzhou. It rises nine stories in a height of 76 m (249 ft). It is the tallest Chinese pagoda south of the Yangtze river.\nTwin Pagodas (\u82cf\u5dde\u53cc\u5854) lie in the Dinghui Temple Lane in the southeastern corner of the city proper of Suzhou. They are artistic and natural as they are close at hand. One of them is called Clarity-Dispensing Pagoda and the other Beneficence Pagoda and they are in the same form of building. There are many legends about the one-thousand-year-old pagodas. It is charming that the exquisite and straight Twin Pagoda look like two inserted writing brushes. There was originally a single-storey house with three rooms just like a writing brush holder with the shadows of the two pagodas reclining on its roof at sunset. To the east of the pagoda is a square five-storeyed bell building built in the Ming Dynasty which is exactly like a thick ink stick.

          "We took a day trip to Zhouzhuang and it was wonderful. It was a private guided tour and our guide really brought to life the area and the way residents would have lived many years ago. As part of the tour was a Gondola ride around the canals which was quite nice and relaxing",
          "Spent a full afternoon in the town and canals. very romantic place and has an amazing feel. Must visit if in Shanghai.",
          "Zhouzhuang is larger than Luzhi town, but equally enchanting. A little more commercial but it is up to you to find the quiet coners - and there are plenty. Less commercial than Tongli and Suzhou though. Just take your time to explore and look at the mansions, it is worth it and",
          "Great experience... maybe the best water town in China... located near Kunshan. One hour by taxi. Almost 160 CNY.",
          "This is really an exquisite, must see spot if you are visiting Suzhou or Shanghai. It is right in between. If you are attentive to the excellent signs and museum, you can learn a great deal about the history of the region which goes back 5,000 years. Although Venice is much",
          "A great place. A 5 star tourist attraction according to Chinese authority ratings. Loved the old buildings, the canal setting, the bridges (some famous), the shops and restaurants. Looking forward to taking 16 year 6 children to see the place in March. Plus, bits of",
          "I was touring this beautiful town with some business colleagues and we inadvertently went off the main tourist path. We were very happy we did. Our first indication that we may have made a wrong turn is that we saw some locals washing clothes in the water. They had small",
          "It is the oldest and a well-preserved ancient water town in China. It has a mesh of waterways and stone bridges, the most famous being the Double Bridge (two adjoining twin stone bridges, crossing two narrow waterways at right angles, dating back to Ming Dynasty of 1573-1619).",
          "On the recommendation of a friend we stayed overnight in Zhouzhuang, and are we glad we did! We stayed at the Guanshuiyi Inn, which was right on one of the many waterways. The town requires an admission of 100rmb (discount for those over 60), but when we checked in to the hotel",
          "This town covers a big area, and is worth visiting. Take a cruise, via man-rolled boat to tour the river. Historic shophouses lined both sides of the river. Have lunch in one of the inn, try the local specialty, braised pig trotter, and have a view of the river while dining.",
          "The place is one hour taxi drive from Suzhou and worth the journey. We came on a November Monday afternoon and stayed for the early evening. The city is charming, weather was perfect, and it was not crowded. Nice seafood in the local restaurants specifically the local crab.",
          "I have visited this town six times and still love it. Stayed at a traditional hotel which was great value for money. Little English is spoken in the town bu everyone is helpful. I would recommend an overnight stay in Zhouzhuang.",
          "Magnificent views with lots to do and see (cheap too). You can use an app called didi for transportation to and from water town.",
          "A day trip to Zhouzhuang is all you need to see old houses and rivers and bridges in one spot. Zhouzhuang is an ancient village built along the river banks, connected with numerous delicately built bridges. Every corner or every angle of this town is photo-perfect! Be it black",
          "There are several attractions of this kind, but this one is better, as it is genuine and not a fake one for tourists",
          "Which is now fully catered to tourists and full of them. You have to pay an entrance fee to get in though. The pass allows you to enter freely for 3 days. Bad: The shops were pretty pathetic. Every 3-4 shop were selling the usual and same thing. Either food, shoes, clothes,",
          "Variously described as the 'Venice of the East' this is a lovely water town. Yes, there are lots of tourists, but the canals, the stone bridges, the boat trips, exploring the very narrow alley ways with their shops and restaurants - especially those along the canals - make this",
          "This place was beyond my expectations. It was a Sunday that we visited and there were tons of tourists, mostly Chinese, but they didn't detract from the experience. The waterways, bridges, narrow alleyways, old buildings, shops, restaurants and temples all made for an",
          "Big hit with chinese tourists Interesting small streets adjacent to shallow canals Took the boat trip - not very exciting as such .. was very concerned and off putting ,when we spotted dishes being washed in the murky canal water in the back of a restaurant at the end of the",
          "I believe the town used to be beautiful and unique before it was overly exploit by tourism. During holiday rush hours it was literally not possible to walk in the town since it was extremely crowded. It's difficult to find authentic or original business because all the shops or",
          "If you are in the area, it is worth going to visit. Just try to see the village for what it was and leave the tourist shops behind. The fascinating part is realizing that part of the town still works and operates, walk towards those sites and those areas and you will enjoy",
          "Too commercialised. Expensive almost everywhere. Much job to be done to preserve the site. Baby stroller not recommended.",
          "It's 1.5-2.0 hours drive from Shanghai. Nice water town with bridges over a network of canals. Interesting to watch the gondola. Yummy braised pork knuckles dish. The barbel fish is small and overrated! Another option is to visit Zhujiajiao water town which smaller but nearer to",
          "How to get there: There are many long distance bus departing from Shanghai, Suzhou or Hangzhou. Even in Shanghai there are a few departure points. Almost all will bring one to the Zhouzhuang bus station, located north of Zhouzhuang. I took the exception and departed from",
          "Very old and nice town on the water. Not easy to visit without speaking Chinese though, I had a big help of my local guide. It was raining which made a bit less fun but many things to visit indoors too. Recommended.",
          "Zhouzhuang is considered Venice of China. It is about hour drive from Shanghai and we took taxi from the hotel that was near People's square and negotiated for 800Yuan($117 USD with today's rate) all in for him to take us there, wait for us for 3hours or so and come back to the",
          "Although some way from Shanghai, we would not have missed it. Built on a waterway, with a great variety of shops and the chance to visit old buildings and small craft type shops, it is an opportunity not to be missed. We had a ride in the gondola on the waterway and then got",
          "It is a long drive from Shanghai but worth it. It is built like Venice, buildings surrounded by narrow waterways with stone bridges providing access. The streets are packed with tourists type shops but there are some shops of interest. It is a place for walking and there would",
          "Located about one hour's drive from Shanghai, this charming water town was made famous by a Chinese painter Chen Yifei, whose famous Twin Bridges was acquired by Armand Hammer and presented to Deng Xiaoping (how ironic). Because of its fame, ZhouZhuang is always crowded, even",
          "We stayed in kunshun nothing really report Just shopping mall and a park We did go to water village in taxi and that was worth the trip Took boat ride and walked around the village I would not recommend that village when it is very hot Lots of people So yes we had a great",
          "Spent a weekend at Zhouzhuang Water Town after a business trip in Shanghai. Enjoyed the local fares for lunch which are very fresh ( you see the local fishes / river prawns and clams swimming in the tanks before the chef whips up the dishes). Must try : scrambled eggs with",
          "This is definitely a must see when you're in Suzhou province. The town is 1450 years old and offers hundreds of shops for souvenirs and other items such as pearls and scarves etc. There are also many traditional restaurants offering among other dishes the pigs trotters that",
          "This is a place where You can feel a climate of Chinese city from the past. It is worth to take a short boat trip through the city.",
          "I loved this place - it's like you are walking in the movies. Apart from the commercialized shops targeted to tourists, you can still see the real old houses and some locals who minimally sell their goods along the streets. There are boat services to take you along the canal.",
          "We went on a cold, wet day during the off peak season, which could account for the water town being deserted, which worked out well as we had more room to take pictures. Overall, Zhou Zhuang felt pretty authentic (more so than Mudu) did not feel overly commercialized. Try not",
          "Zhouzhuang Water Town is a surprise full of beautiful photo ops and timeless Chinese culture. Stroll the narrow lane and bridges and watch artisans making bone combs, studies in calligraphy, painting and drawings, and flower teas. Weavers card, spin and dye wool and make",
          "At evening, we stopped here for a couple hours to still about and thoroughly enjoyed the ambience of a lovely, quiet corner of China. The tourist buzz is gone, leaving peaceful picture taking",
          "If you want to travel back in time to see the \"old\" China, here is one place to visit. We were lucky to have a sunny spring day and everything looked so beautiful and authentic. Small trails, canals, gondolas little boutiques and restaurants, not too crowded like big cities and",
          "I went to Zhouzhuang Water Town as part of a tour from Shanghai. I had been to Tongli in September 2016 but I liked this one better. This one includes some buildings that are new to the area and are not original, and were added to increase the tourist appeal. The buildings",
          "Went to water town in december, weather was good.. not too hot! Tourist prizes in shops and restaurants, but it\u00b4s ok. I recommend to bring a decent camera with you, i didn\u00b4t have it :)",
          "I visited this places with 2 of my clients, driving from Shanghai to Zhujiajiao in the morning, noon time from Zhujiajiao to Zhouzhuang, one day tour enough for two famous water towns near Shanghai. My opinion is definitely Zhouzhuang is more famous than Zhujiajiao: larger,",
          "A beautiful place to come with your loved ones to enjoy the scenery, and to feel the ancient charm of zhouzhuang. We came in dec and yes agreed with some reviews that this is the best time to visit, there's no crowd, quiet and most importantly there's no photobomb.Is really a",
          "In my opinion, December is the best time to visit if you want to avoid crowds and get good photos. Been there once in June and it was overcrowded. Very touristy though. Don't really get to see the local life. But a good photography, dining, shopping and bargaining paradise.",
          "This ancient water town is about an hour driving from Shanghai. The area is huge and thus require lots of walking. However, there are man-pulled carriers that you can hired for touring around town. Yet still there are bridges, stairs and areas that you have to walk for better",
          "Beautiful, Quaint, and Friendly City. I enjoyed the short boat ride since it gave me an opportunity to take great photos. The food is great and there's a lot of cute things to buy. Don't forget to bargain! The initial price is always 3 times higher than the actual cost.",
          "I visited with a guide and three friends, we enjoyed trying all the free samples of food they sold all sorts and the views down the river are beautiful.",
          "This is usually a day trip, from Shanghai, offered by many tourism companies. It's not so much the distance that makes it far, as the traffic on the highway to get there - especially weekends and holidays. If you can't make it on a weekday, I wouldn't recommend it for what you",
          "Lovely day tour to this lovely little attraction. A market town as much as a water town, this was truly a wonderful experience. Plenty of shopping options, food options & cultural experience.",
          "I went here on a tour because it is quite a distance from Shanghai. I was not disappointed. You get to go through the water village in a traditional boat and learn about the history. There are very few residence that actually live there year round and not just tourist season.",
          "This ancient water town is truely lovely. The old buildings were astonishing, the history of the place was amazing. Lots of gift shops, food and inns. We went for the day and were not disappointed. A must see when you are in the area. We travelled from Shanghai to visit this",
          "This is the place one must visit when you go to Suzhou or Shanghai. I love this place for its ancient rustic beauty and the friendliness of the people here. A place of attraction is not just confined to the natural landscape but also the people that lived in it. Simple modesty,",
          "Yes, it's touristy but I still loved it. Only had a short time because I did it on the way to Nanjing from Shanghai but I wish I'd had a night to spend there to explore when the crowds died down. There was a 100rmb entrance fee which I think is very reasonable given that the",
          "Come during the night. Take boat ride and tip girl to sing for you. Wouldn't stay here for more than one night unless you are into historical details. Rest are mostly restaurants and gift shops",
          "Ancient white houses, red lamps, surrounded by canals that running through each other, with little bridges over it. A water town that blends together history, culture and nature in a soft mood of peace, a mood that no Venice can compare. To enjoy the most, take a boat tour, and",
          "This place is quite far from Shanghai center, need go by bus around one hour one way. Inside this town main attraction is just shopping for some Chinese traditional stuff and many places to eat of course. However it looks very peaceful and relax. Maybe even can call it little",
          "I have not done a lot of sightseeing in China but the character of this ancient town is really great. If you are in Shanghai it is certainly worth the visit and I am probably being a bit harsh trying to compare to Venice.",
          "A place too see The old historical town Half of the town is under water Boats are the main source of travel from one home to another The markets The lanes The temple All carrys history with beauty",
          "There is a Chinese saying - small bridge, flowing river, families. This is a perfect description of this water town. Yes, the place has become commercialised. It would do better with less shops and less restaurants. But, overall, it continues to retain most of its water town",
          "Zhouzhuang Water Town is more than 900 years old, and is probably the most interesting water town near Shanghai. From the first step I'm almost intoxicated with it's unique atmosphere. You'll find 14 bridges build in the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. Fu'an Bridge and Double",
          "First of all, there are thousands of water towns in this part of China, if not tens of thousands. Most of them are by and large generic. Zhouzhuang is definitely one of the bigger and more famous few. I'd say it is only worth visiting during night or early morning to explore",
          "Taken there by our friend Visited the old houses Had lunch at a local restaurant - had local speciality Snails from the canal Pig hooves Fish from the canal which owner of the restaurant obtained live from local market then steamed for us All a first for us -treated with",
          "The water village is beautiful. It is a very nice experience. It'll be much better if you go with a good tour guide, because there are many details to know that can boost your experience if the story is correctly told. Do take the \"boat\" ride. The bad part of the story is that",
          "We were the in July and it was sweltering. There's a lot of shade in the old buildings and in the narrow sidewalk spaces between the buildings in the old town, but the heat was still stifling. Look for a restaurant with air conditioning if you're there during the summer. Also,",
          "Zhouzhuang is considered as #1 ancient water town in China and they are tourist-friendly. You can easily get here by taking a bus ride from Suzhou (30 km) or from Shanghai (100 km) and it is recommended that you stay overnight at least one night. If you want to take it slow and",
          "A good place to go for water town experience unique to this region of China (Jiangnan). Town is like more than 900 years old. Many of the buildings would have gone through some restoration, but it is nice to see it first hand vs on photos. Alleys are narrow which is typical of",
          "To be brief, get a gondola, pay for a song, enjoy the heck out of the trip around the canal. Avoid the crowded alleyways filled with knock-off souvenir shops and low quality restaurants.",
          "Very peaceful, the shop owners weren't pushy and the Chinese gondola ride was great, for 20rmb the lady steering will sing Chinese songs as you ride along the waterways",
          "This was a very interesting spot to visit, but too crowded to appreciate properly. There is a large tourist infrastructure built into and around the historical town, which is fairly distracting from all the history. The history, however, is very interesting. Recommend going",
          "Quaint shops, not pushy. Gondola ride similar to Venice but much more peaceful. The town was very old and very clean. The waterway was also clean.",
          "A very nice place to visit and spend a lot of time to see everything good. We had limited time and that was a great pity. It has great views and old buildings. A place you should not miss during your stay",
          "Did this as a cheap local bus tour from Shanghai including night cultural performance - EXCELLENT! (near new memorial archway) Whilst the larger boat on lake from bus into river town is not a great point, just exploring the village area, seeing the Zhang residence and the",
          "We walked around the ancient water town among the tree lined banks and the shops, very relaxing and quiet. Shops and road side eateries are clean and serene. Took the gondola for a short ride and the boat lady sang local serenades. It was wonderful, Marco Polo must have had a",
          "We stayed at the Fairmont YangCheng Lake which is less than an hour's drive by taxi to ZhouZhuang. For the visit, it woud be worth taking the boat ride as it offers a different view compared to walking. Be prepared to spend about 2 hours at Zhouzhuang as the walkabout is a",
          "This is an interesting town to visit and highly recommended. It's touted as The Venice of China or shall I say, Oriental Venice. There are some interesting locations within the town to note (with historical significance). It's interesting to note how people live in the town and",
          "I think all the negative points highlighted by others already are pretty accurate. However since I didn't have any expectations and has not read any reviews before visiting I enjoyed the day as it was away from the busy shanghai city. The reason I did not read a review was - I",
          "Zhouzhuang is very beautiful and people are very friendly. Visiting the Shen's residence is an eye opening experience. We have lunch at a restaurant along the riverside, food is nice and the grandma tea is good!! The ancient town water lane boat is also a great thing to do in",

          "This town is a must see. The canals and boats are very romantic. Many small restaurants and shops line the walkways making easy to shop and grab a bite to eat. Many small hotels provide opportunity to spend the night. I recommend to come early in the morning when the crowds",
          "This is a nice quaint little water town on a lake about 90 minute drive from Shanghai. Has about half day worth of activity, though we missed out staying for the evening lights (which are supposedly more inviting/exciting). Do get a ride in the covered row boat and have the lady",
          "Well kept water town. Architecture of the ancient dynasty well-preserved. Visitors are able to take many photoshoots like those in the movies of ancient times!! At a 100RMB entrance fee, it is worth it as you can enter again the water town within 3 days.",
          "A marvellously well preserved water town. Superb views and sights showing how am ancient Chinese town would be organised. Entry fee is good value for Western visitors. We spent so entire day here and didn't see everything.",
          "I went to Zhouzhuang with a friend who spoke Mandrin so things were a lot easier or I think it would have been a problem. We took the bus from Shanghai to there at only 29 RMB per person. The bus was taken from Shanghai South Bus Station (there are fixed no of buses) so you can",
          "The entrance fee is expensive and not worth the price,( i heard from the locals- there's free entry place from the back and you don't have to pay at all ) generally, there's nothing much to see, the food doesn't smell good or taste good to be honest. I recommend going to zhu",
          "it's like an old Chinese town in the movies and worth to see it. it's quite touristic and and it can be very crowded because it's also popular for Chinese.",
          "My husband and I visited Zhouzhuang during our honeymoon - it makes a beautiful day trip. I have previously been to TongLi which (I stand to be corrected) is a shorter bus ride from Shanghai. Both have similar gorgeous scenery that very well portrays an Oriental water town.",
          "What a great place to visit. It was a great area to see the water town, with the gondola style boats rowing by. Then to see the residents washing their clothes in the river. It was filled with alley ways with many little stores. then walking through another section which had",

          "There is a saying that this is the first ancient water town in China. This water town is very small, about the size of 1 football field. 1 main canal with 2 main streets with shops. Half day visit is more than enough, it is nothing much to see, a few highlight like the Twin",
          "A brilliant place to visit. It is about 90 minute drive from Shanghai City, but well worth it. The town is surrounded by water canals. A visit at night would be best due to all the lights. Shops galore. A great selection of wares to browse and plenty of Cafes to suit your",
          "After touring in Beijing and Shanghai I took a day tour to Zhouzhuang to see the water town. It's really a breathe of fresh air. The old town, although a tad bit touristy, still reflects how the old water towns operate. Lots of narrows alleys, brick bridges, and traditional",
          "Despite the crowds, I loved this water town. The boat ride was fantastic, as was the lady who \"drove\" the boat and serenaded us. Had some fun bartering with the locals. We got hopelessly lost trying to find our meeting point so ended up going all over the town and got to see it",
          "Way too commercial you hardly see the water ways & it's just full of tacky shops... Go to Jinix town instead for a more real authentic water town.",

          "The so-called old town is like a poorly maintained theme park with random shops selling low-quality souvenir. Entering the old town costs 100rmb. The boat trip costs another 120. The boat woman insisted on singing (we didn't want it) and kept asking for tips. Complete waste of",

          "Perfect place to slow down a bit and enjoy this old town. It's fun to wander around the narrow streets, poke your head into various shops that sell pig feet (it is very tasty and definitely should try one), liquor, and local snacks and have a meal at one of the many river side",
          "It takes about 1.5 to 2 hrs drive to this water town in Kunshan from Shanghai. I reserved a cab for a day and cost was RMB600, considering the long ride going to Zhouzhuang and back to Shanghai at night, it's really a good deal. Simply looking at the picture you already know",
          "Compared to Xitang,this town is small and more traditional. The ticket includes entrances to various local places or buildings of interest. It looks older and less touristy, but it is as it is. Gives you a more realistic feel of how people used to live in the area. The two",

          "We spent 4 days in Shanghai prior to embarking on a cruise to several places in Asia. Chose to take a tour of this water town to get a bit outside of the city centre. We took a boat ride along the waters which was quaint. We were a group of 8. There were some great photo ops.",
          "I've always been fascinated with these water towns. Zhouzhuang is gorgeous. I visited in August and travelled from Shanghai. That day, typhoon landed in Shanghai. The city was flooded and flights out of Shanghai were delayed. But the rain was a blessing. The unrelenting rain",
          "It is not around the corner from Shanghai. about 90 minute or more car ride so you expect to have something worth while. In the end we could have skipped visiting this place since it is OK but not worth the time it took to get there. Nice to walk around but as a tourist",
          "It took us two hours to reach the place by car from Shanghai. We took an official English speaking guide and he was excellent. From the parking we took the boat directly to the old city. We really enjoyed walking by the canals and in the small streets. In August it was a little",
          "We had the good fortune to visit ZhouZhuang Water Park with some Chinese friends who arranged an English speaking tour guide for us. It made a big difference as we gained a far greater appreciation of the history and significance of different places. It was school holidays and",

          "\"Really beautiful!!\" was my first impression when I got to Zhouzhang. It was even more beautiful than the photo I have seen on Internet before arriving here. Only one thing that I cannot support: too many peoples. From Shanghai, I took metro line 3 to Caoxi Road station, then",
          "I visited a few years back and fell in love with this enigmatic and awe inspiring water towship in Kunshan City. The well preserved ancient houses and the exqusite water ways were picture perfect. Some refer to this township as the Venice of the East but it has its own",
          "Have been here more than once as it isn't too far from where I am currently living. It is nice to see the water town both at night and during the day. There are plenty of places to eat along the canal. Also, I recommend taking a boat ride which costs 120 RMB for the boat. You",
          "I recommend to visit this \"Water Town\" if you are in Shanghai. And do take a trip in a gondol. We had a woman as gondolier. We asked her to sing, and she did! We were lucky to spend the day there without big crowds, and we enjoyed the town with all the bridges and small stores",
          "We rented a car plus a driver from Shanghai because it is apparently a hassle to get here by public transport. The drive was about 2 hours one way. The place is really quiet on a weekeday, and you will be given full attention by the local storekeepers. Not barrier free and there",
          "We took a day trip to Zhouzhuang Water Town during a recent visit to Shanghai. It was nice to get out of the city and see some of the countryside. We were part of a small tour (only five of us) so there was no big bus full of people to deal with. Upon arrival at Zhouzhuang,",
          "I went with group tour ,It was very interesting ,boating in the canal. It is one of the most famous water townships in China, the well preserved ancient residential houses and the elegant watery views. It has been called the \"Venice of the East.",
          "I had planned this tour because I thought I would get to see some authentic towns outside of the city. While the tour itself was great, and the village beautiful, I was dissapointed that it was geared for mainly tourists.",
          "Wuzhen is still the better managed and maintained water town. Zhouzhuang is okay, but as there are fast-riding and honking scooters nearly everywhere in the small alleys it is not really place to relax. Also it is way to commercial. If I want Starbucks and honking scooter driver",
          "The whole place is like a mini village. Many oriental shops and good food. There is this weird house that must visit. There is an admission fee to the house. It was really fun in there, a room that the moment you stepped in you feel like you are on a ship. It was 4 degrees",
          "2.5 hours bus ride from hangzhou, might not go here if it weren't part of our tour itinerary. But definitely happy that we did. The main area of the water town is big, with a lots of nooks and crannies to explore. Many wonderful shops, we could easily spent a say browsing",
          "Beautiful to see. A miniature venice. It was very crowded so made the visit less enjoyable. It is quite a distance from the city so will take up most of your day.",
          "This would have been a lovely thing to do if there were not so many tourists. This place is totally commercialized. You pay 120 yuan to get in and though the alley ways are scenic, there are thousands of vendors trying to sell you stuff. We took the gondola boats for an",
          "We took the Shanghai Tourism Bus. You need to go to Shanghai Indoor Stadium (Line 1 Red and Line 4 Purple) . Once you reach Shanghai Indoor Stadium go to Exit 6 to Caoxi walk across the road, and go left where you can see all the buses. Walk further down to look for Shanghai",
          "Marco Polo commented on this town. It is a great place to visit \"Old China\". Take a canal boat and see it from the water and then retrace your route by land. Local sweets are delicious!",
          "The water town itself is fine and a nice place to spend a few hours. But be warned, it took 2 1/2 by car to get there and 3 1/4 return to Shanghai. Not so much fun with two children. If you are prepared for the travel time then you might enjoy it more. You can stay in small",
          "This place is quite well organized with a nice entrance to the water village. In this water village, there are two ancient houses to visit. They are quite typical of old houses in china with many so called \" halls\" to receive guests. The furniture are unique to the specific",
          "This lovely water village is steeped in history. Starting with the museum house of a millionaire Chinese merchant in the Ming Dynasty, to the lively bridges and boat ride down the canals. Make sure you have time to explore as well as shop!",
          "Unfortunately it was heavily raining when we arrived. Hardly able to walk with umbrella and a little kid, crossing bridges over the water canals with wet floors. Very beautiful views also if you ride a boat. Rain stopped us.",
          "I really enjoyed walking around all the alleys of Zhouzhuang. It is very quaint and peaceful. I was here in March, and am sure it is VERY crowded at other times of the year. It was not too crowded when I visited. The Shen's house (I believe) had spectacular wall murals on what I",

          "My wife, two daughters and I had a wonderful time at Zhouzhuang water town which is about 1.5 hours drive from the Xintiandi area of Shanghai. It was well worth the travelling time as we had a very relaxing walk around the town taking photos and exploring the various shops",
          "You should know that we visited Zhouzhuang over the New Year which I suspect is the worst possible time of year to visit. The streets were jammed with tourists, we were pushed over bridges in a moving mass of people, it was completely overwhelming. The town is geared for",
          "I'm writing this as a public service to others. This town is in the middle of a rather inaccessible area and hence requires much effort to reach. It would have been perfectly fine if it had lived up to its name as Venice of the east. There is also an entrance fee of 100RMB.",
          "A car ride will take around an hour and a half to two hours from Shanghai, depending on traffic conditions. Having braved the Sunday Traffic, we were pleasantly surprised to find fewer tourists than we had expected at Zhou Zhuang, which made our trip even more worthwhile.",
          "We had a great day wandering around this water town. Just before Chinese New Year, so it was very quiet, particularly in the morning. Great photos before people started turning up after 1-2pm, so it's worthwhile getting there early. Apparently there are 400 hotels in the",
          "Came really early in the morning before 10am! Lovely before the crowd build up. We were the first to ride the boat for the day! Pay an additional 220 for a longer boat ride to another temple.Enjoy it and money well spend. Did not eat at the water city as advise by my driver the",
          "Been there about 3 years ago with a family holiday, it was approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes driving distance from the center of Shanghai, with regular traffic. I really loved it because of its typical Chinese style with all the houses and its water canal cross the whole",
          "Zhouzhuang is the oldest among all the other watertowns. Admission fee is required and the staff will snap your photo and print it on the ticket before you could cross the main entrance. This ticket will allow you to visit those places of interest within the watertown. Take",
          "Definitely more touristy, but that includes folks making their crafts right there -- you get to see horn carving, loom, spinning, roof ceramic making, little animals from reeds, etc. That part was great.",
          "This beautiful watertown. It feels a world away from the big city. Granted we were there on a very quiet, cool day in January, but it is an absolute delight! A photographers dream, of bridges, walk ways and a quieter life. The scenic town has an admission fee of 100 RMB, well",
          "close to either Shanghai or Suzhou, this is a good day trip. We went in late winter, so the flowers were not in bloom yet, but still a beautiful place. Being from the States, we hired a tour guide and it was worth it. The history is deep and helps to appreciate everything. I",
          "If in Shanghai, this is a detour worth making. This is a quite large water town (consider about 4 hours to go around and see all canals, including a boat ride). However, nobody speaks English as 99.99% of the tourists there are Chinese. Still, I rather enjoyed. I did not find",
          "We could only stay a couple of hours and were fortunate to be accompanied by 2 Chinese friends. It was an amazing experiance. I wish we could have spent longer. If I could give any advise though it would be don't get caught short, make sure you use your hotel toilet facilities",
          "Locals call this place as \"ancient\" water town, based upon that the oldest relics of this establishment are allocated latest around 900 years after the birth of Jesus Christ. Internationally speaking this is not Antiquity. The place -from my point of view- should be looked at as",
          "We stayed in town in a condo for a few days. Its a great visit because it has the whole \"water town\" area where you do have to pay a fee to enter but there is not fee just to be in the town. You get to see a really really old style homes on the beauty of the canals (in fee area)",
          "Really enjoyed our day here, but an hour ride from Suzhou and back again. Plus a 100RMB entrance fee into the main tourist area. Cute, but not overwhelming. and unless you have a lot of time, not really worth the time and money. Everyone will sell you everything and anything.",
          "Taken here by local host to show me something of \"China History\". Include the boat trip if you get the choice, gives a different perspective. Take a guide if you can, I learned a lot from mine, which would have been missed completely had I relied on the English translations",
          "I wanted to see Zhouzhuang without the crowds. I got there 9:30 AM. The place was empty, Got lots of good pictures with the morning mist rising from the canel. There are a number of interesting historical buildings but limited English signage. You need to do some reading",
          "We went there with a guided tour. Very interesting. Old houses near the canals. We also made a canal tour at night.",
          "Definitely not worth the time and money. Took a mini-bus from Shanghai Tourist Bus Station and paid CNY150, including return bus ticket and entrance fee. The bus took us to a ferry terminal to take a ferry to the water town. Need to pay another CNY50 for the ferry ticket. This",
          "Zhouzhuang dates back more than 900 years. It\u2019s a good hour and a half drive out of Shanghai; the drive was enjoyable, once out of the city you go through the rice fields and smaller towns (we did this as a small group tour which we organised through our hotel). The village",
          "My second visit to a river town. This is a very famous one close to Shanghai. It is very commercial though. I enjoyed the city but there are a lot of shops. Cost was only about $100RMB so not too pricey. The visitors center is quite a walk from the entrance. We ate lunch",
          "My counterpart suggested me to visit Zhou Zhuang during my business trip to Kunshan area. It is worth the visit. the entrance fee is 100RMB per person, but you can really experience and feel the atmosphere of china in old time, i.e old narrow street, bridges, rivers, old",
          "Zhouzhuang, so call number one water town in China. The town was just 1 hour drive from Suzhou and 2 hours drive from Shanghai, we just grab a taxi from Suzhou which cost 120CNY one way direct to Zhouzhuang entrance. The entrance fee is quite expensive 100CNY per person, but is",
          "Buildings and traditions here are well preserved. At the entrance you can get a wheelchair for the elderly if you need one, just need to pay a deposit of \u00a5500, full refund upon returning the wheelchair. This is the place where lots of movies were filmed at. The streets are clean",
          "An old medieval commercial town in a lake, narrow pedestrian roads, small boats and many, many shops and restaurants, like it may have been hundreds of years ago already. Now there hangs still the atmosphere of that time in the narrow paths between the houses, but it is a modern",

          "We had an interesting day, first the drive there..quite a contrast to Shanghai, seeing the countryside was a reminder that the cities aren't necessarily the real China! Sampled the pigs knuckle. Interesting local delicacy. Enjoyed the craft shops. No pressure to buy but lots to",
          "My cousin told me this is a must to see outside of Shanghai and he was right. We hired a tour guide from our hotel who explained everything we saw. So helpful. Also be sure to take a boat ride. Our oarsman also serenaded us. So enjoyable.",
          "The town is nice, but it has a lot of tourists and is very commercialized. Souvenir shops an restaurants are on every corner. Here you can buy cheap souvenirs. I also went to the performance of Zhouzhuang all seasons. Performance was interesting and there are subtitles in order",
          "Make sure you stay there for a night or two. In the daytime head south to get away from the crowds, which dissipate after sunset, when you have much of it to yourself. Entry tickets are steep, but I believe there are a few holes in the perimeter to get in without ticket, and its",
          "The Zhouzhuang Water Town is a park. The entrance fee is not too great, but there is one. Inside it is a preserved, as opposed to restored, ancient town. A lot of interesting buildings to tour, shops of course and people still living in the area. From a historical aspect, it",
          "A great water town. Better than Zhujiajiao or nearby Tongli. We stayed the night (at Zhouzhuang Zhenfengxuan Inn) which was really nice as we could see the canals lit up. Got some great photos during our stay. It wasn't too busy despite us being there on the weekend, could be",

          "Visited this water town during one of our business trips to Shanghai. It was drizzling but comfortable to walk around and take in the sights and sounds. Extremely touristy, as if every sourvenir shops in China converged into this town to set up shops! Make sure to bargain as",
          "It may once have been the Venice of Asia, but now it is only a shallow tourist attraction, but as such it was still fun too see. It is souvenir shop upon souvenir shop along the water, but it still gave an impression of what it once was when we sailed there. There are some",
          "The town was very quiet and not many ppl when I was there in March 2014. A lot of stuffs were overpriced and basically we need to bargain as they marked up probably more than half of the original price.. The town is nice but just that too commercialized for me",
          "We spent 3 nights inside the water town gates. The day trips to Zhouzhuang seem to cease about 5PM (we were there in November) and most businesses with-in close early, too. Restaurants are open later. Take a boat trip (think gondola if you were in Venice) for about $17.00 US",
          "Visiting in the middle of winter (feb 2014), we found zhouzhuang to be almost deserted. The shopkeepers were very aggressive in trying to sell their goods, and this more than anything spoilt the experience for us. There are much more pleasant water towns close to shanghai; do",
          "I'm sure this town was beautiful before it was turned into a huge tourist trap. Many of the original buildings are still here - some are obscured by souvenir shops. I should have done my own research instead of listening to the guide. If you know what you're getting into, and",
          "Frankly speaking, Zhouguang failed to impress me with its proud reputation of \"CNN ranked top 10 water towns around the world\" and something like \"the best watertown in China\". Maybe it's a good place to go for those who travels to China and such ancient towns for the first",

          "We booked an afternoon tour to Zhouzhuang Water Town with the Shanghai Railway International Travel (booked with Mrs Gou who spoke English and was very helpful ). We chose Zhouzhuang as it was closer to Suzhou and Shanghai while Wuzhen was nearer to Hangzhou which we visited",
          "It's not the biggest water town (apparently) but otherwise a good example and certainly closer to Shanghai than the Wuzhen one which I hear is nicer and bigger. It's very touristy but if you look beyond that, close out the others in the crowd it is a great few hours to spend",
          "Once you set foot in the ancient water town of Zhouzhuang, it's easy to understand why it is one of the most popular water towns near Shanghai. Narrow lanes along ribbons of canals hold endless variety of shops, food stalls, coffee houses, restaurants. The locals are friendly",

          "We went as part of a day trip from Shanghai booked \"via\" a \"tour\" company (clue in the name). There are obviously tourist prices and tour company prices - I might have hesitated had I been invited to pay the costs on the booth windows. Worth a visit - if only to watch hordes",
          "This ancient town is about an hour from the center of Shanghai by taxi and offers a glimpse into the past (and perhaps into life outside of the big cities of China). We enjoyed a relaxing stroll along the shop lined waterways and then had a nice lunch on the water. Lots of",

          "We went to Zhouzhuang a few days ago and thought that it was quite nice. A few things to note: --It takes about 2 hours to drive there from Shanghai. If you are short on time, Zhujiajiao or Xitang (where part of MI 3 was filmed) are also nice and can be visited more quickly",
          "On this trip to China we decided to visit Zhouzhiang watertown and we loved it The entrance price was a bit much we thought (100 RMB per person). But what you get for that is quite a large town, well kept and clean. Shops and places to eat everywhere. We recommend you come",
          "Friends and relatives have been telling us to visit this place so finally, we took a private tour to Zhou Zhuang from Shanghai, considered as China's number 1 water village and also \"Venice of China\". Very beautiful and reminds us a lot of Lijiang, another beautiful place in",

        "wiki": "The China\u2013Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park (simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u2014\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u82cf\u5dde\u5de5\u4e1a\u56ed\u533a; traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u570b\u2014\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u8607\u5dde\u5de5\u696d\u5712\u5340; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\u2014X\u012bnji\u0101p\u014d S\u016bzh\u014du G\u014dngy\u00e8 Yu\u00e1n Q\u016b), or Suzhou Industrial Park for short, abbreviated as SIP, is a county-level administrative area located in Suzhou, Jiangsu with a little Singaporean influence.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 1992, the idea of developing a modern industrial township with Singapore experience was broached. During his tour of southern China that year, China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping said: \"Singapore enjoys good social order and is well managed. We should tap on their experience, and learn how to manage better than them.\"\nAfter rounds of discussions and site surveys, both governments decided to join hands in developing a modern industrial park in the east of Suzhou. The China\u2013Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park (CS-SIP) was thus born on February 26, 1994 when Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew signed the Agreement on the Joint Development of Suzhou Industrial Park in Suzhou.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSIP has a total jurisdiction area of 288 km2, of which, the China-Singapore cooperation area covers 80 km2 with a planned residential population of 1.2 million. The China-Singapore Joint Steering Council led by Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi and Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng will hold meeting every year to give directions for the development of SIP.Jinji Lake (literally Golden Rooster Lake) is a small fresh water lake located in the central part of Suzhou Industrial Park. It occupies an area of 7.18 square kilometres and its average depth is about 2.5 to 3 metres. There are two man-made islands in the lake.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nReports surfaced in 2019 that the park was being affected by the US-China trade war, with exports having declined 10 per cent over the first seven months of 2019 when compared to 2018 figures, while imports have fallen 15 per cent over the same period. \n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and higher education ===\n\nThere is Suzhou Dushu Lake Higher Education Town, one of the government's key projects. Located east of Dushu Lake, it has a total area of 25 km2, and expects to have around 400,000 people by 2016, 100,000 of whom will be students. Its goal is to offer good education, advanced technology, and a pleasant living environment. The area is home to many universities (undergraduate as well as graduate schools) including local Chinese universities and universities from other countries. This community focuses on producing educated and creative people. The area offers facilities including libraries, entertainment venues, parks, a sports centre and accommodation. Wenxing Plaza and Hanlin Plaza are popular locations of many small restaurants and shops. Dushu Lake Library is an experimental library of the National Digital Library. Major universities include Suzhou University, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and Renmin University of China, Suzhou Campus.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe SIP ran into trouble when local officials began building Suzhou New District (SND) industrial park to compete with it. As the Suzhou city government had only a minority 35 percent stake in the SIP, while they had a major stake in SND, the city government largely ignored SIP and concentrated on promoting the SND instead.\nThe project was supposed to transfer Singapore's management skills to Chinese bureaucrats and to teach China how to build and run \"business-friendly\" commercial parks. But it ended up straining the close relations between Singapore and China and bringing home to Singaporeans the often unpredictable, and sometimes underhand, business culture of the Communist mainland.Singapore's senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew conceded that the project had not turned out as planned and had made him more cautious about investments in China. He pointed to the difficulties that arose in signing agreements with the central government that were then implemented by local officials who \"have their own imperatives\".After incurring losses of some US$90 million over 5 years, the Singapore consortium lowered its stake to 35 percent, raising the Chinese consortium's stake to 65 percent from 35 percent and reducing the Singaporean share from a planned 70 km2 to just 8 km2.  The Chinese side appointed Wang Jinhua, vice-mayor of Suzhou and the former manager of the New District, as the new chief executive.\nIn 2001, one year after Singapore lowered its stake, the park made its first profit of $3.8 million.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nJinji Lake\nDushu Lake\nGate to the East\nSuzhou Ferris Wheel\nSuzhou Industrial Park Railway Station\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSuzhou Industrial Park Webpage",

        "wiki": "The Chinese garden is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the Chinese emperors and members of the imperial family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world. They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature.A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, rock works, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe earliest recorded Chinese gardens were created in the valley of the Yellow River, during the Shang Dynasty (1600\u20131046 BC). These gardens were large enclosed parks where the kings and nobles hunted game, or where fruit and vegetables were grown.\nEarly inscriptions from this period, carved on tortoise shells, have three Chinese characters for garden, you, pu and yuan. You was a royal garden where birds and animals were kept, while pu was a garden for plants. During the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC), yuan became the character for all gardens. The old character for yuan is a small picture of a garden; it is enclosed in a square which can represent a wall, and has symbols which can represent the plan of a structure, a small square which can represent a pond, and a symbol for a plantation or a pomegranate tree.A famous royal garden of the late Shang dynasty was the Terrace, Pond and Park of the Spirit (Lingtai, Lingzhao Lingyou) built by King Wenwang west of his capital city, Yin. The park was described in the Classic of Poetry this way:\n\nThe King makes his promenade in the Park of the Spirit,\nThe deer are kneeling on the grass, feeding their fawns,\nThe deer are beautiful and resplendent.\nThe immaculate cranes have plumes of a brilliant white.\nThe King makes his promenade to the Pond of the Spirit,\nThe water is full of fish, who wriggle.Another early royal garden was Shaqui, or the Dunes of Sand, built by the last Shang ruler, King Zhou (1075\u20131046 BC). It was composed of an earth terrace, or tai, which served as an observation platform in the center of a large square park. It was described in one of the early classics of Chinese literature, the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji).According to the Shiji, one of the most famous features of this garden was the Wine Pool and Meat Forest (\u9152\u6c60\u8089\u6797). A large pool, big enough for several small boats, was constructed on the palace grounds, with inner linings of polished oval shaped stones from the sea shores. The pool was then filled with wine. A small island was constructed in the middle of the pool, where trees were planted, which had skewers of roasted meat hanging from their branches. King Zhou and his friends and concubines drifted in their boats, drinking the wine with their hands and eating the roasted meat from the trees. Later Chinese philosophers and historians cited this garden as an example of decadence and bad taste.During the Spring and Autumn period (722\u2013481 BC), in 535 BC, the Terrace of Shanghua, with lavishly decorated palaces, was built by King Jing of the Zhou dynasty. In 505 BC, an even more elaborate garden, the Terrace of Gusu, was begun. It was located on the side of a mountain, and included a series of terraces connected by galleries, along with a lake where boats in the form of blue dragons navigated. From the highest terrace, a view extended as far as Lake Tai, the Great Lake.\n\n\n=== The Legend of the Isle of the Immortals ===\n\nAn ancient Chinese legend played an important part in early garden design. In the 4th century BC, a tale in the Classic of Mountains and Seas described a peak called Mount Penglai located on one of three islands at the eastern end of the Bohai Sea, between China and Korea, which was the home of the Eight Immortals. On this island were palaces of gold and silver, with jewels on the trees. There was no pain, no winter, wine glasses and rice bowls were always full, and fruits, when eaten, granted eternal life.\nIn 221 BC, Ying Zheng, the King of Qin conquered other rival states and unified China under the Qin Empire, which he ruled until 210 BC. He heard the legend of the islands and sent emissaries to find the islands and bring back the elixir of immortal life, without success. At his palace near his capital, Xianyang, he created a garden with a large lake called Lanchi gong or the Lake of the Orchids. On an island in the lake he created a replica of Mount Penglai, symbolizing his search for paradise. After his death, the Qin Empire fell in 206 BC and his capital city and garden were completely destroyed, but the legend continued to inspire Chinese gardens. Many gardens have a group of islands or a single island with an artificial mountain representing the island of the Eight Immortals.\n\n\n=== Han dynasty (206 BC\u2013220 AD) ===\nUnder the Han dynasty (206 BC \u2013 220 AD), a new imperial capital was built at Chang'an, and Emperor Wu built a new imperial garden, which combined the features of botanical and zoological gardens, as well as the traditional hunting grounds.  Inspired by another version of Chinese classic about the Isles of the Immortals, called Liezi, he created a large artificial lake, the Lake of the Supreme Essence, with three artificial islands in the center representing the three isles of the Immortals. The park was later destroyed, but its memory would continue to inspire Chinese garden design for centuries.\nAnother notable garden of the Han period was the Garden of General Liang Ji built under Emperor Shun (125\u2013144 AD). Using a fortune amassed during his twenty years in the imperial court, Liang Ji build an immense landscape garden with artificial mountains, ravines and forests, filled with rare birds and domesticated wild animals. This was one of the first gardens that tried to create an idealized copy of nature.\n\n\n=== Gardens for poets and scholars (221\u2013618 AD) ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Han dynasty, a long period of political instability began in China. Buddhism was introduced into China by Emperor Ming (57\u201375 AD), and spread rapidly. By 495, the city of Luoyang, capital of the Northern Wei dynasty, had over 1,300 temples, mostly in the former residences of believers. Each of the temples had its own small garden.During this period, many former government officials left the court and built gardens where they could escape the outside world and concentrate on nature and literature. One example was the Jingu Yuan, or Garden of the Golden Valley, built by Shi Chong (249\u2013300 AD), an aristocrat and former court official, who in 296 completed a garden ten kilometers northeast of Luoyang. He invited thirty famous poets to a banquet in his garden, and wrote about the event himself:\n\nI have a country house at the torrent of the Golden Valley...where there is a spring of pure water, a luxuriant woods,  fruit trees, bambo, cypress, and medicinal plants. There are fields, two hundred sheep, chickens, pigs, geese and ducks...There is also a water mill, a fish pond, caves, and everything to distract the look and please the heart....With my literary friends, we took walks day and night, feasted, climbed a mountain to view the scenery, and sat by the side of the stream.\nThis visit to the garden resulted in a famous collection of poems, Jingu Shi, or Poems of the Golden Valley, and launched a long tradition of writing poetry in and about gardens.The poet and calligrapher Wang Xizhi (307\u2013365) wrote in his excellent calligraphy the Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion introducing a book recording the event of the Orchid Pavilion Gathering, another famous poetry setting at a country retreat called the \"Orchid Pavilion\". This was a park with a meandering stream. He brought together a group of famous poets, and seated them beside the stream. Then he placed cups of wine in the stream, and let them float. If the cup stopped beside one of the poets, he was obliged to drink it and then compose a poem. The garden of the floating cup (liubei tang), with small pavilions and artificial winding streams, became extremely popular in both imperial and private gardens.The Orchid Pavilion inspired Emperor Yang (604\u2013617) of the Sui dynasty to build his new imperial garden, the Garden of the West, near Hangzhou. His garden had a meandering stream for floating glasses of wine and pavilions for writing poetry. He also used the park for theatrical events; he launched small boats on his stream with animated figures illustrating the history of China.\n\n\n=== Tang dynasty (618\u2013907), First Golden Age of the Classical Garden ===\nThe Tang dynasty (618\u2013907 AD) was considered the first golden age of the classical Chinese garden. Emperor Xuanzong built a magnificent imperial garden, the Garden of the Majestic Clear Lake, near Xi\u2032an, and lived there with his famous concubine, Consort Yang.Painting and poetry reached a level never seen before, and new gardens, large and small, filled the capital city, Chang'an. The new gardens, were inspired by classical legends and poems. There were shanchi yuan,  gardens with artificial mountains and ponds, inspired by the legend of the isles of immortals, and shanting yuan, gardens with replicas of mountains and small viewing houses, or pavilions. Even ordinary residences had tiny gardens in their courtyards, with terracotta mountains and small ponds.These Chinese classical gardens, or scholar's gardens (wenren yuan), were inspired by, and in turn inspired, classical Chinese poetry and painting. A notable example was the Jante Valley Garden of the poet-painter and civil servant Wang Wei (701\u2013761). He bought the ruined villa of a poet, located near the mouth of a river and a lake. He created twenty small landscape scenes within his garden, with names such as the Garden of Magnolias, the Waving Willows, the Kiosk in the Heart of the Bamboos, the Spring of the Golden Powder, and the View-House beside the Lake. He wrote a poem for each scene in the garden and commissioned a famous artist, to paint scenes of the garden on the walls of his villa. After retiring from the government, he passed his time taking boat trips on the lake, playing the cithare and writing and reciting poetry.During the Tang dynasty, plant cultivation was developed to an advanced level, with many plant species being grown by means of plant introduction, domestication, transplantation, and grafting. The aesthetic properties of plants were highlighted, while numerous books on plant classification and cultivation were published. The capital, Chang'an, was a very cosmopolitan city, filled with diplomats, merchants, pilgrims, monks and students, who carried descriptions of the gardens all over Asia. The economic prosperity of the Tang dynasty led to the increasing construction of classical gardens across all of China.\nThe last great garden of the Tang dynasty was the Hamlet of the Mountain of the Serene Spring (Pingquan Shanzhuang), built east of the city of Luoyang by Li Deyu, Grand Minister of the Tang Empire. The garden was vast, with over a hundred pavilions and structures, but it was most famous for its collection of exotic-shaped rocks and plants, which he collected all over China. Rocks of unusual shapes, known as Chinese Scholars' Rocks, often selected to portray the part of a mountain or mountain range in a garden scene, gradually became an essential feature of the Chinese garden.\n\n\n=== Song Dynasty (960\u20131279) ===\n\nThere were two periods of the Song dynasty, northern and southern, and both were known for the construction of famous gardens. Emperor Huizong (1082\u20131135) was an accomplished painter of birds and flowers. A scholar himself, he integrated elements of the scholar garden into his grand imperial garden. His first garden, called The Basin of the Clarity of Gold, was an artificial lake surrounded by terraces and pavilions. The public was invited into the garden in the spring for boat races and spectacles on the lake. In 1117 he personally supervised the building of a new garden. He had exotic plants and picturesque rocks brought from around China for his garden, particularly the prized rocks from Lake Tai. Some of the rocks were so large that, in order to move them by water on the grand canal, he had to destroy all the bridges between Hangzhou and Beijing. In the center of his garden he had constructed an artificial mountain a hundred meters high, with cliffs and ravines, which he named Genyue, or \"The Mountain of Stability.\"  The garden was finished in 1122. In 1127, Emperor Huizong was forced to flee from the Song capital, Kaifeng, when it came under attack by the armies of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. When he returned (as a captive of the Jurchens), he found his garden completely destroyed, all the pavilions burned and the art works looted. Only the mountain remained.\n\nWhile the imperial gardens were the best known, many smaller but equally picturesque gardens were built in cities such as Luoyang. The Garden of the Monastery of the Celestial Rulers in Luoyang was famous for its peonies; the entire city came when they were in bloom. The Garden of Multiple Springtimes was famous for its view of the mountains. The most famous garden in Luoyang was The Garden of Solitary Joy (Dule Yuan), built by the poet and historian Sima Guang (1021\u20131086). His garden had an area of eight mu, or about 1.5 hectares. In the center was the Pavilion of Study, his library, with five thousand volumes. To the north was an artificial lake, with a small island, with a picturesque fisherman's hut. To the east was a garden of medicinal herbs, and to the west was an artificial mountain, with a belevedere at the summit to view the surrounding neighborhoods. Any passer-by could visit the garden by paying a small fee.\n\nAfter fall of Kaifeng, the capital of the Song dynasty was moved to Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou, Zhejiang). The city of Lin'an soon had more than fifty gardens built on the shore of the Western Lake. The other city in the province famous for its gardens was Suzhou, where many scholars, government officials and merchants built residences with gardens. Some of these gardens still exist today, though most been much altered over the centuries.\nThe oldest Suzhou garden that can be seen today is the Blue Wave Pavilion, built in 1044 by the Song dynasty poet Su Shunqing. (1008\u20131048). In the Song dynasty, it consisted of a hilltop viewing pavilion. Other lakeside pavilions were added, including a reverence hall, a recitation hall, and a special pavilion for watching the fish. Over the centuries it was much modified, but still keeps its essential plan.\nAnother Song dynasty garden still in existence is the Master of the Nets Garden in Suzhou. It was created in 1141 by Shi Zhengzhi, Deputy Civil Service Minister of the Southern Song government. It had his library, the Hall of Ten Thousand Volumes, and an adjacent garden called the Fisherman's Retreat. It was extensively remodeled between 1736 and 1796, but it remains one of the best example of a Song Dynasty Scholars Garden.In the city of Wuxi, on the edge of Lake Tai and at the foot of two mountains, there were thirty four gardens recorded by the Song dynasty historian Zhou Mi (1232\u20131308). The two most famous gardens, the Garden of the North (Beiyuan) and the Garden of the South (Nanyuan), both belonged to Shen Dehe, Grand Minister to Emperor Gaozong (1131\u20131162).  The Garden of the South was a classic mountain-and-lake (shanshui) garden; it had a lake with an Island of Immortality (Penglai dao), on which were three great boulders from Taihu. The Garden of the South was a water garden, with five large lakes connected to Lake Tai. A terrace gave visitors a view of the lake and the mountains.\n\n\n=== Yuan dynasty (1279\u20131368) ===\n\nIn 1271, Kublai Khan established the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty in China. By 1279, he annihilated the last resistance of the Song dynasty and unified China under Mongol rule. He established a new capital on the site of present-day Beijing, called Dadu, the Great Capital.\nThe most famous garden of the Yuan dynasty was Kublai Khan's summer palace and garden at Xanadu. The Venetian traveler Marco Polo is believed to have visited Xanadu in about 1275, and described the garden this way:\n\n\"Round this Palace a wall is built, inclosing a compass of 16 miles, and\ninside the Park there are fountains and rivers and brooks, and beautiful\nmeadows, with all kinds of wild animals (excluding such as are of\nferocious nature), which the Emperor has procured and placed there to\nsupply food for his gerfalcons and hawks, which he keeps there in mew. Of\nthese there are more than 200 gerfalcons alone, without reckoning the\nother hawks. The Khan himself goes every week to see his birds sitting in\nmew, and sometimes he rides through the park with a leopard behind him on\nhis horse's croup; and then if he sees any animal that takes his fancy, he\nslips his leopard at it, and the game when taken is made over to\n\nfeed the hawks in mew. This he does for diversion.\"\nThis brief description later inspired the poem Kubla Khan by the English romantic poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\nWhen he established his new capital at Dadu, Kublai Khan enlarged the artificial lakes that had been created a century earlier by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, and built up the island of Oinghua, creating a striking contrast between curving banks of the lake and garden and the strict geometry of what later became the Forbidden City of Beijing. This contrast is still visible today.Despite the Mongol invasion, the classical Chinese scholar's garden continued to flourish in other parts of China. An excellent example was the Lion Grove Garden in Suzhou. It was built in 1342, and took its name from the collection of fantastic and grotesque assemblies of rocks, taken from Lake Tai. Some of them were said to look like the heads of lions. The Kangxi and Qianlong emperors of the Qing dynasty each visited the garden several times, and used it as model for their own summer garden, the Garden of Perfect Splendor, at the Chengde Mountain Resort.In 1368, forces of the Ming dynasty, led by Zhu Yuanzhang, captured Dadu from the Mongols and overthrew the Yuan dynasty. Zhu Yuanzhang ordered the Yuan palaces in Dadu to be burned down.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\n\nThe most famous existing garden from the Ming dynasty is the Humble Administrator's Garden in Suzhou. It was built during the reign of the Zhengde Emperor (1506\u20131521) by Wang Xianchen, a minor government administrator who retired from government service and devoted himself to his garden. The garden has been much altered since it was built, but the central part has survived; a large pond full of lotus blossoms, surrounded by structures and pavilions designed as viewpoints of the lake and gardens. The park has an island, the Fragrant Isle, shaped like a boat. It also makes good use of the principle of the \"borrowed view,\" (jiejing) carefully framing views of the surrounding mountains and a famous view of a distant pagoda.Another existing garden from the Ming dynasty is the Lingering Garden, also in Suzhou, built during the reign of the Wanli Emperor (1573\u20131620). During the Qing dynasty, twelve tall limestone rocks were added to the garden, symbolizing mountains. The most famous was a picturesque rock called the Auspicious Cloud-Capped Peak, which became a centerpiece of the garden.A third renowned Ming era garden in Suzhou is the Garden of Cultivation, built during the reign of the Tianqi Emperor (1621\u201327) by the grandson of Wen Zhengming, a famous Ming painter and calligrapher. The garden is built around a pond, with the Longevity Pavilion on the north side, the Fry Pavilion on the east side, a dramatic rock garden on the south, and the creator's study, the Humble House, to the west.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912) ===\n\nThe Qing dynasty was the last dynasty of China. The most famous gardens in China during this period were the Summer Palace and the Old Summer Palace in Beijing. Both gardens became symbols of luxury and refinement, and were widely described by European visitors.\nFather Attiret, a French Jesuit who became court painter for the Qianlong Emperor from 1738 to 1768, described the Jade Terrace of the Isle of Immortality in the Lake of the Summer Palace:\n\n\"That which is a true jewel is a rock or island...which is in the middle of this lake, on which is built a small palace, which contains one hundred rooms or salons...of a beauty and a taste which I am not able to express to you. The view is admirable...\nTheir construction and improvement consumed a large part of the imperial treasury. Empress Dowager Cixi famously diverted money intended for the modernization of the Beiyang Fleet and used it to restore the Summer Palace and the marble teahouse in the shape of boat on Lake Kunming. Both the Summer Palace and Old Summer Palace were destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion and by punitive expeditions of European armies during the nineteenth century, but are now gradually being restored.\nIn addition to the Old Summer Palace and Summer Palace, between 1703 and 1792 the Qing emperors built a new complex of gardens and palaces in the mountains 200 kilometers northeast of Beijing, to escape the summer heat of the capital. It was called the Chengde Mountain Resort, and it occupied 560 hectares, with seventy-two separate landscape views, recreating landscapes in miniature from many different parts of China.  This enormous garden has survived relatively intact.\nRenowned scholar gardens which still exist from this period include the Couple's Retreat Garden (1723\u20131736) and the Retreat & Reflection Garden (1885), both in Suzhou.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Design of the classical garden ==\nA Chinese garden was not meant to be seen all at once; the plan of a classical Chinese garden presented the visitor with a series of perfectly composed and framed glimpses of scenery; a view of a pond, or of a rock, or a grove of bamboo, a blossoming tree, or a view of a distant mountain peak or a pagoda. The 16th-century Chinese writer and philosopher Ji Cheng instructed garden builders to \"hide the vulgar and the common as far as the eye can see, and include the excellent and the splendid.\"\n\nSome early Western visitors to the imperial Chinese gardens felt they were chaotic, crowded with buildings in different styles, without any seeming order. But the Jesuit priest Jean Denis Attiret, who lived in China from 1739 and was a court painter for the Qianlong Emperor, observed there was a \"beautiful disorder, an anti-symmetry\" in the Chinese garden. \"One admires the art with which this irregularity is carried out. Everything is in good taste, and so well arranged, that there is not a single view from which all the beauty can be seen;  you have to see it piece by piece.\"Chinese classical gardens varied greatly in size. The largest garden in Suzhou, the Humble Administrator's Garden, was a little over ten hectares in area, with one fifth of the garden occupied by the pond.  But they did not have to be large. Ji Cheng built a garden for Wu Youyu, the Treasurer of Jinling, that was just under one hectare in size, and the tour of the garden was only four hundred steps long from the entrance to the last viewing point, but Wu Youyu said it contained all the marvels of the province in a single place.The classical garden was surrounded by a wall, usually painted white, which served as a pure backdrop for the flowers and trees. A pond of water was usually located in the center. Many structures, large and small, were arranged around the pond. In the garden described by Ji Cheng above, the structures occupied two-thirds of the hectare, while the garden itself occupied the other third. In a scholar garden the central building was usually a library or study, connected by galleries with other pavilions which served as observation points of the garden features. These structures also helped divide the garden into individual scenes or landscapes. The other essential elements of a scholar garden were plants, trees, and rocks, all carefully composed into small perfect landscapes. Scholar gardens also often used what was called \"borrowed\" scenery (\u501f\u666f jiejing) ; where unexpected views of scenery outside the garden, such as mountain peaks, seemed to be an extension of the garden itself.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nChinese gardens are filled with architecture; halls, pavilions, temples, galleries, bridges, kiosks, and towers, occupying a large part of the space. The Humble Administrator's Garden in Suzhou has forty-eight structures, including a residence, several halls for family gatherings and entertainment, eighteen pavilions for viewing different features of the garden, and an assortment of towers, galleries, and bridges, all designed for seeing different parts of the gardens from different points of view. The garden structures are not designed to dominate the landscape, but to be in harmony with it.\nClassical gardens traditionally have these structures:\n\nThe ceremony hall  (ting), or \u201croom\u201d. A building used for family celebrations or ceremonies, usually with an interior courtyard, not far from the entrance gate.\nThe principal pavilion (da ting), or \u201clarge room\u201d, for the reception of guests, for banquets and for celebrating holidays, such as New Years and the Festival of Lanterns. It often has a veranda around the building to provide cool and shade.\nThe pavilion of flowers (hua ting), or \u201cflower room\u201d. Located near the residence, this building has a rear courtyard filled with flowers, plants, and a small rock garden.\nThe pavilion facing the four directions (si mian ting), or \u201cfour doors room\u201d. This building has folding or movable walls, for opening up a panoramic view of the garden.\nThe lotus pavilion (he hua ting), or \u201clotus room\u201d. Built next to a lotus pond, to see the flowers bloom and appreciate their aroma.\nThe pavilion of mandarin ducks (yuan yang ting), or \u201cmandarin ducks room\u201d. This building is divided into two sections;  one facing north used in summer, facing a lotus pond which provided cool air; and the southern part used in winter, with a courtyard planted with pine trees, which remained evergreen, and plum trees, whose blossoms announced the arrival of spring.In addition to these larger halls and pavilions, the garden is filled with smaller pavilions, (also called ting),or \u201croom\u201d, which are designed for providing shelter from the sun or rain, for contemplating a scene, reciting a poem, taking advantage of a breeze, or simply resting. Pavilions might be located where the dawn can best be watched, where the moonlight shines on the water, where autumn foliage is best seen, where the rain can best be heard on the banana leaves, or where the wind whistles through the bamboo stalks. They are sometimes attached to the wall of another building or sometimes stood by themselves at view points of the garden, by a pond or at the top of a hill. They often are open on three sides.\nThe names of the pavilions in Chinese gardens express the view or experience they offer the visitor:\n\nThe Peak-Worshipping Pavilion (The Lingering Garden) in Suzhou China\nThe Hall of Distant Fragrances (Humble Administrator's Garden) in Suzhou China\nThe Mountain View Tower (Humble Administrator's Garden) inn Suzhou China\nPavilion of the Moon and Wind (Master of the Nets Garden) in Suzhou China\nPavilion in the Lotus Breeze (Humble Administrator's Garden) in Suzhou China\nListening to the Rain Pavilion (Humble Administrator's Garden) in Suzhou China\nWatching the Pines and Appreciating Paintings Hall (Humble Administrator's Garden) in Suzhou China\nSpot of Return for Reading (Lingering Garden) in Suzhou China\nBetween the Mountains and the Water Pavilion (The Couple's Retreat Garden) in Suzhou China\nPavilion Leaning on the Jade (Humble Administrator's Garden) in Suzhou China\nSoft Rain Brings Coolness Terrace (Retreat & Reflection Garden) in Suzhou China\nLasting Spring and Moon Viewing Tower (Retreat & Reflection Garden) in Suzhou ChinaGardens also often feature two-story towers (lou or ge), usually at the edge of the garden, with a lower story made of stone and a whitewashed upper story, two-thirds the height of the ground floor, which provided a view from above of certain parts of the garden or the distant scenery.\nSome gardens have a picturesque stone pavilion in the form of a boat, located in the pond. (called an xie, fang, or shifang). These generally had three parts; a kiosk with winged gables at the front, a more intimate hall in the center, and a two-story structure with a panoramic view of the pond at the rear.\n\nCourtyards (yuan). Gardens contain small enclosed court courtyards,  offering quiet and solitude for meditation, painting, drinking tea, or playing on the cithare.Galleries (lang) are narrow covered corridors which connect the buildings, protect the visitors from the rain and sun, and also help divide the garden into different sections. These galleries are rarely straight; they zigzag or are serpentine, following the wall of the garden, the edge of the pond, or climbing the hill of the rock garden. They have small windows, sometimes round or in odd geometric shapes, to give glimpses of the garden or scenery to those passing through.\nWindows and doors are an important architectural feature of the Chinese garden. Sometimes they are round (moon windows or a moon gate) or oval, hexagonal or octagonal, or in the shape of a vase or a piece of fruit. Sometimes they have highly ornamental ceramic frames. The window may carefully frame a branch of a pine tree, or a plum tree in blossom, or another intimate garden scene.Bridges are another common feature of the Chinese garden. Like the galleries, they are rarely straight, but zigzag (called the Nine-turn bridges) or arch over the ponds, suggesting the bridges of rural China, and providing view points of the garden. Bridges are often built from rough timber or stone-slab raised pathways. Some gardens have brightly painted or lacquered bridges, which give a lighthearted feeling to the garden.Gardens also often include small, austere houses for solitude and meditation, sometimes in the form of rustic fishing huts, and isolated buildings which serve as libraries or studios (shufang).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Artificial mountains and rock gardens ===\n\nThe artificial mountain (jiashan) or rock garden is an integral element of Chinese classical gardens. The mountain peak was a symbol of virtue, stability and endurance in Confucian philosophy and in the I Ching.  A mountain peak on an island was also a central part of the legend of the Isles of the Immortals, and thus became a central element in many classical gardens.\nThe first rock garden appeared in Chinese garden history in Tu Yuan (literally \"Rabbit Garden\"), built during the Western Han dynasty (206 BCE \u2013 9 CE). During the Tang dynasty, the rock was elevated to the status of an art object, judged by its form (xing), substance  (zhi), color (se), and texture (wen), as well as by its softness, transparency, and other factors. The poet Bo Juyi (772\u2013846) wrote a catalog of the famous rocks of Lake Tai, called Taihu Shiji. These rocks, of limestone sculpted by erosion, became the most highly prized for gardens.\nDuring the Song dynasty, the artificial mountains were made mostly of earth. But Emperor Huizong (1100\u20131125) nearly ruined the economy of the Song Empire by destroying the bridges of the Grand Canal so he could carry huge rocks by barge to his imperial garden. During the Ming dynasty, the use of piles of rocks to create artificial mountains and grottos reached its peak. During the Qing dynasty, the Ming rock gardens were considered too artificial and the new mountains were composed of both rocks and earth.The artificial mountain in Chinese gardens today usually has a small view pavilion at the summit. In smaller classical gardens, a single scholar rock represents a mountain, or a row of rocks represents a mountain range.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nA pond or lake is the central element of a Chinese garden. The main buildings are usually placed beside it, and pavilions surround the lake to see it from different points of view. The garden usually has a pond for lotus flowers, with a special pavilion for viewing them. There are usually goldfish in the pond, with pavilions over the water for viewing them.\nThe lake or pond has an important symbolic role in the garden. In the I Ching, water represents lightness and communication, and carried the food of life on its journey through the valleys and plains. It also is the complement to the mountain, the other central element of the garden, and represents dreams and the infinity of spaces. The shape of the garden pond often hides the edges of the pond from viewers on the other side, giving the illusion that the pond goes on to infinity. The softness of the water contrasts with the solidity of the rocks. The water reflects the sky, and therefore is constantly changing, but even a gentle wind can soften or erase the reflections.The lakes and waterside pavilions in Chinese gardens were also influenced by another classic of Chinese literature, the Shishuo Xinyu by Liu Yiqing (403\u2013444), who described the promenades of the Emperor Jianwen of Jin along the banks of the Hao and the Pu River, in the Garden of the Splendid Forest (Hualin yuan). Many gardens, particularly in the gardens of Jiangnan and the imperial gardens of northern China, have features and names taken from this work.Small gardens have a single lake, with a rock garden, plants and structures around its edge. Middle-sized gardens will have a single lake with one or more streams coming into the lake, with bridges crossing the streams, or a single long lake divided into two bodies of water by a narrow channel crossed by a bridge. In a very large garden like the Humble Administrator's Garden, the principal feature of the garden is the large lake with its symbolic islands, symbolizing the isles of the immortals. Streams come into the lake, forming additional scenes. Numerous structures give different views of the water, including a stone boat, a covered bridge, and several pavilions by the side of or over the water.\nSome gardens created the impression of lakes by places smooth areas of white sand, bordered by rocks, in courtyards. In the moonlight these looked like real lakes. This style of 'dry garden' was later imported into Japan and transformed into the zen garden.\nThe streams in the Chinese garden always follow a winding course, and are hidden from time to time by rocks or vegetation. A French Jesuit missionary, Father Attiret, who was a painter in the service of the Qianlong Emperor from 1738 to 1768, described one garden he saw:\n\n\"The canals are not like those in our country bordered with finely cut stone, but very rustic and lined with pieces or rock, some coming forward, some retreating. which are placed so artistically that you would think it was a work of nature.\"\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Flowers and trees ===\n\nFlowers and trees, along with water, rocks and architecture, are the fourth essential element of the Chinese garden. They represent nature in its most vivid form, and contrast with the straight lines of the architecture and the permanence, sharp edges and immobility of the rocks. They change continually with the seasons, and provide both sounds (the sound of rain on banana leaves or the wind in the bamboo)  and aromas to please the visitor.\nEach flower and tree in the garden had its own symbolic meaning. The pine, bamboo and Chinese plum (Prunus mume) were considered the \"Three Friends of Winter\" (\u6b72\u5bd2\u4e09\u53cb) by the scholars who created classical gardens, prized for remaining green or blooming in winter. They were often painted together by artists like Zhao Mengjian (1199\u20131264). For scholars, the pine was the emblem of longevity and tenacity, as well as constance in friendship. The bamboo, a hollow straw, represented a wise man, modest and seeking knowledge, and was also noted for being flexible in a storm without breaking. Plum trees were revered as the symbol of rebirth after the winter and the arrival of spring. During the Song dynasty, the favorite tree was the winter plum tree, appreciated for its early pink and white blossoms and sweet aroma.The peach tree in the Chinese garden symbolized longevity and immortality. Peaches were associated with the classic story The Orchard of Xi Wangmu, the Queen Mother of the West. This story said that in Xi Wangmu's legendary orchard, peach trees flowered only after three thousand years, did not produce fruit for another three thousand years, and did not ripen for another three thousand years. Those who ate these peaches became immortal. This legendary orchard was pictured in many Chinese paintings, and inspired many garden scenes. Pear trees were the symbol of justice and wisdom.  The word 'pear' was also a homophone for 'quit' or separate,' and it was considered bad luck to cut a pear, for it would lead to the breakup of a friendship or romance. The pear tree could also symbolize a long friendship or romance, since the tree lived a long time.\nThe apricot tree symbolized the way of the mandarin, or the government official. During the Tang dynasty, those who passed the imperial examination were rewarded with the banquet in the garden of the apricot trees, or Xingyuan.\nThe fruit of the pomegranate tree was offered to young couples so they would have male children and numerous descendants. The willow tree represented the friendship and the pleasures of life. Guests were offered willow branches as a symbol of friendship.Of the flowers in the Chinese garden, the most appreciated were the orchid, peony, and lotus (Nelumbo nucifera). During the Tang dynasty, the peony, the symbol of opulence and a flower with a delicate fragrance, was the most celebrated flower in the garden. The poet Zhou Dunyi wrote a famous elegy to the lotus, comparing it to a junzi, a man who possessed integrity and balance. The orchid was the symbol of nobility, and of impossible love, as in the Chinese expression \"a faraway orchid in a lonely valley.\" The lotus was admired for its purity, and its efforts to reach out of the water to flower in the air made it a symbol of the search for knowledge. The chrysanthemum was elegized the poet Tao Yuanming, who surrounded his hermit's hut with the flower, and wrote a famous verse:\n\n\"At the feet of the Eastern fence, I pick a chrysanthemum,\nIn the distance, detached and serene, I see the Mountains of the South.\"\nThe creators of the Chinese garden were careful to preserve the natural appearance of the landscape. Trimming and root pruning, if done at all, tried to preserve the natural form. Dwarf trees that were gnarled and ancient-looking were particularly prized in the miniature landscapes of Chinese gardens.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== \"Borrowing scenery\", time and seasons ===\nAccording to Ji Cheng's 16th century book Yuanye, \"The Craft of Gardens,\" \"borrowing scenery\" (jiejing) was the most important thing of a garden. This could mean using scenes outside the garden, such as a view of distant mountains or the trees in the neighboring garden, to create the illusion that garden was much bigger than it was. The most famous example was the mist-shrouded view of the North Temple Pagoda in Suzhou, seen in the distance over the pond of the Humble Administrator's Garden.\nBut, as Ji Cheng wrote, it could also be \"the immaculate ribbon of a stream, animals, birds, fish, or other natural elements (rain, wind, snow), or something less tangible, such as a moonbeam, a reflection in a lake, morning mist, or the red sky of a sunset.\" It could also be a sound; he recommended locating a pavilion near a temple, so that the chanted prayers could be heard; planting fragrant flowers next to paths and pavilions, so visitors would appreciate their aromas; that bird perches be created to encourage birds to come to sing in the garden, that streams be designed to make pleasant sounds, and that banana trees be planted in courtyards so the rain would patter on their leaves. \"A judicious 'borrowing' does not have a reason.\" Ji Cheng wrote. \"It is born simply of feeling created by the beauty of a scene.\"The season and the time of day were also important elements. Garden designers took into account the scenes of the garden that would look best in winter, summer, spring and autumn, and those best viewed at night, in the morning or afternoon. Ji Cheng wrote: \"In the heart of the tumult of the city, you should choose visions that are serene and refined: from a raised clearing, you look to the distant horizon, surrounded by mountains like a screen; in an open pavilion, a gentle and light breeze invades the room; from the front door, the running water of spring flows toward the marsh.\"Actually borrowing scenery is the conclusive, last chapter of Yuanye that explains borrowing scenery as a holistic understanding of the essence of landscape design in its entirety. The ever-changing moods and appearances of nature in a given landscape in full action are understood by the author as an independent function that becomes an agent for garden making. It is nature including the garden maker that creates.\n\n\n=== Concealment and surprise ===\nAnother important garden element was concealment and surprise. The garden was not meant to be seen all at once, it was laid out to present a series of scenes. Visitors moved from scene to scene either within enclosed galleries or by winding paths which concealed the scenes until the last moment. The scenes would suddenly appear at the turn of a path, through a window, or hidden behind a screen of bamboo. They might be revealed through round \"moon doors\" or through windows of unusual shapes, or windows with elaborate lattices that broke the view into pieces.\n\n\n== In art and literature ==\n\nThe garden plays an important part in Chinese art and literature, and at the same time art and literature have inspired many gardens. The school of painting called \"Shanshui\" (literally 'mountains and water' and with the actual meaning of 'landscape'), which began in the 5th century, established the principles of Chinese landscape painting, which were very similar to those of Chinese gardening. These paintings were not meant to be realistic; they were meant to portray what the artist felt, rather than what he saw.\nThe landscape painter Shitao (1641\u20131720) wrote that he wanted to \"'...create a landscape which was not spoiled by any vulgar banality...\"  He wanted to create a sense of vertigo in the viewer: \"to express a universe inaccessible to man, without any route that led there, like the isles of Bohai, Penglan and Fanghu, where only the immortals can live, and which a man cannot imagine. That is the vertigo that exists in the natural universe. To express it in painting, you must show jagged peaks, precipices, hanging bridges, great chasms. For the effect to be truly marvelous, it must be done purely by the force of the brush.\" This was the emotion that garden designers wanted to create with their scholar rocks and miniature mountain ranges.In his book, Craft of Gardens, the garden designer Ji Cheng wrote: \"The spirit and the charm of mountains and forests must be studied in depth; ...only the knowledge of the real permits the creation of the artificial, so that the work created possesses the spirit of the real, in part because of divine inspiration, but especially because of human effort.\" He described the effect he wanted to achieve in the design of an autumn garden scene: \"The feelings are in harmony with the purity, with the sense of withdrawal. The spirit rejoices at the mountains and ravines. Suddenly the spirit, detached from the world of small things, is animated and seems to penetrate to the interior of a painting, and to promenade there...\"In literature, gardens were frequently the subject of the genre of poetry called \"Tianyuan\", literally 'fields and gardens,' which reached its peak in the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) with such poets as Wang Wei (701\u2013761). The names of the Surging Waves Garden and the Garden of Meditation in Suzhou are taken from lines of Chinese poetry. Within the gardens, the individual pavilions and view points were frequently dedicated to verses of poems, inscribed on stones or plaques. The Moon Comes with the Breeze Pavilion at the Couple's Retreat Garden, used for moon-viewing, has the inscription of a verse by Han Yu:\n\n\"The twilight brings the Autumn\nAnd the wind brings the moon here.\"And the Peony Hall in the Couple's Retreat Garden is dedicated to a verse by Li Bai:\n\n\"The spring breeze is gently stroking the balustrade\nand the peony is wet with dew.\"Wang Wei (701\u2013761) was a poet, painter and Buddhist monk, who worked first as a court official before retiring to Lantian, where he built one of the first wenren yuan, or scholar's gardens, called the Valley of the Jante. In this garden, a series of twenty scenes, like the paintings of a scroll or album, unrolled before the viewer, each illustrated by a verse of poetry.  For example, one scene illustrated this poem:\n\n\"The white rock emerges from the torrent;\nThe cold sky with red leaves scattering:\nOn the mountain path, the rain is fleeing,\nthe blue of the emptiness dampens our clothes.\"The Valley of the Jante garden disappeared, but its memory, preserved in paintings and poems, inspired many other scholar's gardens.The social and cultural importance of the garden is illustrated in the classical novel Dream of the Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin which unfolds almost exclusively in a garden.\n\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\nThe Chinese classical garden had multiple functions. It could be used for banquets, celebrations, reunions, or romance. It could be used to find solitude and for contemplation. It was a calm place for painting, poetry, calligraphy, and music, and for studying classic texts. It was a place for drinking tea and for poets to become happily drunk on wine. It was a showcase to display the cultivation and aesthetic taste of the owner. But it also had a philosophical message.\nTaoism had a strong influence on the classical garden. After the Han dynasty (206 BC \u2013 220 AD), gardens were frequently constructed as retreats for government officials who had lost their posts or who wanted to escape the pressures and corruption of court life in the capital. They chose to pursue the Taoist ideals of disengagement from worldly concerns.For followers of Taoism, enlightenment could be reached by contemplation of the unity of creation, in which order and harmony are inherent to the natural world.The gardens were intended to evoke the idyllic feeling of wandering through a natural landscape, to feel closer to the ancient way of life, and to appreciate the harmony between man and nature.In Taoism, rocks and water were opposites, yin and yang, but they complemented and completed one another. Rocks were solid but water could wear away rock. The deeply eroded rocks from Lake Tai used in the classical garden illustrated this principle.\nBorrowing scenery is a most fundamental idea in Ming period garden making theory (see above).\nThe winding paths and zig-zag galleries bridges that led visitors from one garden scene to another also had a message. They illustrated a Chinese proverb, \"By detours, access to secrets\".According to the landscape historian and architect Che Bing Chiu, every garden was  \"a quest for paradise. of a lost world, of a utopian universe. The scholar's garden participated in this quest; on the one hand the quest for the home of the Immortals, on the other hand the search for the world of the golden age so dear to the heart of the scholar.\"A more recent view of the philosophy of the garden was expressed by Zhou Ganzhi, the President of the Chinese Society of Landscape Architecture, and Academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, in 2007: \"Chinese classical gardens are a perfect integration of nature and work by man. They are an imitation of nature, and fully manifest the beauty of nature.  They can also be seen as an improvement on nature; one from which the light of human artistic genius shines.\"\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\n\n=== Chinese influence on the Japanese garden ===\nThe Chinese classical garden had a notable influence on the early Japanese garden. The influence of China first reached Japan through Korea before 600 AD. In 607 AD, the Japanese crown prince Shotoku sent a diplomatic mission to the Chinese court, which began a cultural exchange lasting for centuries. Hundreds of Japanese scholars were sent to study the Chinese language, political system, and culture. The Japanese Ambassador to China, Ono no Imoko, described the great landscape gardens of the Chinese Emperor to the Japanese court. His reports had a profound influence on the development of Japanese landscape design.During the Nara period (710-794), when the Japanese capital was located at Nara, and later at Heian, the Japanese court created large landscape gardens with lakes and pavilions on the Chinese model for aristocrats to promenade and to drift leisurely in small boats, and more intimate gardens for contemplation and religious meditation.A Japanese monk named Eisai (1141\u20131215) imported the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism from China to Japan, which led to the creation of a famous and unique Japanese gardening style, the Zen garden, exemplified by the garden of  Ry\u014dan-ji. He also brought green tea from China to Japan, originally to keep monks awake during long meditation, giving the basis for the Japanese tea ceremony, which became an important ritual in Japanese gardens.The Japanese garden designer Muso Soseki (1275\u20131351) created the celebrated Moss Garden (Kokedera) in Kyoto, which included a recreation of the Isles of Eight Immortals, called Horai in Japanese, which were an important feature of many Chinese gardens.   During the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333), and particularly during the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573) the Japanese garden became more austere than the Chinese garden, following its own aesthetic principles.\n\n\n=== In Europe ===\n\nThe first European to describe a Chinese garden was the Venetian merchant and traveler Marco Polo, who visited the summer palace of Kublai Khan at Xanadu. The garden of Kublai Khan had a later effect on European culture; In 1797, it inspired the romantic poem, Kubla Khan, by the English romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.Marco Polo also described the gardens of the imperial palace in Khanbaliq, the Mongol name for the city which eventually became Beijing. He described ramparts, balustrades and pavilions surrounding a deep lake full of fish and with swans and other aquatic birds; whose central feature was a manmade hill one hundred steps high and a thousand steps around, covered with evergreen trees and decorated with green azurite stones.The first Jesuit priest, Francis Xavier, arrived in China in 1552, and the priest Matteo Ricci received permission to settle in Beijing in 1601. Jesuit priests began sending accounts of Chinese culture and gardens to Europe. Louis Le Comte, the mathematician to the King of France, travelled to China in 1685. He described how the Chinese gardens had grottos, artificial hills and rocks piled to imitate nature, and did not arrange their gardens geometrically.In the 18th century, as Chinese vases and other decorative objects began to arrive in Europe, there was a surge of popularity for Chinoiserie. The painters Watteau and Fran\u00e7ois Boucher painted Chinese scenes as they imagined them, and Catherine the Great decorated a room in her palace in Chinese style. There was great interest in everything Chinese, including gardens.In 1738, the French Jesuit missionary and painter Jean Denis Attiret, went to China, where he became court painter to the Qianlong Emperor. He described in great detail what he saw in the imperial gardens near Beijing:\n\n\"One comes out of a valley, not by a straight wide alley as in Europe, but by zigzags, by roundabout paths, each one ornamented with small pavilions and grottos, and when you exit one valley you find yourself in another, different from the first in the form of the landscape or the style of the buildings. All the mountains and hills are covered with flowering trees, which are very common here. It is a true terrestrial paradise. The canals are not at all like ours- bordered with cut stone- they are rustic, with pieces of rock, some leaning forward, some backwards, placed with such art you would think they were natural. Sometimes a canal is wide, sometimes narrow. Here they twist, there they curve, as if they were really created by the hills and rocks. The edges are planted with flowers in rock gardens, which seem to have been created by nature. Each season has its own flowers. Aside from the canals, everywhere there are paths paved with small stones, which lead from one valley to the other. These paths also twist and turn, sometimes coming close to the canals, sometimes far away.\"\nAttiret wrote:\n\n\"Everything is truly great and beautiful, both as to the design and the execution: and [the gardens] struck me the more, because I had never seen any thing that bore any manner of resemblance to them, in any part of the world that I had been before.\"The Qianlong Emperor (1711\u20131799) was equally interested in what was going on in Europe. He commissioned the Jesuit priest Father Castiglione, who was trained in engineering, to build fountains for his garden similar to those he had heard about in the gardens at Versailles.\n\nChinese architecture and aesthetics also influenced the English garden. In 1685, the English diplomat and writer Sir William Temple wrote an essay Upon the garden of Epicurus (published in 1692), which contrasted European theories of symmetrical gardens with asymmetrical compositions from China. Temple had never visited China, but he had read the works of European travelers there. He noted that Chinese gardens avoided formal rows of trees and flower beds, and instead placed trees, plants, and other garden features in irregular ways to strike the eye and create beautiful compositions. His observations on the Chinese garden were cited by the essayist Joseph Addison in an essay in 1712, who used them to attack the English gardeners who, instead of imitating nature, tried to make their gardens in the French style, as far from nature as possible.The English landscape garden was already well-established in England in the first part of the 18th century, influenced by the travel to Italy by the British upper class and their desire to have a new style of garden to match the Palladian style of architecture they chose for their country houses, and by the romantic landscapes of Claude Lorraine and other painters, but the novelty and exoticism of Chinese art and architecture in Europe led in 1738 to the construction of the first Chinese house in an English garden, at Stowe House, alongside Roman temples, Gothic ruins and other architectural styles.\n\nThe style became even more popular thanks to William Chambers (1723\u20131796), who lived in China from 1745 to 1747, and wrote a book, The Drawings, buildings, furniture, habits, machines and untensils of the Chinese, published in 1757. He urged western garden designers to use Chinese stylistic conventions such as concealment, asymmetry, and naturalism. Later, in 1772, Chambers published his Dissertation on Oriental Gardening, a rather fanciful elaboration of contemporary ideas about the naturalistic style of gardening in China.Chambers was a fierce critic of Capability Brown, the leading designer of the English landscape garden, which Chambers considered boring. Chambers believed that gardens should be full of surprises. In 1761 he built a Chinese pagoda, house and garden in Kew Gardens, London, along with a mosque, a temple of the sun, a ruined arch, and Palladian bridge. Thanks to Chambers Chinese structures  began to appear in other English gardens, then in France and elsewhere on the continent. Carmontelle added a Chinese pavilion to his garden at Parc Monceau in Paris (1772), and the Duc de Choiseul built a pagoda on his estate at Chanteloup between 1775 and 1778. The Russian Empress Catherine the Great built her own pagoda in the garden of her palace of Tsarskoye Selo, near Saint Petersburg, between 1778 and 1786. Many continental critics disliked the term English Garden, so they began to use the term 'Anglo-Chinois\" to describe the style. By the end of the nineteenth century parks all over Europe had picturesque Chinese pagodas, pavilions or bridges, but there were few gardens that expressed the more subtle and profound aesthetics of the real Chinese garden.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nClassical Gardens of Suzhou\nJi Cheng\nList of Chinese gardens\nList of botanical gardens in China\nPear Garden\nPenjing\nWest Lake\nBorrowed scenery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nSuzhou Classical Gardens",

During his tour of southern China that year, China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping said: \"Singapore enjoys good social order and is well managed. We should tap on their experience, and learn how to manage better than them.\"\nAfter rounds of discussions and site surveys, both governments decided to join hands in developing a modern industrial park in the east of Suzhou. The China\u2013Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park (CS-SIP) was thus born on February 26, 1994 when Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew signed the Agreement on the Joint Development of Suzhou Industrial Park in Suzhou.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSIP has a total jurisdiction area of 288 km2, of which, the China-Singapore cooperation area covers 80 km2 with a planned residential population of 1.2 million. The China-Singapore Joint Steering Council led by Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi and Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng will hold meeting every year to give directions for the development of SIP.Jinji Lake (literally Golden Rooster Lake) is a small fresh water lake located in the central part of Suzhou Industrial Park. It occupies an area of 7.18 square kilometres and its average depth is about 2.5 to 3 metres. There are two man-made islands in the lake.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nReports surfaced in 2019 that the park was being affected by the US-China trade war, with exports having declined 10 per cent over the first seven months of 2019 when compared to 2018 figures, while imports have fallen 15 per cent over the same period. \n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and higher education ===\n\nThere is Suzhou Dushu Lake Higher Education Town, one of the government's key projects. Located east of Dushu Lake, it has a total area of 25 km2, and expects to have around 400,000 people by 2016, 100,000 of whom will be students. Its goal is to offer good education, advanced technology, and a pleasant living environment. The area is home to many universities (undergraduate as well as graduate schools) including local Chinese universities and universities from other countries. This community focuses on producing educated and creative people. The area offers facilities including libraries, entertainment venues, parks, a sports centre and accommodation. Wenxing Plaza and Hanlin Plaza are popular locations of many small restaurants and shops. Dushu Lake Library is an experimental library of the National Digital Library. Major universities include Suzhou University, Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and Renmin University of China, Suzhou Campus.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe SIP ran into trouble when local officials began building Suzhou New District (SND) industrial park to compete with it. As the Suzhou city government had only a minority 35 percent stake in the SIP, while they had a major stake in SND, the city government largely ignored SIP and concentrated on promoting the SND instead.\nThe project was supposed to transfer Singapore's management skills to Chinese bureaucrats and to teach China how to build and run \"business-friendly\" commercial parks. But it ended up straining the close relations between Singapore and China and bringing home to Singaporeans the often unpredictable, and sometimes underhand, business culture of the Communist mainland.Singapore's senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew conceded that the project had not turned out as planned and had made him more cautious about investments in China. He pointed to the difficulties that arose in signing agreements with the central government that were then implemented by local officials who \"have their own imperatives\".After incurring losses of some US$90 million over 5 years, the Singapore consortium lowered its stake to 35 percent, raising the Chinese consortium's stake to 65 percent from 35 percent and reducing the Singaporean share from a planned 70 km2 to just 8 km2.  The Chinese side appointed Wang Jinhua, vice-mayor of Suzhou and the former manager of the New District, as the new chief executive.\nIn 2001, one year after Singapore lowered its stake, the park made its first profit of $3.8 million.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nJinji Lake\nDushu Lake\nGate to the East\nSuzhou Ferris Wheel\nSuzhou Industrial Park Railway Station\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSuzhou Industrial Park Webpage",

        "wiki": "Kunshan  is a county-level city in southeastern Jiangsu province with Shanghai  bordering its eastern border and Suzhou on its western boundary. It is under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Suzhou.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThere is a strong possibility that the name Kunshan is derived from a hill, but which one is controversial. According to an impacted version, the hill is present-day Little Kunshan (Xiaokunshan) in Shanghai's Songjiang District. The character \u5d11 (Kun) was the old Chinese name for the Kunlun Mountains. From it developed the Chinese idiom \"a jade from Kunlun Mountains\", meaning any \"outstanding figure\". This was applied to Lu Ji and a hill in his hometown was designated as Kun to commemorate him.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLou county (\u5a41\u7e23) which administered Kunshan and the area around was established in Qin dynasty. It was named after Lou River (\u5a41\u6c5f; present-day Liu River: \u700f\u6cb3), while its seat was located in the north eastern of Kunshan. In 507, Xinyi county (\u4fe1\u7fa9\u7e23) which hold Lou county 's former seat was separated from the old Lou county. In 535, the old Kunshan county was separated from the old Xinyi county, while its seat was moved to the north of Kun Hill, Songjiang. In 751, the seat was moved to the south of Ma'anshan (Ma'an Hill: \u99ac\u978d\u5c71; in Kunshan nowadays).\nIn 1724, then Kunshan county was divided into new Kunshan county and Xinyang county (\u65b0\u967d\u7e23), the walled city also was halved to locate their own seat respectively. In 1860, Taiping Rebellions captured the walled city, then the Ever Victorious Army?recaptured it in 1863.\nOn 11 November 1911, the local rally announced that both of the counties seceded from the Qing court from then on. In 1912, Xinyang county was merged into Kunshan county. On 15 November 1937, the Japanese army captured the walled city. On 13 May 1949, the CPC controlled the walled city.

        "wiki": "Suzhou embroidery, Su embroidery or Su xiu (Chinese: \u82cf\u7ee3) is the embroidery created around the city of Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. It is one of the oldest embroidery techniques in the world and is the most representative type of art in Chinese embroidery. It already has a history more than 2,000 years and is an important form of handicraft in the history of Chinese art and folk custom. As a representative of Chinese traditional folk arts, it is famous for its variety of stitches, beautiful patterns, elegant colors, and consummate craftsmanship.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSu Xiu originated in Suzhou, Jiangsu. Suzhou is a city which rich in producing silk because of its superior geographical environment. Because of its superior geographical environment, Suzhou is a city which rich in producing silk. This provided a favorable environment for the development of Su Xiu.\nSuzhou embroidery already has a history of more than two thousand years. It was recorded as early as era of Three Kingdoms.\nIn Three Kingdoms era (220-280 A.D.), Su Xiu has been used as a decoration for clothing. It gradually moved into people's life.\nDuring the Song Dynasty (960-1697 A.D.), Su embroidery had reached a high level.\nDuring the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 A.D.), Suzhou embroidery has become a popular avocation for people live in Suzhou. At that time, almost every family were doing embroidery. Not only that, an imperial office was founded to oversee dyeing, weaving and embroidering for court use. At that time, Su Xiu has been not only an object for family use, but also gradually loved by the royal.\nDuring the ensuing Qing Dynasty (1644-1912 A.D.), Su Xiu reached its heyday. At that time, Suzhou already has more than 100 embroidery workshops and markets. It was widely used to decorate clothing, costumes, quilt, pillow bag, curtain, cushion, shoe upper, sachet and other aspects. It was the most popular costume for royal clothing and wall decoration at that time. Some ladies from affluent families made embroideries as pastime. In the later period of the Qing Dynasty, Su Xiu made further development in embroidery technology. Exquisite \"Double-faced Embroidery\" appeared. Accordingly, Su Xiu had the development of new one pace in Qing Dynasty.\nIn the early 20thcentury, between 1912 and 1949, after the Xinhai Revolution. due to the war, the Su Xiu industry once declined.\nAfter the founding of new China (after 1949), the government showed great concern for Su Xiu. China set up the Suzhou embroidery institute and opened embroidery training classes. People made innovations to bring new life to traditional skill. The embroidery method of Su Xiu developed from 18 kinds to more than 40 kinds.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Subjects ===\nThe traditional subjects of Su Xiu embroidery reflect characters and nature environment include figures, animals, mountains, rivers, flowers and birds. Here are some classical Su embroidery works: \"Lady Jiong Dances on a Golden Lotus Platform\", a masterpiece made by a well known Qing-Dynasty embroiderer's called Ling Shu, it depicts imperial concubine Lady Jiong dancing for Emperor Li Yu of the Southern Tang Dynasty. It is about the subject of figures. The \u201cGolden Belt Apron\u201d is Zhao Huijun's masterpiece. By using different stitching techniques, It shows us delicate peony flower.It is about the subject of animals. \u201cTwo Chickens under a Wisteria Branch\", is generally recognized a masterpiece of the early 20thcentury. It shows two chickens under a wisteria tree. It is about the subject of flowers. \n\n\n=== Use ===\nSuzhou embroidery is mainly used in costumes and for decorations around the home, adding both decorative and practical value. It could be used to as the decoration for shoes, pillow sides, purses. And can also be the mirror cover. The purse is a kind of pocket with embroidered pattern. In ancient China, it was embroidered by ladies as the tokens of pledging love for their lover. The patterns cover a very wide rage, animals, plants and figures. Ladies always use these patterns to express their good wishes. It was not only practical, but also an ornament. And was the most emotional expression of love at that time. The mirror cover is used to put woman's mirror in old times. It has many shapes such as circular, square and octagon.\n\n\n=== fabrication ===\nFirst of all, the draft of the embroidery should be prepared. It can be divided into two types. One is a drawing specially made for the embroidery. The other is the works selected from famous artists, including traditional Chinese paintings, oil paintings, photographs and so on.\nSecondly, materials and tools should be prepared. The materials include: draft, silk and embroidery thread. Tools are: stretch frame, hand board, scissors, embroidery needle and tape measure.\nSu embroidery has strict requirements for embroidery needles, and the thickness of the needles will affect the shades and the performance of the work. Embroiderers usually split a hair-thin silk thread into two to sixteen thinner threads. Different thread thicknesses are used for different parts of a subject in embroidery. For threads, Su embroiderers usually split each silk strand into thinner threads\u2014in half, in quarters, eighths, sixteenths and so on.Third, start the embroidery. Su Xiu can be divided into two categories according to its appearance: single-sided embroidery and double-sided embroidery. Double-sided embroidery is the embroidery which can see the same signature, colours and stitches in both sides. The method of making this embroidery is very complicated. All thread ends are skill-fully concealed between layers of stitch work. The embroidery process is finished without a second time. As a result, no knots or thread ends are visible in a double sided embroidery. According to different stitches, Su Xiu can be divided into random needlework and plain needlework. Random needlework, as the name implies is the needlework which has a very stochastic embroidery method. Embroidered with this kind of needlework usually consist of straight and oblique lines, cross and mixed together, and then go through another layer of mixed colours and density until light, colour and shape are similar.\nThe final step is to frame the finished piece. Frames usually are made by annatto wood, Millettia wood and rosewood.\nIt usually takes 3 to 5 months to complete a small piece of embroidery, one year for a medium-size piece and 2 or 3 years for a large one.\n\n\n== Traditional Pattern ==\n\n\n=== animals ===\n\nDragon\n\nDragon worship has a long history in China. In ancient times, the dragon was a symbol of power. Only the emperor could wear yellow clothes embroidered with dragons. Now, \"The descendants of the dragon\" is a symbol of the Chinese nation.\nPhoenix\n\nPhoenix is a kind of auspicious bird in myth and legend. It is also a mascot in Chinese traditional culture and gradually becomes the representative of women. In symbolies a happy marriage and good luck in Su Xiu.\nMandarin ducks\n\nMandarin ducks are famous ornamental birds in China. Their images are widely used in the embroidery art. It's It symbolizes faithful love and a happy marriage.\nBat\nBats symbolize luck and wealth. The bat is thus used because the words \u201cbat\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d have the same sound, although there is a slight difference in tone.\n\nKylin\nKylin is a kind of auspicious animal in Chinese mythology, symbolizing rarity and auspiciousness.\n\n\n=== Plants ===\nPeony\n\nPeony is the \u201cqueen of the flowers\u201d. In traditional Chinese designs, peonies are often used as symbols of great wealth and honor.\nLotus\nLotus belongs to the aquatic root plant of water lily family, which has a high status in Chinese traditional culture and is called \"the gentleman in the flower\". It's a symbol of integrity and purity. Because it rises undefiled from the black mud. Not only that, lotus is also the main symbol of Buddhism. The embroidery with lotus patterns sometimes shows the sanctity and purity of Buddhism, and inviolability.\nPeach, pomegranate and hand fruit\n\nThey symbolize longevity. A free translation of their meaning would be, \u201cMay you have many years, many honors and as many male descendants as there are seeds in a pome granate.\u201d\n\n\n=== others ===\n\nOverlapping coin\nThe overlapping coin with a square hole is a symbol of wealth. A favorite background is a series of overlapping circles which forms an all-over design of these coins.Words\nPeople will embroider words to express the meaning intuitively. Like \u201cshou\u201d means long life, \u201cfu\u201d means happiness, \"xi\u201d is used for marriage, meaning beautiful love.\n\n\n== Innovation ==\n\n\n=== Technique ===\nIn the modern craft, Su Xiu has carried on the innovation which combine the old embroidery technology and the modern technology or material.\nAfter the 19th century, people invented the machine of embroidery. Machines stitches could save time and have more advantages than hand stitches. Although the machine stitches are more convenient, it only plays an auxiliary role and improve embroidery development. But can never replace handwork. Modern technology is a combination of machine and hand. Together they can complement each other.For the embroidery in silk scarf, embroider combine Su Xiu with Swarovski crystals. The combination of two different cultures makes Su Xiu more acceptable to modern fashion, expand new space. In Suorang 2012 collection, the design adopts method of combining embroidery with beads.\n\n\n=== Art form ===\nWith the change of time, in order to comply with the development of modern. Su Xiu is not only used in the design of clothes, but also in the design of furniture and jewelry.\nLike the ring with Su embroidery. The ring with embroidery instead of gems or diamonds, break the viewers\u2019 inherent imagination, thus deepening the visual experience.\n\n\n=== Theme ===\nThe original patterns of Su Xiu are mostly animals and plants. The whole embroidery picture is very aesthetic and impact. But may not accord with the aesthetic concept of modern people. In order to adapt to modern aesthetics, the embroider created new patterns such as geometric patterns, or western paintings, which are accepted by more people. These show the aesthetic and the decorative of designs.\n\n\n== Value ==\n\n\n=== Historical value ===\nSuzhou embroidery has experienced many dynasties in the course of its 2,000-year historical development, and the works of Su Xiu in each dynasty are strongly influenced by The Times. Due to the origin of Su Xiu is in the Suzhou, with its grid structure of roads and waterways, ancient Suzhou used to be one of the largest cities in China. The folk embroidery products have been rich in color and life atmosphere of the town, which reflects the cultural life and folk customs of the people of Suzhou from one side. We can see the changes of Su Xiu in the works of different periods. Through these works, we can study the life customs, social customs and aesthetic styles of Chinese people in different era.\n\n\n=== Cultural value ===\nAs a traditional handicraft, Su Xiu has always been closely combined with Chinese traditional culture and Western culture. It already becomes an important part of Chinese traditional culture. Among them, the traditional Chinese calligraphy and painting have been incisively and vividly expressed in the Su Xiu works, which mostly draw the artistic essence from them. Contemporary Chinese culture and art are also fully expressed in Su Xiu works. Not only that, Su Xiu also combined the Western culture such as the oil painting. Su embroidery shows oil paintings with needle and thread. Makes people feel the integration of Chinese and western cultures.\n\n\n=== Artistic value ===\nThe artistic value of Su Xiu is mainly reflected in its exquisite craftsmanship. Artists of Su Xiu embroidered their works with needles and threads instead of pigment. Due to the artistic effect of silk, the calligraphy and painting patterns on the embroidery products appeared more vivid. Whether it is to show landscapes, flowers, birds, animals or figures, exquisite Su embroidery skills can make it looks truly. Because of this, Su Xiu is praised as \"the pearl of the east\" by people all over the world.\n\n\n=== Collection value ===\nSuzhou embroidery inherits an ancient and traditional craft with strong national characteristics, and its value potential mainly comes from the scarcity and uniqueness of the works' resources. Due to the complexity of Su Xiu technology, each process has different techniques, and a good embroidery product often takes several years or even longer to complete, which also leads to fewer and fewer people willing to learn and master Su embroidery techniques in contemporary fast-paced life.\n\n\n== Protection ==\nIn October 1986 (Ming dynasty), Suzhou city set up the Chinese embroidery art museum. Displaying more than 200 embroidery products from The Han dynasty to the present.\nOn May 20, 2006, Su Xiu was designated an intangible cultural heritage of China. On May 24, 2018, Su Xiu was selected as one of the first batch of China national traditional craft revitalization and protection objects.\n\n\n== References ==",

A lane called Gong Xiang (\u5bab\u5df7) along north-south direction leads directly to the gate.\n\n\n== History ==\nXuanmiao Temple was founded in Xianning 2nd year (AD 276), Western Jin Dynasty, and was initially named \"Zhenqing Daoyuan\" (\u771f\u5e86\u9053\u9662). It was destroyed by wars in Southern Song Dynasty. It was rebuilt in the Chunxi era (1174\u20131189) of the reign of Emperor Xiaozong of Song, and was renamed Xuanmiao Guan in 1264. During the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing Dynasty, the temple was renamed Yuanmiao Guan (\u5143\u5999\u89c2) to avoid naming taboo because the emperor's personal name, Xuanye (\u7384\u70e8), contained the Chinese character xuan (\u7384).\nThe first structure of the temple that visitors see is the Zheng Shan Men. It is built entirely from wood. The Zheng Shan Men is aligned south to north, with the main entrance facing south. It has two side entrances, in the east and west. The temple dates back to the Tang Dynasty. It suffered some damages in the eighteenth century and had to be rebuilt in 1775. The temple houses six statues of Taoist gods. There are also idols of four marshals and two generals. The temple's flank has a tablet commemorating the restoration of the temple.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nXuanmiao Temple, Architectura Sinica Site Archive",

        "wiki": "The Confucian Temple of Suzhou (Chinese: \u82cf\u5dde\u6587\u5e99) and also known as the Suzhou Stone Inscription Museum and Suzhou Prefecture School (Chinese: \u82cf\u5dde\u5e9c\u5b66; a state-run school), is a Confucian temple located in the ancient city of Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, on the south bank of the Yangtze River. It was built by Fan Zhongyan, a famous state officer in Song Dynasty. It was the first temple school in China and is notable for containing the four greatest steles of Song Dynasty, of on which is the Map of Pingjiang. In 1961, the stone inscriptions in Suzhou Confucian Temple were listed among the first batch of National Key Cultural Relic Protection Units by The State Council of the People\u2019s Republic of China. In 2001, together with the Confucian Temple, it was called Suzhou Confucian Temple and Stone inscription. Presently, it is known as new name as Suzhou Stone Inscription Museum.\n\n\n== History and architecture ==\nSuzhou Confucian Temple is located in the central part of Suzhou, Jiangsu province, China. Built by the order of Fan Zhongyan, then the Prefect of Suzhou, it stands across from the street with Garden of Surging Wave Pavilion. In 1035, Fan Zhongyan was the Prefect of Suzhou. He combined the State School and the Confucian Temple, which began the State education. The system was imitated by other places, for which it got the saying \"State education began from Wu County \". Suzhou Temple School had been extended several times, so presently, it takes up a large area. According to the record of County Wu, it had 213 rooms in Southern Song Dynasty (in 1241). In its day, it had classrooms, dormitoroes, exam rooms and canteens, besides the hall and temple. Suzhou Temple School also had gardening architecture, for instance, rockery, pond, bridge and pavilion. Its scale is the biggest among schools in the southeast.\nWith the abolition of the imperial examination system, an examination system in Imperial China designed to select the best administrative officials for the state's bureaucracy, at the end of Qing Dynasty, the Confucian Temple was gradually abandoned.\nAt present, the temple only occupies 17,800 square metres, which is one sixth of the area when it was in the prime. However, the architectural layout remains, with the temple and the school. In the eastern temple area, only Ji Men, Dacheng Hall and Chongsheng Memorial Temple are left, and in the western school area, only Pan pond, Qixing pond and Minglun Hall are comparatively complete.\nExcept the Dacheng Hall and the Lingxing Men, most of the architectures we can see now were rebuilt in the Qing Dynasty (1864).\nLingxing Men, built in 1373, Ming Dynasty, is a huge limestone memorial archway with six columns, three doors and four door leaves.\nDacheng Hall, rebuilt in 1474, Ming Dynasty, is 7 rooms wide, 13 purlins deep, Zhong Yan Dianding Veranda, and supported by 50 Nanmu columns.\nOutside the hall are limestone platforms on which is a huge bronze statue of Confucius and inside the hall hangs a giant picture of Confucius, both of which are contemporary works.\nThe magnificent Dacheng Hall, is the main building of Confucian Temple and its scale is second in Suzhou only to Sanqing Hall in Xuanmiao Taoist temple in Suzhou.\n\n\n== Stone inscriptions ==\nThere are a substantial number of stone inscriptions in the temple, among which Tianwen Tu \u5929\u6587\u5716, Dili Tu \u5730\u7406\u5716, Diwangshaoyun Tu \u5e1d\u738b\u7d39\u904b\u5716, and Pingjiang Tu \u5e73\u6c5f\u5716, known as \u201cThe Four Great Stone Inscriptions\u201d of the Song Dynasty, are the most famous ones. They respectively represent sky, earth, people and city. Formerly placed in Dacheng Hall, they are presently in the wing-room beside the hall, under special protection.\nPingjiang Tu is 2.76m high and 1.48m wide. The wired shade is engraved in second year in Shaoding reign of Southern Song Dynasty. This inscription delicately describes the layout situation of the prefectural city of Pingjiang (namely Suzhou today) in that time. It labels 613 places, including defensive wall, officials, temples, business houses, academies, warehouses, barracks, gardens, rivers, bridges, roads and such kinds of architectures and places of interest. Dozens of rivers with a total length of about 82 km and 359 bridges are painted on it. These fully reflect the feature of cities in the Yangtze River Delta. It also records more than 50 temples, 12 ancient towers and 65 cross street arches, lots of which remain today. Since the inscription is of considerable antiquity, some obscure points were carved again in 1917. This stone inscription, Pingjiang Tu, is the oldest and kept the most entirely city plan left in China. It has an extremely high historical value.\nThe other three steles of Song Dynasty were drawn by Huang Shang in the Shaoxi reign of the south Song (1190), and carved by Wang Zhiyuan in the Chunyou reign (1247). Tianwen Tu, 1.9 meters high and 1.08 meters wide, was the oldest, existing, eastern constellations in the world. 1440 stars and 280 constellations which were observed in the Yuanfeng reign of the North Song were carved on the upper part of the stele. In the bottom of the stele, there are 2091-word notes that briefly introduced some stars and astronomical phenomena. The notes fully reflect the level of Astronomy in that time. Dili Tu is 2 meters high and 1.07 meters wide, which carved the mountains and the city of Song Dynasty in detail on the stele. The note in the bottom of the stele is made up of 645 words, which briefly showed the change of China\u2019s territory from Yu The Great to Song Dynasty. Dili Tu and Huayi Tu, Yuji Tu from the Stele Forest in Xi\u2019an were listed as the three oldest national maps. Diwangshaoyun Tu is 1.83 meters high and 1 meter wide. In the upper part, it lists the ancient kings\u2019 lineage clearly by diagram. In the bottom part, there is a 550-word comment.\nBesides the four great steles of the Song Dynasty, Suzhou Confucian Temple also holds more than 3000 stone inscriptions and about ten thousand rubbings. These included the famous handwriting and poem steles of Lu Ji, Huang Tingjian, Su Xu, Su Shi, Wen Tianxiang and Wen Zhengming. These collections were displayed according to theme, such as Confucius, Confucianism, economy and ancient calligraphy. In 1985, the Suzhou Confucian Temple was renamed as Suzhou Stone Inscription Museum.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSuzhou High School\n\n\n== References and notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Suzhou Confucian Temple at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "The Grand Canal, known to the Chinese as the Jing\u2013Hang Grand Canal (Chinese: \u4eac\u676d\u5927\u904b\u6cb3; pinyin: J\u012bng-H\u00e1ng D\u00e0 Y\u00f9nh\u00e9; lit.: 'Beijing\u2013Hangzhou Grand Canal', or more commonly, as the\u300c\u5927\u904b\u6cb3\u300d(\"Grand Canal\")), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the longest canal or artificial river in the world. Starting at Beijing, it passes through Tianjin and the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the city of Hangzhou, linking the Yellow River and Yangtze River. The oldest parts of the canal date back to the 5th century BC, but the various sections were first connected during the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618 AD). Dynasties in 1271\u20131633 significantly rebuilt the canal and altered its route to supply their capital Beijing.\nThe total length of the Grand Canal is 1,776 km (1,104 mi). Its greatest height is reached in the mountains of Shandong, at a summit of 42 m (138 ft). Ships in Chinese canals did not have trouble reaching higher elevations after the pound lock was invented in the 10th century, during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), by the government official and engineer Qiao Weiyue. The canal has been admired by many throughout history including Japanese monk Ennin (794\u2013864), Persian historian Rashid al-Din (1247\u20131318), Korean official Choe Bu (1454\u20131504), and Italian missionary Matteo Ricci (1552\u20131610).Historically, periodic flooding of the Yellow River threatened the safety and functioning of the canal. During wartime, the high dikes of the Yellow River were sometimes deliberately broken in order to flood and thus sweep away advancing enemy troops. This would cause disaster and prolonged economic hardships for local residents. Despite temporary periods of desolation and disuse, the Grand Canal furthered an indigenous and growing economic market in China's urban centers from the Sui period onwards to the present. It has allowed faster trading and has thus improved China's economy. The southern portion remains in heavy use to the present day.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Precursors ===\nIn the late Spring and Autumn period (770\u2013476 BC), Fuchai, King of the State of Wu (whose capital was in present-day Suzhou), ventured north to attack the State of Qi. He ordered a canal to be constructed for trading purposes, as well as a means to ship ample supplies north in case his forces should engage the northern states of Song and Lu. This canal became known as the Han Gou (\u9097\u6e9d, \"Han Conduit\"). Work began in 486 BC, from south of Yangzhou to north of Huai'an in Jiangsu, and within three years the Han Gou had connected the Yangtze with the Huai River by means of existing waterways, lakes, and marshes.The Han Gou is known as the second oldest section of the later Grand Canal since the Hong Gou (t \u9d3b\u6e9d, s \u9e3f\u6c9f, H\u00f3ngg\u014du, \"Canal of the Wild Geese\" or \"Far-Flung Canal\") most likely preceded it. It linked the Yellow River near Kaifeng to the Si and Bian rivers and became the model for the shape of the Grand Canal in the north. The exact date of the Hong Gou's construction is uncertain; it is first mentioned by the diplomat Su Qin in 330 BC when discussing state boundaries. The historian Sima Qian (145\u201390 BC) knew of no historical date for it, placing his discussion of it just after the legendary works of Yu the Great; modern scholars now consider it to belong to the 6th century BC.\n\n\n=== Sui dynasty ===\n\nThe sections of the Grand Canal today in Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu provinces were in large part a creation of the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618), a result of the migration of China's core economic and agricultural region away from the Yellow River valley in the north and toward the southern provinces. Its main role throughout its history was the transport of grain to the capital. The institution of the Grand Canal by the Qin dynasty and the Sui dynasty, mostly the Sui, also obviated the need for the army to become self-sufficient farmers while posted at the northern frontier, as food supplies could now easily be shipped from south to north over the pass.By the year 600, there were major buildups of silt on the bottom of the Honggou canal, obstructing river barges whose drafts were too deep for its waters. The chief engineer of the Sui dynasty, Yuwen Kai, advised the dredging of a new canal that would run parallel to the existing canal, diverging from it at Chenliu (Yanzhou). The new canal was to pass not Xuzhou but Suzhou, to avoid connecting with the Si River, and instead make a direct connection with the Huai River just west of Lake Hongze. With the recorded labor of five million men and women under the supervision of Ma Shumou, the first major section of the Grand Canal was completed in the year 605\u2014called the Bian Qu. The Grand Canal was fully completed under the second Sui emperor, from the years 604 to 609, first by linking Luoyang to the Yangzhou (and the Yangtze valley), then expanding it to Hangzhou (south), and to Beijing (north). This allowed the southern area to provide grain to the northern province, particularly to troops stationed there. Running alongside and parallel to the canal was an imperial roadway and post offices supporting a courier system. The government also planted an enormous line of trees. The history of the canal's construction is handed down in the book Kaiheji ('Record of the Opening of the Canal').The earlier dyke-building project in 587 along the Yellow River\u2014overseen by engineer Liang Rui\u2014established canal lock gates to regulate water levels for the canal. Double slipways were installed to haul boats over when the difference in water levels were too great for the flash lock to operate.Between 604 and 609, Emperor Yang Guang (or Sui Yangdi) of the Sui dynasty ordered a number of canals be dug in a 'Y' shape, from Hangzhou in the south to terminate in (modern) Beijing and in the capital region along the Yellow River valley. When the canal was completed it linked the systems of the Qiantang River, the Yangtze River, the Huai River, the Yellow River, the Wei River and the Hai River. Its southern section, running between Hangzhou and the Yangtze, was named the Jiangnan River (the river \u2018South of the Yangtze\u2019). The canal's central portions stretched from Yangzhou to Luoyang; the section between the Yangtze and the Huai continued to the Shanyang River; and the next section connected the Huai to the Yellow River and was called the Tongji Channel. The northernmost portion, linking Beijing and Luoyang, was named the Yongji Channel. This portion of the canal was used to transport troops to what is now the North Korean border region during the Goguryeo-Sui Wars (598\u2013614). After the canal's completion in 609, Emperor Yang led a recorded 105 km (65 mi) long naval flotilla of boats from the north down to his southern capital at Yangzhou.The Grand Canal at this time was not a continuous, man-made canal, but a collection of often noncontiguous artificial channels and either canalized or natural rivers.\n\n\n=== Tang to Yuan dynasties ===\nAlthough the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) capital at Chang'an was the most thriving metropolis of China in its day, it was the city of Yangzhou\u2014in proximity to the Grand Canal\u2014that was the economic hub of the Tang era. Besides being the headquarters for the government salt monopoly and the largest pre-modern industrial production center of the empire, Yangzhou was also the geographical midpoint along the north-south trade axis, and so became the major center for southern goods shipped north. One of the greatest benefits of the canal system in the Tang dynasty\u2014and subsequent dynasties\u2014was that it reduced the cost of shipping grain that had been collected in taxes from the Yangtze River Delta to northern China. Minor additions to the canal were made after the Sui period to cut down on travel time, but overall no fundamental differences existed between the Sui Grand Canal and the Tang Grand Canal.By the year 735, it was recorded that about 149,685,400 kilograms (165,000 short tons) of grain were shipped annually along the canal. The Tang government oversaw canal lock efficiency and built granaries along the route in case a flood or other disaster impeded the path of shipment. To ensure smooth travel of grain shipments, Transport Commissioner Liu Yan (in office from 763 to 779) had special river barge ships designed and constructed to fit the depths of each section of the entire canal.After the An Shi Rebellion (755\u2013763), the economy of northern China was greatly damaged and never recovered due to wars and to constant flooding of the Yellow River. Such a case occurred in the year 858 when an enormous flood along the Grand Canal inundated thousands of acres of farmland and killed tens of thousands of people in the North China Plain. Such an unfortunate event could reduce the legitimacy of a ruling dynasty by causing others to perceive it as having lost the Mandate of Heaven; this was a good reason for dynastic authorities to maintain a smooth and efficient canal system.\n\nThe city of Kaifeng grew to be a major hub, later becoming the capital of the Song dynasty (960\u20131279). Although the Tang and Song dynasty international seaports\u2014the greatest being Guangzhou and Quanzhou, respectively\u2014and maritime foreign trade brought merchants great fortune, it was the Grand Canal within China that spurred the greatest amount of economic activity and commercial profit. During the Song and earlier periods, barge ships occasionally crashed and wrecked along the Shanyang Yundao section of the Grand Canal while passing the double slipways, and more often than not those were then robbed of the tax grain by local bandits. This prompted Qiao Weiyue, an Assistant Commissioner of Transport for Huainan, to invent a double-gate system known as the pound lock in the year 984. This allowed ships to wait within a gated space while the water could be drained to appropriate levels; the Chinese also built roofed hangars over the space to add further protection for the ships.Much of the Grand Canal south of the Yellow River was ruined for several years after 1128, when Du Chong decided to break the dykes and dams holding back the waters of the Yellow River in order to decimate the oncoming Jurchen invaders during the Jin\u2013Song wars. The Jurchen Jin dynasty continually battled with the Song in the region between the Huai River and the Yellow River; this warfare led to the dilapidation of the canal until the Mongols invaded in the 13th century AD and began necessary repairs.During the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368) the capital of China was moved to Beijing, eliminating the need for the canal arm flowing west to Kaifeng or Luoyang. A summit section was dug across the foothills of the Shandong massif during the 1280s, shortening the overall length by as much as 700 km (430 mi) (making the total length about 1,800 km (1,100 mi)) and linking Hangzhou and Beijing with a direct north-south waterway for the first time. As in the Song and Jin era, the canal fell into disuse and dilapidation during the Yuan dynasty's decline.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty restoration ===\n\nThe Grand Canal was renovated almost in its entirety between 1411 and 1415 during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644). A magistrate of Jining, Shandong sent a memorandum to the throne of the Yongle Emperor protesting the current inefficient means of transporting 4,000,000 dan (428,000,000 liters) of grain a year by means of transferring it along several different rivers and canals in barge types that went from deep to shallow after the Huai River, and then transferred back onto deep barges once the shipment of grain reached the Yellow River. Chinese engineers built a dam to divert the Wen River to the southwest in order to feed 60% of its water north into the Grand Canal, with the remainder going south. They dug four large reservoirs in Shandong to regulate water levels, which allowed them to avoid pumping water from local sources and water tables. Between 1411 and 1415 a total of 165,000 laborers dredged the canal bed in Shandong and built new channels, embankments, and canal locks.The Yongle Emperor moved the Ming capital from Nanjing to Beijing in 1403. This move deprived Nanjing of its status as chief political center of China. The reopening of the Grand Canal also benefited Suzhou over Nanjing since the former was in a better position on the main artery of the Grand Canal, and so it became Ming China's greatest economic center. The only other viable contender with Suzhou in the Jiangnan region was Hangzhou, but it was located 200 km (120 mi) further down the Grand Canal and away from the main delta. Even the shipwrecked Korean Choe Bu (1454\u20131504)\u2014while traveling for five months throughout China in 1488\u2014acknowledged that Hangzhou served not as a competitor but as an economic feeder into the greater Suzhou market. Therefore, the Grand Canal served to make or break the economic fortunes of certain cities along its route, and served as the economic lifeline of indigenous trade within China.\nThe scholar Gu Yanwu of the early Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912) estimated that the previous Ming dynasty had to employ 47,004 full-time laborers recruited by the lijia corv\u00e9e system in order to maintain the entire canal system. It is known that 121,500 soldiers and officers were needed simply to operate the 11,775 government grain barges in the mid-15th century.Besides its function as a grain shipment route and major vein of river borne indigenous trade in China, the Grand Canal had long been a government-operated courier route as well. In the Ming dynasty, official courier stations were placed at intervals of 35 to 45 km (22 to 28 mi). Each courier station was assigned a different name, all of which were popularized in travel songs of the period.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty and modern China ===\nThe Manchus invaded China in the mid-17th century, allowed through the northern passes by the Chinese general Wu Sangui once the Ming capital at Beijing had fallen into the hands of a rebel army. The Manchus established the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912), and under their leadership the Grand Canal was overseen and maintained just as in earlier times.\nIn 1855, the Yellow River flooded and changed its course, severing the course of the canal in Shandong. This was foreseen by a Chinese official in 1447, who remarked that the flood-prone Yellow River made the Grand Canal like a throat that could be easily strangled (leading some officials to request restarting the grain shipments through the East China Sea). In 1855 the dikes of the canal were opened to flood advancing troops of the Taiping Rebellion's Northern Expedition. Because of various factors\u2014the difficulty of crossing the Yellow River, the increased development of an alternative sea route for grain-ships, and the opening of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the Beijing-Hankou Railway\u2014the canal languished and for decades the northern and southern parts remained separate. Many of the canal sections fell into disrepair, and some parts were returned to flat fields. Even today, the Grand Canal has not fully recovered from this disaster. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the need for economic development led the authorities to order heavy reconstruction work.\nBy the 1990s, pollution in the canal had reached the point where boat and barge crews could tell when they were nearing Hangzhou by the stench of the visibly black water. A $250 million restoration project begun in 2001 has improved water quality to the point where it no longer smells, and is once again capable of supporting some fauna.The economic importance of the canal likely will continue. The governments of the Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces planned dredging meant to increase shipping capacity by 40 percent by 2012.\nOn June 22, 2014, The Grand Canal was listed as a World Heritage Site, at the 2014 Conference on World Heritage.\n\n\n=== Historical sections ===\nAs well as its present-day course, fourteen centuries of canal-building have left the Grand Canal with a number of historical sections. Some of these have disappeared, others are still partially extant, and others form the basis for the modern canal. The following are the most important, but do not form an exhaustive list.\n\n\n==== Jia Canal ====\nIn 12 BC, in order to solve the problem of the Grand Canal having to use 160 kilometers (100 mi) of the perilous course of the Yellow River in Northern Jiangsu, a man named Li Hualong created the Jia Canal. Named after the Jia River whose course it followed, it ran 140 kilometers (87 mi) from Xiazhen (modern Weishan) on the shore of Shandong's Weishan Lake to Suqian in Jiangsu. The construction of the Jia Canal left only 100 kilometers (62 mi) of Yellow River navigation on the Grand Canal, from Suqian to Huai'an, which by 1688 had been removed by the construction of the Middle Canal by Jin Fu.\n\n\n==== Nanyang New Canal ====\nIn 1566, to escape the problems caused by flooding of the Yellow River around Yutai (now on the western shore of Weishan Lake), the Nanyang New Canal was opened. It ran for 75 kilometers (47 mi) from Nanyang (now Nanyang Town, located in the center of Weishan Lake) to the small settlement of Liucheng (in the vicinity of modern Gaolou Village, Weishan County, Shandong) north of Xuzhou City. This change in effect moved the Grand Canal from the low-lying and flood-prone land west of Weishan Lake onto the marginally higher land to its east. It was fed by rivers flowing from east to west from the borders of the Shandong massif.\n\n\n==== Huitong Canal ====\nNorth of the Jizhou Canal summit section, the Huitong Canal ran downhill, fed principally by the River Wen, to join the Wei River at the city of Linqing. In 1289, a geological survey preceded its one-year construction. The Huitong Canal, built by an engineer called Ma Zhizhen, ran across sharply sloping ground and the high concentration of locks gave it the nicknames chahe or zhahe, i.e. 'the river of locks'. Its great number of feeder springs (between two and four hundred, depending on the counting method and season of the year) also led to it being called the quanhe or 'river of springs'.\n\n\n==== Jizhou Canal ====\nThis, the Grand Canal's first true summit section, was engineered by the Mongol Oqruq\u010di in 1238 to connect Jining to the southern end of the Huitong Canal. It rose to a height of 42 meters (138 ft) above the Yangtze, but environmental and technical factors left it with chronic water shortages until it was re-engineered in 1411 by Song Li of the Ming. Song Li's improvements, recommended by a local man named Bai Ying, included damming the rivers Wen and Guang and drawing lateral canals from them to feed reservoir lakes at the very summit, at a small town called Nanwang.\n\n\n==== Duke Huan's Conduit ====\nIn 369 AD, General Huan Wen of the Eastern Jin dynasty connected the shallow river valleys of the Huai and the Yellow. He achieved this by joining two of these rivers' tributaries, the Si and the Ji respectively, at their closest point, across a low watershed of the Shandong massif. Huan Wen's primitive summit canal became a model for the engineers of the Jizhou Canal.\n\n\n==== Yilou Canal ====\nThe Shanyang Canal originally opened onto the Yangtze a short distance south of Yangzhou. As the north shore of the Yangtze gradually silted up to create the sandbank island of Guazhou, it became necessary for boats crossing to and from the Jiangnan Canal to sail the long way around the eastern edge of that island. After a particularly rough crossing of the Yangtze from Zhenjiang, the local prefect realized that a canal dug directly across Guazhou would reduce the journey time and thus make the crossing safer. The Yilou Canal was opened in 738 AD and still exists, though not as part of the modern Grand Canal route.\n\n\n== Modern course ==\nThe Grand Canal nominally runs between Beijing and Hangzhou over a total length of 1,794 km (1,115 mi), however, only the section from Hangzhou to Jining is currently navigable. Its course is today divided into seven sections. From south to north these are the Jiangnan Canal, the Inner Canal, the Middle Canal, the Lu Canal, the South Canal, the North Canal, and the Tonghui River.\n\n\n=== Jiangnan Canal ===\n\nThis southernmost section of the canal runs from Hangzhou in Zhejiang, where the canal connects with the Qiantang River, to Zhenjiang in Jiangsu, where it meets the Yangtze. After leaving Hangzhou the canal passes around the eastern border of Lake Tai, through the major cities of Jiaxing, Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou before reaching Zhenjiang. \n\nThe Jiangnan (or \u2018South of the Yangtze\u2019) Canal is heavily utilized by barge traffic bringing coal and construction materials to the booming delta. It is generally a minimum of 100 meters wide in the congested city centers, and often two or three times this width in the neighboring countryside. In recent years, broad bypass canals have been dug around the major cities to reduce \u2018traffic jams\u2019.\nThe Suzhou section of the Jiangnan Canal flows through the western part of the city. It includes ten city gates and over 20 stone bridges of traditional design and historic areas that have been well preserved as well as temples and pavilions. \n\n\n=== Inner Canal ===\nThis \u2018Inner Canal\u2019 runs between the Yangtze and Huai'an in Jiangsu, skirting the Shaobo, Lake Gaoyou and Hongze lakes of central Jiangsu. Here the land lying to the west of the canal is higher than its bed while the land to the east is lower. Traditionally the Shanghe region west of the canal has been prone to frequent flooding, while the Xiahe region to its east has been hit by less frequent but immensely damaging inundations caused by failure of the Grand Canal levees. Recent works have allowed floodwaters from Shanghe to be diverted safely out to sea.\n\n\n=== Middle Canal ===\n\nThis \u2018Middle Canal\u2019 section runs from Huai'an to Weishan Lake, passing through Luoma Lake and following more than one course, the result of the impact of centuries of Yellow River flooding. After Pizhou, a northerly course passes through Tai'erzhuang to enter Weishan Lake at Hanzhuang bound for Nanyang and Jining (this course is the remnant of the New Nanyang Canal of 1566 \u2013 see below). A southerly course passes close by Xuzhou and enters Weishan Lake near Peixian. This latter course is less used today.\n\n\n=== Lu Canal ===\nAt Weishan Lake, both courses enter Shandong province. From here to Linqing, the canal is called the Lu or \u2018Shandong\u2019 Canal. It crosses a series of lakes\u2014Zhaoyang, Dushan and Nanyang\u2014which nominally form a continuous body of water. At present, diversions of water mean that the lakes are often largely dry land. North of the northernmost Nanyang Lake is the city of Jining. Further on, about 30 km (19 mi) north of Jining, the highest elevation of the canal (38.5 m or 126 ft above sea level) is reached at the town of Nanwang. In the 1950s a new canal was dug to the south of the old summit section. The old summit section is now dry, while the new canal holds too little water to be navigable. About 50 km (31 mi) further north, passing close by Dongping Lake, the canal reaches the Yellow River. By this point waterless, it no longer connects to the river. It reappears again in Liaocheng City on the north bank where, intermittently flowing through a renovated stone channel, it reaches the city of Linqing on the Shandong \u2013 Hebei border.\n\n\n=== Southern Canal ===\n\nThe fifth section of the canal extends for a distance of 524 kilometers (326 mi) from Linqing to Tianjin along the course of the canalized Wei River. Though one of the northernmost sections, its name derives from its position relative to Tianjin. The Wei River at this point is heavily polluted while drought and industrial water extraction have left it too low to be navigable. The canal, now in Hebei province, passes through the cities of Dezhou and Cangzhou. Although to spectators, the canal appears to be a deep waterway in these city centers, its depth is maintained by weirs and the canal is all but dry where it passes through the surrounding countryside. At its terminus, the canal joins the Hai River in the center of Tianjin City before turning north-west.\n\n\n=== Northern Canal and Tonghui River ===\nIn Tianjin the canal heads northwest, for a short time following the course of the Yongding, a tributary of the Hai River, before branching off toward Tongzhou on the edge of the municipality of Beijing. It is here that the modern canal stops and that a Grand Canal Cultural Park has been built. During the Yuan dynasty, a further canal on the Tonghui River connected Tongzhou with a wharf called the Houhai or \"rear sea\" in central Beijing. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, however, the water level in the Tonghui River dropped and it was impossible for ships to travel from Tongzhou to Beijing. Tongzhou then became the northern shipping terminus of the canal. Cargo was unloaded at Tongzhou and transported to Beijing by land. The Tonghui river still exists as a wide, concrete lined storm-channel and drain for the suburbs of Beijing.\n\n\n=== Eastern Zhejiang Canal ===\nThe Eastern Zhejiang Canal (simplified Chinese: \u6d59\u4e1c\u8fd0\u6cb3;; traditional Chinese: \u6d59\u6771\u904b\u6cb3;; pinyin: zh\u00e8d\u014dng y\u00f9nh\u00e9), also known as the Hangzhou\u2013Ningbo Canal (\u676d\u752c\u8fd0\u6cb3) is located in Zhejiang. Its west end is in Xixing Street, Binjiang District, Hangzhou City, crossing Cao'e River and Shaoxing City to its east end, the Yong River estuary in Ningbo City. The canal is 239 kilometers (149 mi) long. Early canal construction took place in the Shanyin old canal in Shaoxing City, in the Spring and Autumn period (approximately 771 to 476 BC). In the third century AD, an official named He Xun supervised the construction of Xixing Canal, establishing the complete Eastern Zhejiang Canal.\nIn the Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279), the capital was established at Linan, which meant that the Eastern Zhejiang Canal became an important shipping channel. From the Yuan Dynasty (1271\u20131368) to the Qing Dynasty (1644\u20131912), the Eastern Zhejiang Canal lost its privilege but still remained navigable. In recent years, because of newer modes of transportation, the canal has been gradually replaced. The reconstruction of the canal began in 2002, by 2007 it was partially navigable, and the renovation project finished in 2009, though the Ningbo section was not navigable until the end of 2013.\nIn May 2013, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was listed in the seventh group of Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level, and was included in the Grand Canal. In November 2008, as an extension of Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal and the passage between the Grand Canal and the Maritime Silk Road, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal was placed into the nomination file in the UNESCO World Heritage program. In 2014, with Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal and Sui & Tang Grand Canal, the Eastern Zhejiang Canal became one World Heritage site.\n\n\n== Elevations ==\nThough the canal nominally crosses the watersheds of five river systems, in reality the variation between these is so low that it has only a single summit section. The elevation of the canal bed varies from 1 m below sea level at Hangzhou to 38.5 m above at its summit. At Beijing it reaches 27 m, fed by streams flowing downhill from the mountains to the west. The water flows from Beijing toward Tianjin, from Nanwang north toward Tianjin, and from Nanwang south toward Yangzhou. The water level in the Jiangnan Canal remains scarcely above sea level (the Zhenjiang ridge is 12 meters higher than that of the Yangtze River).\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nFrom the Tang to Qing dynasties, the Grand Canal served as the main artery between northern and southern China and was essential for the transport of grain to Beijing. Although it was mainly used for shipping grain, it also transported other commodities and the corridor along the canal developed into an important economic belt. Records show that, at its height, every year more than 8,000 boats transported four to six million dan (240,000\u2013360,000 metric tons) of grain. The convenience of transport also enabled rulers to lead inspection tours to southern China. In the Qing dynasty, the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors made twelve trips to the south, on all occasions but one reaching Hangzhou.\nThe Grand Canal also enabled cultural exchange and political integration to occur between the north and south of China. The canal even made a distinct impression on some of China's early European visitors. Marco Polo recounted the Grand Canal's arched bridges as well as the warehouses and prosperous trade of its cities in the 13th century. The famous Roman Catholic missionary Matteo Ricci traveled from Nanjing to Beijing along the canal at the end of the 16th century.\nSince the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the canal has been used primarily to transport vast amounts of bulk goods such as bricks, gravel, sand, diesel and coal. The Jianbi shiplocks on the Yangtze are currently handling some 75,000,000 tons each year, and the Li Canal is forecast to reach 100,000,000 tons in the next few years.\nCurrently, ships can only travel up to Jining. The section from Jining to Beijing is not available for transport due to the silt deposit buildup from the Yellow River and lack of water sources. There are plans on restoring transportation up to Tai'an.\n\n\n=== South-North Water Transfer Project ===\n\nThe Grand Canal is currently being upgraded to serve as the Eastern Route of the South-North Water Transfer Project. Additional amounts of water from the Yangtze will be drawn into the canal in Jiangdu City, where a giant 400 m3/s (14,000 cu ft/s) pumping station was already built in the 1980s, and is then fed uphill by pumping stations along the route and through a tunnel under the Yellow River, from where it can flow downhill to reservoirs near Tianjin. Construction on the Eastern Route officially began on December 27, 2002, and water was supposed to reach Tianjin by 2012. However, water pollution has affected the viability of this project.\n\n\n== Notable travelers ==\nIn 1169, with China divided between the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty in the north and the Southern Song dynasty in the south, the Southern Song Emperor Xiaozong sent a delegation to the Jurchen to wish their ruler well for the New Year. A scholar-official named Lou Yue, secretary to the delegation, recorded the journey, much of which was made upon the Grand Canal, and submitted his Diary of a Journey to the North to the emperor on his return.In 1170 the poet, politician and historian Lu You traveled along the Grand Canal from Shaoxing to the river Yangtze, recording his progress in a diary.In the late 1200s, Marco Polo traveled extensively through China and his trips included time on the Grand Canal, then a major artery for shipping silk, porcelain and wine.In 1345 Arab traveler Ibn Battuta traveled China and journeyed through the Abe Hayat river (Grand Canal) up to the capital Khanbalik (Beijing).\nIn 1488, the shipwrecked Korean scholar Choe Bu traveled the entire length of the Grand Canal on his way from Zhejiang to Beijing (and on to Korea), and left a detailed account of his trip.\nIn 1600, Matteo Ricci traveled to Beijing from Nanjing via the Grand Canal waterway to gain the support of the Wanli Emperor of the Ming dynasty with the help of Wang Zhongde, the Director of the Board of Rites in the central government of China at the time.In 1793, after a largely fruitless diplomatic mission to Jehol, a large part of Lord Macartney's embassy returned south to the Yangtze delta via the Grand Canal.In 1848  Robert Fortune reached Hang Chow Foo by the Grand Canal in his quest for tea plants.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Reinvigoration of the Grand Canal\nHangzhou Section of The Grand Canal \u2013 EN.GOTOHZ.COM",

          "Went on a 45 min cruise along the grand canal - wonderful. Tranquil water, clean waterways, old buildings and perfect weather. At the end we disembarked and walked through Shan Tang St which was packed with local people buying their fruit and vegetables for the day. Excellent",
          "I've been in similar river tours all over Asia, this one was nice but nothing extraordinary. I didn't like the fact that the captain of our boat tried very persistently to persuade us to buy useless souvenirs.",
          "Suzhou Ancient Grand Canal has vast history behind. With today's technology system, the canal could be improve for the better future.",
          "Lots to see and do here. You MUST take a Sampan ride down the canal. It was the highlight of our visit. The wonderful elderly man driving the boat sang to us while steering us through the water. It was fantastic! Also along the canal are tons of shops and restaurants and",
          "It was perhaps our fault but I had wanted to take the evening cruise but was unable to find the place to get the boat. We did see the boats but the place marked, on the map, as the dock was closed and had apparently been moved. However the area around the canal was interesting",
          "Optional package on our tour and I enjoyed it. About 40 minutes up and down the canal, taking in the old style buildings and the way things were. Our guide was knowledgeable about the area and explained it thoroughly.",
          "Traveled the Canal as part of a Nexus Tour. The positive aspect was to see the households from the river, and have a feeling of stepping back in time. The negative was that there was not a commentary describing the history of the canal and its local residents.",
          "This was a great river cruise. You got to see ancient China mix with modern day. People laundering in the river alongside motor boats. Such a cool experience. It's not long in duration (90 min) therefore it wasn't boring. Anything longer however would have been to much.",
          "You can soak up the atmosphere of this place and criss cross the canal if you explore the local shops and market. Don't be afraid to haggle to get the price price and sample the local food.",
          "A rickety boat touring the backyards of homes, expect lots of hanging laundry, garbage and general views of unsanitary riverway.",
          "We did a half hour or so boat trip on the canal as part of a bus tour from Shanghai and loved it. You feel like you're stepping back in time as you sail past the buildings overhanging the water. This is no Venice, though. The houses are not palaces but rather run down dwellings",
          "2 weeks ago we took a boat ride on the Grand canal.Both side you can see houses and stores.Houses are very old.",
          "I am not sure what is actually Grand Canal at Suzhou, but I guess that most of the reviews here refer to the \"ancient moat\" which forms a square around the old city. There is an exercise trail around this, which I believe is 17km long. We walked part of it from a little north of",
          "A bland, 30-minute ride on a wooden boat. No commentary was provided on the buildings and houses we were passing by on the river.",
          "I was staying for two weeks in Shanghai and wanted to experience the China countryside. Many locals recommended this trip. I went on a Greyline tour and was not disappointed. After touring an Ancient residence and the city gate we arrived at the grand canals. Although",

          "Grand Canal, length of 1800 km. the longest canal in the world, like the Great Wall of China, is a miracle of engineering. The first section of the channel had been dug early as 400 BC However, the main part has been dug in the 7th century AD. The most amazing thing is that the",
          "Happened upon this place in the evening while strolling around the area around our hotel. The Grand Canal is lit with colors and bridges are outlined with lights. Magical.",
          "Best at night when you can see all the lights from different colors along the way, during the day it's less enchanting",
          "A cruise on the Suzhou Grand Canal raises expectations of a Venetian excursion in China. The Grand Canal is similar in size to the smaller Venetian canals and really Grand Canal is a misnomer. However if you enjoy canal longboats or small boat (say up to 20 people) river",
          "This shows the cultural history of the early chinese and is worthwhile to wander around or better still take the tour on the Canal.",
          "A boat trip down the Grand Canal is like stepping back in time into Old China. You pass people's houses, people sitting on the banks, people taking photographs. A relaxing way to take in the remnants of an old culture",
          "The lights were on inside the boat for most of the tour, could not see anything outside. They were just trying to sell CDs and postcards. Not worth the trip, very disappointed in this tour.",
          "The southern part of huge canal from Beijing to Hangzhou is not used for trade ships now, only for touristic purposes.",
          "We took a tour boat on the Suzhou section of the Grand Canal and into the old town. Well worth it for just being on the Grand Canal but also really interesting to see the river side of the old town",
          "Actually you can see in all Suzhou this things because most of Suzhou place have water and lake so if you have limited time you should know which place more interesting for you because Suzhou big and have many many history",
          "Often called the \"Venice of the Orient\", this doesn't quit meet that lofty expectation. However, don't let that dissuade you from visiting, as it's still a great boat ride tour past various stone bridges, gardens, restaurants and buildings of various types and in various stages",
          "We took the night ride. Just lightings along the canal. The ferry has tour guide but only speak Chinese. Don't understand a word. A short singing performance was also presented but only sand Chinese song with no introduction explained in English. At the end of the ride,",
          "Unfortunately this was a very nice spot but we saw in the dark with it lite up with lanterns. Large stone steps to get down to the canal. Slippery when it's wet. Rides on the canal make a nice peaceful time.",
          "Suzhou is a city richly endowed with attractions. The Lingering Gardens and the canals are must sees. The Canal leads into a series of minor canals where dwellings, shops and restaurants face the water and use it for transport and commerce.The waterways were remarkably free of",
          "We wandered along the Grand Canal. There are nice (and restorated?) paths, very green and peaceful. You can see also local people talking with each other or gambling.",
          "Take the boat ride up and back on the canal. It takes maybe 45 minutes to one hour. Cruise under bridges that are 1,500 years old and down smaller canals with very cool old residences and buildings. Our whole family loved to cruise.",
          "Since we were the guest of the Pan Pacific hotel, the entrance fee to the Pagoda park was included. After checking out the city wall, we entered the Suzhou Canal via the exit of the City Wall. Nice view of the Grand Canal and its arched bridges. We enjoyed our gondola ride,",
          "The Venice of China, lots of canals leaving the main canal so you see the little scenes of everyday life from the gentle waterborne journey. Good for photos too",
          "we took a boat ride on a tributary of the Grand Canal while on a day trip to Suzhou, the tributary ran through a small shopping precinct and concluding the ride we were able to walk along the narrow streets and shop.",
          "I would definitely suggest this experience for all. The smells emanating from the various buildings all added to the overall adventure. The canal ran the gamut from lovely gardens, pagodas to women doing their laundry. All this drifting by as you take in the ancient buildings",
          "Our tour group had an optional full day trip including lunch and cruise on the canal. We took the bus there and the pagodas, old fashioned wooden boats, centuries older than the Venetian gondolas, we're waiting for us. Seven or eight of us in each boat and the captain even",
          "Our tour group arranged a boat ride for us on the Suzhou Grand Canal. We boarded the boat near the train station. As the ride began, we went past formal gardens and a downtown area with tall buildings. As we proceeded under bridges and into the narrower channels, we were close",
          "Our Chinese driver suggested we take this canal ride even though my travel companion was leary we did so. What a treat and great way to see the beautiful city of Suzhou!",
          "This was a very interesting and enjoyable boat ride along the Grand Canal. This is a man-made canal over 2400 years old. Along the way you will pass under several bridges and see many white-washed old houses along the canal. These houses are over 200 years old and have a lot of",
          "We went on a cruise in one of the smaller vessels with our tour group. Was very impressed to see what it would be like to live along the canal. Clothes hanging to dry, people sitting to cool down with the breeze.",
          "I thought this canal trip wouldn't be all that great but seeing this old city from the canal made the cruise very interesting. We don't have many chances to see how people live on canals and take photos from the water so this was an eyeopener .",
          "Our group of seven enjoyed this canal tour and seeing modern buildings, centuries-old boat bays, gardens, temples and busy streets from an unusual vantage point. We passed people hanging laundry out their back windows and a wedding party having their pictures taken on a",
          "Sadly it poured with rain during our visit but an amazing sight and gives understanding into the past and how people lived and worked.",
          "We went in a smaller boat that could go up some of the smaller branches of the grand canal. The canal itself if very impressive with it's many bridges, but the smaller waterways are what make it interesting. Cruising fast homes and seeing the life style was terrific.",
          "Went to China in May this year and went on a small boat along the Grand Canal of Suzhou, it was really great to see the oldest man made canal in the world, went past peoples houses that are still living along the canal and they were all so friendly waving as we went past,",
          "Took subway line 2 west 2km of the central area of Suzhou (area enclosed on 4 sides by canals or moats.) Walked along the canal for quite a way in park-like setting on the canal edge. Many tour boats came by but no commercial boats or barges spotted. Most bridges are modern for",
          "We had some free time to explore a small section of the Grand Canal. There are of course shops selling a range of goods, some of which are quite different to the usual tourist fare. There are many photogenic old buildings along the canal banks and a few cafes where you take a",
          "This is a great area tucked away in a huge city. We arrived and took a gondola ride about a mile down river all while being serenaded. We were dropped off on a small street that bordered the canal on one side and small shops on the other. Great for snacks and souvenir shopping.",
          "There were 6 of us on one Gondola boat, and it was a great experience. Our boat was piloted by a senior lady, who also sang towards the end. Venice, Italy should be called \"Suzhou of the West\", as Suzhou has been around for a few more centuries than Venice! Suzhou is second, in",
          "We were on a Grand Circle Travel 20 day trip around China. Up early and on the road at 8AM for a shot trip to the Shanghai train station where we took the high speed bullet train to Suzhou in China's fabled Silk Region. The weather is overcast and around 65 F this morning,",
          "They call the cancels the Venice of China. It certainly lives up to the title and more. This the real China away from the factory's and high rise. Walk the back streets as well its a real people's market. A must do in China.",
          "Beautiful peaceful little town hidden away in China. Canals right through the main area and also a fresh food market. Lovely place to sit and relax and take some amazing photos. Lots of wedding parties here also taking photographs. You can also go down the canals in gondolas",
          "If you want to feel atmosphere, first take a little walk allong the canal and then take a ride. It will give you an insight into the way of life of the people who live alongside the waterways. This ride was a lovely relaxing 40 minute cruise along the canal. Lots of history to",
          "An interesting ride that gave an insight into the way of life of the people who live alongside the waterways. The boatmen are keen to sell postcards, playing cards etc during a ride.",
          "We took a boat ride up the canal which then took us further up into the smaller canals where we saw the traditional old buildings and had a fairly close up glimpse into the homes of the local people. It is a very enjoyable cruise and highly recommended. We disembarked our cruise",
          "This was a lovely relaxing 40 minute cruise along the canal. Lots of history to be seen along the canal, loved the crazy little steps from building down to the waters edge and the gorgeous bridges. Passed by the Opera building where we could hear practice which lent to the",

          "Signed up for a boat trip to the Grand Canal after visiting Humble Administrator's Garden. The boat trip itself was interesting, but the guide hijacked us afterwards with promises of more important sights \u666f\u70b9\u3002 These important sights turned out to be a shopping trip to a huge",
          "I know it is not a great spectaculair thing to see. But when you are in Suzhou or any other town next to the Grand Canal look at the canal and keep in mind that this Grand Canal is hand made .It runs from Beijing to Hangzhou it is 1700 km long and there for the longest man made",
          "We booked a boat tour and ended up being on a chinese speaking tour, it was still ok. I had no idea what was being said but had the same views. My enjoyment of this could have been hampered by being pretty tired (we landed that morning from ny).",
          "It is that you see almost Chinese infleunces but otherwise you think that you are in Venice. Very nice to be with a lot of details.",
          "We went on a cruise along the canals, what a marvelous piece of engineering! Lots and lots of photos of the wonderful old homes and bridges you pass. I very much enjoyed this even though it was raining lightly",
          "This canal is build for king 'Qian Long' from 'Man Qing' dynasty. Purpose of it is for the king to come to jiang nan by boat, what a big project on that time. Now become tourist area.",
          "Took a sampans ride up where the locals sang some songs... very very peaceful (different from Venice)! Walked around the shops as well and it was quite beautiful!",
          "Imagining Marco Polo riding these waters is easy and brings historic perspective to the area. That said, it is hard to be romantic when objectively looking at the poverty, dirt, and poor living conditions. The boat we were on sold playing cards for about $1.50 with images of",
          "Having been to Venice, I actually found Suzhou much more beautiful. The boat trip through the canal was very peaceful and observing village life was very interesting. On the way in, there were some interesting fruit being sold on the streets: they are encased in molds when",
          "unique trip up the canals in a rather funny old boat with a very proud captain with his official 4 striped blazer and cap. apart from the interesting sights and we had a guy on board selling things ( we couldn't escape!) we was so entertaining, selling DVDs hats playing cards, (",
          "I am not sure if the tpalce mentioned in the title is this one but Zhouzhuang is THE place to visit if you go to Suzhou. It is a town with canals and small houses all along the banks of the tributaries. You can stay there too in small hotels and have a greatest experience of",
          "Taking a short trip on a boat through the canals of old Suzhou is definitely worth doing if the weather is nice. No matter if you are a there as a couple enjoying the time together or a small family which wants to get an idea of the old China. If you are lucky, the guy steering",
          "Seeing the city by water lets you see how residents once lived and traveled. Houses and shops back up to the canals and business is carried out directly with those on the canals. In places the canals are wide enough for one narrow 'boat' only, a logistic challenge.",
          "After several days of the hustle and bustle of life in Beijing this was really a glimpse of the China village life I was really looking for. Not sure of the cost of this 1 hour cruise as it was part of a package deal but would highly recommend it.",
          "This is the longest and oldest surviving man made waterway in the world. Suzhou is known as the Venice of the east and having been to Venice I can vouch that this leaves Venice for dead. The canal is amazing when considering it is man made and is hundreds of years old.",
          "After the garden visits on a hot day, we cooled off with the canal boat trip. This is a fleet of motorized boats, with wood and glass cabins, seating 30 or more. There was a breeze and it was fine,later the crew insisted on using the AC. This is a working canal running behind",
          "Visited with a group of 38. Took a gondola ride (it was an 18-22 seater, so forget the romantic visions) through this ancient waterway. he ride itself was only some 40 mins but we all had a great time. The locals were very happy to see us and could be seen waving and posing for",
          "It wasn't the Grand Canal of Venice but it was appealing nonetheless. In Venice all the buildings, river boats and street vendors are an array of colors but in China things are much more muted. Lots of black, white, gray...with hints if red here and there because red is",
          "You can sit inside or out on the boat. All sorts of architecture and activities along the banks. Worth doing.",
          "You do not need to get to the wharf by yourself to take the boat ride. There is a lot of sales counters inside hotels that you can engage. They will send you to the wharf and send you to anywhere (most probably town centre) after the boat ride. It was a nice ride, but I think",
          "The canals are really beautiful with old houses lining the banks giving a real picture of the history of the city.",
          "Got dropped there in a taxi and went up to the desk to book our tickets. Was told that we needed to have 5 people and we only had 2. Nothing on trip advisor to let us know these minimums. So we tried to get another taxi and a Chinese girl walked past us and got into the taxi we",

          "Very busy lining up for boats, hawkers trying to sell their wares at wharf. Fruit sellers. Easy comfy seating in the boat, relaxed hour on the canals. See history, architecture, how they live, store water & do their washing. Pluck ducks & geese. Give them a friendly wave.",
          "The river cruise on the Suzhou ancient grand canal was fantastic, it was tranquil, peaceful and historical, it is like a time machine to have brought people back to the old era. It is like to watch an old movie telling the story in the past.",
          "We did a boat cruise along the Ancient Grand Canal in Suzhou. It was great seeing the old buildings and getting a feel for the life of the locals. It was also interesting to stroll through the market.",

          "A good 50 minute boat ride on the canals, quaint houses lining the canal and seeing how the people of this area live. A very old part of Suhou which is being preserved - goverment help with maintaining the houses as it is a real heritage area. Recommended if you have time.",
          "A great way to see the bridges and houses that are along the canal. Air conditioned boats take you down narrow canals and along the wide grand canal. You really feel like you are back when only rivers were used to move goods and people around. Great history lesson.",
          "Its close to the tiger hill, and don't compare with Venice, its totally different with Venice, except the waterways, there is no historical building or house boats or water transport. just some tourists boat, one i approach said to me, there is not enough people so the man",
          "Nice way to pass an hour and see what you can not from the road side. The crew were very helpful and friendly which made the trip enjoyable. As we were coming back to the landing area they started to sell hats and creams but did not force you to buy. Well worth going just for",
          "It was interesting to see the circuitry of small waterways that were once a main trade avenue for imperial China in Suzhou. It made a nice visit as we were leaving Shanghai on route to the airport to leave for our next destination.",
          "The canal offers many opportunities for trips. Book a boat and enjoy the sites of the canal. It is know as the Venice of the East and is so worth the price of admission.",
          "After getting around the fact of the boat sitting very low in the water, once under way we had a very enlightening cruise. We were allowed to go up on deck once we got past a particular point, where all the houses backed onto the canal. Here you could see how the people here",
          "We enjoyed our canal ride. Very pretty and good photo opportunities of the small houses and restaurants along the narrow canals. There are some lovely little bridges along the way and nice cafes. Although it is charming, it is nowhere near the Venice of the east. Do not come",
          "Take a short cruise along the ancient canal and see the local living from a few meters distance and pass along lovely area full of bridges and decorations and people visiting on the ground. it is about half an hour long cruise only but very charming.",
          "One of those things you would do when in town, but I would not go there just for this and as for being described as the \"Venice of the East\", does not hold a candle to it!",
          "This might be a touristy thing to do but it is something that I enjoyed a lot. From the boat, you can see that this area is still home to many people and not just shops for the visitors. Certainly not like Venice with its grandiose palaces, it was still very unique and",
          "A short stop at Suzhou Grand Canal if you are going to Suzhou ancient water village. Won't take much of your time but don't purposely go there if its not your direction. Its a bridge that resembles grand canal.",
          "Totally enjoyed the boat ride and the breeze on top of the boat. Manage to catch the sunset scenery. A must go and experience activity if u are in suzhou",
          "Calling Suzhou the Venice of the East is a bit of a stretch, but a cruise down the Grand Canal but especially off on to some of the smaller waterways is something special. I have read reviews where some people were not particularly impressed but the route we took was lovely. It",
          "Take your time and enjoy the scenery around. The part of the canal you are visiting had been cleaned and maintained during the last 10 years. Also take a short boat ride around the many private gardens.",
          "This inexpensive boat ride was a highlight, but it depends on who is steering your boat down the side canal. Each boat sat 6, and we were paddled motorless along a smooth, quiet waterway which parallels the main village street at the end. The woman steering our boat was quite a",
          "I decided to join a tour for a Dragon Boat ride down the Grand Canal from Pinjiang Street and I thought it was quite interesting. I am not sure if there are English Tours available but it was disappointing that the entire commentary was in Chinese and I didn't have an",

          "Take a short cruise and view old & new dwellings from the canal. Most trips go to the 1000yo Wuman bridge and gate house Panmen part of ancient walled Suzhou. Allow 1 to 2 hours",
          "There are cruises during the day, but the evening cruises are much more attractive. The canal was started in 486 BC by king Fuchai of the state of Wu for trading and military purposes. Subsequent rulers have increased the length of the original canal to what is now known as",
          "A lovely ride along the canal showing some of the traditional house built many years ago. All the houses had steps leading down to the canal and were traditionally decorated with intricate wooden features.",
          "I guess no visit to Suzhou would be complete without a boat ride on the canal. It is a water town called 'Venice of the East', although the comparison is not justified. I would still recommend it if you have the time, you get to see the area from a different vantage point, but",
          "Got to know that this tour starts from different places and takes different routes. I can only comment on the one we took. The boat was good, and the price was also ok 80 CNY for a 45 minute ride. But the route taken was not at all pleasant. The water was smelly and the houses",
          "Quite amazing that, 2,500 years ago, the city fathers were able to construct an artificial waterway the width of the Seine or the Thames all around the walled city of Suzhou. The canal and the city wall were the main lines of defence in what must have been very bloody times,",
          "The ancient Grand Canal of China is an incredible feat of engineering, however there is not really much to see going through Suzhou. The main interest for me was going up the smaller side canals, where only smaller boats can make the journey. The houses back directly on to the",
          "It was so beautiful. We took a boat ride down the canal with the gondola paddler singing to us. It was an incredible experience. I absolutely loved it.",
          "Nice way to see the waterworld view of Suzhou in a boat. Checkout the houses and people washing clothes in the murky waters as you cruise past.",
          "A small trip to definitely take whilst in Suzhou. To see China's golden waterway was an eye opener and it allowed us to realize how the people lived and commuted to the many places.",
          "We just returned from a 13 day trip of China with Gate 1Travel. It was an amazing cultural experience. Our guide, Joan, was exceptional. Her knowledge and attention to detail made for a memorable trip. I would highly recommend the day in Suzhou. The sampan boat ride on the canal",
          "We went on a boat ride down the canal. It was very different than the street side. You see the back side of people homes & businesses. It was nice, but, you could tell it was very old. The canal runs directly behind the houses (meaning if they stepped out the back they would",
          "We took a boat ride up the canal and while it was very pleasant there really isn't much to see along the shore of the Grand Canal until the boat turns into the narrower canals that run through the old town. The trip was worth it to see the narrow canals and the houses that",

          "The boat ride is not long but very nice and relaxing, you get to see people getting married and taking pictures, people selling their trinkets, everyone on land is waving to you and the surrounding area has beautiful gardens and also a silk factory.",
          "Take a boat ride and explore this Ancient Grand Canal, which by the way is beautiful. It's not too long and you can take really nice pictures. Highly recommended!",
          "It's a short ride down the canal and back again, we had envisioned a longer boat ride. The views along the canal are really interesting though. The boat operators are friendly and happy, and bring out their souvenirs before they dock. I think there was only one other boat on the",
          "We went on a boat into the canal. It was interesting but you could see signs of povety. The water was murky looking. However other people walking around the area were cheery and friendly.",
          "They say that Suzhou is the asiatic Venice .. I can't really confirm that but it was a nice tour in the grand canal",
          "Very interesting area of Suzhou there are no likes or dislikes it's just all part of the experiNce of your visit",
          "Know about this Grand Canal from history, when I was there, the first impression is : Its not as grand as I think. The view is nice, different experience. There is a temple, which is also interesting,",
          "China is wide large country that offers more than foolish comparisons. We can not call Venice any city that is crossed by canals. The magnificent of the italian city is not comparable. The canal is absolutely poor, just some nice walks along the river. No interesting buildings.",
          "Very interesting trip along the canals that enable you to see both the newer commercial areas of the city as well as many traditional canal homes and older areas. As lights come on at dusk you can see a very different side of the area and enjoy the changing face of the buildings",
          "We have done this during the day as well as at night. Both are very nice. At night, the buildings are lite, during the day you see more detail. No visit to Suzhou would be complete without a boat ride on the canal.",
          "We were part of a tour group that all went together for a boat ride up and back on the canal. I liked the chance to see the residences and other local areas that backed up to the canal. Many of the people in and near them were friendly and waved to us, and it was interesting to",

          "On a guided tour with Hayes and Javis, whilst staying in Shanghai, we were offered the chance to visit the Suzhou waterways, and despite the 2 hour coach journey to Suzhou, we were very glad we took the opportunity! Really interesting place to see how the locals live, whist",

          "Luckily we had a much smaller boat to ourselves, not one jam packed with tourists. The Grand Canal itself is very wide and is has some nice green areas and sculptures either side. Found it a bit more interesting once we had got down to the smaller canals which had shops, houses",
          "I actually travelled far from my hotel to this place, only to be disappointed by the price of a boat ride and scenery. Historic significance aside, you are likely to enjoy a ride down the streams of Shantang Street or Pingjiang Road more than here.",
          "A 45 minute canal boat ride provided a short but wonderful view into \"old\" Suzhou and how these small canals were an essential part of daily life. It also expanded understanding of how the whole waterway system connected into the ancient Grand Canal.",
          "This was a real immersion into the Chinese way of life. It feels like life has stood still in this place. Ancient houses line the canal and ordinary people go about their lives along the canal edges. Cleaning pots and pans, washing clothes and even brushing their teeth in this",
          "Canal ride was ok as you can take in the sights of the black and white old houses along the canal. But this pales in comparison the the Ancient water town Gondola tour of the water ways which was beautiful in tongli. The walk along the narrow alley ways through the market was a",
          "I was glad to have taken the boat ride just to relax. There were only three of us aside from the boat driver. The boat ride was good. We saw some interesting looking houses along the way. I have seen the canal a few years ago but did not take the boat so it was nice to grab",
          "How this item is ranked so high on Suzhou's to do list is beyond belief. As one approaches the foreshore, for the location given, one is met by a number of dilapidated buildings. There are no clear signs on the services on offer. Please give this a miss.",

          "We absolutely loved this! It's very neat, and a must see if you have more than one day in Shanghai. It reminded me more of Amsterdam than Venice, and it is quite impressive. Bring a camera for some great views and people watching.",
          "Since we were on a tour, I'm not sure which location we visited. This was by far my favorite event of the tour of Suzhou. The market place prior to getting on one of the canal boats had unique items and wasn't the same Market feel you usually encounter. The ride on the canal",

          "There are so many canals, all over Suzhou, vestiges of the city's history in the most strategic of places in China, where the east-west main river, the Yangtze, crosses the north-south main canal, the Grand Canal. For centuries, Suzhou has been one of the richest cities in",
          "We took a cruise in a small boat along the Grand Canal. It was a great way to see Suzhou as it really is. We passed many houses in a lower class neighborhood and had many views of people's wash hanging out their windows to dry. The ride was reminiscent of the canals of Venice",
          "We took the boat ride as part of our tour. It was good to see the local life around the canal. It's a little depressing seeing the poorer side of life but I was very impressed that it's not being hidden from view as happens in many cities of the world. The boat captains have no",
          "It was a nice diversion to see part of a city from the water. The trip was pastoral and gave a glimpse of life on the banks of the canal. We were the only passengers on our boat.",
          "Great experience which felt like we had just stepped back in time but in fact is what I called old china but the true China you have to see when you go to Suzhou. The City is modern and new this part is traditional and eye opening. You get to see different aspects of theirs",
          "This was why I went to China to see the real people of China. Other main attractions were necessary, but seeing the real China was fantastic",
          "The boat trip - unlike some other occasions - will let you just sit, watch and relax. Nobody will want to sell you Rolex or other staff. And you will see on the one side ancient Suzhou architecture, but on the other side normal daily life. Take some refreshment with you,",
          "our group took a trip up and back. our local guide translated for the boat guide. the fact that people still on the canals made it fascinating as you had glimpses into different areas.",

          "We had a lovely boat trip on the canal - experiencing how China looked way back. There were many chinese people alongside the canal, doing their daily chores. Although we did not get off the boat, we had a good idea what was going on in the old town. People washing their",
          "Our boat trip on the Suzhou Canal was a highlight of our trip. The old houses are well kept and show the old way of life, before the modern city was built around the historic centre. We got off the boat at one point and walked through the old narrow streets through a market area",
          "For some reason we thought there would be more to it. It was okay and the boat drivers did a good job avoiding other boats. The tour guide gave a good history of this canal.",
          "This is one of the best trips I took while in China. The ride is quiet and peaceful and a chance to see the \"old China\" that we have read about. If you can, have the boat stop at a local market and get out and have a look around. The people in the market are friendly and",
          "The boats trips take about an hour. The moat part of the trip is pretty standard but the canal part allows you to get a glimpse of how life used to be for the Chinese ... living next to the water & using it to meet all of your needs. Some of the buildings are very photogenic.",
          "I highly recommend a boat tour of the canals. A peaceful ride along the canals is reasonably priced and worth the money. Great for artistic pictures and seeing the back roads and alleys of the town.",
          "We took an old rusty boat onto the canal which worried me a little but it was worth seeing the way the people actually live. Not in the high rises which remain empty. We saw people washing their clothes in the canal and also fishing in it. I watched as a cat played with a rat",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the cruise and were glad that we had an English speaking translator as the skipper did not speak English.",

          "Had really been looking forward to this having seen all the hype in various travel brochures, but in reality most of what you see is people's scruffy back yards and washing. And the canal boats are closed in so your view is limited anyway. If you are pushed for time I suggest",
          "A bit like a theme park but beautiful at the same time. Along Shantang street and along the canal are quaint shops and chinese tea houses. I also recommend taking a cruise down the canal to see the heritage buildings. Worth a visit if in Suzhou and as a day trip from Shanghai.",
          "I just loved it's uniquenes. They call it t he Venice of China but it's a shame to do that. It has its own unique history and design. It's not chocolate box pretty but just fascinating and a step back in time",

          "Actually it is inside the Shanghai's metropolitan area. You can reach there by subway line 17. There are several water towns near Shanghai but Zhujiajiao is the best I have seen. There are gondolas riding on the canals. They are a bit pricey but it may be worth trying if you are",

          "Not a \u201c tourist attraction \u201c but rather a genuine South China historic water village ! It is very quaint and similar to Venice with Chinese culture. Escape the urban sprawl of Shanghai \u2013 about 90 minutes drive \u2013 and experience this authentic village traversed by water canals.",

          "It takes only an hour from Shanghai to this small water town. It's a different experience worth going with many monuments. We enjoyed a small boat cruise as part of the entrance ticket. There are some cafes, restaurants (traditional & modern), gift shop, clothes and shoes, etc.",
          "Really enjoyed this little day trip - great to experience another side to Shanghai getting of the city into a village environment. It felt like a China version of Venice, and just as crowded. Would highly recommend. Make sure you go to the Kezhi Gardens. Give yourself at",
          "This site was quite a drive from Shanghai (about an hour) but well worth the visit - even on a rainy day, You can have a lovely little ride on a boat around the canals and see the sights from there. Very atmospheric! There are lots of little shops to visit that are clustered",
          "It's a typical south old china water town. South of China is famous for it water town. The water in the town is dirty, can't swim of course. But the Town is nicely suited with the small river. Many touristy food and snacks over there as well souvenir shops.",

          "I was very much looking forward to discovering one of the \"Water Town\" surrounding Shanghai. IN my humble opinion, it is not worth the drive, minimum 90 minutes from center of Shanghai. Not much to see, not clean, not well organized. We spent 1 hour walking around and came back",

          "During the first trip to Shanghai, I did not go because I was not sure where to take the bus to Zhujiajiao. But it is rather simple to get there. If you stay near Peoples Square or Peoples Park, bus stop is in the walking distance. If you are not sure, ask your taxi driver",
          "Very old town, fun to go thru and see all the little shops and restaurants, lots of interesting foods ( to say the least ). We went to the Fish Spa there, that was a really fun experience. This area looks how I thought parts of China would like.",
          "We were offered to visit this town as a day trip, supposedly it was going to be very nice.\u00f1 since this is where a few rivers converge. Well it was disappointing. There is not really to much to see, it will take you 30 minutes to visit the town and it will take about 90 minutes",

          "I really enjoyed just walking around this area. I think it\u2019s really beautiful. It is also really nice that you can get to it by metro (line 17). I do think that it is a) good to give yourself enough time for this place and b) good to visit in the off season if you can. We",

          "While the town is quaint and picturesque, it is tiny compared to THE Venice. So, there is little to do besides walk the streets, shop for trinkets and eat. A visit will consume no more than 2 or 3 hours. Hard to say it is worth the considerable amount of time it takes to get",
          "It's just fabulous - how blessed I feel to come here. Fabulous vibe - great street food - don't panic if you smell stinky tofu - the smell won't kill you ! It's like Venice but less commercial.",
          "I took the new subway line here and it\u2019s pretty easy to get to. There are two ticket centres if you want to buys a ticket for the sites; one north of the town (follow road signs to car park) and one south on Xinfeng Road. You only need a ticket to enter sites, otherwise it\u2019s",
          "This in an quite and romantic town I highly recommend To visit.I want To come back there for visiting the other \"old venetian\"town. I recommend a small cruise on the river with the boat",
          "We took a train to People\u2019s Square then walked to Pu An Lu to take the express bus. The bus journey took about 1.5 hours. Upon arrival at the terminal station, walked out to the main road and turn left. Then turn right when you see the big red ZHU JIA JIAO (in Chinese",
          "Very picturesque. Make sure to see the Governors house which includes an excellent garden. Also, take a gondola ride.",
          "Just wow! We knew what to expect as ten years ago we\u2019d been to Zhouzhuang but we thought Zhujiajiao was even better. It helped that it was glorious sunshine (things always look better in the sunshine) and it had been torrential rain in Zhouzhuang due to Typhoon Wipha but it",
          "From shanghai railway station ,we took a subway ,it was a quite long trip ,need to take a bus to particular place which cost 2 rmb,from the bus station we need to take a another bus to the village which cost around 10 to 15 rmb,it will be around 90 minutes travel from",
          "I visited the ZhuJiaJiao in Dec 2017. It's a lovely and quaint water town with lots of small eateries and cafes. There were not a lot of tourists, hence it was very pleasant for us to have a leisurely stroll along the canal. Great place to take loads of photos for avid",
          "It was a long trip with a far amount of traffic as expected on a Sunday especially on a Sunday afternoon. Place was not to busy, foreigners few and far between, lots of places to eat and drink and try different things though be warned a good tourist guide like I had is a must to",
          "We visited this water town on a tour from Shanghai - it was about an hour's drive, much of it through pleasant rural areas. After a visit to the Kezhi Gardens, we took a walk along the riverfront and down the narrow colourful alleyways. These are lined with small stalls \u2013 the",
          "Loved this half day trip- hired a car on our own with 2 kids, took an hour from The Bund area- you can easily do this trip without a tour guide since the town in so small. The tourist center is right when you come in, purchase your ticket- 80 RMB for all the sites (Post office,",
          "We took a cab and the driver kindly agreed to wait while we spent 2hrs walking / exploring before driving us back to our hotel. This is one of the many ancient water towns and probably the nearest to the city of Shanghai - an hour car ride away. Weaved through the colorful",
          "Narrow winding roads with plenty of traditional shops and food lining both sides. And lots of water. Exploring by boat is nice. Best to avoid coming here on public holidays as it can become crowded quickly.",
          "If you are keen to visit this ancient water town, my advice would be to take the soon-to-be-opened Shanghai Subway Line 17 or book tickets wifi tour bus companies. Self-travel (bus > train) would take forever. Otherwise, it\u2019s a nice quaint site to visit. End the trip with a",
          "The town looks nice and you get the feeling of the old chinese water town. It is a great way to spend the day. Also, don't go during national holidays!",
          "Zhujiajiao Ancient Town is like Venice but in China. It is beautiful place . Canals and bridges and boats and market.",
          "It was one of our favorite places in China. We enjoy traveling by boat on this place, the people was really nice",
          "Our itinerary with Miki Tours included a visit to Zhujiajiao Water Town and a Shanghai City Tour. The water town is located approximately one hour away from the port so we got an early start and was rated the best water town on various websites. This village reminded me of",
          "The canal town is round 2 hours drive from Shanghai. The houses along the canals and the bridges cross the canals provide many motives for photographs. The town is very commercialized. The former residential houses are now shops, restaurants or food stalls. You can also find a",

          "If you have time interesting to see. The city is certainly NOT like Venice so that would be a big disappointment; however it is interesting and enjoyed the ride in the canal. Shops are nice but nothing extraordinary and wherever you go make sure to bargain. There is a",
          "About 1 hr from the city, it is worth going..nice experiences...shops and dining options...can see that the western shops are trying also...you must try the boat ride and you feel the venice of the east feeling!!",
          "I did a half day tour to the ancient water village booked through Viator.com The drive was supposed to be 1 hour each way, but traffic was bad to it took just over an hour and half each way. The town it's self had nice old shopping alleyways and the water ways were quaint. We",
          "Zhujiajiao provides museums, gardens, art, street markets, and boat tours, making for a day of fun right outside of Shanghai.",
          "was a bit disappointed calling it an ancient town, better call it an old town, not so ancient like Wuzhen. local snacks and food was good and reasonable price. Won't be reach by subway, you need to change to a bus to reach the town.",
          "We took the metro to east end of 2 line then caught a didi car (Uber/Lyft). Once we arrived we wandered on our own. There was no entrance fee. We were met by a \u201clocal\u201d offering to give us a guided tour - yet we were wanting to wander on our own. We had dumplings not as good",
          "A river town located at about slightly more than an hours drive from the city centre. Despite renovations and roadworks being carried out to accommodate and appeal to tourists , Zhu jia jiao still manages to maintain its distinct charm as a traditional old town. I will like to",
          "You have to pay to get into the water village. Worth doing with a guide so as they can explain the area to you. Lots of little restaurants, we didn't eat there.",
          "It was an impromptu trip from Shanghai. We took a cab and it took us around 45 mins to an hour as it was the evening rush. We reached there around 6pm and it was already dark. Several shops were closed but we had a nice evening stroll in the ancient town. We asked the cab drive",
          "About one Hour from Shanghai, A great day out walking along the canes or by boat, Plenty places to have lunch. Like stepping back in time",
          "We hired a driver and guide to take us outside of Shanghai to this place. We didnt have as much time as i would have liked here but I loved this place. We walked around some and then took a gondola ride along the river. Would be a fun place to stay a night or two if you have",
          "Visiting here gave us a flavor of old time China. Definitely do the boat ride if you can. There were small shops that were great fun. Had all sorts of items from China cotton candy made in special shapes to fine leather handbags and beautiful porcelain flutes. Loved seeing",
          "Loved our morning trip to this quaint water town. While there were tourists it still had a very authentic feel. We were able to take a tour of a beautiful private garden home, ride the boat to the south end of the city, and eat in a great restaurant! Also enjoyed the car ride",
          "Chujiajiao is a developing water village which has the touch of heritage still. Do not expect it as clean as others water village in China because the inner village are still the same old rundown village. There are many food and souvenir stalls leading toward the new commercial",
          "When you like to find a little authentic China you are right here. This small town offers a lot of waterways, shops, handcraft, restaurant and other things to see like the scary house. Also Zhen and Zhang house are really great to see. As a foreigner invest the money for a",
          "Probably my favourite bit staying in Shanghai.Zhijiajiao is such a different world to Shanghai. More relaxed and traditional. It\u2019s like a Chinese Venice. I loved the boat ride although it was quite expensive. We were able to venture to Zhujiajao on a public bus. So much cheaper",
          "Very quaint with an ancient Venetian feel. Lots of shops, restaurants and people. We went both by day and by evening and I must say that the evening tour was my favourite, when all the lanterns were lit and there was a festival like atmosphere.",
          "This area has it all. From traditional markets to western coffee shops. You can even take a ride in a sampan. Lots of tourists make this area a very active location.",
          "Traveled there on our own using a public bus at Pu'an Road Station. Bought a boat ride and entry tickets to all the 8 attractions. Very crowded and busy. Very touristic. Lots of shops. Lots of different food types to choose from. Some very traditional. Very nice scenery and a",
          "this place is so nice, you don\u2019t have to pay anything to walk arround, if you need an english translator you just buy 120 rmb outside, the food here is also very delicious",
          "Many new buildings made to look old...lots of food kiosks (take some local money\u2014I never did find an ATM); completely walkable and safe. Pleasant diversion!",
          "A delightful and photogenic reminder of China's past. True, a lot is rebuilt, but if you are not an archaeologist, just relax and enjoy it. Incredible opportunities for photography. Great street food plus a number of Western friendly food options. Lots of kitschy stalls to enjoy",
          "First time i mention this place to my Chinese colleague, they are quite surprised. Then they helped me to arrange car rental for a day of city tour in Shanghai city. From our hotel, JW Marriott to Zhujijiao, it took 45 minutes in congestion period. The place is very clean and",
          "This is one of the water towns that is closest to Shanghai and it took more than an hour to drive there. It as been rebuilt but not restored, Basically a tourist trap with no remaining heritage. Its a sad commentary on how some of the Chinese development has swallowed their",
          "Despite the crowds, we had a nice afternoon here. Walked all over every bridge and crannie, fighting the throngs of other tourists. Then we took a somewhat relaxing boat ride. All and all a pleasant experience.",
          "This place is very near to Shanghai .. I stayed at Caohejing hi tech park line 9 .. To get here taken metro line 9 drop at Dingjong then took shared cab (20 rmb each) from exit 4 ,took around 30 mins to reach .. Place was nice ..very scenic but too much crowd . We took a detour",
          "Was taken here as part of a 'research' trip with my host company so there were only two of us and it was an easy 1-1.5 hour drive out of Shanghai. For a normal weekday it was quite crowded with a lot of Chinese tourists so be patient with getting through the narrow laneways.",
          "We went on Jenny's Shanghai Tours and had a wonderful exploration of the water town, gardens and markets. The boat ride on the canal was a highlight.",
          "Had a great tour of this ancient water town. Enjoyed a boat tour along one of the canals. Did a bit of shopping and eating in one the many stalls along the street. Very photogenic.",
          "A magnet for tourists, this town is like a Chinese replica of Venice. It is an undemanding place, charming and visually quaint. There are plenty of eating places and a multitude of street food. It seemed every second store front was offering cooked food though it was not always",
          "As part of our tour we visited the Zhujiajiao Ancient Town for a few hours. We started walking along the river, it kind or reminded me of the River Walk in San Antonio Texas. There are many small shops that line the river on both sides where you can shop, eat and just browse",
          "This was a beautiful trip into China's past. Make sure you get a boat tour through the city and enjoy the ancient songs of the boat operators. It's also great to eat by the water front as the boats pass by. They had some great deals on souvineers as well. Seemed to be the",
          "If you're in the area and have the time, it's worth a trip but I wouldn't go back after having seen it. We did a short boat trip, some shopping, pictures, and Starbucks. Not really worth the 45 minute drive out there from Shanghai. We didn't find it to be unusually beautiful.",
          "We did a lot of research on water towns accessible from central Shanghai, and chose Zhujiajiao as it was the closest. We weren't disappointed. Although it is tourist oriented, there's plenty of beautiful and historic sites to see, and the town is quite large, so there's always",
          "We were lucky enough to have a friend drive us here. We had been to several \"old\" streets and towns in Chengdu, Shanghai and Hong Kong but this was definitely our favorite. It's incredibly scenic and the shops were different - not your standard tourist fare. Touristy yes, but",
          "We took an organized tour to this spot and it was a wonderful experience. After arriving we took the short boat cruise on the river and then meandered through the little streets to look at the interesting shops selling all sorts of foods and trinkets.",
          "A little bit of old Shanghai, lots of greetings from children on an excursion/ a trip back in time and a delicious lunch",
          "Zhujaijiau is a popular destination for most tours from Shanghai, and I got taken there as part of what was supposed to be an 8 hour trip from Shanghai. The problem I was not aware of when booking, was that I was hitting Shanghai at the start of Golden Week, a week long public",
          "Zhujiajiao ( tsoo jar jow) is a one hour drive by car from central Shanghai and is well worth the trip. We went on a public holiday so the town was teeming with locals as well as quite a few foreign visitors. There are several canals bordered by narrow streets and crossed by",
          "We took a cab from the bund and an hour later arived in Zhujiajiao. You can walk around the canal, stop by in one of the liitle shops to buy some souvenir and eat some local delicacies in a rooftop restaurant with a view on the canal. Overall a pleasant activity for half a day",
          "Zhujiajiao is an oasis within the city of Shanghai. It's a slower paced water town with a canal system criss crossed by beautiful old stone bridges. The town exudes old world charm. There are alley ways where vendors are selling food and vegs, trinkets, home wares. You can",
          "Nice to spend a couple of hours in Zhujiajiao, walking along the canals and with all the small shops of a Chinese touristy area. No metro to reach the area but that may change soon, so arrange a car for the drop off and pick up to/from town",
          "Just one hour bus ride and you have a totally different experience of Shanghai. This town is filled with cafe by the river, temples, small shops and restaurants. good mix of modernity and traditional elements. I will visit again!",
          "An ancient water town with over 1700 years of documented history Known as Pearl Stream and not Venice of the East (that is Suzhou) Some fascinating bridges from the different dynasties and a good selection of restaurants and shops (a very good bamboo shop) Well worth the 2 hour",
          "This is good for a half day trip and not far from Shanghai. Like everywhere, you will not feel lonely, there is always a crowd. Lots to see, quaint - almost car free, which is a blessing. If you can - take a boat ride. The restaurants offer interesting fare and it is worth",
          "This was a beautiful town with an extremely old bridge that was built in 1571 and is still standing today. The KeZhi gardens were worth seeing and full of history. If the weather is nice and you have the time, take a day trip to see this town.",
          "Upon entry to the water city, we jumped on a type of gondola and cruised through the some of the canals that ran through the water city. Very relaxing way to start our visit. Once we hit land and walked through all of the narrow streets, it was time to get our bartering hats",
          "Such an amazing little town, lots of little touristy shops. We wanted to take a boat ride, and did, however they really ripped us off, so watch out.",
          "Visited on a Sunday afternoon, as well many people but much. much more relaxing compared to Shanghai Down Town sightseeing. Lot of bric-a-brac and street food. A must have - take a boat what brings you through the ancient town, takes you app. 30 minutes. The boat is for 6",
          "This is a lovely place to go for a day trip from Shanghai. It is approx. 44 km outside of downtown Shanghai. Great shopping and food is available along the waterways. You can also take a gondola boat ride through the waterways.",
          "If you've never seen a water Town before, this might interest you. Else please avoid this place. Huge tourist trap and overcommercialized shops everywhere selling the same stuff. Note there are NO TAXIS there waiting in line. Either take the bus or have the taxi that dropped",
          "Defn don't pass up an opportunity to see the water village. Some of the previous reviews said to get off at the second to last stop.. Despite asking the conductor didn't tell us where to get of, they didn't.. We arrived at the bus station not knowing where we were and a bit",
          "I went on a wednesday and it was not very crowded. I took the express bus from the People's square and the ride was pretty fast (about 1hr). I went at 10am and came back around 3pm. Try to avoid rush hour. One way is only 12rmb. I suggest you to buy the transportation card. You",

          "Came here with classmates on a guided tour and was not disappointed at all! It was really refreshing to see a different side of Shanghai since we were mainly in the city and the town was very beautiful!",
          "This is definitely a place a Little too crowded with tourists for my liking, especially on nice weekend days. A lot of people trying to sell you fish, trying to proactively get you into their cafes and buy their food. Made the whole experience a Little less nice, but once you",
          "You can get here via bus, but admittedly an organised tour or a hired car with driver would be easier. Plenty to see and strikingly beautiful architecture, a lovely relaxing half day.",
          "Great place to visit away from all the glitter of Shanghai. Situated on the outskirts of the city, this place has some ancient history which is well preserved. The waterways across the town will make you feel as if you're in a place like Venice. Impeccable food and local market",
          "This is indeed an ancient town with multiple rivers spreading all across this place. It is a place to see the old traditional Chinese Building Architecture. You get lot of shops for antique designed artefacts & also lot of food stalls - worth mentioning about different types of",
          "Booked with ChinaTravel/Shanghai Highlights a 1/2-day morning tour for 2 with private car and guide. Booking went smooth, good contact and upon arrival at Shanghai hotel, tour was reconfirmed by the local tour operator using WhatsApp which was great. Pick-up was on time with a",
          "I have been there for two times in my lifetime, it was a relaxing place and you could enjoy an old Shanghai village there. Things are developed, so you are able to eat and live there. If you are tired on Shanghai skyline, you could come a look.",
          "1 hour bus ride from Shanghai city center. Hence making it convenient to people who wants to see ancient water town but do not wish to travel far. I felt that this place has been commercialized and nevertheless, it is the best place for anyone who wishes to see something",
          "Booked private tour with CTRIP for the 2 water town places-- the 2nd one was Jinxi Water town which i reviewed already. This is definitely the bigger and more complete one than Jinxi which has to have other stuff added to it make it more complete-- brick and other museums.",
          "The place is great! You'll find not only a totally different place from Shanghai, but also nice things to do for a very nice price: the boat ride, making jewelry from pearls you can get from a shell you'll pick yourself, fish pedicure (I found a place there that charged 20\u00a5 for",
          "Once I got here I thoroughly enjoyed walking around and taking pictures. There is a lot to see. You need to be comfortable walking on uneven surfaces and stairs. On a hot day, you will want to find one of the many air conditioned cafes. Expect a juice to cost around 15 RMB and",
          "This was an amazing excursion from Shanghai. It truly is the Venice of China. Many bridges and channels with the opportunity to ride in gondolas. There was a lot of shopping. My favorite was touring the gardens. I could have done that all day. Even though it was raining part of",
          "I was so glad we went here. It was fantastic. It is how I imagined China to be. They are building a (sky) train from Shanghai to here which should be finished by October 2017. If it is finished, it would be worth taking that out there and spending the say just wondering the",
          "Crowded, commercial, tourist trap. If you have to go to a \"water village,\" this gets the job done but if feels forced. It used to be a quaint old watertown and but probably better visited in winter when nobody is around.",
          "Enjoyed this trip on the canal boat. Gives you a real sens of old China and the way people live there. Had a good atmosphere. Enjoyed looking at the food markets and also enjoyed shopping there.",
          "Only about one hour west of Shanghai, very accessible. Fascinating insight to ancient village life. Quite touristy, but worth a look .Go on a week day -less crowded.",
          "This old city is a perfect escape from the big city of Shanghai. You can easily get there by car as a day trip and see some of the old world charm of China. The streets are lined with stores selling knick knacks and for the less adventurous types, there are some modern stores",
          "We went on a half day tour from Shanghai and were the first pick up (for a van load of about 12 people) and the last drop off. Five hours plus driving, for not much time in the village. The village is presented as being in the country but theres nothing rural about its",
          "Riding on gondolas through a historic Chinese village is a once in a life time. The streets were overflowing with merchants selling wares, but the gardens within the town were astoundingly beautiful - my favorite seen so far in all of China. Take a meal on a balcony and watch",
          "The Zhujiajiao Ancient Water Town is the place for those who wants to fulfill their water town sightseeing desires yet would not like to travel hours away from Shanghai just to see it. Though some spots at this water town may be the usual crowded touristy areas, take a walk",
          "This was one of the top places I visited while staying in Shanghai. Only 1 hour away by bus, it makes it a bit of adventure, but worth it. Walking through the streets of Zhujiajiao brings you back in time and you suddenly have a feeling like you are a part of some Chinese",
          "The water city is about an hour's drive from Shanghai but it is worth it. It is well preserved with lots of interesting little local stores to buy gifts or snacks from. We were in a small group of 7 people which was great. We also visited the ancient garden which was lovely",
          "This is a wonderful town that I highly recommend visiting. If you go early enough you can beat the crowds. I went at 11am and the streets were dead, it was almost like I had the place to myself. By the time a left in the afternoon the streets were starting to get busy. This",
          "I must admit I had low expectations for Zhujiajiao, and expected it to be entirely commercialized and diluted of all its value. When we arrived, I discovered that I was quite wrong. The main streets and canals of the town are quite commercialized and packed with tourists, yes,",
          "We took a tour to this little treasure and was worth it as it takes 2 hours from Shangahi to get there so you see quite a bit along the way. As usual a lot of touristy things there in the shopping but we had a good chinese meal and a nice walk around the area.",
          "It's quite easy to get to this place by subway & then by taxi. Entrance fees for the more interesting sights r reasonable. The boat rise is well worth it. Just watch out when in the Taoist temple as you can part with your cash without realising it.",
          "The place smelt really really bad because of the fermented tofu which I will admit will really put me off visiting. I have been here three times and its good in good weather and for photos. Very touristy.",
          "When you go to SHANGHAI, there are several ancient water towns to go but dont choose ZHUJIAJIAO. Pick another one. We chosed it because it was nearer. About 1 hour and a half from the city center including traffic. The \"ancient\" town is sorrounded by modern subdivisions and",
          "We travelled as part of the SNA tour and were taken to the location by our coach driver and guide. A bit of a drive out but being able to see more of the city outskirts was enlightening. We arrived on a week day so there were not as many visitors as expected. Not quite what",
          "This is a place not to be missed. The city is built around canals, with cobble-stoned pedestrian streets. There are many cafes, restaurants, and shops along the canals. It is quite busy in the day but the early mornings and evenings are lovely. Definitely worth an overnight stay!",
          "The gift shops were inexpensive and there were plenty of local specialty foods to try. It's easy to get to by bus too - direct from People's Square, last bus back is 9pm. Only really need 1/2 a day to take in the sights, but could spend a whole day if you want to spend time",
          "We came here as part of a shore excursion on a cruise and we had a guide most of the time. We saw the ancient post office and pharmacy which had an interesting perspective of life at the time. I think this town's history goes back 1700 years. We took a boat ride down the",
          "I took a taxi here from the Pudong area. It took about an hour and a half with moderate traffic a Saturday morning. The fare was around 250 rmb. I was really impressed with the gardens canals and bridges. There are endless restaurants and trinket shops so bring some extra",

          "It took 2 hours in grueling traffic to arrive there and then another 2 hours to get back. It's one tiny waterway.. you take a 20 minute boat trip and then walk an \"ancient\" road with tacky tourist gifts and very smelly street food vendors (it was either the food or sewage,",
          "We were there very early at 7am as we went there directly from the Pu Dong airport which took us about 1.5 hours on private car. We noted that is was 30minutes away from Hong Qiao Airport. If you have some time in Shanghai, I would recommend a short trip down. When we reached",
          "We managed to follow the instructions (see other posts) and the bus from Shanghai. It wasn't easy finding the bus but for $12rmb each way, it was worth the savings for us. There's really no need to book a tour, you can roam around your self and be perfectly fine. We bought the",
          "It takes about one hour from Suzhou Long-Distance Bus Station to get to this place, but it definitely worth it. We have visited this place during our trip to Shanghai. From Shanghai Railway Station we took a G Train to Suzhou, which took about 25 minutes. Train ticket for the",

          "A terrific place. We had a tour from the cruise ship which was very interesting. Of course, everyone wants to come here and it is a bit cramped, bit the boat trip was excellent and the tour one of the best we did on the cruise. Easily done from Shanghai in half a day.",

        "wiki": "Guanqian Street (Chinese: \u89c2\u524d\u8857; pinyin: gu\u00e0n qi\u00e1n ji\u0113; Suzhou Wu: Kuoe zie ka, Wu Chinese pronunciation: [ku\u0275 zi\u026a k\u0251]) is a street in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The street is located in Suzhou city centre, an area covering 0.52 square kilometres, the commercial part of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is an old street consisting of a Grand Taoist Building group, which has a long history of more than 1300 years. The Temple of the Lord has nine rooms and its name is Sanqing Temple. Besides, there are about ten temples along the street.\nThe street is named for a temple\u2014Xuanmiao Temple, which is on the street, because it is in front of the temple.\nThis street has existed since 1930 and has been renovated many times since then. On June 1982, the street was designated by the municipal authority as a \u201cwalking street\u201d and a new night market was established. The street has been honoured as the one of the Four Most Famous Walking Streets in China (other three: Nanjing's Fuzimiao, Shanghai's Cheng Huang Miao and Beijing's Tianqiao).\n\n\n== Development ==\nLying in the city center of Suzhou, the main theme of the street involves eating, shopping and entertaining. There are hundreds of shops, restaurants, bars, stores and clubs in old fashioned structures surrounded by colorful signs and neon lights along the street. \nThe location of this 150-year-old street lying in front of the Xuanmiao Taoist temple explains its name, which means \"before a temple\". The street running 760 metres long, consists of the eastern, middle and western sections. The eastern part is filled with nice ancient buildings of historical significance. The middle is mainly the temple and fashionable shops occupy the western part. Strolling on Guanqian Street is a favorite pastime of the locals. Now, the restored street attracts not only Suzhou people but also visitors, as it is an attraction blending business, culture, religion and food delights.\n\n\n== Century-old shops ==\nThere are many features of the street, including the famous century-old shops such as Huangtianyuan, Sanwanchang, Caizhizhai and so on, which gain an international reputation. It is precisely the existence of these century-old shops that make the Guanqian Street not only become a typical commercial street, but also illustrate the culture of Suzhou. Tourists at home and broad are attracted by these century-old shops because there is variety of Jiangnan dishes available in those century-old shops. Meanwhile, some of the shops have a long history of more than 100 years, which gives the tourists deep impressions and many of the tourists visiting Guanqian street just come to enjoy the delicious food.\n\n\n== Scenic spots ==\n\n\n=== Xuanmiao Temple ===\nThe Guanqian street is named after the Xuanmiao Temple which is located on the street. It is a prominent Taoist temple with a long history dating back to 276 and it was founded in the Western Jin dynasty. Its original name is Zhenqingdao Yard. In 1264, it was renamed Xuanmiao Temple. At the beginning of the Qing dynasty, in order to avoid naming taboo associated with the Kangxi Emperor's personal name, it was renamed again. An old laneway leads to the gate of the temple while the Guanqian pedestrian street lies just ahead of it.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "We stayed in a hotel just off the street and went here to eat a few times. There are plenty of small restaurants on and off the main strip and of course plenty of spending opportunities. There seem to be an extraordinary number of stores selling coats and shoes! It is a fun",

          "I went here as a tour group ranging from adults to the elderly. Public parking areas are available although it'll take a while to get to the main shopping street. There are many benches and seating spots with vegetations (in case it's a hot and sunny day). Crowded(?), yes, like",

          "I am probably being over critical as I visit many cites all over the world but to be honest, there is nothing special about this street. It is no different to any other shopping street and very busy. If you like busy shopping with thousands of people then it is the place to go",

          "You can buy anything and tried all sort of different kind of food. I usually went there for a good food massage after a long walk around the city. There is a good restaurant servign dumpling and noodle.",
          "If you want to be harassed by the hawkers, overpay for meals / local dishes, encounter beggars, and wander aimlessly for hours while struggling to bargain, this is a great place for you! It is however quite near to some of the good tourist attractions such as the Suzhou",

        "wiki": "Taihu (Chinese: \u592a\u6e56), also known as Lake Tai or Lake Taihu, is a lake in the Yangtze Delta and one of the largest freshwater lakes in China. The lake lies in Jiangsu province and significant part of its southern shore forms its border with Zhejiang. With an area of 2,250 square kilometers (869 sq mi) and an average depth of 2 meters (6.6 ft), it is the third-largest freshwater lake entirely in China, after Poyang and Dongting. The lake holds about 90 islands, ranging in size from a few square meters to several square kilometers.\nLake Tai is linked to the renowned Grand Canal and is the origin of a number of rivers, including Suzhou Creek. In recent years, Lake Tai has been plagued by pollution as the surrounding region experienced rapid industrial development.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nScientific studies suggest that Lake Tai's circular structure is the result of a meteor impact based on the discovery of shatter cones, shock-metamorphosed quartz, microtektites, and shock-metamorphic unloading fractures. The prospective impact crater has been dated to be greater than 70 million years old and possibly from the late Devonian Period. However, new research suggests that present evidence shows no impact crater structure or shock-mineral at Lake Tai. Fossils indicate that Lake Tai was dry land until the ingression of the East China Sea during the Holocene epoch.  The growing deltas of the Yangtze and Qiantang rivers eventually sealed off Lake Tai from the sea, and the influx of fresh water from rivers and rains turned it into a freshwater lake.\n\n\n== Scenic locations ==\n\nThe lake is renowned for its unique limestone formations at the foot of the adjacent Dongting Mountain (\u6d1e\u5ead\u5c71).  These \"scholar's rocks\" or \"Taihu stones\" are often prized as a decorating material for traditional Chinese gardens, as exemplified by those preserved as museums in nearby Suzhou.\nLake Tai is best seen from atop the Dragon Light Pagoda in western Wuxi's Xihui Park, from which both Wuxi and Lake Tai are visible. Another well-known panoramic view, made famous by an 11th-century poem by Su Shi, is that from Longshan.\nThree of the lake's islands are preserved as a national geological park under the name Sanshan. They are famed as a former haunt of local bandits. Mei Yuan is also located in Lake Tai, along with Yuantouzhu. Yuantouzhu received its name (\"Turtle Head Isle\") from the shape of its outline.\n\n\n=== Ferris wheel ===\n\nThe \"Star of Lake Tai\" is a giant, 115-meter (377 ft) Ferris wheel on the shore of the lake.  Completed in 2008, it takes 18 minutes to complete one revolution. Passengers can enjoy the scenery of Lake Tai and the city center.  At night, lighting effects are switched on around the wheel.\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\nSheraton Huzhou Hot Spring Resort is situated on the southern shore of the lake.\n\n\n== Business and industry ==\nThe lake is known for its productive fishing industry and is often covered by fleets of small private fishing boats.  Since the late 1970s, harvesting food products such as fish and crabs has been invaluable to people living along the lake and has contributed significantly to the economy of the surrounding area.\nThe lake is home to an extensive ceramic industry, including the Yixing pottery factory, which produces world-renowned Yixing clay teapots.\n\n\n== Pollution ==\n\nPollution of the lake has been ongoing for decades despite efforts to reduce pollution that were not sustained and thus proved ineffective.  In the 1980s and 1990s, the number of industries in the lake region tripled, and the population also increased significantly.  One billion tons of wastewater, 450,000 tons of garbage, and 880,000 tons of animal waste were dumped into the shallow lake in 1993 alone.  The central government intervened and initiated a campaign to clean up the lake, setting a deadline to comply with pollution standards.  When the deadline was not met, 128 factories were closed on New Year's Eve in 1999.  Compliance improved somewhat afterwards, but the pollution problem remained severe.In May 2007, the lake was overtaken by a major algae bloom and by major pollution with cyanobacteria.  The Chinese government called the lake a major natural disaster despite the anthropogenic origin of this environmental catastrophe.  With the average price of bottled water rising to six times the normal rate, the government banned all regional water providers from implementing price hikes.  (The lake provides water to 30 million residents, including about one million in Wuxi.)  By October 2007, it was reported that the Chinese government had shut down or given notice to over 1,300 factories around the lake.  Nonetheless, Wu Lihong, one of the leading environmentalists who had been publicizing pollution of the lake, was sentenced to three years in prison for alleged extortion of one of the polluters, but, undeterred, alleged in 2010 that not a single factory was closed.Jiangsu province planned to clean the lake; chaired by Wen Jiabao, the State Council set a target to complete the task by 2012.  However, in 2010 The Economist reported that pollution had broken out again and that Wu Lihong, released from prison that April, was claiming that the government was trying to suppress news of the outbreak while switching to other supplies in place of lake water.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of possible impact structures on Earth\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===",
        "brit": "Lake Tai, Chinese (Pinyin) Tai Hu or (Wade-Giles romanization) T\u2019ai Hu,  large lake between Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, eastern China. Roughly crescent-shaped, it is about 45 miles (70 km) from north to south and 37 miles (59 km) from east to west; its total surface area is about 935 square miles (2,425 square km). The lake lies in a flat plain and is connected with a maze of waterways that feed it from the west and discharge its waters eastward into the East China Sea, via the Wusong, Liu, Huangpu, and other rivers. In addition to these natural waterways, there is an intricate pattern of canals and irrigation channels associated with the lake. Only on the northeast side is the lake bounded by uplands\u2014a ridge of hills that also outcrop in the lake as islands, many of which, because of silting, have been joined to the shoreline.Tai, LakeLake Tai, eastern China.Iwanafish\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\nUnknown Waters\nWhat is the second-longest river in the world?\n\n\n\nThe surrounding area has been settled since the 1st century bc, but the irrigation system mostly dates from the 7th century ad and later. Reclamation and drainage improvements were conducted intensively between the 10th and 13th centuries; large-scale flood control measures were undertaken in the 11th and again in the 15th century. Similar improvements have been carried out in more recent times: drainage canals and dikes have been built, and an ever more complex irrigation pattern has emerged. In the 1930s the Chinese Nationalist government established a water conservancy authority for the lake that the Chinese communist government replaced after 1949 with a water conservancy assembly that also became responsible for the surrounding area.Some of the islands in the eastern part of the lake are traditionally famous Daoist and Buddhist religious sites, and several thousand people live on them, raising fruit and fishing in the lake. Lake Tai has historically been considered a place of great natural beauty, and the area, particularly in the east near Suzhou and in the north around Wuxi (both in Jiangsu), attracts many tourists.Fish traps on Lake Tai, near Wuxi, Jiangsu province, China.

          "This is the place to go for the locals. Catch tadpoles or fish bites, fly a kite, kick a ball, walk, jogging... Wuxi people just adore this place. I do not understand why, though. Just an average place made for commercial and recreational usage. Do not go there for the weekends",

          "Worth a trip from any of the nearby cities of Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai. The main strips are quite touristy, but take a few turns and then you're in the resident areas. Really neat. I enjoyed seeing the place lit up at night, especially the small bar strip that is to your",
          "Tongli developed around the ancient canals connecting the cities of China. It is a small enclave bisected by many small canals. It is both an interesting step back into old China, and an area full of shops and kitsch. It is more enjoyable if one gets off the streets packed",
          "Having visited Zhujiajiao Water Town, I found Tongli to be much more pleasant and intimate. It\u2019s smaller, less busy and less commercial. There are still shops and restaurants but minus the trinkets stuff. We traveled there from Suzhou by taxi. It takes about 30-45mins and costs",
          "If you understand that some of these build water channels are more than 1000 years old you will certainly get feeling of the flair this little town have. Strol away from the busy part and walk the small path ways of the residential area where many little guest houses are",
          "Quite a nice day trip. The water village is a great little bit of heritage. Well looked after. Very pleasant day of walking around and inspecting historic sights. Plenty of little cafes and coffee shops to enjoy.",
          "Tongli Town is a very nice water town with nice restaurants and shops to keep you amused. There are quite a few buildings to visit and it is also a base where movies are made. Overall a very pleasant way to spend a day.",
          "You need to spend a day walking around the Tongli Water Town. It is so peaceful and picturesque. We saw the old governor's home, shopped, ate lunch, took a boat ride. It was all so wonderful. We had a guide, which was so helpful because no one spoke english.",
          "Visiting Tongli Town is very relaxing and conforting time to see and view the gardens and canals of the ancient Chinese city.",
          "Sunday spring visit. Not too crowded. Very much worth the trip. By metro line 4 (over 1 hour) or taxi 30 mins. Easy to get there. Entrance at South Gate costs 100RMB: Expensive for my taste. The people are exceptionally nice but you can come across a few hustlers as this place",
          "I went to Suzhou and Tongli on a one day trip booked with China Highligths. Booking online was very easy, and everything organized upon request. My guide was Sophie Lee, speaking very good english, professional and with good knowledge about those places. Humble Administrator",
          "Tongli is a village in the Suzhou area. Easily accessible from Shanghai or Suzhou, it makes a great day trip. The buildings and waterways have been reconstructed to create a prosperous village as it might have been 100 years ago. There are homes stores, temples, and other",

          "This was a very cool boat ride. I am not sure exactly how the paddle works, but it was very cool to take it through the little town. It seems like that was one of the only things to do there. We also had time to walk around and got to watch some ginger /toffee type candy being",
          "A water town 1-1/2 to 2 hra from Shanghai, a visit is worth your while. Leave you in awe. Serene,peaceful, ancient, and a diff kind of tour.",
          "Unlike its more popular cousins Zhujiajiao and Zhouchuang, Tongli is quieter but just as nice. The picturesque water town is a little further than the rest but is easily accessible by MRT. We took about an hour to reach it from Suzhou. What really struck us about this place are",
          "It is fun to walk around the town and to explore. Plenty of restaurants and shops to visit. A unique experience while touring China.",
          "This is a very pretty and quiet place. Travelling on a boat is fantastic.There are many small shops and guset house along the river. It would be a good idea to stay in the guest house of one night.",
          "Half the shops were closed , maybe because of the season and it\u2019s December. Clean/ unique in its own way. If you are looking for a water town with its much original decor / environment retained with some elements of history and culture this can be a place to consider. (Advises",
          "Beautiful water town like a Venice of china.. still petty and not so commercialised as compare to Zhou Zhuang. Less crowded compare to other place and enjoy the stroll on the old Ming and Qing style shopping street. You can take a river cruise and can be unique. However, I",
          "Very cool place built along several canals. Lots of shopping and eating places. Wander the alleys for some of the best bargains. Take a boat ride to get a unique perspective. Would be a cool place to stay for a couple of days.",
          "Tongli Water Town, although very 'touristy', still has people living and working next to the canals. You see locals, washing clothes (and some food) in the water, as you pass by on a very reasonably price boat trip around the waterways. A great place to wander around,",
          "Shops, restaurants and homes along the canal makes this a nice place to take a stroll. It is a short visit that doesn't require a lot of walking. Our guide, Ocean helped us find a restaurant for lunch.",
          "Historic old water town. Quite scenic and very old. Charming to watch the boats navigate the canals. Could be a Chinese Venice or Amsterdam. Well worth a visit.",
          "We drove to Tongli water town from Shanghai (about 1hr 30mins) and came with an English speaking guide. We chose it because it is less crowded, people still live there and it is one of the oldest of the water towns that you can visit in Jiangsu province, close to Shanghai. We",
          "Tongli is a long way out of Shanghai but well worth the visit. it is another ancient town but so different and is a little \"Venice of the east\" complete with gondolas. There are no vehicles in the old town with the walkways running beside the canals and it all creates a most",
          "We visited this lovely water town on the way to Suzhou. It makes you feel like a time traveler into the past. The very first restaurant that you see is a hundred years old. You can go up to the upstairs to listen the ancient Chinese musical playing while enjoying your food.",
          "After fighting with masses of tourists in China for the past two weeks, I arrived early at Tongli at 10am (left Suzhou around 8:30) and was happy that there wasn\u2019t such a big crowd (end-October). The tourists did arrive but it was still ok. The town is definitely old and",
          "Very similar to the other water towns we have visited around Shanghai. Nice for a day out. 100rmb to enter and visit all the attractions. Only thing that put us off were a few idiots who need to look after animals better. There was a very sad pet shop with an idiotic owner who",
          "We took a half day trip with a tour guide to this water town outside Shanghai. I had done some research to choose a water town to visit, and Tongli seemed like it would be less touristy than some of the others. We went on a Monday, which was great. The crowds were not bad at",
          "While a little touristy, Tongli is easily accessible from Suzhou using the metro. Ignore the tat and people offering to take you on a tour of the town on their bikes. Head out on foot and enjoy exploring. Just be careful not to eat at the restaurants that wash their dishes in",
          "Tongli is a bijou little town, crisscrossed by canals, and a perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of nearby Shanghai. Step aboard one of the wooden boats and your oarsman will take you through the quiet canals, under the stone bridges and past the cormorant fisherman.",
          "Old area, with old buildings to visit. Communist China history. Lots of restaurants, however I question the sanitary level. Most you sit along what looks like a dirty canal to eat. I\u2019ll pass. Tourist oriented. Odd smells from the food served.",
          "As strange as it may sound I do not recommend going to Tongli Town instead of spending more time in Suzhou or Shanghai. Although you MUST visit a garden during your stay in China, you will find much better places in Suzhou. Tongli Town was full of similar shops, expensive cafes",
          "Unfortunately what was once probably a beautiful ancient Canal town has now been converted into a Disney carnival theme park. It is totally full off souvenir shops Iva price restaurants and other tourist venues. We are so disappointed that we came here. The whole town smells",
          "Amazing beautiful. It really is worth 100 rmb. The place offers a lot of gift shops, restaurants, and snack vendors. It also offers boat ride for 90 rmb per boat. The best part is a costumes dress up picture offer by tongli vendors . The picture can be ported digitally to",
          "I will let the photos do the talking. On that note, I would recommend reaching there early in the morning to avoid the crowds, as the tourists, particularly the tour groups, start coming in droves after 12pm. Making a day trip from Shanghai to Tongli is totally doable, as there",
          "It is advertised as the venice of the orient/east. It's truly pretty. If you have been to Hoi An in Vietnam, there is some similarity with the water and the proliferation of red lanterns. After lunch, we meandered around the small shops, obligatory boat ride down the canals,",
          "We took the 6:47 G trains from Shanghai, it took 33minutes to reach Suzhuobhei station. We had breakfast at Starbucks. Was reading prior departure to take the bus to Tongli but since we couldn\u2019t locate the bus though there was a bus station, went there to ask where\u2019s the bus",
          "Very recommendable old chinese water town great atmosphere, still many old building which aren't so perfect mixed with very well restored buildings. Many good restaurants with reasonable pricing. Best time is in the morning from 06:00 to 10:00 - its very quiet and only locals",
          "WOW, what a beautiful place! Tongli is beautiful, relatively unmodernized, and surprisingly devoid of hordes of tourists. I'll attach some photos and let those images speak for themselves. Before our visit, we had considered visiting some of the other water towns including",
          "The Tongli Town in the afternoon is quite bustling with people and quite touristy to say the least. Its surely quite popular, but we preferred the Xitang ancient water village in comparison.",
          "This water town in suzhou is wonderful old city with canals and water ways ...many smal bridges many historic sites and many side ways with shops.. Take the bout tour for 90 rmb Take cycle tour for 5 stops by every historic spot and walk its nice to walk as well..you can eat",
          "I highly recommend this water town as it has many different historic buildings. I however recommend that if you visit in the summer bring water as the heat can be quite extreme if you come from a cool climate. There are a number of different restaurants with both Chinese dishes",
          "We took the Metro to Tongli station and went to Exit 10 as others have said. What we did not know was that Tongli Water Town offers a senior discount. The lady at the booth asked our ages and one of us qualified. We bought one 88RMB ticket and took the free bus to the ticket",
          "There's definitely shops with good price items. Nice looking Garden too. The Bridges are nice place to take photos.",
          "Easy to get to, now that they have extended the subway line to Tongli - just buy the Tongli day ticket (at 12% discount) in the Tongli station near the station\u2019s exit 10 and use that to get the free shuttle bus to the town where you exchange it for the town entrance fee which",
          "Contrary to Suzhou, where Pingjiang Lu is basically the only place where you can still see the old water channels, the ancient town of Tongli has preserved the full water channel system, and this makes the town and excellent place for a one day getaway (e.g., if you're staying",
          "First of all, definite recommendation if you have time to spare and want to get out of the city. It is very convenient to get to from Suzhou with subway line 4, all the way to the final stop (30-60 min from Suzhou, depending on starting point, 6-7rmb). But do NOT leave the",
          "Really nice place to visit ! I went on a saturday and it was not crowded at all, more quiet than the humble administrator garden :p Not really easy to get there when you dont exactly know so I am sharing the itinerary: From suzhou railway station take the subway line 4 to",
          "Visited both Suzhou and Tongli town. As a solo traveler, I took a morning high speed train from shanghai and had previously booked Jeff to drive me around. jeff picked me up at the Suzhou station and then we visiting Tongli town, Humble Administrators Garden, Pingjiang Street",
          "Togli has nothing to do with Venice for the exception that it develops a part on water. Nevertheless the little town is worth half a day trip. It\u2019s around 45 minutes from Suzhou by car. When you arrive you cross a modern bridge and you are in. Walk around the little streets,",
          "We spent an amazing day in Tongli. Went there on a rainy day so it was not crowded. Really enjoyed a boat tour on canals and delicious local food. It is accessible by metro. You need to take tickets to enter the old town area. Entrance fee is 100 yuan.",
          "We spent an amazing memorable day in rural water towns: picturesque views and experiences full of unusual moments for western travellers. Melody gave this trip a nice personal touch. Highly recommend!",
          "After living in China for such a long time, I FINALLY made it to Tongli. Many of my Chinese friends insisted that I go. You will soon learn that many of these \"historic\" cities are all the same.",
          "We went on a week day ( avoid weekends due to crowds and crowds in China are real crowds) the place is outstanding you can go by line 4 train but we took a hotelcar. I advise you to use a rickshaw once you are there to be able to see everything without being overtired mostly if",
          "Beautiful place. The brst advice is to take one night in a waterside hotel. Bring your own food and drinks and enjoy the beauty after 6 pm, when the masses leave. Never go on weekends. Vompleteky overcrowded, and those who know China might be able to imagine the noise. But",
          "The old part of the town has admission fee till evening, but it's free after 5 or 5:30pm. I think it should be better to go at evening as those restaurants at the sides of water channel will light up lanterns that adds some beauty. If the weather is hot and humid, sitting",
          "Easily accessible from Suzhou via the metro system although it will take well over 2 hours from centre of town. Once you arrive there is a tour desk but you may also take a taxi or Didi from the terminal subway station. We traveled there on a rainy day and the expectation was",
          "My 2GFs and I loved this place! We almost opted for another canal town, but I am glad we did it after a long day touring Suzhou with our amazing tour guide Sunny who drove us in his car from Shanghai and helped us to purchase the entry tickets in advance to dodge the long queue",
          "We went on an excursion to Tongli as part of our Shanghai visit. This is a town known as the Venice of the East and it certainly lives up to its name. Very narrow sidewalks and very pretty canals. We took a nice gondola ride on the canals. The open square in the center of town",
          "It was really easy to get to from Suzhou. Line 4 metro . Then bus 725. There are signs once you get out of Tongli metro to bus stop 725. Bus is 2 dollars .",
          "It\u2019s overrated to call this the Venice of China, but it is a pleasant old village with pretty canals. Be sure to watch out for the ticket booth, or you\u2019ll have to backtrack a fair distance to get back to it. The area is larger than it first appears, with a shopping district.",
          "Many say that this is a (Chinese) tourist trap and I have read reviews about dilapidated and molded wall houses. We did not visit Tongli in a tour group for 3 hours but actually stayed there for 3 days and there is much more to it than what these reviews claim. There are many",
          "You need a few hours to enjoy Tongli and the lovely rivers. It costs 100 to get in the old part and after that all sights are free. Please note that the sex museum which is mentioned in the Lonely Planet is now permanently closed. From Suzhou, you take the metro to the end of",
          "You can get to this area by bus. But be warned it\u2019s not a short walk from the bus stop. We didn\u2019t know and when we asked we were just to walk around the corner and all the way down the street. We were about 25 mins into our walk before we found an entrance into the town. We",
          "During my China trip I was visiting 2 water towns. One was Tongli, the other Nanxun. Both are listed as \"least\" commercial compared to the bigger and more built up ancient towns in the Sozhou area. Both towns are very different, both beautiful, but have a different flavor. One",
          "Tongli is one of the old water villages in Suzhou and perhaps is the one nearest to the city centre. If you take a car the trip will take around one hour. Quite like many old heritages in China it is too commercialised. With a little bit of imagination, you can have an idea",

          "Visited Tongli two weeks ago from Suzhou. Take metro line 4 to the Tongli Station (terminal station). Follow the crowd through the exit. At the back of the station, take bus 725 (you will not miss it as you'll see a long line or a large crowd). The 4th stop is the Tongli scenic",
          "This is not the best water village in this area but easy to access from Suzhou. Can make a boat tour (30mn and 90 Rmb whatever number of persons). Dining alongside the canal in evening is nice.",
          "Maybe my expectations were too high as it is described as a Venice type place with buildings on the water. People do live there and apparently Chinese go there for birthdays and celebrations because it is certainly different but the buildings need cleaning up. White buildings",
          "A must see when you\u2019re in Suzhou, however be aware of very large groups of chinese visitors ! Best is to visit on a monday or tuesday, early morning . Do take a canal boat tour ! It\u2019s certainly not the venice of the east, but still very nice to see.",
          "Another great garden each section you go through archways, you need to take a guide to give you the history the houses were built to give the impression that they are in water on little islands the view from one of the balconies is spectacular as the photograph shows, well worth",
          "Water towns are a great feature of this part of China; canals with bridges, little streets branching left and right, history laid out and cared for, occasional public opera performances, street food and boat trips. Excellent traditional gardens and old preserved houses. And",
          "We were quite looking forward to come to Tong Li historic town BUT... hearing all the time laud klaxons, jumping to the side because of crazy drivers, seeing all that mess on the ground was quite disappointing and ruing the trip. I am not sure whether it is needed to sell all",
          "Beautiful canals lined with old houses. Fantastic place to walk and explore. The houses have very old roofs but several walls have been repaired with cement. Cobbled streets with large cobble stones, old growth trees that hang over the canals, beautiful wooden boats and the",
          "One of the many water towns near Suzhou. We took a bus from Suzhou North Train station. About 1.5 hour. Day trip (2-3 hours). Town is small. Commercialized but still quiet (we visited in Dec) enough to walk around and enjoy. White buildings, black roofs, bridges over canals",
          "Made a mistake and booked hotel car for 4 hours at rmb1,000 !!! There are taxis available even though it seems remote and about 1 hour drive from the city. Arrived early at 11am and most shops have just opened. Wondered around and had some fun wearing traditional costumes",
          "TongLi old town is a nice day trip destination from Suzhou albeit it's getting touristy. Go early to have a peaceful and leisurely stroll around the water town or stay overnight in one of the inn or hotel to enjoy the night views without the crowd. Good photography spots when",

          "Came here for a few hours. Walked through a garden and took a cruise through the town. Plenty of places that offer pictures in traditional Chinese clothing along the canals. Fun visit.",
          "Nothing spectacular, gardens are average, narrow water canals. Didn't take a boat ride. Food options are also not great",
          "Well worth visiting this water town. We took a boat tour around the canals and under the bridges...and we all thoroughly enjoyed the tour. I could have taken the boat tour several more times and seen new things each time. At the end of the morning we ate lunch at the NanYuan tea",
          "One of the highlights of our visit to Shanghai was going to this beautiful small Watertown . There are about seven of these listed to bea able to visit . This even though it was fairly busy is listed as being quiet and less commercial than the others . Really enjoed our walk",
          "Tongli was unquestionably one of the unexpected highlights of our recent trip to China. We'd read about it in a guide, but were still taken by surprise at the timeless charm of this ancient hamlet nestled between bridges and cuddled along canals. We came on a Sunday and so had",

          "Small village which sits astride a maze of canals. Water focused rural life was probably not quite as smart as this, but definitely worth a visit and maybe a ride down a canal. Keep your eyes open for cormorant fishermen.",

          "Though we had a guide with us, we did not learn much about the town's history. Instead we learned more about how it is today. We took a short gondola ride, which was very peaceful, though it was sad to see the ospreys tied to the docked boat. (Our guide told us the birds used",

          "A busy and touristy water/canal town in China - one of many visited while here. It was worth the trip as there are the traditional structures, canals, boat people and small ally ways however most things were trinkety, touristy and of course - costly. Good weather for Suzhou, the",
          "Yes you have to pay to tour this town, but it's not the only town I found in China that I had to do the very same thing, (so that's not a turn off). There is no way I would have been able to see this slice of life with out touring this 1000 year old area just on the outskirts",

          "Tongli is really nice. Easy to spend a day wandering around taking in the atmosphere. Nice hotel close by too. Not sure why they charge foreigners to enter though",
          "It is worth a visit. I felt transported to another era in this town where life is simpler and evolved around water. I saw an old lady cleaning her vegetables and fish in the same canal as where the water boats pass, and not far from some black vultures tied to the moored boats",

          "We loved Tongli! The poverty there is very sad, but it is truly a beautiful place to visit, and a must do if you have more than 1 day in Shanghai. It is a bit of a trip from shanghai, so it's worth hiring a driver (at least that's what we did).",

          "It's told to be the Venice of the east and in some places it's really looks like Venice. The only thing that stops me from putting the best grade to this activity is that it was to much stores and resturants inside the town which takes away the autentic feeling.",
          "Our tour guide Tifa suggested this trip. There are other water towns but she suggested this because of lesser crowds and greater natural beauty. We had a wonderful day seeing the old buildings, waterways, bridges nd whjoying a fine lunch cooked by a local resident in her \"home",

          "What a unique city with its waterways and quaint buildings. Just do not take any free taste of fruit from bicycle lady. Once you taste, she expects you to buy a bag even though she said to taste free. Met a cute little lady, 82 years old who had just been shopping. She was",

          "I went to Tongli on an outing with my program this semester, and it was beautiful. There is a town square with a stage, where some amateur actresses were putting on a play. There are many sites to see, including temples, museums and residents. Many shops line the streets,",
          "I was very surprised to find a town of this type on our tour through China. It was much more relaxed and laid back than most places we went. Yes, there are crowds on the main pedestrian mall, and it is noisy. But on the other streets with the canals, it is quite lovely and",
          "friendly residents, quiet ambience. still have a lot of old \"storis\" around to browse. The MUST VISIT is the \"Sex Museum\", never expect the collection of items is that rich",
          "We spent a day trip out of Shanghai visiting Suzhou and Tongli. Tongli is a charming little canal town (Venice of China). Take a gondola ride along the canals, visit the wedding museum, browse & shop along the canals and try street food...(fried crab on a stick for 5 yuan, ice",
          "With a lot of canals, bridges, old buildings and no rush - it is fantastic place to relax. Electric shuttle vans are helping to get into town center quickly from the parking. The pitty is that most of attractions there are closing early (but this is very common in China). There",
          "Tongli, while an interesting place to visit for us canals, bridges and gardens, is really nothing but an overpriced tourist trap. You must pay and entrance fee to get in the village, and once in the prices for everything sky rockets. You will be hounded incessantly to purchase",
          "Buy your entrance to this ancient town in the Suzhou railway station bus stop. That way, you'll get a 20% discount. I was captivated by this town and would wish to spend the entire day here. This place is mostly visited by local tourists, so not everyone can speak English. You",
          "We visited the small town of Tongli and it was just lovely! I enjoyed taking a gondola boat ride down the canals and walking through the gardens. I also liked the many shops along the streets. We were also fortunately to come upon an elderly man playing a traditional Chinese",

          "Tongli is another Suzhou highlight where you can see ancient homes and how people lived.It is a beautiful place to wander around in for 3-4 hours. Now the visitors (Chinese) are in such numbers that you get dropped off from your car or bus far away and are shuttled in to the",
          "Beautiful with a cursory look, but 2 days is too much. You then notice the filth of the canals which are clearly used for dumping. If you visit Suzhou, you can skip the gardens of Tongli, they don't compare. The inclusive ticket package may not actually save you money unless",

          "We took the day trip out to Tongli and yes it is a lovely canal town. But it is very busy with tourists. There are people everywhere on the weekend. We ate at one of the many \"restaurants\" that are set up to take the tourist trade - and the proprietor tried to rip us off beyond",
          "we had read about Tongli in a little book and found more on the web. Chinese sometimes say it is the Venice of China, and although not a big and cultural as Venice, it has a lot of charm. It is World Heritage and we thoroughly enjoyed staying here. Strolling along the canals",
          "My husband and I loved this place!!!! It was such a neat find and a treat, we almost did not make it, but I am glad we stuck through the rough times to get there. We took the train to Suzhou, when we got off there were no tourist, no English signs anywhere and tons of people",
          "We arrived in Tongli late afternoon after the majority of tourists had departed. We parked in the small coach park just off a traffic-choked main street and walked the short distance towards the official entrance, leaving the cars and fumes behind. There were plenty of",
          "If the town wasn't full of restaurants setting up plastic tables and umbrellas along sides of the canal, it would've been pictureque... But according to some other tripadvisor articles, Tongli is the best water town compared to Zhujiajiao, Zhouzhuang and Xitang. If this was",
          "You have to purchase ticket at the tourist centre, which includes a ride to the town itself, and you return via the same mode of transport (buggy). The town is lined up with lots of eateries and souvenir shops, calling out to you. The ticket includes a few major attractions,",
          "After quite a bit of online research and on the recommendation of a friend who had been to a number of water towns we ended up choosing Tongli as our destination for our obligatory water town visit while in Shanghai. The big advantage of Tongli over some of the other water",
          "I spent a few hours here and found it to be charming and quite interesting. There are at least 1/2 a dozen museums within the town that are included in the price of admission (yes, it costs a few bucks to get in). There are also a few museums that are not included in the",
          "I visited 3 watertowns - Zhouzhuang, Tongli and another one whose name escapes me. To be quite honest, if you've been to one, you've been to them all. There are obviously slight differences (each water town has a different food specialty) but when you come right down to it,",
          "There are many little \"canal towns\" spread around the Yangtse delta area. The more famous cousin is Zhouzhuang which is bigger, more crowded and more touristy. (But that shouldn't keep you away from it.) The water part of Tongli is a relaxed little village and worth the time"

        "wiki": "Daming Temple (Chinese: \u5927\u660e\u5bfa; pinyin: D\u00e0m\u00edng S\u00ec) is a temple located at the middle peak of Shugang Mountain, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China. This temple is known for a famous monk, Jianzhen, who studied the sutras and initiated people into monkhood here in 742 AD before he left for Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\nDaming Temple is so named because it was constructed during the periods in the reign of Xiaowu Emperor of the Liu Song dynasty (453\u2013464 AD). In 581 AD, Qiling Tower was built in the temple as a place to offer sacrifices to the relic of Buddha.During the periods of the Wuzong reign of the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907), it was called Qiling Temple.\nIn the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), due to social taboo of \"Daming\" (Daming Chinese: \u5927\u660e means Ming dynasty), its name was changed into \"Qiling Temple\" (\u6816\u7075\u5bfa). In 1765, during the 30th year of Qianlong period (1736\u20131795), Qianlong Emperor honored the name \"Fajing Temple\" (\u6cd5\u51c0\u5bfa).In 1922, Japanese scholar Tokiwa Daijo (\u5e38\u76d8\u5927\u5b9a) built a pavilion, a gallery and a memorial hall before Daming Temple to commemorate master Jianzhen.In 1973, Jianzhen Memorial Hall, designed by Liang Sicheng, was constructed.In 1980, the temple reverted to its former name of \"Daming Temple\".\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe temple was constructed around the hill, which consisted of three parts. The central part consistes of the Hall of the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" (\"F\u0113ng Ti\u00e1o Di\u00e0n\") and the Great Hall. The eastern part consisted of Pingyuan Hall and the \"Jianzhen Memorial Hall\". The western part consisted of Pingshan Hall, Si Garden and other features. The palaces and pavilions are well integrated with each other and well-arranged in structure.\n\n\n=== Memorial Hall ===\nThe Memorial Hall modeled the style of the Main Hall in the T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji which was organized and built by Jianzhen in Japan. A wood carving sitting statue of Jianzhen which was dry-lacquered and wrapped with linen layer by layer is enshrined in the hall.\n\n\n=== Pingshan Hall ===\nThe Pingshan Hall (\u5e73\u5c71\u5802) was built by Song dynasty scholar Ouyang Xiu in 1048 during the Qingli period when he was prefecture chief of Yangzhou. When people overlook the distant scenes, the mountains are at the same level with sight line, hence the name \"Pingshan Hall\" (\u5e73\u5c71\u5802; Ping means the same level and shan means mountains).\n\n\n=== Qiling Pagoda ===\nSome time during the Renshou reign of the Sui Dynasty - between 601 and 604 AD, the nine-story \"Qiling Pagoda\" (\u6816\u7075\u5854) was completed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nReport on Water for Brewing Tea\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nZi Yan (2012).

The street connects Changmen (Chinese: \u960a\u95e8) in the east with Huqiu in the west, with a total length of about 3,829.6 meters (2.38 miles), or a little more than seven li or traditional \"Chinese miles\".In 2015, the Shantang Street Scenic Area was added to the list of China's \"National Historic and Cultural Streets\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nConstruction of the Shantang Canal (Chinese: \u5c71\u5858\u6cb3) started in 825 AD, during the Tang Dynasty by Bai Juyi, a poet and the Cishi (modern-day equivalent of the prefectural governor) of Suzhou, to provide a link between Huqiu and the city. The sludge dug out from the construction formed a dam along the north bank of the canal known as Baigong Dam (Chinese: \u767d\u516c\u5824) in honor of Bai Juyi. A street was built on dam, which later became the modern-day Shantang Street.Along with Pingjiang Road, the street was declared a Historical and cultural block of China (Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u5316\u8857\u533a) in 2015.Today, this is a heavily touristed area, with visitors attracted by the heritage nature of the buildings and the old stone bridges.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\u82cf\u5dde\u5c71\u5858\u8857 - Official site (in Chinese)\nSuzhou Shantang Street - Official English site\nSuzhou Shantang Kunqu Opera House - Mildchina",

          "It's cool to see the rivers and canals, but it's a bit commercialized and has quite a bit of construction. Isn't the most polished tourist street but I only spent about a half hour to an hour here. Small shops and food places, and you can get out easy via subway. Some gardens",

          "This was an unexpected highlight of our China Trip. We took a boat ride on the Grand Canal and it was beautiful and serene! Then we walked along Shantang street and did some shopping for souvenirs and snacks. This little gem is a ancient Chinese street and is great for people",

          "Went there with the family and spent about 2 hours there. It\u2019s a narrow pedestrian walking street with traditional looking shops. It\u2019s just by the canal so the atmosphere was good. Feels like you are walking in an old street with shops selling souvenirs and street food. I would",
          "It did remind me of Venice, narrow canals with \u201cGondoliers\u201d, narrow cobbled streets packed full of restaurants and craftshop touting local handicrafts. Highly worth a visit.",

          "I have been to this old street on a few occasions, and like most of the others, it's best visited outside of peak times as it can get quite crowded. I have never seen it get as crowded as the better known and more central Pingjiang Road, but still. The area isn't that large but",
          "Shantang street should be the main attraction of Suzhou. Whole place is so beautiful with canals and shops/bar along both sides of canal. Lot of eateries and souvenir shops along small food joints throng the whole street. Ideally to be visited during night as it's much more",
          "We actually started our visit half way up the street and found it very different to what we expected ... The northern end (walking towards tiger hill) it is set up for the locals! Fruit & vegetable stalls, bread bakers, butchers, fish mungers, spices, pulses, loads of authentic",

          "First of all... I came upon this place with pure luck. This was closest to my hotel and one of the colleague suggested i visit this place, hence the visit. But this place is a nice bustling alleyway filled with lots and lots of shops. I had checked online, which says this place",

          "Disappointing visit here, very touristy street compared to other \"Old Towns\" visited in China, such as Lijiang. Did take a canal boat trip and saw a lot of old, run down buildings. Tong Li is much better canal village.",
          "Nice place to stroll along leisurely. Some old wooden houses built along the canal made a pretty scenery. There are mainly shops selling scarves and Chinese style clothing. Tea drinking places and shops selling snacks are worth trying.",
          "Suzhou , suzhou , suzhou \ud83d\ude29\u2764\ufe0f! I love this city as hell! It's one of the most wonderful places there .. Don't miss the chance ! You should visit it!",
          "This is a place of many things. Took the canal cruise down and back. Fascinating to see the local life along the waters edge. You see old China plus tourist shops. Spent time having lunch overlooking the water. Crowded but interesting.",
          "A busy bustling tourist street that comes alive at night, Shantang Jie offers everything from restaurants to boutiques to shops selling tourist nick-nacks, etc. It also has launch points for the tourist boat services that provide boat rides/cruises along the Suzhou canals. Worth",
          "We came here as part of a Sinorama tour and enjoyed strolling along the narrow streets and visiting many of the shops. Although we didn't end up buying anything, many in our group found a few bargains. The highlight for us was passing under the overpass to the open market",
          "Nice to see if you have tight schedule in Shanghai, just need to buy a train ticket from Hongqiao Railway Station..it took +/-30 min to arrive at Suzhou, from the Suzhou station you can walk the city, use traditional transport services (pedicap/cycling cart), or use metro to",
          "We visited as part of a day tour. It is very busy, bikes drive through the crowds. The shops mainly sell tourist items. We enjoyed the tranquility of sitting on the boat for half an hour but the area is quite run down, we much preferred Pingjiang Street for strolling and",
          "ShanTang Street is not worthy of visiting it in daylight, looks rundown & sorely in need of restoration. If you must come, come in the evening when there is no more brightness to show you all its flaws and the lights will give you a somewhat romantic ambiance. Absolutely no",
          "Visited this place with the our roommate in the hostel. And, we all loved the theme. It has all these little bridges and the view is pretty nice on there. It feels comfortable to walk around all these tiny alleys during April. And, if you have time maybe hop on one of the boats",
          "This place will not top the travel recommendation books. However, we found this place to be a pleasant surprise. The ShanTang Jie shopping street itself is nothing special. However, take a longer walk across the bridge at the end of the shopping street, and you will immediately",
          "This is famous old street market. Always crowded at night time. I can see many shops selling yoghurt, somehow it translated in Mandarin as \"sour milk\". The interesting part is many different choices of \"sour milk\". This is just another famous tourist spot where you can buy some",
          "We had a short time to walk through the old street, however you get to see a lot either way. We took the \"tuk tuk\" from Pingjang road to Shantang street and it cost us 50RMB. It is an amazing way to see Suzhou also as the rider takes you through the side streets of Suzhou.",
          "I love the local market selling vegetables, fish, chicken, fruits etc. near Shantang street whereby you can see how the locals lived their life. Things are generally cheaper as compared to those at supermarkets.The day & night scenery near the canals was really amazing. shantang",
          "I went to these here , the shantang street and shantang canal are very near together, i sea pepole of difrent nationaly of world , i am happy for visit , i have good moment for here",
          "It was a real surprise the visit to Shantang Street. If you skip the boat ride and start your walk along the street, 15 minutes later you can feel the real life of Suzhou. A giant non touristic market full of clothes, food, artifacts and many other things to discover.",
          "I booked a trip through my hotel... which was amazing value for money - 400RNB (just over \u00a340 GBP at time of writing) and included - hotel pick up - 2 hour drive each way - then entry to : Humble administrators garden - Lion Forest Garden - Liu Lingering Garden - Shantang",
          "When in Suzhou this street is well worth a visit. From here you can get a boat to Tiger Hill. You can also purchase many craft and art items here too, we had a paper cutting of our family made in about 15 minutes.",
          "Had reallay wanted to visit this attraction to see the more historic part of Suzhou. Mother Nature gave us a beautiful day . .. and we prowled the area for a couple of hours. Visited some of the delightful shops in the area and the market was neat.",
          "The old streets and shops fuse with modern technology at every corner. Some of the silk shops are quite stunning, but generally prices reflect the tourist end of the market. Go to Shanghai for your silk if that is a requirement. The food outlets are all interesting and reflect",
          "In this street you see the old town Suzhou, real people, living their daily life. If you walk under the bridge you come to the market. Prepare for an assault on the senses because there is everything here from live chicken/fish/turtles for sale to socks, coats, kitchen sponges",
          "This is an interesting place with many shops and boost a rich local culture. Must bargain for every purchase. Good place to take photographs and get good food. Can try the local trishaw for RMB2 to nearby places.",
          "I recommend to visit the street in the evening when all lanterns are illuminated. Enjoy a short tea break with an opera singer; even if it is a \"strange\" experience for western people.",
          "This atraction is very plain. Ride in a boat with other 20 people and all we see are old houses with some lanterns and a corner full of trash. I found it very boring. Wish I can find more of lanterns because in some spot it's dark.",
          "This is an amazing place to visit, especially if you take a boat ride up the street. Not only does it provide great views of the iconic houses along the canal, but you can literally see into people's houses, and you can see how they live and cook. It is very interesting, and",
          "This is the oldest street in Suzhou. In one direction it is a shopping street for tourists, in the other for locals. We went the local way. Food, products, everything you can imagine. It was the most crowded place I've ever been, and you will be pushed, though not maliciously.",
          "Shangtang street is probably one of the places where you can see and experience classical chinese water town environment best. Its beautiful and lively walking street along the channel with all is bars and cafes are very nice especially in evening light. Also the more upper",
          "I loved this area where we walked along a canal and took picots of a wedding couple getting photos done. We also walked through the market on the other side of the bridge and saw some interesting things and food for sale. Best to cross UNDER the bridge though, as the traffic",
          "A very nice place to stop by coming back from the garde of Tiger Hill. It is a canal street with boutiques. Lovely to walk by and window shopping. However, window only shopping as I found the boutiques to be the same than in all these touristic shopping street and perhaps even",
          "Better go during late afternoon and stay till night, so you get to see the views of different timing! the street is a bit commercial, but overall you get a taste of how the local people live if you keep walking towards the end of the street. there are some markets selling fish",
          "It's such the most beautiful place I've been to on my trip to Shanghai - Suzhou - Nanjing - Hangzhou - Shaoxing. An ancient street is full of Chinese tradictional characters such as river, plant, old street \"hutong\" with old rooves... I came here in autumn, it might be the",
          "One section of the street had the locals jostling to buy fresh produce. This is quite an eye opener for many foreigners that are used to clean supermarkets. The other section is commercialised with shops selling touristy stuffs.",
          "A nostalgic place. Looking for a place to spend my evening after work, I was recommended to this place. It's a typical old Chinese downtown area, but it is well maintained and beautiful with the lights. One can find some local street food and delights, souvenirs and artisan",
          "The start of it is very similar to the other canal streets in Suzhou (Pingjiang Street, for example), but if you wander past the bridge you end up in a very local kind of market. It can be a bit eye opening (especially in the sections with meat), but it's interesting to see.",
          "They call Suzhou chinese Venice for the canal but of course they are completely different but both stunning. If you have time, have a ride on the boat, it is super nice! Be aware of the prices and bargain as much as you can",
          "A charming little street with nice cafes and restaurants. Enjoyed the views and the music. Gets crowded, especially on the bridges, post 7pm. Do not take your stroller here!",
          "Nice old town of the city but it's getting too commercial like lijiang and there were way too many tourists. It is still very pretty with a lot of local store and resturants , however.",
          "Suzhou is a water town in West of Shanghai. Oneof their main attraction was Shantang street. There is a market along the canal. you can get food, souvenirs and get to ride boat, drinks and great lighting during night time. definitely a must visit",
          "its is a place everyone who visit suzhou must go...not only because of an old water town...but the variety of things you see and vibrancy...you will never feel tired walking and its full of shopping and food...you can also take a boat to see the old town ( boating is not scenic",
          "Visiting this street reminded me my visit to Venice a few years ago. Canals, boats, couples, shops, markets and street food. Great place to spend a half day and see the beautiful part of Suzhou!",
          "We originally wanted to do a canal tour by boat but wound up strolling along the bustling street and it's fantastic market instead. The food market further along was not for the faint hearted but very interesting. This is a glimpse of ancient China indeed... Except for all the",
          "Beautiful, lively, with many restaurants and much fewer shops than Pingjiang road. Shops are mostly on an alley away from the canal. Once you pass the shops and go to the main street, turn left and cross the bridge, you see the city gate. Some restaurants have live band. There",
          "it is nice to experience a boat tour in Suzhou. enjoy heavenly Suzhou in a different way. recommand pay extra money to have the boat tour by your own.",
          "It was raining the night we went. The place was brightly lit and there were many visitors despite the rain. We trudged around the place in the rain and saw quite a few interesting buildings. But, the rain and cold stopped us from spending more time here. Would love to return",
          "Great touristy place to wander around. Lots of people and most appeared to be tourists. Bought a bottle of rice wine and some little nibbles. Found the boat that goes down the canal but it was a bit disappointing as there were about 20 people on board and there were lots of",
          "Beautiful historic area of Suzhou which has been well maintained. Very nice and safe to walk around. Around the area is a very modern shopping centre which has number of international stores.",
          "Pretty quiet place, maybe cos I went on a weekday. Nice to have a stroll in the area. Nothing much actually.",
          "People still trading like they have for centuries. There on a Sunday morning and it was a crush. They even sold snakes and killed them on purchase. Anything you could think f in the food line was sold here. Eggs, live poultry and other animals and insects. as well as clothes and",
          "Beautiful old structure, can seen be seen from the image uploaded. Traditional food, accompany with beautiful scenery",
          "I've been told this place is really nice at night, however we were only able to go during the day and to add to it was raining while we went, it was still nice to see though.",
          "Under one side of the bridge is the part for tourists, where you can buy souvenirs, sample local foods, look at all sorts of things to buy, and find some lovely bars and restaurants. The other side is where the locals live, and where they shop - it is amazing. We were the only",
          "The street is impressive - full of shops for tourists, but there are bargains to be found! Old China meets tourism - but it's worth the visit, and a very interesting place to just sit and people watch. We also took a boat ride with a terrific driver, who serenaded us with a",
          "Excellent view of the river. There were many small souvenirs and food stores by the side of the river. We took the river boat ride costing Rmb55 to Tigerhill. Beautiful bridges and view. The negative part is that it's only a one way boat ride. We had to catch a taxi or local bus",
          "The main street is very crowded\uff0c it has not much to see because almost all the shops are doing business in modern ways, that make it loose the feeling. But it will be better to view the water way along the canal or from stone bridges, the scenes will give you a feeling that you",
          "The old historical town no doubt been commercialised, it still has its charm for tourists who wish to visit during day time, or go for the evening market which is spoiled with lots of local food and shops.",
          "A must see if you head to Suzhou. I recommend a visit during day time and come back one evening to see the lights. I had a lovely dinner on this street.",
          "Highly recommend a stroll through Shantang Street. I expected this place to be commercial / touristy so I was able to overlook that and absorb the history of this place. Absolutely loved it!",
          "A boot tour on the canal gives you a nice view of the ancient houses in Suzhou. The tourist markets on both sides of the canal are very interesting, as the vegetable/animal market. A very nice walk to see more of the Chinese culture",
          "One of the cannot miss tourist spot in Suzhou. Everything is quite similar to any other ancient streets, very commercialise, you can get all the souvenirs you want, you may try to bargain but not sure you can get the price you want because the prices are pretty much fixed.",
          "Shantang Jie is free (which is awesome) and directly accessible on metro line 2. It's a great sneak peak into old world Suzhou with classic homes and a working canal. You can take a boat ride down the main canal here, or just walk the streets and people watch. It can be a",
          "I used to love this place but by now it is too commercial, too touristy and not really worth going there, unless you nearby and want to take a few pics...The buildings and setup is nice. Also you can combine it with the Shilu shopping area, basically in walking distance.",
          "This is another must see location and gives an insight into the History of the area, I was around during daytime, nighttime and there is some very impressive photo opportunities.",
          "Best to visit in the evening. The atmosphere is very nice and lamps and lights decorates the canal and the streets. Very popular place to go and can be very crowed in the evening and public holidays. Take good time and look around. I have been here often and never been bored so",
          "The street of Shantang awaken all your senses!! A must visit. There is so much going on and it is how the locals live! We walked the full stretch and the sights are great!",
          "Best time to go is in the evening, I went around 5pm and it was beautiful the see how the busy old market street changes into night time. Or come earlier in the day if can really plan to shop and explore because there are so many things to see, and so many foods to try. If you",
          "The little Venice in China. It's nicer to visit in the evening when they light up the red lantern. There's a lot of things to do and places to eat , get souvenirs or just walk around the area. When you're in Suzhou, you should not miss to visit this place.",
          "I visited here one evening after dinner. It was a warm July night and the street was busy. It had a wonderful atmosphere, and as night fell and the lights came on it was quite magical. Lovely to walk at the side of the canal and pass the bars and restaurants. The place is a",
          "Ever been to Venice? Well if you're in Suzhou then this is one of the places you should check out. Doesn't matter when you go, day or night. Though I found it better looking at night when the lights go on and lit up the streets and river. Shantang Street is a traditional",
          "Though it's a place made for tourists, it's not too bad comparing with Guan Qian Jie. There are some interesting shops to see, and a couple of tea house to sit down and drinking tea. It's a small area, take you only a couple of hours maximum, at least gives you a little bit",
          "This is a wee adventure! Best time to hit this for pics is as the sun goes down, as it has great lighting effects. So, do the market first, enjoy the sights and sounds and take pics of the market stalls. Then after that wander back up and under the main road, or over it into the",
          "First part of the street- if you come from the south, Beihao Long- is commercial with shops and many tourists, the middle part function as a morning market with only locals (7-9 am). This part is very narrow and be prepared for a very slow walk during the morning. The street is",

          "An exciting place full of shops and especially pretty at night when the buildings are lit and red lanterns line the narrow streets. Be sure to take a look down some of the side streets as they reveal a whole different world. Very busy at weekends and watch out for the silent",
          "Overated, average chinese traditional street with not many street food available. Not too long, It just need around 30 mins to stroll the street without shopping. They have nice Starbucks with Chinese ornament.",
          "What a fun place to take a walk, look for souviniers and dine at a local restaurant. Some upscale shops but lots of local places as well. Best in the evening as the heat starts to drift away and more people come out. Don't go if you are in a hurry, best to just stroll along.",
          "Awesome place to enjoy local Suzhou. Can enjoy operas, local food, Dairy Queen, Starbucks! A boat ride is recommended. Although try in the day time when it's less crowded. If you buy anything, make sure to bargain!",
          "Great place to enjoy local Suzhou culture. A very beautiful though a little crowded pedestrian sceniC spot of Suzhou. If you like to enjoy opera, go in there at around 10in the morning, and you might see performance, FREE! A boat ride is also recommended. I used to live near",

          "I visited the canals some 30 years ago and find little difference from the early days. There are more local tourist than foreigners this time. Restaurants are now modern, but have more interesting offerings. I did not take the boat ride on this visit",
          "For me Suzhou is like Venice of Italy. There are so many lake ways within the city with old houses lining up next to it. Shantang Street is one such area with a lakeway on one side that's ideal to go for long gondola like boat ride and on the other side you have restaurants and",
          "Wonderful traditional environment. Seeing a canal with lots of rowing boat. Good time to take photos at there. Enjoy eating local food. Must visit !",
          "Shantang street is a must do when visiting Suzhou. Although it can be very busy at times it is definitely worth it and gives some 'hustle and bustle' to the place. There are many touristy shops, and you can often see musicians playing in the building part way along. At the end",

          "Went to this street at night and it was lighted with so many beautiful bulbs. A very nice view indeed. But it's crowded. Along the way, you can find lots of local delicacies. Most shops sells souvenirs and some local made products. The street is easily accessible thru metro",

          "A walk through these lanes will take you back by a few decades for sure. The crowds are interesting and the walk is worth the time. Would suggest to go just before sunset to enjoy the street while daytime and also the lighting after sunset. Take time to enjoy the local shops",
          "Quiet high prices, but you can walk for hours there. People speak English in few stores, and if not there is always ways to get along. Few store that making hand crafts, with loud music, and hammer beets in the tempo. Nice",
          "A great walk. Yes it is crowded, but it is full of local hustle and bustle and is well worth your time. A great place to explore and pick up any thing you fancy in the plethora of side shops and market vendors: good local foods, Chinese clothing, fresh fruit, or knick-knacks and",

          "Located in Suzhou, Jiangsu. This street still has the last century houses and old people live near by. The street is surrounded by a canal and you can buy souvenirs and typical food. Here is the prefect location to make really good pictures. At night the lights give the street a",

          "Shantang Jie is a picturesque, restored and renovated area along a canal at the Northwest corner of the Suzhou old city that evokes older times in China. Avoid going when the area is crowded, such as weekends. We went on a Sunday, which was a mistake. Not only did the crowds",
          "We were kinda lost when we were trying to find this place, fortunately there was a nice local kid who helped us to find this place. It's a very nice place, with the canals and the shops along the streets selling something to eat and drink. You can also take a boat ride there.",
          "Such a beautiful place to see, walk around, eat, and shop a little! I am so glad that I got to experience such a beautiful, historic location!",
          "I only made 2 visits, less than a couple of hours each time, and I already came across countless wedding shoots. The backdrop is a photo treat. Almost at any angle, you're likely to capture something beautiful. Architecture aside, some souvenir shops provide a good deal of local",
          "We were there for one evening and could not believe the beautiful and brightly lit Chinese architecture surrounding the whole street. You can buy souvenirs and have typical Chinese food along this street.",
          "What a place! We had a ball. Take your time, relax by the water and enjoy a meal and a drink, stroll through the streets and over the bridges and wander round the shops. Lovely. The canal boats will take you along for a ride, or you can just sit and do a bit of people",
          "I just had one evening in Suzhou and went here by taxi in the evening hoping to pass a few hours and have dinner. The canal was pretty at night with all the lanterns but the street itself is full of boring tourist shops and there was no inspiring or buzzing place to eat, so I",
          "The part of Old Suzhou along Shantang Lu is similar to famous Chinese ancient water towns like Zhouzhuang, Tongli or Wuzhen. There are historical homes along a canal, each with a boat and stairs down to the water, women \u201cstone-washing\u201d clothes in the canal, flowerpots in",
          "I like everything here! You should try to get into the boat and enjoying the view. Best time to come here is in the evening. Enjoy the coffee and the food there..",
          "I have been to many canal streets in China, and this was definitely not the best one I've been to, but it was quite pleasant. It has several temples and a few sightseeing spots that require tickets. I didn't go to any of these places, but there is more to do than shop there. The",
          "There's a lot of cafe with traditional Chinese interior. It was so nice. So romantic. When i was there, every 3 meter there's a couple took a picture by professional photographer. This place reflect an old China. We also can find Suzhou Food Street.",
          "After visiting Tongli this was a bit of a disappointment but well worth a visit. If you have to chose one canal town over another then I vote for Tongli. This place seemed more modernized than Tongli but was a nice place to wander at night.",
          "This is a very beautiful street with a lot of Chinese characters. I would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting Suzhou. There are some very beautiful shops selling all kinds of things like tea, jade and embroideries. The street is not that long, it is right",

          "We found this a very interesting visit first through the pagoda and it's history through the years then to the gate itself. This is the only Land/water gate left in China and is quite fascinating. Well worth a visit",
          "Shantang used to be a local commercial street for locals to do daily grocery shopping and snacks, but now it is too commercial. Certainly many traditional restaurants and business still exist there and for generations, but their recipe and views can hardly always keep first",
          "If on a short time schedule this street gives an insight into life on the Grand Canal without the fees and time needed to visit a water town. Enough to take a few photos, enjoy some delicacies and browse the tourist shops.",
          "A place you must go while visiting Suzhou. Be really touristy by going in all of the shops and buying the same items that are everywhere in China. Then continue down Shantang and you will find a market that shows how the real citizens of Shantang live.",
          "Very old and traditional street. Lots of little stores selling cheap souvenir items. Good place to spend a few hours walking around.",
          "Stayed in YHA hostel nearby Shantang street where food and souvenirs are easy to find. Note that this is a pedestrian only street, no vehicle is allowed inside. (well, except bicycles)",
          "Thanks to the tour guide, we learned a thing or two about this important and famous place. Loved watching newlyweds taking pictures there.",
          "The street is very beautiful, in the beginning there are many nice shops, food, gifts and handcraft, there is also quite a lot of visitors but after 300-400 meters you will find more peaceful path along the river where you can get close to local people life. In the first part of",
          "We went to visit this area at night and it was absolutley beautiful with all of the lit red lanterns. This is a long street with different uses in areas. Along the way there is a residential area and then there is the market area. We also got a chance to go down the area by boat",
          "Small streets of little shops and restaurants. Fascinating and atmospheric - not to be missed. Watched a practioner of traditional Chinese medicine in action right on the street. Altogether a lovely experience!",

          "This street is really nice for the first kilometer or so. It's new, it's clean, it's renovated, there are plenty of people walking around, the canal is clean and pretty. Once you leave this nice spot, if you keep walking, you reach a really scummy part of town. It continues like",
          "Very nice, real old style Chinese street with a canal. Lots of cafes on both sides of canal, very very crowded though, long queue for canal boat trip. A must visit place in Suzhou.",
          "Very real and not for the faint hearted. The canal trip was interesting, it was winter time so it looked drab and grey and misty with amazing splashes of color from peoples laundry hanging outside! The farmers market is real, raw, dirty, with ALL kinds of raw meat on the",
          "Had a great shopping experience here, but get ready to bargain! Don't be afraid to walk away if they won't give you the price they want....you'll eventually get it!",
          "Very nice atmosphere at night. Red lanterns swaying in the wind, shops selling local snacks....won't get lost.",
          "This is a great site which is well kept. Make sure you head in the correct direction. Initially I ventured the wrong way and ended up in a dirty backstreet. Once I found the correct way it was a lovely site to explore, plenty of photos with locals :)",
          "It is a good way to get to Tiger Hill walking or on a bike. Definitely worth a visit. Not much in the way of nice restaurants but there is one square with some musicians playing some traditional music. The bridges over canal are nice as well.",
          "Loved the atmosphere. Lots of interesting shops. A slice of china of the imagination. Interesting canal ride too. Go at night.",
          "this area is kept in the tradition of the old city, with pedestrian only access, multiple bridges and small alleys and ancient sites throughout...we stayed at a hotel, the royal garden inn, that was a great deal for the price, allowing us to wake up right on the canal and",
          "My local Suzhou friend brought me here for a walk along the canal and shopping. What a great time! We went into almost every shop, looking at cut paper designs, embroidered pictures, silk, combs...the list goes on and on. The tea house/opera stage had costumes and pictures",
          "We visited the section of Shantang Street at the base of Tiger Hill and it was nothing special. All you will find there are shops selling the normal tat and a few overpriced restaurants. You get funnelled through it on the way out of Tiger Hill as the exit is built in a way",

          "Go to Tiger Hill mid day, when you are finished with that, take a boat ride to Shantang Street. Walk all the way down the street, preferably at night! The street is beuatiful during the evening, all the lanterns are lit up! the shops are really cute too.",
          "Very crowded but at least there were no vendors bugging you to buy stuff. We took a wrong turn and ended up in a less touristy area. Quite a difference between what Shantang Lu is, but you get a good view of Suzhou's daily life",
          "This was one of my places to visit in China and if I return, I would spend more time here. This is the China of my imagination. P.S. the horrible smell is fermenting tofu!",
          "I went in this street to buy summer clothes. It was like going to an old China town.There are different kinds of things to buy there but the most that i like is the Wall frames that looks like painting at fat but when you go near, it really is embroidery. awesome! various unique",
          "It is a great place to just simply spend time and hang out here. Experience old chinese style living although it gets too commercial with prices. You get to go for a boat ride along the canal street that runs along the street. There is also a tea house that has special opera",
          "Highly recommended to visit, especially at the canal part. Go there at night time, and it is extremely beautiful. Chill out beside the canal with drink while eating.. Memorable!",
          "Pleasant canal strolls until you hit the shopping street. Best advise is to head up the canal rather than down it!",
          "Yes, it is a little touristy but the buildings and the street kind of brings you back to way back when. The view at the beginning of the street with the red lanterns lining up the canal is beautiful during the day and stunning by evening. The only issue with walking along the",
          "Shantang Jie is great fun: both on foot and by boat. We typically take our guests to Tiger Hill and then take the boat to Shantang street \"tourist part\": the view is really nice. You get to see the old houses from the canal point-of-view and look at local life on the terraces.",
          "You have to go but we were a bit disappointed - tooo touristy. Perhaps we missed something. Pingjiang Road has more character. However, the area at the start of the road is fascinating, full of local colour such as hairdressers in the street.",
          "but beware fo the rotten toufu smell from under the bridge... :D",
          "fun, fun, fun Beware of the scooter drivers. They are everywhere, even on the sidewalks. You really have to be careful when walking because of this. What can I say. When in China take this as their culture and enjoy",
          "There's a museum worth visiting , entrance fee is RMb45. It's a well maintained \"resort\" or ancient house? You can take a 30min river cruise for RMB45, around evening as the lights up make the whole ShangTang street very pretty. There are many shops along the street and a nice",
          "Shantang Jie, just north of Shi Lu, in the NW corner of Suzhou is a great little street. The initial part is quite touristy, but is very photographic during the day and particularly in the evening. TIP: Once you pass through the very first stone arch, hang an immediate left,",
          "Chinese friends took us here in the evening. The lantern-lit setting, with small shops and stores along a narrow lane paved with granite blocks certainly makes you feel you're in an earlier century. Looking down the canal behind the buildings is also an unforgettable image."

        "wiki": "Yu Garden or Yuyuan Garden (simplified Chinese: \u8c6b\u56ed; traditional Chinese: \u8c6b\u5712; pinyin: Y\u00f9 Yu\u00e1n, Shanghainese \"Yuyu\" lit. Garden of Happiness) is an extensive Chinese garden located beside the City God Temple in the northeast of the Old City of Shanghai at Huangpu Qu, Shanghai Shi. It abuts the Yuyuan Tourist Mart, the Huxinting Teahouse and the Yu Garden Bazaar.This garden is accessible from the Shanghai Metro's Line 10 Yuyuan Garden Station.A centerpiece is the Exquisite Jade Rock (\u7389\u73b2\u73d1) a porous 3.3-m, 5-ton boulder. Rumours about its origin include the story that it was meant for the Huizong Emperor (Northern Song Dynasty from 1100-1126 AD) at the imperial palace in Beijing,  but was salvaged from the Huangpu River after the boat carrying it had sunk.\n\n\n== History ==\nYu Garden was first built in 1559 during the Ming Dynasty by Pan Yunduan as a comfort for his father, the minister Pan En, in his old age. Pan Yunduan began the project after failing one of the imperial exams, but his appointment as governor of Sichuan postponed construction for nearly twenty years until 1577. The garden was the largest and most prestigious of its era in Shanghai, but eventually its expense helped ruin the Pans.The garden was inherited by Zhang Zhaolin, Pan Yunduan's granddaughter's husband, and then passed to different owners. A section was briefly organised by Zhang Shengqu as the \"Academy of Purity and Harmony\" (\u6e05\u548c\u4e66\u9662, Q\u012bng-H\u00e9 Sh\u016byu\u00e0n) and the Ling Yuan (\u7075\u82d1, L\u00edng Yu\u00e0n, lit. \"Spirit Park\"), today's East Garden, was purchased by a group of local leaders in 1709. A group of merchants renovated the increasingly decrepit grounds in 1760 and in 1780 the West Garden was opened to the general public.The gardens suffered damage numerous times during the 19th century. During the First Opium War, the British army used the Huxinting Teahouse as a base of operations for several days in 1842. During the Taiping Rebellion, the Small Swords Society ran its headquarters in the Dianchun Hall; by the time Qing troops recovered the garden, the original structures had nearly all been destroyed. They were damaged again by the Japanese in 1942 before being repaired by Liangshun Han (Rockery Han) appointed by the Shanghai government from 1956 to 1961. They were opened to the public in 1961 and declared a national monument in 1982.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nToday, Yu Garden occupies an area of 2 hectares (5 acres), and is divided into six general areas laid out in the Suzhou style:\n\nSansui Hall (\u4e09\u7a57\u5802, S\u0101n Su\u00ec T\u00e1ng, lit. \"Three Tassel Hall\") \u2013 includes the Grand Rockery (\u5927\u5047\u5c71, D\u00e0 Ji\u01cesh\u0101n ), a 12-meter-high rockery made of huangshi stone, featuring peaks, cliffs, winding caves, and gorges. This scenery was possibly created by Zhang Nanyang during the Ming Dynasty.\nWanhua Chamber (\u4e07\u82b1\u697c, W\u00e0n Hu\u0101 L\u00f3u, lit. \"Chamber of the Ten Thousand Flowers\")\nDianchun Hall (\u70b9\u6625\u5802, Di\u01cen Ch\u016bn T\u00e1ng, lit. \"Heralding Spring Hall\") \u2013 built in 1820, the first year of the Daoguang Emperor; served as the base of the Small Swords Society from September 1853 to February 1855\nHuijing Hall (\u4f1a\u666f\u697c, Hu\u00ec J\u01d0ng L\u00f3u)\nYuhua Hall (\u7389\u534e\u5802, Y\u00f9 Hu\u00e1 T\u00e1ng, lit. \"Jade Magnificence Hall\") \u2013 furnished with rosewood pieces from the Ming Dynasty, shares its name with a mountain near Xinye in Zhejiang.\nInner Garden (\u5185\u56ed, N\u00e8i Yu\u00e1n) \u2013 rockeries, ponds, pavilions, and towers; first laid out in 1709 and more recently recreated in 1956 by combining its east and west gardens.Each area is separated from the others by \"dragon walls\" with undulating gray tiled ridges, each terminating in a dragon's head.\n\n\n=== Features ===\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nClassical Gardens of Suzhou\nList of Chinese gardens\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Yu Yuan map\".

Beautifully maintained ancient architecture with lots of meaningful shopping and food outside. It's meaningful to come here as a tourist.",
          "Great example of a family compound (although a rich family) that has been here for several centuries.   Well worth visiting with a reasonable entry fee. There are a myriad of tourist shops next to the gardens and it can get quite crowded but I thinks adds to the atmosphere.",

          "Classical Chinese architecture in Ming Dynasty, such a beautiful ancient peaceful place. Worth visiting even in winter.

      "name": "The Bund",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Bund or Waitan (Chinese: \u5916\u6ee9; pinyin: W\u00e0it\u0101n, Shanghainese: nga3thae1, lit.: 'Outer Beach') is a waterfront area in central Shanghai. The area centers on a section of Zhongshan Road (East Zhongshan Road No.1) within the former Shanghai International Settlement, which runs along the western bank of the Huangpu River in the eastern part of Huangpu District. The area along the river faces the modern skyscrapers of Lujiazui in the Pudong District. The Bund usually refers to the buildings and wharves on this section of the road, as well as some adjacent areas. From the 1860s to the 1930s, it was the rich and powerful center of the foreign establishment in Shanghai, operating as a legally protected treaty port.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe word bund means an embankment or an embanked quay. The word comes from the Persian word band, through Hindustani, meaning an embankment, levee or dam (a cognate of English terms \"bind\", \"bond\" and \"band\", and the German word \"Bund\"). Mumbai's Apollo Bunder and city names like Bandar Abbas and Banda Aceh share the same etymology. The various \"bunds\" in east Asia, may therefore be named after the bunds/levees in Baghdad along the Tigris, given by the immigrating Baghdadi Jews, like the prominent Baghdadi Sassoon family who settled their businesses in Shanghai, and other port cities in east Asia in the 19th century, and heavily built up their harbors. In these Chinese port cities, the English term came to mean, especially, the embanked quay along the shore. In English, \"Bund\" is pronounced to rhyme with \"fund\".\n,(for example, the Yokohama Bund). However, \"The Bund\", without qualification to location, usually refers to this stretch of embanked riverfront in Shanghai. \nThe Chinese name for the Bund is unrelated in meaning: it means literally the \"outer bank\", referring to the Huangpu River, because this part of the riverfront was located farther downstream than the \"inner bank\" area adjacent to the old walled city of Shanghai.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Shanghai Bund has dozens of historical buildings, lining the Huangpu River, that once housed numerous banks and trading houses from the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Italy, Russia, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and Belgium, as well as the consulates of Russia and Britain, a newspaper, the Shanghai Club and the Masonic Club. The Bund lies north of the old, walled city of Shanghai. It was initially a British settlement; later the British and American settlements were combined in the International Settlement. Magnificent commercial buildings in the Beaux Arts style sprang up in the years around the turn of the 20th century as the Bund developed into a major financial center of east Asia. Directly to the south, and just northeast of the old walled city, the former French Bund (the quai de France, part of the Shanghai French Concession) was of comparable size to the Bund but functioned more as a working harbourside.\n\nBy the 1940s, the Bund housed the headquarters of many, if not most, of the major financial institutions operating in China, including the \"big four\" national banks in the Republic of China era. However, with the Communist victory in the Chinese civil war, many of the financial institutions were moved out gradually in the 1950s, and the hotels and clubs closed or converted to other uses. The statues of colonial figures and foreign worthies which had dotted the riverside were also removed.\n\n\n=== Post Cultural Revolution ===\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, with the thawing of economic policy in the People's Republic of China, buildings on the Bund were gradually returned to their former uses. Government institutions were moved out in favour of financial institutions, while hotels resumed trading as such. Also during this period, a series of floods caused by typhoons motivated the municipal government to construct a tall levee along the riverfront, with the result that the embankment now stands some 10 metres higher than street level.  In the 1990s, Zhongshan Road (named after Sun Yat-sen), the road on which the Bund is centred, was widened to ten lanes. As a result, most of the parkland which had existed along the road disappeared. Also in this period, the ferry wharves connecting the Bund and Pudong, which had served the area's original purpose, were removed. A number of pleasure cruises still operate from some nearby wharves.\nIn the 1990s, the Shanghai government attempted to promote an extended concept of the Bund to boost tourism, and land value in nearby areas, as well as to reconcile the promotion of \"colonial relics\" with the Socialist ideology. In its expanded form, the term \"Bund\" (as \"New Bund\" or \"Northern Bund\") was used to refer to areas south of the Yan'an Road, and a stretch of riverfront north of the Suzhou River (Zhabei). Such use of the term, however, remains rare outside of tourism literature.\n\n\n== Twenty first century redevelopment ==\n\nFrom 2008, a major reconfiguration of traffic flow along the Bund was carried out. The first stage of the plan involved the southern end of the Bund, and saw the demolition of a section of the Yan'an Road elevated expressway, including removal of the large elevated expressway exit structure that formerly dominated the confluence of Yan'an Road and the Bund. A second phase involved the year-long restoration of the century-old Waibaidu Bridge at the northern end of the Bund. In a third stage, the former 10-lane Bund roadway was reconstructed in two levels, with six lanes carried in a new tunnel. The vacated road space was used to widen the landscaped promenade along the waterfront. The new concrete bridge that was built in 1991 to relieve traffic on Waibaidu Bridge was rendered obsolete by the new double-levelled roadway, and demolished.\nThe Bund was reopened to the public on Sunday 28 March 2010 after restoration for the 2010 Expo.\n\nA stampede occurred on December 31, 2014, at 11:36 p.m. in the waterfront. At least 36 people were killed and 47 injured in the incident. The primary incident took place near Chen Yi Square, where a large crowd, estimated at around 300,000, had gathered for the new year celebration.The bund is one of the most prominent features when viewed from the Shanghai World Financial Center in Pudong and its observation deck on the 100th floor.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\nThe Bund stretches one mile (1.6 km) along the bank of the Huangpu River. Traditionally, the Bund begins at Yan'an Road (formerly Edward VII Avenue) in the south and ends at Waibaidu Bridge (formerly Garden Bridge) in the north, which crosses Suzhou Creek.\nThe Bund centres on a stretch of the Zhongshan Road, named after Sun Yat-sen. Zhongshan Road is a largely circular road which formed the traditional conceptual boundary of Shanghai city \"proper\". To the west of this stretch of the road stands some 52 buildings of various Western classical and modern styles which is the main feature of the Bund (see Architecture and buildings below). To the east of the road was formerly a stretch of parkland culminating at Huangpu Park. (This park is the site of the infamous sign reported to have proclaimed \"no dogs or Chinese\", although this exact wording never existed. Further information, including an image of the sign, can be found at the article on Huangpu Park.) This area is now much reduced due to the expansion of Zhongshan Road. Further east is a tall levee, constructed in the 1990s to ward off flood waters. The construction of this high wall has dramatically changed the appearance of the Bund.\nNear the Nanjing Road intersection stands what is currently the only bronze statue along the Bund. It is a statue of Chen Yi, the first Communist mayor of Shanghai. At the northern end of The Bund, along the riverfront, is Huangpu Park, in which is situated the Monument to the People's Heroes - a tall, abstract concrete tower which is a memorial for those who died during the revolutionary struggle of Shanghai dating back to the First Opium War.\n\n\n== Architecture and buildings ==\n\nThe Bund houses 52 buildings of various architectural styles, generally Eclecticist, but with some buildings displaying predominantly Romanesque Revival, Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, Baroque Revival, Neo-Classical or Beaux-Arts styles, and a number in Art Deco style (Shanghai has one of the richest collections of Art Deco architectures in the world). From the south, the main buildings are:\n\nAmerican Club 209 Fuzhou Rd - General Claire Chennault, then Executive Director of China Post 1,  used the premises until 1948.

The present building was completed in 1923. At the time, it was called \"the most luxurious building between the Suez Canal and the Bering Strait\". Its famous ceiling mosaics have been fully restored, and can be viewed inside the entrance hall.\nThe Customs House (No. 13, The Bund), was built in 1927 on the site of an earlier, traditional Chinese-style customs house.

Today, it forms the other part of the Peace Hotel.\nBank of China Building (No. 23, The Bund) housed the headquarters of the Bank of China.

The closest station is East Nanjing Road, about a five-minute walk up Nanjing Road. East-1 Zhongshan Road is a major bus route.\nThere were previously frequent ferry services operating by Shanghai Ferry from wharves on and near the Bund. The most popular remaining ferry service runs from Jinling Road wharf, near the southern end of the Bund, to Dongchang Road wharf, at the southern end of Lujiazui across the river. A full fare ride on the ferry costs 2 RMB. \n\nA number of companies offer Huangpu River cruises (boat tours) departing from the wharf; all of the major buildings in the Bund, and in Pudong, are illuminated each evening.A pedestrian transit tunnel crosses the Huangpu River from the Bund. Passengers board slow-moving SK people movers which travel along the tunnel, with light effects projected onto the walls of the tunnel. These effects are marketed as a tourist attraction; the charge for the tunnel is ten times the fee for crossing the river on Line 2 and 20 times the 2 RMB fee for crossing by ferry.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThere are numerous studies in Chinese and English, and many popular representations.The Bund was featured in the 1984 novel Empire of the Sun by British author J.G. Ballard, based on his experiences as a boy during the Japanese invasion and occupation.

          "Whilst on business I had been able to take my son, so we headed out on an organised trip that took us to the Bund. It\u2019s a really great location on the river and allows you to see the Financial District with its futuristic towers, but also to get a feel of the more historic",

          "Went to the Bund at night during the May Day holidays. Big mistake! The crowd was horrendous. We were literally pushed along by the sea of people as soon as we exited from East Nanjing metro station towards the bund. The police were out in full force controlling the crowd.",
          "I went to The Bund a couple of times because everyone said you should go there. Once during the day and it was empty. Then at night and it was packed due to a holiday. It's a large area to walk around along the river. I'm not sure where it starts and ends but I'm sure I",
          "All visitors to Shanghai should take a stroll along the waterfront area known as the Bund. On one side of the Huangpu river there are European style buildings. Look across the river at the massive modern skyscrapers of all shapes and sizes. At the North end of the Bund is the",
          "This is the elevated leeve that runs for a mile or two along the Huangpu River and gives you a pleasant view of the city. It is easy to hop on and off to go visit buildings you find interesting as you stroll. We had a guide who was able to talk about the history of the buildings",

          "One of the best views on the Lujiazui skyline. Furthermore, many historical buildings that once housed numerous banks and trading houses. Less know to most tourists is the Wall Street Charging Bull's brother, designed by same artist Arturo Ugo Di Medica. Typically very crowded",
          "Every trip to SHanghai should include a visit to the bund. It's fine during the day but best at night where you'll see an incredible free light show and the Shanghai skyline. They turn the lights off around 10 pm so go early evening. There are plenty of restaurants and bars",
          "overrated, overcrowded, only went because it was a tourist thing to do. Go at night so the lights on the buildings make it worth while, and don't bother walking down the shopping streets - too busy and too expensive. Instead walk along the boardwalk and enjoy the lights.",
          "The Bund is a main meeting place for locals and tourists in Shanghai - it skirts along the Huangpu River. It is a must see-do site. The river is wide and long. The river traffic includes ferries, launches, and pleasure craft. It is basically a wide \"cement\" walkway. There",

          "The Bund is a nice place to see the lights and the skyline of the city. You see some of the famous landmarks of shanghai such as the pearl tower, jinmao tower and the shanghai tower (2nd tallest building in the world). The best time would be right before sundown that way you get",
          "Standing at the rivers edge, looking across at the Pearl Tower, and World Finance centre is a good way to spend a bit of time. Watching the boats and barges going up and downstream, moving th goods tat are the life blood of China. There is a lot to see, and is also a nice walk.",

          "The place to go in Shanghai. We had a layover in Shanghai and we had just few hours. The place is very nice overlooking the river. You can enjoy a nice walk and visit the shops in the area. It is kind of far from the airport.",
          "I always enjoy watching towers and here is where you an astonishing view of many towers. I was there an hour before sunset and saw both day and night view. The only negative point was that on the bridge there is no where to sit and take a rest so maybe you have stand at least 3",

          "Everybody talks about the Bund while in Shanghai, it is nice for a walk. I haven't taken the river tour thought.",
          "The best time is way after sunset. Before approaching the Bund, you will be aware of a certain glow in the sky and as you get closer, the traffic gets congested with more pedestrians moving towards the epicenter of a UFO as it were. Once you reach the Boulevard the hustle",
          "We went on a very foggy day unfortunately, so we saw a less common view across the bund. It was still very beautiful to see the buildings half visible, a little like a ghost city. I'd recommend going on a clear night to see all the lights and city, and then also on a foggy day",
          "Great way to see the skyline of the financial district day or night. Ferries are available to take you across the river for sight seeing and access to viewing towers. Too much fog in January to go up the towers though.",

          "The Bund waterfront is on the banks of river Huangpu. Its like Marine Drive of Mumbai, which is facing the sea. You can have a beautiful view of the river with skyscrapers across the river. Its worth taking a walk on the Bund. One can take a cruise also. Carry an umbrella",
          "We visited both in the day and night and I feel you should do both as both are great photo opportunities. You don't need to allow a great deal of time as once you have the photos it is more of a financial district. The is also a large bull stature which is similar to the one",
          "Had a very good couple of days wounding around the Bund. Try a trip down the river on the boat is a great way to see the Bund",
          "The view of the bund is just splendid. Across the river you get a view of the skyscrapers and on the bund side you get a view of nice European style buildings all light up. Western style buildings are pretty rare in China so it's an interesting sight to see",
          "This is a must do for Shanghai. The shops and stores are all the same you'd find in any large city so nothing really special there. There are some very good restaurants in the area. But it's not about the insides but what is happening outside. The lights at night-so fun so",

          "This is one of the most must visit point when in Shanghai. The view is very beautiful (both day and night) - hopefully there would be no low hanging clouds or mist. I would suggest to visit both sides of the river to see the different views as for me both sides are equally",
          "I was looking for an option around the bund after many visits you keep loving it but the idea of having another perspective and visiting other places for dinner this showed up as good alternative, we loved the walk around there are several options to eat around this area, they",
          "I went with friends and we were surprised to know that we have come to visit in a timely September week. They were celebrating the moon festival so ALL lights at the bund area were lit. What an amazing view from the bay area. Make Shanghai your bucket list...",

          "We walked some on the Bund. We were waiting for more buildings to light up after 5. We were told that the most interesting building lights up at 6:30. There are free toilets in several places. There is a visitor center with people that know English.",

          "We visited The Bund in Shanghai last month during our trip to China. The Bund, the historical founding site for the city located right along the river, was very interesting. It's a site of major comparisons with the old historical buildings on one bank, all classical and",

          "Nice during the day but really needs to be seen during the night. The light show is spectacular. The night time cruises do enhance the experience a little, but maybe not enough to justify the cost. Yes there are plenty of people but still able to get the shots you want and",

          "Came here in December 2019, and the view is certainly breaktaking. On the Puxi side is where the historic colonial-era buildings are, and they have been restored to perfection. Across the Huangpu river are the modern skyscrapers with bright lights. Certainly worth a visit to",
          "Went full of expectations but found a murky river, view of fancy sky-scrapers and an odd selection of older style European office buildings. Lots of photo kiosks but nowhere to find a decent coffee. Lights tunnel straight from Disneyland ends up in a backstreet on the other",
          "We were blown away by how beautiful and modern the cities in China are, and the Bund and Shanghai are their crown jewels. Be sure to take the nighttime boat ride on the Huangpu river. The upgrade to the top level is worth it.",

          "I had high hopes for the Bund but was disappointed. Perhaps I set my expectations too high. You walk on a promenade and view the city's spectacular skyline, but that is about it. You don't really get that close to the older buildings. Tips: You will be walking a lot. There",

          "Yes, the buildings are amazing, but I was expecting there would be a bit more too it. There are some old-style buildings across the street, and some stands selling sodas, but that\u2019s about all I saw. To me, it wasn\u2019t a place to spend more than 10-15 minutes.",
          "Visiting Shanghai without visiting its symbol is IMPOSSIBLE! So it is a must see when you are in Shanghai. You should be there both in day and night and enjoy the spectacular landscape in day light and of course fabulous lighting at nights. But to see all building full of lights",
          "Loved walking along the Bund and looking across the river towards the city skyline. The beautiful view of Shanghai is something I will never forget. I did a night cruise with The Huangpu River tours which was a bit tacky but worth it to see the city from the water.",

          "A day visit is great, but after dark, the buildings are lit up with various colors, scenes, etc., it's hard to believe that so much lighting can be so enjoyable. Numerous cruises are offered, but a leisurely walk reveals more than enough lights than you can enjoy. Very",
          "This is a must go to place while in Shanghai as its an iconic area where the first jetties were built in 1880s and from there expanded into a economic area. You need to go there at least twice, one in the daytime and another in the night time. But you may need to trips if you",

          "By day you can walk along the riverside boardwalk and maybe watch a local couple taking their wedding photographs or perhaps a model with her camera entourage. But I believe this is best visited at night as it is truly a spectacular sight. It is not expensive to book a River",
          "On this side (Pudong) it is less crowded as on the North side. It is really nice to see the barges, ferry boats and excursion boats on the river. Also it is nice to watch the illuminated buildings. Recommendation cross over the river by ferry boat for 1 RMB.",
          "Great for strolling, people-watching and at dusk, watching the lights on the sky-scrapers across the river.",
          "Watch the glimmering skyline of the new Shanghai day and night. The boardwalk is amazing allows you to walk along the river.",
          "The bund is extremely crowded on weekends. Nice to visit once but I will not go again. Evening is nicer than daytime with the lightings but really crowded. What stood out was how contrasting the buildings are on each side of the river, old vs modern.",
          "This is a wonderful and very popular walk along the river with river cruises, restaurants and drinks kiosks along the way. The views across the water are stunning at night. The best views are on the stretch from Waibaidu Bridge in the North to Shiliupu Marina.in the South. Just",
          "This is the place everyone must visit when in Shanghai. The promenade is filled with tourists - local and foreign. Every one is capturing the views of the opposite shore Liujiazui, Putong and the Huangpu River. The scene with the nightly lights up is beautiful, but too packed",

          "We visited the bind during the daytime and found it really pretty and the contrast between East and west was totally impressive. However we decided to go back in the evening and watching the skyline light up building by building was like watching fireworks in slow motion.",

          "Amazing views of the Shanghai skyline especially the pearl TV tower and Shanghai tower. It was a very hot day and quite uncomfortable without shade so didn't walk down along the Bund but walked down Nanjing rd for ice cream and coconut drinks. There is a great food court just a",

          "The tour at night time is a must, the lights on every building are gorgeous and together make an impressive showcase, not far from the sights in the cult sci-fi classic film. Some of the lights are animated so it's a must see!",

          "It is amazing to see the lights at night as they change and shine off of the buildings. If you can get a hotel along the river with a river view and fairly high up it is worth it. It wasn't too busy along the walkway when we were there in the beginning of November 2019, even",

          "A visit to Shanghai would not be the same without a visit to the Bund. You get the best views over the city and see it in all it\u2019s glory. Yes it is full of tourists but you need that photo as well. Do walk on the other side of the road as well and look at the amazing Art Deco",
          "If you come early in the morning you'll see some elders practising taiqi or meditating, young people running, lonely walkers. All this makes wonderful atmosphere when it's peaceful and quiet. A must to visit!",
          "At this time of the year, the Pearl Tower and the Shanghai skyline\u2019s two tallest buildings light up at about 7:00 pm. As such, when we arrived on a Sunday night at 6:50, hoards of people were crowded onto the observation deck (no bicycles allowed), sitting on all the steps",
          "Enjoying strolling along the Bund on a mid summers night with my wife, and hearing all the people's voices and chatter, very interesting.",
          "Lots of people for people watching. The steps going up and down are guarded by uniformed Chinese soldiers for some odd reason. The skyline is incredible and I am sure like many large Chinese Cities the Buildings dance at night with light. I wouldn\u2019t call it FUN but it is worth",
          "In my opinion the best place to see modern/historical shanghai. A great mix of the old European style buildings and a huge modern skyline.",
          "As we walked from our hotel (Fairmont peace)to the Bund the crowds got bigger and bigger. It became a bit of crush to go up the stairs and finally onto the Bund. While the views of the river and skyline were outstanding the crowds were unbelievable. Similar to those we had",
          "Lovely to view the bund at night. Plenty of restaurants and bars. We visited Bar rouge and Mercato. We went to the viewing Gallery of the World Financial centre",
          "The infamous Shanghai skyline that is beautiful during the day and even more phenomenal during the night. There\u2019s a really nice walk along the riverfront. With photographers offering to take your photo and print for quite a reasonable price. The Bund is a MUST visit while",
          "Took a family trip. With in laws and nephews. Stunning vistas and boat trips. The Chinese people I have found to be wonderful and friendly if one makes the effort.",
          "Went on a weekend, which is definitely not advisable. Choose a weekday if you are going, otherwise you will have to jostle with a huge crowd. The view of the skyline after all the jostling is alright, if you manage to get a clear shot without a stray selfie stick in your frame.",
          "This is a must-see place and if possible, go on the cruise to enjoy the evening lights. Be prepared as it is a very crowded place all year round and worse during peak season. Check out the lights when it comes on at 7:00pm and it is quite a sight to behold!",
          "Visit the Bund in the evening. The light show is very good. Shanghai is as expected a nice city. Be prepared for the crowds, we could hardly walk at times as it was August and school holidays. We took a ferry ride on the river which was very nice.",
          "This is the iconic experience in Shanghai. Go at night to see the incredible light show that illuminates the new buildings across the river and the older buildings to the west.",
          "Beautiful at night! It is a must see but note it is very crowded! May have been because we were there during Chinese holiday!",
          "Like old quater, from period of British occupation. Very lively place with waljing path and amazing views to new part od Shanghai...",
          "A must visit for Shanghai skyline. We can walk along the river from the Nanjing road. We also took the boat from the pier to the other side with Shanghai tower, oriental Pearl building, and IFC building.",
          "Instead of just heading down here, call Gray Line and reserve Grace. She will make your day special.",
          "The bund is definitely one of the most beautiful sites in Shang Hai. I have been there at the evening and night time. It is a quiet place. Good to have a walk and for photo taking. Suprisingly it was not as crowded as I thought.",
          "Great views of the lights of Shanghai from the Bund. This is a must visit in Shanghai. Note the lights tend to be turned off around 11pm to get there prior for the best views.",
          "The Bund is a vibrant area located on the river. During the day people gather to see the traffic on the river, and of course the replica of the Wall Street Bull. At night it really shines. The buildings across the river are all lit up in wonderful color and amazing light shows.",
          "A must see if you visit Shanghai, shows the true splendor , visit during right to see the light show",
          "If in Shanghai, this is the 'must see' place to go to at night. The view is absolutely amazing. The lighting on the building across the river are fantastic. Very very busy.... crowds everywhere... but def. worth it!",
          "On a clear day the views are amazing, even better at night. But at night there are tens (or hundreds) of thousands of people here. Really hard to move around. I've found the best bet is to go to one of the bars or restaurants overlooking the Bund, having some height really",
          "We went during the day and evening. We really enjoyed the evening view more,way more beautiful. It was alittle busy but we found a gap along the river and took some beautiful pictures.",

          "This was always busy anytime of the day or night. We walked there from our hotel to explore Shanghai on foot. The older architecture was more interesting one side of Huangpu River which can be admired more during the day. You can take the scenic decker bus to see the top part",
          "Great place for a walk. Do visit during the day and the evening as the sights are completely different.",
          "The Bund is amazing with no matter who go with. It\u2019s just a magnificent sight for everyone and a must-see when you come to Shanghai. And it\u2019s beautiful both at day and in the evening with all the lights, just incredible! The Bund is generally always crowded with both tourists",
          "This is a very nice place to walk on and enjoy the fantastic views of the beautiful modern mega structures of Shanghai from the other side of the river. I will recommend take some water as it is a concrete structure and in daytime it will get hot. The evening stroll down the",
          "Went there just because it is The place to visit in Shanghai. It can be crowded on public holidays but usually is accessible. The architecture from the past century and the stories around them as well as the futuristic buildings across he river tell a lot about the progress in",

          "Not much here. Go explore the suburbs and you will find so much more. Shanghai is vast and worth exploring. If your meal is above 20 RMB you're in the wrong place, or it has to be hella good!",
          "Visited the Bund during the day walking past the old and new buildings with many different designs and architecture - so interesting. Went under the river using the pedestrian only crossing, the light show tunnel, quirky but fun. Walked around the elevated bridges in the",
          "I have visited the bund during my two weeks in Shanghai the skyline is impressive and entertaining. Would definitely recommend a visit there",
          "Recommended to visit at night. Also consider taking a boat tour, from which you can enjoy an good view over the bund. Very crowded, mostly Chinese tourists. May be difficult to find (fair) taxi driver after the visit in the area.",
          "The Bund of course is a very known Shanghai tourist attraction and in my view the early evening is the best time to jostle with the crowds. A truely relaxing experience to wander along the top of th bind along with the great number of Chinese tourists that you will encounter",
          "Gorgeous view with high traffic (foot) corridor. Very nice view of East Shanghai. Must visit the Wall Street bull",
          "Visiting the Bund is altogether a different experience. Best seen at night with the lighting, It attracts one to the amazing architecture of the Buildings along the river. Best view can be observed on roof top of any of the Buildings. There are many roof top restaurants from",
          "Walking through The Bund, is a great experience. It is incredible the progress that has been made in the last 30 years when you look at the new settlement.",
          "The bund is just a promenade along the waterway, first used by new couples to prevent being seen,. It has developed into a decent walk along the river, past the shopping areas.",

          "Amazing views and well organized. You can see all modernity from most of the sides with all those beautiful buildings and the past with historical buildings. Of course recommended at night with all the lights. Pay attention to all locals wanting to help you or selling you",

          "On previous visits we visited at night. It loses much of its charm in the day! The famous buildings on the other side look better with the lights than through the smog. The colonial buildings are interesting.",
          "Day or by night it is a very busy place. The night lights are why most people go. I have been many times . Do not go on a public holiday as too many people. I found viewing the lights from both sides of the river is a must. A walk along the river is also good.",
          "Visually stunning place to visit as night falls with contrasting old and new architecture. Very busy though!",
          "A must see at night with boats and highrise light shows. Huge crowds on weekend nights....100k+ so it took 40min to actually get down the streets and on to the bund for 10 min photo opp. Still its worth negotiating the crowd if you can only go on weekend.",
          "Place that you can view scenic old and new town side by side. You can walk around for sight seeing, more beautiful at evening to night time.. just enjoy the atmosphere",
          "We walked along the river during the day and saw the stunning skyline on the opposite side of the river. Well worth seeing even during the day",
          "Beautiful night skyline. It is definitely worth doing one if the many ferries. We loved it. It was about an hour. We went the entire length of the river.",
          "This is an stunning view, a very lively environment, and an unforgettable experience in my life. All those marvelous colours reflected in a beautiful river, and the dynamicity of the scene, give you an energetic vibe. Never forget this scene if you ever go to Shanghai.",
          "Iconic views of Shanghai\u2019s iconic buildings. Oh yes and huge crowds if you come at sunset. Either come during the day or later in the evening when the crowds have gone. Having said that everyone was very ordered and the que to get up to the bund moved really quickly. We came",
          "Wow, just wow - what an experience, a view I will never forget. The views from the south of the Bund are remarkable and something to behold. We took the boat trip a 11pm and the entire landscape came alive with neon lights that changed the wall art of the buildings every few",
          "Totally worth hustling your way through the crowds at sunset. A night time view is spectacular. Lots of places to eat drink along the strip and a nice walk along the promenade.",
          "these spectacular buildings along the Bund date back to end of 19/early 20 century. Only problem is the hassling by locals trying to sell imitation watches etc. No respect for personal space",

          "Beautiful area - showing you what modern China really looks like. Very crowded - do try a restaurant or a bar with a view instead of walking - hopefully you can avoid crowds",
          "We reached on the night when lights of buildings were on. Somehow managed to reach bund, but immediately stepped off as the area as we could barely walk, but were pushed to move forward. Although police does good job to manage flow of people but still not worth with very young",
          "It\u2019s an amazing stretch that one must visit if they come to Shanghai. Should do so at night as it will be too hot during day time and more so due to the amazing lights from all the buildings and surrounding areas. The only issue is the massive crowd. I think this can be",

          "This is a must see in Shanghai. Really great when the sun is setting. I would recommend staying until it is dark too as the whole thing lights up and looks amazing!",
          "The bund is a must visit site. It has the most beautiful silhouette on e river off the building lights across e bund. With e long stretch of walkway. U can enjoy both historic architectual n popular river. U have never been to Shanghai without visiting the bund. Have fun. Cheers!",

          "Every time we come to Shanghai, we spend several evenings at The Bund. It\u2019s like an open-air theatre with some recurring acts combined with something new or extraordinary. We never get tired of watching - the skyline, the river, the people.",
          "I love city lights. We live in a very small town and so we were excited to see the city. It did not disappoint. It was gorgeous and so sparkly. However it was also SO SO SO crowded at night. During the daytime in August it\u2019s like 7 million degrees (and there aren\u2019t any pretty",

          "I last visited Shanghai 20 years ago. It's changed. Still hectic, overcrowded, noisy. But now it is awash with astonishing architecture. This is particularly evident on the Bund. By day it is a pleasant place to stroll and take in river views. But at night it comes alive in an",
          "To the reviewers who gave it 1 star due to the 'scammers and untrustworthy'. Unfortunately in this day and being a populated area of foreigners you are going to be bothered. In the time I was there I think I got asked to buy a bag or teach English a couple of times. I may have",

          "This should definitely be part of a visit to Shanghai because of the amazing view of the skyline. Two negatives: a minor one is that the bars and restaurants in the are are horribly overpriced and the quality is low by Shanghai standard. More of a nuisance is that a single man",

      "name": "Qingming Bridge",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Along the River During the Qingming Festival, also known by its Chinese name as the Qingming Shanghe Tu, is a painting by the Song dynasty painter Zhang Zeduan (1085\u20131145). It captures the daily life of people and the landscape of the capital, Bianjing (present-day Kaifeng) during the Northern Song. The theme is often said to celebrate the festive spirit and worldly commotion at the Qingming Festival, rather than the holiday's ceremonial aspects, such as tomb sweeping and prayers. Successive scenes reveal the lifestyle of all levels of the society from rich to poor as well as different economic activities in rural areas and the city, and offer glimpses of period clothing and architecture.  The painting is considered to be the most renowned work among all Chinese paintings, and it has been called \"China's Mona Lisa.\"As an artistic creation, the piece has been revered and court artists of subsequent dynasties made re-interpretive versions, each following the overall composition and the theme of the original but differing in details and technique.  Over the centuries, the Qingming scroll was collected and kept among numerous private owners, before it eventually returned to public ownership. The painting was a particular favorite of Puyi, the Last Emperor, who took the Song dynasty original with him when he left Beijing. It was re-purchased in 1945 and kept at the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City. The Song dynasty original and the Qing versions, in the Beijing and Taipei Palace Museums respectively, are regarded as national treasures and are exhibited only for brief periods every few years.\n\n\n== The Song original ==\nThe scroll is 25.5 centimetres (10.0 inches) in height and 5.25 meters (5.74 yards) long. In its length there are 814 humans, 28 boats, 60 animals, 30 buildings, 20 vehicles, 8 sedan chairs, and 170 trees. Only about twenty women appear in the Song dynasty original, and only women of low social rank are visible out of doors unless accompanied by men.The countryside and the densely populated city are the two main sections in the picture, with the river meandering through the entire length. The right section is the rural area of the city. There are crop fields and unhurried rural folk\u2014predominately farmers, goatherds, and pig herders\u2014in bucolic scenery. A country path broadens into a road and joins with the city road. The left half is the urban area, which eventually leads into the city proper with the gates. Many economic activities, such as people loading cargoes onto the boat, shops, and even a tax office, can be seen in this area. People from all walks of life are depicted: peddlers, jugglers, actors, paupers begging, monks asking for alms, fortune tellers and seers, doctors, innkeepers, teachers, millers, metalworkers, carpenters, masons, and official scholars from all ranks.\n\nOutside the city proper (separated by the gate to the left), there are businesses of all kinds, selling wine, grain, secondhand goods, cookware, bows and arrows, lanterns, musical instruments, gold and silver, ornaments, dyed fabrics, paintings, medicine, needles, and artifacts, as well as many restaurants. The vendors (and in the Qing revision, the shops themselves) extend all along the great bridge, called the Rainbow Bridge (\u8679\u6a4b Hong Qiao) or, more rarely, the Shangdu Bridge (\u4e0a\u571f\u6a4b).\nWhere the great bridge crosses the river is the center and main focus of the scroll. A great commotion animates the people on the bridge. A boat approaches at an awkward angle with its mast not completely lowered, threatening to crash into the bridge. The crowds on the bridge and along the riverside are shouting and gesturing toward the boat. Someone near the apex of the bridge lowers a rope to the outstretched arms of the crew below. In addition to the shops and diners, there are inns, temples, private residences, and official buildings varying in grandeur and style, from huts to mansions with grand front- and backyards.\nPeople and commodities are transported by various modes: wheeled wagons, beasts of labor (in particular, a large number of donkeys and mules), sedan chairs, and chariots. The river is packed with fishing boats and passenger-carrying ferries, with men at the river bank, pulling the larger ships.\nMany of these details are roughly corroborated by Song dynasty writings, principally the Dongjing Meng Hua Lu, which describes many of the same features of life in the capital.\n\n\n== Exhibition ==\nIn a rare move, the Song original was exhibited in Hong Kong from June 29 to mid-August 2007 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's transfer to the People's Republic of China. It is estimated that the costs of shipping the painting ran into tens of millions of dollars in addition to an undisclosed cost of insuring this piece of priceless art.\nFrom January 2\u201324, 2012, the painting was exhibited in the Tokyo National Museum as the centerpiece of a special exhibition to mark the 40th anniversary of normalized diplomatic relations between China and Japan, with the Japanese museum officials providing the \"highest security standards\" for the work.\n\n\n== Copies ==\nThe original painting is celebrated as the most famed work of art from the Song dynasty. It was a pride of the personal imperial collections of emperors for centuries. These emperors commissioned copies, or reproductions, reinterpretations and elaborations, over forty of which are in museums in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, North America, and France.  A large modern reproduction is displayed in the entrance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing.\nAn early copy, generally considered to be very faithful to the original, was made by Zhao Mengfu during the Yuan dynasty. \nA notable remake was painted during the Ming dynasty (14th to 17th centuries) by Qiu Ying. This version has a length of 6.7 meters, longer than the original. It also replaced the scenery from the Song dynasty to that of the Ming dynasty based on contemporary fashions and customs, updating the costumes worn by the characters and the styles of vehicles (boats and carts). The Song wooden bridge is replaced with a stone bridge in the Ming remake. The arc of the stone bridge is much taller than that of the wooden original, and where the original had a boat about to crash into the bridge, the reinterpretation has a boat being methodically guided under the bridge by ropes, pulled by men ashore, several other large boats dutifully waiting their turn, undisturbed.   A 12 meter long copy from the late Ming period is kept in the collection of the Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna in Austria.Another version by five Qing dynasty court painters (Chen Mu, Sun Hu, Jin Kun, Dai Hong and Cheng Zhidao) was presented to the Qianlong Emperor on January 15, 1737. This version, shown below, was later moved, along with many other artifacts, to the National Palace Museum in Taipei in 1949.There are many more people, over 4,000, in the Qing remake, which also is much larger (at 11 metres by 35 cm, or 37 ft by 1 ft). The leftmost third of this version is within the palace, with buildings and people appearing refined and elegant. Most people within the castle are women, with some well-dressed officials. On the contrary, in the original Song version, the leftmost side is still the busy city.\n\n\n=== Associated poem ===\nIn April 1742, a poem was added to the right-most end of the Qing remake. The poem apparently was composed by the Qianlong Emperor; the calligraphy is in the running script style, and is in the hand of Liang Shizheng (\u6881\u8a69\u6b63), a prominent court official and frequent companion of the Qianlong Emperor. The poem reads as follows:\n\n\n=== Digital version ===\nFor a three-month period in the World Expo 2010 presented at the China Pavilion, the original painting was remade into a 3D animated, viewer-interactive digital version, titled River of Wisdom; at 128 x 6.5 m, it is roughly 30 times the size of the original scroll. The computer-animated mural, with moving characters and objects and portraying the scene in 4-minute day and night cycles, was one of the primary exhibitions in the Chinese Pavilion, drawing queues up to two hours with a reservation. Elaborate computer animation gives life to the painting.\nAfter the Expo, the digital version was on display at the AsiaWorld\u2013Expo in Hong Kong from November 9 to 29, 2010, where it was a major commercial success. It was then exhibited at the Macau Dome in Macau from March 25 to April 14, 2011. The digital painting also traveled to Taiwan and displayed at the Expo Dome in Taipei from July 1 to September 4, 2011.  From December 7, 2011 to February 6, 2012, in an exhibition titled A Moving Masterpiece: The Song Dynasty As Living Art, the digital reproduction was exhibited at the Singapore Expo.

Today, it is on permanent exhibition at the China Art Museum, Shanghai.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== Analysis and questions ==\nScholars have studied the painting carefully in the second half of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first century but do not agree on many basic points.\n\n\n=== Translations of the title ===\nScholars have disputed the accuracy of the translation of the painting's name; the word Qingming may refer to either the Qingming Festival or to \"peace and order\". Several translations have been suggested, such as:\n\nGoing Upriver on the Qingming Festival\nLife along the Bian River at the Qingming Festival\nLife Along the Bian River at the Pure Brightness Festival\nRiverside Scene at Qingming Festival\nUpper River during Qing Ming Festival\nSpring Festival on the River\nSpring Festival Along the River, or alternatively,\nPeace Reigns Over the RiverDuring the late 1960s, the Taipei Palace Museum released a series of books (later digitized as CD-ROM), videos, and stamps about the scroll that translated it loosely as A City of Cathay.\n\n\n=== Meaning and content ===\nThree things have been accepted about the original painting:\n\nThe city depicted is Kaifeng\nIt was painted before the fall of the Northern Song dynasty in 1127\nIt depicts the Qingming FestivalSome recent scholarship challenges each of those assertions:  \n\nThe city depicted is an idealized non-existent city\nIt was painted after the fall of the Northern Song dynasty in 1127\nIt depicts a scene in early autumnIn 2003 a further interpretation was presented:\nThe city depicted is indeed Kaifeng\nIt depicts a day in the Qingming solar term of the Chinese calendar, but not the Qingming Festival itselfAn interpretation published in 2013 proposed that the painting was the artist's subtle entreaty to the emperor to discern dangerous trends beneath the surface of prosperity, and some of the suggested hints were:\nReceiving grain shipment at the docks was crucial to Kaifeng which depended on transporting the food from the far south, yet only a lowly official was on duty\nThe few guards stationed at the city gate and the docks appeared not to be alert and even lax in their appearances\nThe term \"Qingming\" did not refer to the solar term but was taken from the phrase \u6e05\u660e\u4e4b\u4e16 (\"A bright and enlightened era\") from the Book of the Later Han, and the name of the painting was meant to be ironicThe wooden bridge depicted in the original version was reconstructed by a team of engineers and documented by the PBS television show NOVA during their Secrets of Lost Empires series.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese painting\nCulture of the Song dynasty\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Palace Museum, Beijing\nThe National Palace Museum, Taiwan\nThe Place of \"Qingming Shanghe Tu\" in the Historical Geography of Song Dynasty Dongjing\nInteractive paintings from the Harvard University one and two\nAlong the River During the Qingming Festival at the Columbia University\nFull interactive painting of the Qing remake on the National Palace Museum website\nAlong the River During the Qingming Festival at China Online Museum",

        "wiki": "Shanghai (Chinese: \u4e0a\u6d77, Shanghainese pronunciation: [z\u0251\u0303.h\u025b] (listen), Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0282\u00e2\u014b.x\u00e0i] (listen)) is one of the four municipalities of the People's Republic of China. It is located on the southern estuary of the Yangtze, with the Huangpu River flowing through it. With a population of 24.28 million as of 2019, it is the most populous urban area in China and the second most populous city proper in the world. Shanghai is a global center for finance, innovation and transportation and the Port of Shanghai is the world's busiest container port.\nOriginally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five treaty ports forced open to foreign trade after the First Opium War. The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai. After the war, with the CPC takeover of mainland China in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries and the city's global influence declined.\nIn the 1990s, economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city, especially the Pudong district, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment to the city. The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance; it is the home of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world by market capitalization and the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, the first free-trade zone in China.\nShanghai has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the booming economy of China. Featuring several architecture styles such as Art Deco and shikumen, the city is renowned for its Lujiazui skyline, museums and historic buildings\u2014including the City God Temple, Yu Garden, the China Pavilion and buildings along the Bund. Shanghai is also known for its sugary cuisine, distinctive dialect and vibrant international flair. Every year, the city hosts numerous national and international events, including Shanghai Fashion Week, the Chinese Grand Prix and ChinaJoy.\nShanghai is governed as one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of Chinese central government and is thus under direct administration of the State Council.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe two Chinese characters in the city's name are \u4e0a (sh\u00e0ng/zan, \"upon\") and \u6d77 (h\u01cei/hae, \"sea\"), together meaning \"Upon the Sea\". The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century Song dynasty, when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. How the name should be understood has been disputed, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the Tang dynasty, the area of modern-day Shanghai was under the sea level, so the land appeared to be literally \"on the sea\".\nShanghai is officially abbreviated \u6caa (H\u00f9/Vu2) in Chinese, a contraction of \u6caa\u6e0e (H\u00f9 D\u00fa/Vu Doh, \"Harpoon Ditch\"), a 4th- or 5th-century Jin name for the mouth of Suzhou Creek when it was the main conduit into the ocean. This character appears on all motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today.\n\n\n=== Alternative names ===\n\u7533 (Sh\u0113n) or \u7533\u57ce (Sh\u0113nch\u00e9ng, \"Shen City\") was an early name originating from Lord Chunshen, a 3rd-century BC nobleman and prime minister of the state of Chu, whose fief included modern Shanghai. Shanghainese sports teams and newspapers often use Shen in their names, such as Shanghai Shenhua F.C. and Shen Bao.\n\u534e\u4ead (Hu\u00e1t\u00edng) was another early name for Shanghai. In AD 751 during the mid-Tang dynasty, Huating County was established by Zhao Juzhen, the governor of Wu Commandery, at modern-day Songjiang, the first county-level administration within modern-day Shanghai. The first five-star hotel in the city was named after Huating.\u9b54\u90fd (M\u00f3d\u016b, \"Magical City\"), a contemporary nickname for Shanghai, is widely known among the youth. The name was first mentioned in Sh\u014dfu Muramatsu's 1924 novel Mato, which portrayed Shanghai as a dichotomic city where both light and darkness existed.The city has various nicknames in English, including \"Pearl of the Orient\" and \"Paris of the East\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nThe western part of modern-day Shanghai was inhabited 6000 years ago. During the Spring and Autumn period (approximately 771 to 476 BC), it belonged to the Kingdom of Wu, which was conquered by the Kingdom of Yue, which in turn was conquered by the Kingdom of Chu. During the Warring States period (475 BC), Shanghai was part of the fief of Lord Chunshen of Chu, one of the Four Lords of the Warring States. He ordered the excavation of the Huangpu River. Its former or poetic name, the Chunshen River, gave Shanghai its nickname of \"Sh\u0113n\". Fishermen living in the Shanghai area then created a fish tool called the h\u00f9, which lent its name to the outlet of Suzhou Creek north of the Old City and became a common nickname and abbreviation for the city.\n\n\n=== Imperial history ===\n\nDuring the Tang and Song dynasties, Qinglong Town (\u9752\u9f99\u9547) in modern Qingpu District was a major trading port. Established in 746 (the fifth year of the Tang Tianbao era), it developed into what historically called a \"giant town of the Southeast\", with thirteen temples and seven pagodas. Mi Fu, a scholar and artist of the Song dynasty, served as its mayor. The port experienced thriving trade with provinces along the Yangtze and the Chinese coast, as well as with foreign countries such as Japan and Silla.\n\nBy the end of the Song dynasty, the center of trading had moved downstream of the Wusong River to Shanghai. It was upgraded in status from a village to a market town in 1074, and in 1172, a second sea wall was built to stabilize the ocean coastline, supplementing an earlier dike. From the Yuan dynasty in 1292 until Shanghai officially became a municipality in 1927, central Shanghai was administered as a county under Songjiang Prefecture, which had its seat in the present-day Songjiang District.Two important events helped promote Shanghai's developments in the Ming dynasty. A city wall was built for the first time in 1554 to protect the town from raids by Japanese pirates. It measured 10 m (33 ft) high and 5 km (3 mi) in circumference. A City God Temple was built in 1602 during the Wanli reign. This honor was usually reserved for prefectural capitals and not normally given to a mere county seat such as Shanghai. Scholars have theorized that this likely reflected the town's economic importance, as opposed to its low political status.\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, Shanghai became one of the most important sea ports in the Yangtze Delta region as a result of two important central government policy changes: in 1684, the Kangxi Emperor reversed the Ming dynasty prohibition on oceangoing vessels\u2014a ban that had been in force since 1525; and in 1732, the Qianlong Emperor moved the customs office for Jiangsu province (\u6c5f\u6d77\u5173; see Customs House, Shanghai) from the prefectural capital of Songjiang to Shanghai, and gave Shanghai exclusive control over customs collections for Jiangsu's foreign trade. As a result of these two critical decisions, Shanghai became the major trade port for all of the lower Yangtze region by 1735, despite still being at the lowest administrative level in the political hierarchy.\n\n\n=== Rise and golden age ===\n\nIn the 19th century, international attention to Shanghai grew due to European recognition of its economic and trade potential at the Yangtze. During the First Opium War (1839\u20131842), British forces occupied the city. The war ended in 1842 with the Treaty of Nanking, which opened Shanghai as one of the five treaty ports for international trade. The Treaty of the Bogue, the Treaty of Wanghia, and the Treaty of Whampoa (signed in 1843, 1844, and 1844, respectively) forced Chinese concession to European and American desires for visitation and trade on Chinese soil. Britain, France, and the United States all carved out outside the walled city of Shanghai, which was still ruled by the Chinese.The Chinese-held Old City of Shanghai fell to rebels from the Small Swords Society in 1853, but was recovered by the Qing government in February 1855. In 1854, the Shanghai Municipal Council was created to manage the foreign settlements. Between 1860 and 1862, the Taiping rebels twice attacked Shanghai and destroyed the city's eastern and southern suburbs, but failed to take the city. In 1863, the British settlement to the south of Suzhou Creek (northern Huangpu District) and the American settlement to the north (southern Hongkou District) joined in order to form the Shanghai International Settlement. The French opted out of the Shanghai Municipal Council and maintained its own concession to the south and southwest.\n\nThe First Sino-Japanese War concluded with the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki, which elevated Japan to become another foreign power in Shanghai. Japan built the first factories in Shanghai, which was soon copied by other foreign powers. All this international activity gave Shanghai the nickname \"the Great Athens of China\". In 1914, the Old City walls were dismantled because they blocked the city's expansion. In July 1921, the Communist Party of China was founded in the French Concession. On May 30, 1925, the May Thirtieth Movement broke out when a worker in a Japanese-owned cotton mill was shot and killed by a Japanese foreman. Workers in the city then launched general strikes against imperialism, which became nation-wide protests that gave rise to Chinese nationalism.The golden age of Shanghai began with its elevation to municipality on 7 July 1927. This new Chinese municipality covered an area of 494.69 km2 (191.0 sq mi), including the modern-day districts of Baoshan, Yangpu, Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong, but excluded the foreign concessions territories. Headed by a Chinese mayor and municipal council, the new city government's first task\u2014the Greater Shanghai Plan\u2014was to create a new city center in Jiangwan town of Yangpu district, outside the boundaries of the foreign concessions. The plan included a public museum, library, sports stadium, and city hall, which were partially constructed before being interrupted by the Japanese invasion.The city flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s. During the ensuing decades, citizens of many countries and all continents came to Shanghai to live and work; those who stayed for long periods\u2060\u2060\u2014some for generations\u2060\u2014called themselves \"Shanghailanders\". In the 1920s and 1930s, almost 20,000 White Russians fled the newly established Soviet Union to reside in Shanghai. These Shanghai Russians constituted the second-largest foreign community. By 1932, Shanghai had become the world's fifth largest city and home to 70,000 foreigners. In the 1930s, some 30,000 Jewish refugees from Europe arrived in the city.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Japanese invasion ===\n\nOn 28 January 1932, Japanese forces invaded Shanghai while the Chinese resisted. More than 10,000 shops and hundreds of factories were destroyed, leaving Zhabei district ruined. About 18,000 civilians were either killed, injured, or declared missing. A ceasefire was brokered on 5 May. In 1937, the Battle of Shanghai resulted in the occupation of the Chinese-administered parts of Shanghai outside of the International Settlement and the French Concession. People who stayed in the occupied city suffered on a daily basis, experiencing hunger, oppression, or even death. The foreign concessions were ultimately occupied by the Japanese on 8 December 1941 and remained occupied until Japan's surrender in 1945; multiple war crimes were committed during that time.A side-effect of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai was the Shanghai Ghetto. Japanese consul to Kaunas, Lithuania, Chiune Sugihara issued thousands of visas to Jewish refugees who were escaping the Nazi's Final Solution to the Jewish Question. They traveled from Keidan, Lithuania across Russia by railroad to the Vladivostok from where they traveled by ship to Kobe, Japan. However, the Jewish refugees' stay in Kobe was short as the Japanese government transferred them to Shanghai by November, 1941. Other Jewish refugees found haven in Shanghai, not through Sugihara, but came on ships from Italy. The refugees from Europe were interned into a cramped ghetto in the Hongkou District, and after the Japenese invasion of Pearl Harbor, even the Iraqi Jews who had been living in Shanghai from before the outbreak of WWII were interned. Among the refugees in the Shanghai Ghetto was the Mirrer Yeshiva, including its students and faculty. On September 3, 1945, the Chinese Army liberated the Ghetto and most of the Jews left over the next few years. By 1957, there were only one hundred Jews remaining in Shanghai.\nOn 27 May 1949, the People's Liberation Army took control of Shanghai through the Shanghai Campaign. Under the new People's Republic of China (PRC), Shanghai was one of only three municipalities not merged into neighboring provinces (the others being Beijing and Tianjin). Most foreign firms moved their offices from Shanghai to Hong Kong, as part of a foreign divestment due to the PRC's victory.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nAfter the war, Shanghai's economy was restored\u2014from 1949 to 1952, the city's agricultural and industrial output increased by 51.5% and 94.2%, respectively. There were 20 urban districts and 10 suburbs at the time. On 17 January 1958, Jiading, Baoshan, and Shanghai County in Jiangsu became part of Shanghai Municipality, which expanded to 863 km2 (333.2 sq mi). The following December, the land area of Shanghai was further expanded to 5,910 km2 (2,281.9 sq mi) after more surrounding suburban areas in Jiangsu were added: Chongming, Jinshan, Qingpu, Fengxian, Chuansha, and Nanhui. In 1964, the city's administrative divisions were rearranged to 10 urban districts and 10 counties.\n\nAs the industrial center of China with most skilled industrial workers, Shanghai became a center for radical leftism during the 1950s and 1960s. The radical leftist Jiang Qing and her three allies, together the Gang of Four, were based in the city. During the Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976), Shanghai's society was severely damaged, with 310,000 wrongful convictions involving more than 1 million people. About 11,500 people were unjustly persecuted to death. Yet, even during the most tumultuous times of the revolution, Shanghai was able to maintain economic production with positive annual growth rate.Since 1949, Shanghai has been a comparatively heavy contributor of tax revenue to the central government; in 1983, the city's contribution in tax revenue was greater than investment received in the past 33 years combined. This came at the cost of the severely crippling welfare of Shanghainese people and Shanghai's infrastructural and capital development. Its importance to the fiscal well-being of the central government also denied it from economic liberalizations begun in 1978. In 1990, Deng Xiaoping finally permitted Shanghai to initiate economic reforms, which reintroduced foreign capital to the city and developed the Pudong district, resulting in the birth of Lujiazui.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nShanghai is located on the Yangtze Estuary of China's east coast, with the Yangtze River to the north and Hangzhou Bay to the south. The land is formed by the Yangtze's natural deposition and modern land reclamation projects. As such, it has sandy soil, and skyscrapers are to be built with deep concrete piles to avoid sinking into the soft ground. The provincial-level Municipality of Shanghai administers both the estuary and many of its surrounding islands. It is roughly equidistant from Beijing and Guangzhou, bordering the East China Sea to the east, Zhejiang to the south, and Jiangsu to the west and north. The municipality's northernmost point is on Chongming Island, which is the second-largest island in mainland China after its expansion during the 20th century. However, it does not include an exclave of Jiangsu on northern Chongming or the two islands forming Shanghai's Yangshan Port, which are parts of Zhejiang's Shengsi County.\nShanghai is located on an alluvial plain. As such, the vast majority of its 6,340.5 km2 (2,448.1 sq mi) land area is flat, with an average elevation of 4 m (13 ft). The city's few hills, such as She Shan, lie to the southwest, and its highest point is the peak of Dajinshan Island (103 m or 338 ft) in Hangzhou Bay. Shanghai has many rivers, canals, streams, and lakes, and it is known for its rich water resources as part of the Lake Tai drainage basin.Downtown Shanghai is bisected by the Huangpu River, a man-made tributary of the Yangtze created by order of Lord Chunshen during the Warring States period. The historic center of the city was located on the west bank of the Huangpu (Puxi), near the mouth of Suzhou Creek, connecting it with Lake Tai and the Grand Canal. The central financial district, Lujiazui, has been established on the east bank of the Huangpu (Pudong). Along Shanghai's eastern shore, the destruction of local wetlands due to the construction of Pudong International Airport has been partially offset by the protection and expansion of a nearby shoal, Jiuduansha, as a nature preserve.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nShanghai has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa), with an average annual temperature of 15.8 \u00b0C (60.4 \u00b0F) for urban districts and 15.2\u201315.7 \u00b0C (59.4\u201360.3 \u00b0F) for suburbs. The city experiences four distinct seasons. Winters are chilly and damp\u2014northwesterly winds from Siberia can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing. Each year, there are an average of 6.2 days with snowfall and 2.8 days with snow cover. Summers are hot and humid, and occasional downpours or freak thunderstorms can be expected. On average, 8.7 days exceed 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) annually. In summer and the beginning of autumn, the city is susceptible to typhoons, which have not caused considerable damage in recent years.The most pleasant seasons are generally spring, although changeable and often rainy, and autumn, which is usually sunny and dry. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 34% in March to 54% in August, the city receives 1,895 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221210.1 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) on 31 January 1977 (unofficial record of \u221212.1 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F) was set on 19 January 1893) to 40.9 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) on 21 July 2017 at a weather station in Xujiahui.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nShanghai has a rich collection of buildings and structures of various architectural styles. The Bund, located by the bank of the Huangpu River, is home to a row of early 20th-century architecture, ranging in style from the neoclassical HSBC Building to the Art Deco Sassoon House (now part of the Peace Hotel). Many areas in the former foreign concessions are also well-preserved, the most notable being the French Concession. Shanghai is also home to many architecturally distinctive and even eccentric buildings, including the Shanghai Museum, the Shanghai Grand Theatre, the Shanghai Oriental Art Center, and the Oriental Pearl Tower. Despite rampant redevelopment, the Old City still retains some traditional architecture and designs, such as the Yu Garden, an elaborate Jiangnan style garden.As a result of its construction boom during the 1920s and 1930s, Shanghai has among the most Art Deco buildings in the world. One of the most famous architects working in Shanghai was L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Hudec, a Hungarian-Slovak who lived in the city between 1918 and 1947. His most notable Art Deco buildings include the Park Hotel, the Grand Theatre, and the Paramount. Other prominent architects who contributed to the Art Deco style are Clement Palmer and Arthur Turner, who together designed the Peace Hotel, the Metropole Hotel, and the Broadway Mansions; and Austrian architect GH Gonda, who designed the Capitol Theater. The Bund has been revitalized several times. The first was in 1986, with a new promenade by the Dutch architect Paulus Snoeren. The second was before the 2010 Expo, which includes restoration of the century-old Waibaidu Bridge and reconfiguration of traffic flow.\n\nOne uniquely Shanghainese cultural element is the shikumen (\u77f3\u5e93\u95e8, \"stone storage door\") residence, typically two- or three-story gray brick houses with the front yard protected by a heavy wooden door in a stylistic stone arch. Each residence is connected and arranged in straight alleys, known as longtang (\u5f04\u5802). The house is similar to western-style terrace houses or townhouses, but distinguishes by the tall, heavy brick wall and archway in front of each house.The shikumen is a cultural blend of elements found in Western architecture with traditional Jiangnan Chinese architecture and social behavior. Like almost all traditional Chinese dwellings, it has a courtyard, which reduces outside noise. Vegetation can be grown in the courtyard, and it can also allow for sunlight and ventilation to the rooms.\n\nSome of Shanghai's buildings feature Soviet neoclassical architecture or Stalinist architecture, though the city has fewer such structures than Beijing. These buildings were mostly erected between the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 and the Sino-Soviet Split in the late 1960s. During this time period, large numbers of Soviet experts, including architects, poured into China to aid the country in the construction of a communist state. An example of Soviet neoclassical architecture in Shanghai is the modern-day Shanghai Exhibition Center.Shanghai\u2014Lujiazui in particular\u2014has numerous skyscrapers, making it the fifth city in the world with the most skyscrapers. Among the most prominent examples are the 421 m (1,381 ft) high Jin Mao Tower, the 492 m (1,614 ft) high Shanghai World Financial Center, and the 632 m (2,073 ft) high Shanghai Tower, which is the tallest building in China and the second tallest in the world. Completed in 2015, the tower takes the form of nine twisted sections stacked atop each other, totaling 128 floors. It is featured in its double-skin facade design, which eliminates the need for either layer to be opaqued for reflectivity as the double-layer structure has already reduced the heat absorption. The futuristic-looking Oriental Pearl Tower, at 468 m (1,535 ft), is located nearby at the northern tip of Lujiazui. Skyscrapers outside of Lujiazui include the White Magnolia Plaza in Hongkou, the Shimao International Plaza in Huangpu, and the Shanghai Wheelock Square in Jing'an.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\nLike virtually all governing institutions in mainland China, Shanghai has a parallel party-government system, in which the Party Committee Secretary, officially termed the Communist Party of China Shanghai Municipal Committee Secretary, outranks the Mayor. The party's committee acts as the top policy-formulation body, and is typically composed of 12 members (including the secretary).Political power in Shanghai has frequently been a stepping stone to higher positions in the central government. Since Jiang Zemin became the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in June 1989, all former Shanghai party secretaries but one were elevated to the Politburo Standing Committee, the de facto highest decision-making body in China, including Jiang himself (Party General Secretary), Zhu Rongji (Premier), Wu Bangguo (Chairman of the National People's Congress), Huang Ju (Vice Premier), Xi Jinping (current General Secretary), Yu Zhengsheng, and Han Zheng. Zeng Qinghong, a former deputy party secretary of Shanghai, also rose to the Politburo Standing Committee and became the Vice President and an influential power broker. The only exception is Chen Liangyu, who was fired in 2006 and later convicted of corruption.Officials with ties to the Shanghai administration collectively form a powerful faction in the central government known as the Shanghai Clique, which has often been viewed to compete against the rival Youth League Faction over personnel appointments and policy decisions. However, Xi Jinping, successor to Hu Jintao as General Secretary and President, was largely an independent leader and took anti-corruption campaigns on both factions.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nShanghai is one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of the Government of the People's Republic of China, and is divided into 16 county-level districts.\n\nAlthough every district has its own urban core, the city hall and major administrative units are located in Huangpu District, which also serves as a commercial area, including the famous Nanjing Road. Other major commercial areas include Xintiandi and Huaihai Road in Huangpu District, and Xujiahui in Xuhui District. Many universities in Shanghai are located in residential areas in Yangpu District and Putuo District.\n\nSeven of the districts govern Puxi (lit. \"The West Bank\", or \"West of the River Pu\"), the older part of urban Shanghai on the west bank of the Huangpu River. These seven districts are collectively referred to as Shanghai Proper (\u4e0a\u6d77\u5e02\u533a) or the core city (\u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3), which comprise Huangpu, Xuhui, Changning, Jing'an, Putuo, Hongkou, and Yangpu.\nPudong (lit. \"The East Bank\", or \"East of the River Pu\"), the newer part of urban and suburban Shanghai on the east bank of the Huangpu River, is governed by Pudong New Area (\u6d66\u4e1c\u65b0\u533a).Seven of the districts govern suburbs, satellite towns, and rural areas farther away from the urban core: Baoshan, Minhang, Jiading, Jinshan, Songjiang, Qingpu, and Fengxian.Chongming District comprises the islands of Changxing and Hengsha and most\u2014but not all\u2014of Chongming Island.\nThe former district of Nanhui was absorbed into Pudong District in 2009. In 2011, Luwan District merged with Huangpu District. As of 2015, these county-level divisions are further divided into the following 210 township-level divisions: 109 towns, 2 townships, and 99 subdistricts. Those are in turn divided into the following village-level divisions: 3,661 neighborhood committees and 1,704 village committees.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nShanghai has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the booming economy of China. The city is a global center for finance and innovation, and a national center for commerce, trade, and transportation, with the world's busiest container port\u2014the Port of Shanghai. As of 2019, Shanghai had a GDP of CN\u00a53.82 trillion (US$539 billion) that makes up 3.85% of China's GDP, and a GDP per capita of CN\u00a5157,138 (US$22,186). Shanghai's six largest industries\u2014retail, finance, IT, real estate, machine manufacturing, and automotive manufacturing\u2014comprise about half the city's GDP. In 2019, the average annual disposable income of Shanghai's residents was CN\u00a569,442 (US$9,808) per capita, making it one of the wealthiest cities in China, but also the most expensive city in mainland China to live in according to a 2017 study by the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nShanghai was the largest and most prosperous city in East Asia during the 1930s, and rapid redevelopment began in the 1990s. In the last two decades, Shanghai has been one of the fastest-developing cities in the world; it has recorded double-digit GDP growth in almost every year between 1992 and 2008, before the financial crisis of 2007\u201308.\n\n\n=== Finance ===\n\nShanghai is a global financial center, ranking fifth in the 26th edition of the Global Financial Centres Index (and third in Asia, after Singapore and Hong Kong), published in September 2019 by Z/Yen and China Development Institute. As of 2019, the Shanghai Stock Exchange had a market capitalization of US$4.02 trillion, making it the largest stock exchange in China and the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world. In 2009, the trading volume of six key commodities\u2014including rubber, copper, and zinc\u2014on the Shanghai Futures Exchange all ranked first globally. By the end of 2017, Shanghai had 1,491 financial institutions, of which 251 were foreign-invested.In September 2013 with the backing of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, the city launched the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone\u2014the first free-trade zone in mainland China. The zone introduced a number of pilot reforms designed to incentivize foreign investment. In April 2014, The Banker reported that Shanghai \"has attracted the highest volumes of financial sector foreign direct investment in the Asia-Pacific region in the 12 months to the end of January 2014\". In August 2014, fDi magazine named Shanghai the \"Chinese Province of the Future 2014/15\" due to \"particularly impressive performances in the Business Friendliness and Connectivity categories, as well as placing second in the Economic Potential and Human Capital and Lifestyle categories\".\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\n\nAs one of the main industrial centers of China, Shanghai plays a key role in domestic manufacturing and heavy industry. Several industrial zones\u2014including Shanghai Hongqiao Economic and Technological Development Zone, Jinqiao Export Economic Processing Zone, Minhang Economic and Technological Development Zone, and Shanghai Caohejing High-Tech Development Zone\u2014are backbones of Shanghai's secondary industry. Shanghai is home to China's largest steelmaker Baosteel Group, China's largest shipbuilding base Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding Group, and one of China's oldest shipbuilders, the Jiangnan Shipyard. Auto manufacturing is another important industry. The Shanghai-based SAIC Motor is one of the three largest automotive corporations in China, and has strategic partnerships with Volkswagen and General Motors.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is a major industry of Shanghai. In 2017, the number of domestic tourists increased by 7.5% to 318 million, while the number of overseas tourists increased by 2.2% to 8.73 million. As of 2019, the city had 71 five star hotels, 61 four star hotels, 1,758 travel agencies, 113 rated tourist attractions, and 34 red tourist attractions.The conference and meeting sector is also growing. According to the International Congress and Convention Association, Shanghai hosted 82 international meetings in 2018, a 34% increase from 61 in 2017.\n\n\n=== Free-trade zone ===\n\nShanghai is home to China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone, the first free-trade zone in mainland China. As of October 2019, it is also the second largest free-trade zone in mainland China in terms of land area (behind Hainan Free Trade Zone, which covers the whole Hainan province) by covering an area of 240.22 km2 (92.75 sq mi) and integrating four existing bonded zones\u2014Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, Waigaoqiao Free Trade Logistics Park, Yangshan Free Trade Port Area, and Pudong Airport Comprehensive Free Trade Zone. Several preferential policies have been implemented to attract foreign investment in various industries to the zone. Because the zone is not technically considered Chinese territory for tax purposes, commodities entering the zone are exempt from duty and customs clearance.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2019, Shanghai had a total population of 24,281,400, including 14,504,300 (59.7%) hukou holders (registered locally). According to the 2010 national census, 89.3% of Shanghai's population live in urban areas, and 10.7% live in rural areas. Based on the population of its total administrative area, Shanghai is the second largest of the four municipalities of China, behind Chongqing, but is generally considered the largest Chinese city because the urban population of Chongqing is much smaller. According to the OECD, Shanghai's metropolitan area has an estimated population of 34 million.According to the Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau, about 157,900 residents in Shanghai are foreigners, including 28,900 Japanese, 21,900 Americans and, 20,800 Koreans. However, the actual number of foreign citizens in the city is probably much higher. Shanghai is also a domestic immigration city\u201440.3% (9.8 million) of the city's residents are from other regions of China.Shanghai has a life expectancy of 83.6 years for the city's registered population, the highest life expectancy of all cities in mainland China. However, this has also caused the city to experience population aging\u2014in 2017, 33.1% (4.8 million) of the city's registered population was aged 60 or above. In 2017, the Chinese government implemented population controls for Shanghai, resulting in a population decline of 10,000 people by the end of the year.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nDue to its cosmopolitan history, Shanghai has a blend of religious heritage; religious buildings and institutions are scattered around the city. According to a 2012 survey, only 13.1% of the city's population belongs to organized religions, including Buddhists with 10.4%, Protestants with 1.9%, Catholics with 0.7%, and other faiths with 0.1%. The remaining 86.9% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities and ancestors, Confucian churches, Taoism, or folk religious sects.Buddhism, in its Chinese varieties, has had a presence in Shanghai since the Three Kingdoms period, during which the Longhua Temple\u2014the largest temple in Shanghai\u2014and the Jing'an Temple were founded. Another significant temple is the Jade Buddha Temple, which was named after a large statue of Buddha carved out of jade in the temple. As of 2014, Buddhism in Shanghai had 114 temples, 1,182 clergical staff, and 453,300 registered followers. The religion also has its own college, the Shanghai Buddhist College, and its own press, Shanghai Buddhological Press.\n\nCatholicism was brought into Shanghai in 1608 by Italian missionary Lazzaro Cattaneo. The Apostolic Vicariate of Shanghai was erected in 1933, and was further elevated to the Diocese of Shanghai in 1946. Notable Catholic sites include the St. Ignatius Cathedral in Xujiahui\u2014the largest Catholic church in the city, the St. Francis Xavier Church, and the She Shan Basilica. Other forms of Christianity in Shanghai include Eastern Orthodox minorities and, since 1996, registered Christian Protestant churches. During World War II, thousands of Jews emigrated to Shanghai in an effort to flee Nazi Germany. They lived in a designated area called the Shanghai Ghetto and formed a community centered on the Ohel Moishe Synagogue, which is now the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum.Islam came into Shanghai during the Yuan dynasty. The city's first mosque, Songjiang Mosque, was built during the Zhizheng (\u81f3\u6b63) era under Emperor Huizong. Shanghai's Muslim population increased in the 19th and early 20th centuries (when the city was a treaty port), during which time many mosques\u2014including the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque, the Huxi Mosque, and the Pudong Mosque\u2014were built. The Shanghai Islamic Association is located in the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque in Huangpu.Shanghai has several folk religious temples, including the City God Temple at the heart of the Old City, the Dajing Ge Pavilion dedicated to the Three Kingdoms general Guan Yu, the Confucian Temple of Shanghai, and a major Taoist center Shanghai White Cloud Temple where the Shanghai Taoist Association locates.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe vernacular language spoken in the city is Shanghainese, a dialect of the Taihu Wu subgroup of the Wu Chinese family. This is different from the official Chinese dialect, Mandarin, which is mutually unintelligible with Wu Chinese. Modern Shanghainese is based on other dialects of Taihu Wu: Suzhounese, Ningbonese, and the local dialect of Songjiang Prefecture.Prior to its expansion, the language spoken in Shanghai was subordinate to those spoken around Jiaxing and later Suzhou, and was known as \"the local tongue\" (\u672c\u5730\u95f2\u8bdd), which is now being used in suburbs only. In the late 19th century, downtown Shanghainese (\u4e0a\u6d77\u95f2\u8bdd) appeared, undergoing rapid changes and quickly replacing Suzhounese as the prestige dialect of the Yangtze River Delta region. At the time, most of the city's residents were immigrants from the two adjacent provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, so Shanghainese was mostly a hybrid between Southern Jiangsu and Ningbo dialects. After 1949, Putonghua has also had a great impact on Shanghainese as a result of being rigorously promoted by the government. Since the 1990s, many migrants outside of the Wu-speaking region have come to Shanghai for education and jobs. They often cannot speak the local language and therefore use Putonghua as a lingua franca. Because Putonghua and English were more favored, Shanghainese began to decline, and fluency among young speakers weakened. However, in recent years, there have been movements within the city to promote the local language and protect it from fading out.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nShanghai is a major center of higher education in China. By the end of 2019, Shanghai had 64 universities and colleges, 929 secondary schools, 698 primary schools, and 31 special schools. A number of China's most prestigious universities are based in Shanghai, including Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Tongji University, and East China Normal University. These universities were selected as \"985 universities\" by the Chinese government in order to build world-class universities. Fudan University established a joint EMBA program with Washington University in St. Louis in 2002 which has since consistently been ranked as one of the best in the world. The city government's education agency is the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission.\n\nThe city has many Chinese\u2013foreign joint education institutes, such as the Shanghai University\u2013University of Technology Sydney Business School since 1994, the University of Michigan\u2013Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute since 2006, and New York University Shanghai\u2014the first China\u2013U.S. joint venture university\u2014since 2012. In 2013, the Shanghai Municipality and the Chinese Academy of Sciences founded the ShanghaiTech University in the Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in Pudong. Shanghai is also home to the cadre school China Executive Leadership Academy in Pudong and the China Europe International Business School.\nIn Shanghai, the nine years of compulsory education\u2014including five years of primary education and four years of junior secondary education\u2014are free, with a gross enrollment ratio of over 99.9%. The city's compulsory education system is among the best in the world: in 2009 and 2012, 15-year-old students from Shanghai ranked first in every subject (math, reading, and science) in the Program for International Student Assessment, a worldwide study of academic performance conducted by the OECD. The consecutive three-year senior secondary education is priced and uses the Senior High School Entrance Examination (Zhongkao) as a selection process, with a gross enrollment ratio of 98%. Among all senior high schools, the four with the best teaching quality\u2014Shanghai High School, No. 2 High School Attached to East China Normal University, High School Affiliated to Fudan University, and High School Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University\u2014are termed \"The Four Schools\" (\"\u56db\u6821\") of Shanghai. As of October 2019, the city's National College Entrance Examination (Gaokao) is structured under the \"3+3\" system, in which all general senior high school students study three compulsory subjects (Chinese, English, and math) and three subjects chosen from six options (physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, and politics).\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\n\nShanghai has an extensive public transportation system comprising metros, buses, ferries, and taxis, all of which can be accessed using a Shanghai Public Transport Card.Shanghai's rapid transit system, the Shanghai Metro, incorporates both subway and light metro lines and extends to every core urban district as well as neighboring suburban districts. As of 2019, there are 17 metro lines (excluding the Shanghai maglev train and Jinshan Railway), 415 stations, and 704.91 km (438 mi) of lines in operation, making it the longest network in the world. On 8 March 2019, it set the city's daily metro ridership record with 13.3 million. The average fare ranges from CN\u00a53 (US$0.48) to CN\u00a59 (US$1.28), depending on the travel distance.\n\nOpened in 2004, the Shanghai maglev train is the first and the fastest commercial high-speed maglev in the world, with a maximum operation speed of 430 km/h (267 mph). The train can complete the 30-kilometer (19 mi) journey between Longyang Road Station and Pudong International Airport in 7 minutes 20 seconds, comparing to 32 minutes by Metro Line 2 and 30 minutes by car. A one-way ticket costs CN\u00a550 (US$8), or CN\u00a540 (US$6.40) for those with airline tickets or public transportation cards. A round-trip ticket costs CN\u00a580 (US$12.80), and VIP tickets cost double the standard fare.With the first tram line been in service in 1908, trams were once popular in Shanghai in the early 20th century. By 1925, there were 328 tramcars and 14 routes operated by Chinese, French, and British companies collaboratively, all of which were nationalized after the PRC's victory in 1949. Since the 1960s, many tram lines were either dismantled or replaced by trolleybus or motorbus lines; the last tram line was demolished in 1975. Shanghai reintroduced trams in 2010, as a modern rubber-tire Translohr system in Zhangjiang area of East Shanghai as Zhangjiang Tram. In 2018, the steel wheeled Songjiang Tram started operating in Songjiang District. Additional tram lines are under planning in Hongqiao Subdistrict and Jiading District as of 2019.\n\nShanghai also has the world's most extensive bus network, including the world's oldest continuously operating trolleybus system, with 1,575 lines covering a total length of 8,997 km (5,590 mi) by 2019. The system is operated by multiple companies. Bus fares generally cost CN\u00a52 (US$0.32).As of 2019, a total of 40,000 taxis were in operation in Shanghai. The base fare for taxis is CN\u00a514 (US$2.24), which covers the first 3 km (2 mi) and includes a CN\u00a51 (US$0.14) fuel surcharge. The base fare is CN\u00a518 (US$2.55) between 11:00 pm and 5:00 am. Each additional kilometer costs CN\u00a52.5 (US$0.40), or CN\u00a53.3 (US$0.47) between 11:00 pm and 5:00 am.  In addition to traditional taxis, ridesharing companies including DiDi and Uber play major roles in urban transportation. Ridesharing costs are comparable to those of taxis, and are sometimes even lower due to promotional discounts from ridesharing companies.\n\n\n=== Roads and expressways ===\n\nShanghai is a major hub of China's expressway network. Many national expressways (prefixed with the letter G) pass through or end in Shanghai, including Jinghu Expressway (overlaps with Hurong Expressway), Shenhai Expressway, Hushaan Expressway, Huyu Expressway, Hukun Expressway (overlaps with Hangzhou Bay Ring Expressway), and Shanghai Ring Expressway. There are also numerous municipal expressways prefixed with the letter S. As of 2019, Shanghai has a total of 12 bridges and 14 tunnels crossing the Huangpu River. The Shanghai Yangtze River Bridge is the city's only bridge\u2013tunnel complex across Yangtze River.\nThe expressway network within the city center consists of North\u2013South Elevated Road, Yan'an Elevated Road, and Inner Ring Road. Other ring roads in Shanghai include Middle Ring Road, Outer Ring Expressway, and Shanghai Ring Expressway.\n\nBicycle lanes are common in Shanghai, separating non-motorized traffic from car traffic on most surface streets. However, on some main roads, including all expressways, bicycles and motorcycles are banned. In recent years, cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity due to the emergence of a large number of dockless app-based bicycle-sharing systems, such as Mobike, Bluegogo, and ofo. As of December 2018, these ridesharing systems have a joint average of 1.15 million daily riders within the city.Private car ownership in Shanghai is rapidly increasing: in 2019, there were 3.40 million private cars in the city, a 12.5% increase from 2018. New private cars cannot be driven without a license plate, which are sold in monthly license plate auctions. Around 9,500 license plates are auctioned each month, and the average price is about CN\u00a589,600 (US$12,739) in 2019. According to the city's vehicle regulations introduced in June 2016, only locally registered residents and those who have paid social insurance or individual income taxes for over three years are eligible to be in the auction. The purpose of this policy is to limit the growth of automobile traffic and alleviate congestion.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nShanghai has four major railway stations: Shanghai railway station, Shanghai South railway station, Shanghai West railway station, and Shanghai Hongqiao railway station. All are connected to the metro network and serve as hubs in the railway network of China.\nBuilt in 1876, the Woosung railway was the first railway in Shanghai and the first railway in operation in China By 1909, Shanghai\u2013Nanjing railway and Shanghai\u2013Hangzhou railway were in service. As of October 2019, the two railways have been integrated into two main railways in China: Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway and Shanghai\u2013Kunming railway, respectively.Shanghai has three high-speed railways (HSRs): Beijing\u2013Shanghai HSR (overlaps with Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu passenger railway), Shanghai\u2013Nanjing intercity railway, and Shanghai\u2013Kunming HSR. Two HSRs are under construction: Shanghai\u2013Nantong railway and Shanghai\u2013Suzhou\u2013Huzhou HSR.Shanghai also has four commuter railways: Pudong railway and Jinshan Railway operated by China Railway, and Line 16 and Line 17 operated by Shanghai Metro. As of October 2019, three additional lines\u2014Chongming line, Jiamin line and Shanghai Airport Link\u2014are under construction.\n\n\n=== Air and sea ===\n\nShanghai is one of the largest air transportation hubs in Asia. The city has two commercial airports: Shanghai Pudong International Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. Pudong International Airport is the primary international airport, while Hongqiao International Airport mainly operates domestic flights with limited short-haul international flights. In 2018, Pudong International Airport served 74.0 million passengers and handled 3.8 million tons of cargo, making it the ninth-busiest airport by passenger volume and third-busiest airport by cargo volume. The same year, Hongqiao International Airport served 43.6 million passengers, making it the 19th-busiest airport by passenger volume.\n\nSince its opening, the Port of Shanghai has rapidly grown to become the largest port in China. Yangshan Port was built in 2005 because the river was unsuitable for docking large container ships. The port is connected with the mainland through the 32-kilometer (20 mi) long Donghai Bridge. Although the port is run by the Shanghai International Port Group under the government of Shanghai, it administratively belongs to Shengsi County, Zhejiang.Overtaking the Port of Singapore in 2010, the Port of Shanghai has become world's busiest container port with an annual TEU transportation of 42 million in 2018. Besides cargo, the Port of Shanghai handled 259 cruises and 1.89 million passengers in 2019.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Shanghai was a combination of the nearby Wuyue culture and the \"East Meets West\" Haipai culture. Examples of the Wuyue culture's influence includes Shanghainese language developed from the nearby Jiaxing, Suzhou, and Ningbo dialect, and Shanghai cuisine influenced by the Jiangsu cuisine and Zhejiang cuisine. The Haipai culture emerged after Shanghai became a prosperous port in the early 20th century, with numerous foreigners from Europe, America, Japan, India moving into the city. The culture fuses elements of western cultures with the local Wuyue culture, and its influence extends to the city's literature, fashion, architecture, music, and even food and beverages. The term Haipai\u2014originally referring to a painting school in Shanghai\u2014was coined by a group of Beijing writers in 1920 to criticize some Shanghai scholars for admiring capitalism and western culture. In recent years, Shanghai has been recognized as a new influence and inspiration for cyberpunk culture. Futuristic buildings such as the Oriental Pearl Tower and the neon-illuminated Yan'an Elevated Road are examples that have boosted Shanghai's cyberpunk image.\nCultural curation in Shanghai has seen significant growth since 2013, with several new museums having been opened in the city. This is in part due to the city's most recently released city development plans, with aims in making the city \"an excellent global city\". As such, Shanghai has several museums of regional and national importance. The Shanghai Museum has one of the best collections of Chinese historical artifacts in the world, including a large collection of ancient Chinese bronzes. The China Art Museum, located in the former China Pavilion of Expo 2010, is the largest art museum in Asia. Power Station of Art is built in a converted power station, similar to London's Tate Modern. The Shanghai Natural History Museum and the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum are major natural history and science museums. In addition, there is a variety of smaller, specialist museums housed in important archaeological and historical sites such as the Songze Museum, the Museum of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the site of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, the former Ohel Moshe Synagogue (Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum), and the General Post Office Building (Shanghai Postal Museum). The Rockbund Art Museum is also in Shanghai. There are also many art galleries, concentrated in the M50 Art District and Tianzifang. Shanghai is also home to one of China's largest aquariums, the Shanghai Ocean Aquarium. MoCA, Museum of Contemporary Art of Shanghai, is a private museum centrally located in People's Park on West Nanjing Road, and is committed to promote contemporary art and design.\nBenbang cuisine (\u672c\u5e2e\u83dc) is Shanghai's traditional cooking style originated 400 years ago under profound influence of those of the surrounding provinces. It emphasises the use of condiments and meanwhile retaining the original flavours of the raw ingredients materials. Sugar is an important ingredient in Benbang cuisine, especially when used in combination with soy sauce. Another characteristic is the use of a great variety of seafood and freshwater food. Signature dishes of Benbang cuisine include Xiaolongbao, Red braised pork belly, and Shanghai hairy crab. Haipai cuisine, on the other hand, is a Western-style cooking originated in Shanghai but absorbs elements from French, British, Russian, German, and Italian cuisine and adapts them to suit the local taste according to the features of local ingredients. Famous dishes of Haipai cuisine include Shanghai-style borscht (\u7f57\u5b8b\u6c64, \"Russian soup\"), crispy pork cutlets, and Shanghai salad derived from Olivier salad.\nThe Songjiang School (\u6dde\u6c5f\u6d3e), containing the Huating School (\u534e\u4ead\u6d3e) founded by Gu Zhengyi, was a small painting school in Shanghai during the Ming and the Qing Dynasty. It was represented by Dong Qichang. The school was considered as a further development of the Wu School in Suzhou, the cultural center of the Jiangnan region at the time. In the mid 19th century, the Shanghai School movement commenced, focusing less on the symbolism emphasized by the Literati style but more on the visual content of the painting through the use of bright colors. Secular objects like flowers and birds were often selected as themes. Western art was introduced to Shanghai in 1847 by Spanish missionary Joannes Ferrer (\u8303\u5ef7\u4f50), and the city's first western atelier was established in 1864 inside the Tushanwan orphanage. During the Republic of China, many famous artists including Zhang Daqian, Liu Haisu, Xu Beihong, Feng Zikai and Yan Wenliang settled in Shanghai thus it gradually became the art center of China. Various art forms\u2014photography, wood carving, sculpture, comics (Manhua) and Lianhuanhua\u2014thrived. Sanmao, one of the most well-known comics in China, was created then to dramatize the chaos brought to society by the Second Sino-Japanese War. Today, the most comprehensive art and cultural facility in Shanghai is the China Art Museum. In addition, the Chinese painting academy features the Guohua, while the Power Station of Art plays an important role in the contemporary art. First held in 1996, the Shanghai Biennale has now become an important place for Chinese and foreign arts to interact.\nTraditional Xiqu became the main way of entertainment for the public in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, monologue and burlesque in Shanghainese appeared in Shanghai, absorbing elements from traditional dramas. The Great World opened in 1912 is a significant stage at the time. In 1920s, Pingtan expanded from Suzhou to Shanghai. With the abundant commercial radio stations, Pingtan art developed rapidly to 103 programs every day by the 1930s. At the same time, Shanghai also formed a Shanghai-style Beijing Opera led by Zhou Xinfang and Gai Jiaotian, and attracted lots of Xiqu masters like Mei Lanfang to the city. At the same time, a small troupe from Shengxian (now Shengzhou) also began to promote Yue opera on the Shanghainese stage. A unique style of opera, Shanghai opera, is formed when the local folksongs collided with modern operas. As of 2012, the well-known Xiqu troupes in Shanghai include Shanghai Jingju Theatre Company, Shanghai Kunqu Opera Troupe, Shanghai Yue Opera House and Shanghai Huju Opera House.Drama appeared in missionary schools in Shanghai in the late 19th century. Back then, it was mainly performed in English. Scandals in Officialdom (\u5b98\u573a\u4e11\u53f2), staged in 1899, was one of the earliest recorded plays. In 1907, Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly (\u9ed1\u5974\u5401\u5929\u5f55) was performed at the Lyceum Theatre. After the New Culture Movement, drama had become a popular way for students and intellectuals to express their views. Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre, Shanghai Opera House and Shanghai Theatre Academy are four major institutes of theater training in Shanghai. Notable theaters in Shanghai include the Shanghai Grand Theatre, the Oriental Art Center and the People's Theatre.\n\nShanghai is considered to be the birthplace of Chinese cinema. China's first short film, The Difficult Couple (1913), and the country's first fictional feature film, An Orphan Rescues His Grandfather (\u5b64\u513f\u6551\u7956\u8bb0, 1923) were both produced in Shanghai. Shanghai's film industry went on to blossom during the early 1930s, generating great stars such as Hu Die, Ruan Lingyu, Zhou Xuan, Jin Yan, and Zhao Dan. Another film star, Jiang Qing, went on to become Madame Mao Zedong. The exile of Shanghainese filmmakers and actors as a result of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Communist revolution contributed enormously to the development of the Hong Kong film industry. The movie In the Mood for Love directed by Wong Kar-wai, a native Shanghainese, depicts a slice of the displaced Shanghainese community in Hong Kong and the nostalgia for that era, featuring 1940s music by Zhou Xuan.Since 2001, Shanghai has held its own fashion week called Shanghai Fashion Week twice every year in April and October. The April session is a part of the Shanghai International Fashion Culture Festival, which usually lasts for a month, while Shanghai Fashion Week lasts for seven days, and the main venue is in Fuxing Park, Shanghai, while the opening and closing ceremony is in Shanghai Fashion Center. Supported by the People's Republic Ministry of Commerce, Shanghai Fashion Week is a major business and culture event of national significance hosted by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Shanghai Fashion Week is aiming to build up an international and professional platform, gathering all of the top design talents of Asia.\nThe event features international designers but the primary purpose is to showcase Chinese designers. The international presence has included many of the most promising young British fashion designers.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nShanghai is home to several soccer teams, including two in the Chinese Super League: Shanghai Greenland Shenhua F.C. and Shanghai SIPG F.C. Another professional team, Shanghai Shenxin F.C., is currently in China League One. China's top-tier basketball team, the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association, developed Yao Ming before he entered the NBA. Shanghai also has an ice hockey team, China Dragon, and a baseball team, the Shanghai Golden Eagles, which plays in the China Baseball League.\nThe Shanghai Cricket Club dates back to 1858 when the first recorded cricket match was played between a team of British Naval officers and a Shanghai 11. Following a 45-year dormancy after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the club was re-established in 1994 by expatriates living in the city and has since grown to over 300 members. The Shanghai cricket team was a cricket team that played various international matches between 1866 and 1948. With cricket in the rest of China almost non-existent, for that period they were the de facto China national cricket team.\n\nShanghai is home to many prominent Chinese professional athletes, such as basketball player Yao Ming, 110-meter hurdler Liu Xiang, table tennis player Wang Liqin, and badminton player Wang Yihan.\n\nShanghai is the annual host of several international sports events. Since 2004, it has hosted the annual Chinese Grand Prix, a round of the Formula One World Championship. The race is staged annually at the Shanghai International Circuit. It hosted the 1000th Formula One race on 14 April 2019. In 2010, Shanghai also became the host city of Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM), which raced in a street circuit in Pudong. In 2012, Shanghai started to host 6 Hours of Shanghai as one round from the inaugural season of the FIA World Endurance Championship. The city also hosts the Shanghai Masters tennis tournament, which is part of ATP World Tour Masters 1000, as well as golf tournaments including the BMW Masters and WGC-HSBC Champions.On 21 September 2017, Shanghai hosted a National Hockey League (NHL) ice hockey exhibition game in an effort to increase fan interest for the 2017\u201318 NHL season.\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\n\n=== Parks and resorts ===\nShanghai has an extensive public park system; by 2018, the city had 300 parks, of which 281 had free admission, and the per capita park area was 8.2 m2 (88 sq ft). Some of the parks also have become popular tourist attractions due to their unique location, history, or architecture.\n\nThe People's Square park, located in the heart of downtown Shanghai, is especially well known for its proximity to other major landmarks in the city. Fuxing Park, located in the former French Concession, features formal French-style gardens and is surrounded by high-end bars and cafes.Zhongshan Park in western central Shanghai is famous for its monument of Chopin, the tallest statue dedicated to the composer in the world. Built in 1914 as Jessfield Park, it once contained the campus of St. John's University, Shanghai's first international college; today, the park features sakura and peony gardens and a 150-year-old platanus, and it also serves as an interchange hub in the metro system.One of Shanghai's newer parks is the Xujiahui Park, which was built in 1999, on the former grounds of the Great Chinese Rubber Works Factory and the EMI Recording Studio (now La Villa Rouge restaurant). The park has an artificial lake with a sky bridge running across the park. Shanghai Botanical Garden is located 12 km (7 mi) southwest of the city center and was established in 1978. In 2011, the largest botanical garden in Shanghai\u2014Shanghai Chen Shan Botanical Garden\u2014opened in Songjiang District.\n\nOther notable parks in Shanghai include Lu Xun Park, Century Park, Gucun Park, Gongqing Forest Park, and Jing'an Park.\nThe Shanghai Disney Resort Project was approved by the government on 4 November 2009 and opened in 2016.\nThe $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Pudong features a castle that is the biggest among Disney's resorts. More than 11 million people visited the resort in its first year of operation.\n\n\n=== Air pollution ===\n\nAir pollution in Shanghai is not as severe as in many other Chinese cities, but is still considered substantial by world standards. During the December 2013 Eastern China smog, air pollution rates reached between 23 and 31 times the international standard. On 6 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter in Shanghai rose above 600 micrograms per cubic meter and in the surrounding area, above 700 micrograms per cubic metre. Levels of PM2.5 in Putuo District reached 726 micrograms per cubic meter. As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission received orders to suspend students' outdoor activities. Authorities pulled nearly one-third of government vehicles from the roads, while much construction work was halted. Most inbound flights were canceled, and more than 50 flights at Pudong International Airport were diverted.On 23 January 2014, Yang Xiong, the mayor of Shanghai, announced that three main measures would be taken to manage the air pollution in Shanghai, along with surrounding Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces. The measures involved implementing the 2013 air-cleaning program, establishing a linkage mechanism with the three surrounding provinces, and improving the city's early-warning systems. On 12 February 2014, China's cabinet announced that a CN\u00a510 billion (US$1.7 billion) fund will be set up to help companies meet the new environmental standards. The effect of the policy was significant. From 2013 to 2018, more than 3,000 treatment facilities for industrial waste gases were installed, and the city's annual smoke, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide emission decreased by 65%, 54%, and 95%, respectively.\n\n\n=== Environmental protection ===\n\nPublic awareness of the environment is growing, and the city is investing in a number of environmental protection projects. A 14-year cleanup of Suzhou Creek, which runs through the city, was finished in 2012, and 1.3 million cubic meters of sludge were removed. Additionally, the government has moved almost all the factories within the city center to either the outskirts or other provinces, and provided incentives for transportation companies to invest in LPG buses and taxis.\nOn 1 July 2019, Shanghai adopted a new garbage-classification system that sorts out waste into residual waste, kitchen waste, recyclable waste, and hazardous waste. The wastes are collected by separate vehicles and sent to incineration plants, landfills, recycling centers, and hazardous-waste-disposal facilities, respectively.\n\n\n== Media ==\nMedia in Shanghai covers newspapers, publisher, broadcast, television, and Internet, with some media having influence over the whole country. In regard to foreign publications in Shanghai, Hartmut Walravens of the IFLA Newspapers Section said that when the Japanese controlled Shanghai in the 1940s \"it was very difficult to publish good papers \u2013 one either had to concentrate on emigration problems, or cooperate like the Chronicle\".As of March 2020, newspapers publishing in Shanghai include:\n\nNewspapers formerly published in Shanghai include:\n\nThe city's main broadcaster is Shanghai Media Group.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nThe city is the home of the New Development Bank, a multilateral development bank established by the BRICS states, and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a Eurasian political, economic, and security organization.\nAs of April 2020, Shanghai is twinned with the following regions, cities, and counties:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of economic and technological development zones in Shanghai\nList of fiction set in Shanghai\nList of films set in Shanghai\nShanghai Detention Center\nShanghai International Football Tournament\nShanghai Scientific and Technical Publishers\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDanielson, Eric N.

        "wiki": "Pingjiang Road (Chinese: \u5e73\u6c5f\u8def; pinyin: P\u00edngji\u0101ng L\u00f9), historically known as Shiquan Li (Chinese:\u5341\u6cc9\u91cc), is a street and historic district in Gusu District (formerly the Pingjiang District), northeastern Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. It is a well-preserved area and is part of the so-called Old Town of Suzhou.In 2015, the Pingjiang Road Historical Block was added to the list of China's \"National Historic and Cultural Streets\".\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe main street (Pingjiang Road) is located along Pingjiang He (Chinese:\u5e73\u6c5f\u6cb3) and is 1,606 metres (5,269 ft) in length. It stretches from Ganjiang Donglu (Chinese:\u5e72\u5c06\u4e1c\u8def) in the south to Baita Road East (Chinese:\u767d\u5854\u4e1c\u8def) in the northwest, near the Humble Administrator's Garden and Suzhou Museum. The entire historic district covers an area of 0.4 square kilometres (0.15 sq mi). The city of Suzhou was known as Pingjiang during Southern Song Dynasty. As a major thoroughfare of eastern Suzhou back then, the street carries on the former name of the city. It was featured in the map Pingjiang Tu (Chinese:\u5e73\u6c5f\u56fe), produced in the year 1229. There are 51 smaller alleys intersecting the street. There are also about 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) of canals within the historic district.In 2009, Pingjiang Road was listed as a Zhongguo Lishi Wenhua Mingjie (Chinese:\u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u5316\u540d\u8857, literally: Famous historical and cultural street of China), one of the first nine streets with such title across China. Along with Shantang Street, the area was also declared a Zhongguo Lishi Wenhua Jiequ (Chinese:\u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u5316\u8857\u533a, literally: Historical and cultural block of China) in 2015.A BBC Travel article describes Pingjiang Road as less touristy than Shantang Street and states that it is \"lined with houses that embody Suzhou\u2019s style \u2013 graceful, simple and timeless. Pingjiang Road gives an insight into the leisurely existence of the city\u2019s residents. [It is a] centre of Suzhou's artistic life, lined with bookshops and local opera theatres. There are also several teahouses, where people gather for performances of traditional storytelling and ballad singing\".Couple's Retreat Garden (Ou Yuan), a noted Classical Garden located within the historic district, is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Classical Gardens of Suzhou. Guanqian Street is also in walking distance. There are two national-class and 12 provincial-class protection units within the historic district. Pingjiang Road undergone a major renovation prior to the 28th Session of the World Heritage Committee which took place in Suzhou in 2004.\n\n\n== Bridges within the district ==\nThere are 18 stone bridges in the Pingjiang Road historic district. Among them, 12 bridges (or in their previous forms) are shown on the Song Dynasty Pingjiang Tu. They are namely Sipo, Shou'an, Xuegao, Jiqing, Sujun, Zhong'an, Tongli, Huxingsi, Beikaiming, Tangjia, Zhumajiao and Xiaoxin. 10 of the bridges are lying in the north\u2013south direction, the other eight in the east\u2013west direction. The historic district thus has the highest density of bridges across Suzhou.\n\n\n== The story of Hong Jun and Sai Jinhua ==\n\nHong Jun, a scholar and diplomat temporarily residing on 27 Xuanqiao Lane, Pingjiang Road, met 20-year-old Sai Jinhua in 1886, then as a prostitute while on a flower boat. At the time Hong Jun was in mourning due to his mother's death. Hong Jun made Sai Jinhua his concubine one year after meeting her. Sai Jinhua followed Hong Jun in his diplomatic visits to Russia, Germany, Australia and the Netherlands, Sai Jinhua also gave birth to a daughter named Deguan. The couple returned to Suzhou in 1893 and made 29 Xuanqiao Lane home, neighboring Hong Jun's former residence. However, two months after their return, Hong Jun became sick and died at age 55. Sai Jinhua was forced to leave the house after Hong's death and carried on her profession as a courtesan in Shanghai.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nPingjiang Road is within walking distance to the Xiangmen Station of Line 1, Suzhou Rail Transit.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPingjiang Subdistrict\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Pingjiang Road at Wikimedia Commons",

          "A beautiful, very picturesque ancient Chinese town, not far from Shanghai. We did a daytrip and got back in the late afternoon. Wonderful photo opportunities. There is an entrance fee to get in, but it does not feel like a museum, but a living town.",

          "This old town is more commercialised than, say, Tong Li though it is worth a look. It is a network of lanes around the canal, and is quite large. You will need at least half a day to see it. It is located about 30 klms from Jiaxing. The town has been extensively renovated",
          "Visited Xitang during our China trip in Sep 2015. We were in a dilema whether to visit Xitang or Tongli. Trip advisor suggests that both are more or less same and hence we zeroed on Xitang. Its half an hour from Shanghai in bullet train. Better to book the bullet train tickets",
          "We got a tour from our hotel in Shanghai, and we were very suprised that the guide told us that it is not a popular destination. She even told us that it was years since the last trip she made. The place was lovely, and not at all crowded. We had lunch at a family hotel,",

          "Having been a few times I'd suggest going to Xi Tang in early April when the spring blossoms are out, it is very picturesque. Highly recommend it regardless though, it's still a great day out of the city. Getting there on local transport I was immersed in the culture & saw some",
          "We stayed in Xi Tang for one night in May 2015..took the 2 hr bus from Hangzhou. I expected something different..like Lijiang in Yuannan..a new old town but Xi Tang is really an old water town which has been refurbished. Its quite scenic and there are lots of photo opportunities",
          "There are many ways to get to this town from Shanghai. We were told that we could hire a taxi that could take us for about 500RMB but we opted for the trains. We took the high speed train from HongQiao station and asked to go JiaShan which is the nearest station to Xi Tang.",

          "I was worried that 100RMB entry was expensive but found it very much value for money. The ticket gives you entry to 11 \"museums\" throughout the village. Wandering around the streets is a pleasure with shop windows to look in, but nobody forcing their wares on you. We visited on",

        "wiki": "Lujiazui (simplified Chinese: \u9646\u5bb6\u5634; traditional Chinese: \u9678\u5bb6\u5634; pinyin: L\u00f9ji\u0101zu\u01d0, lit. meaning \"[The] Lu family's mouth\"), formerly known as Lokatse from its pronunciation in Shanghainese, is a locality in Shanghai, a peninsula formed by a bend in the Huangpu River. Since the early 1990s, Lujiazui has been developed specifically as a new financial district of Shanghai. The decision to earmark Lujiazui for this purpose reflects its location: it is located on the east side of the Huangpu River in Pudong, and sits directly across the river from the old financial and business district of the Bund.\nLujiazui is a national-level development zone designated by the government. In 2005, the State Council reaffirmed the positioning of the 31.78 km2 (12.27 sq mi) Lujiazui area as the only finance and trade zone among the 185 state-level development zones in mainland China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLujiazui is located in the Pudong New District on the eastern bank of Huangpu River. It forms a peninsula on a bend of the Huangpu River, which turns from flowing north to flowing east. The importance of Lujiazui stems from the fact that it lies directly across the river from the Bund, the old financial and business district of Shanghai, and just south of the confluence of the Suzhou Creek with the Huangpu River. Until the 1980s, Lujiazui was a relatively low-built area, featuring residential houses, warehouses, and factories. Following the allocation of Lujiazui as a special investment zone in 1992, the development of Lujiazui's skyline begun. This was largely driven by Chinese state owned enterprises investing and developing the property within the area, with the inaugural landmark, the Oriental Pearl Tower, being completed in 1994.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nCurrently, there are more than 30 buildings over 25 stories high with commerce as their leading function, and over 504 domestic and foreign financial and insurance corporations located in Lujiazui.The success of Lujiazui in the past 20 years has fueled tourism and business related travel to Shanghai. Pictures of the Lujiazui skyline dominate Shanghai tourism materials, and there are 5 five-star hotels in the area, providing approximately 2,443 rooms, and three more five-star hotels are expected in the area in the coming years, adding more than 1,200 luxury units.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nThe modern configuration of the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek beyond the old county town of Shanghai is the result of engineering works completed during the early Ming Dynasty. The result is that the wider Huangpu River, flowing north past the county town, then turned east at its confluence with the now narrower Suzhou Creek, proceeding along the former downstream channel of the Suzhou Creek to enter the sea at Wusongkou, the former mouth of Suzhou Creek.\nThe bend in the Huangpu River resulted in the formation of an alluvial beach east and south of the bend. This alluvial floodplain was called a \"mouth\" (zui) after its shape. It was named after the family of Lu Shen, a 15th century scholar-official of the Ming Dynasty. Lu's family became one of the most prominent in Ming Dynasty Shanghai, and lived in the Yangjing canal area, east of the Huangpu River and close to today's Lujiazui.\n\n\n=== Settlement ===\nDuring the Ming Dynasty, fishermen were recorded as living in Lujiazui. During the Qing Dynasty, the construction of levees on the peninsula encouraged settlement in greater numbers, with a number of villages forming in the part of the peninsula within the levees. Mudflats remained outside the levees.\nThe opening of Shanghai as a treaty port in the mid-19th century led to rapid development of Lujiazui as an industrial and commercial area servicing Shanghai. The middle part of the peninsula became a town called Lannidu (\u70c2\u6ce5\u6e21, literally \"Mud Ferry\"), named after one of the wharves on the river bank. British, American, French, German and Japanese interests built a series of factories, warehouses and storage yards, and wharves to service them. A busy commercial street developed in Lannidu to service the commodities trade as well as the daily needs of the many workers employed by the industrial facilities.\n\n\n=== Development since 1986 ===\nIn 1986, as part of reform measures to use Shanghai as a centre for increasing economic development and trade in China, a Chinese government policy document referred to the development of Pudong for the first time, including the creation of a new financial and trading center in Lujiazui.   The policy of \"developing and opening up Pudong\" was officially announced in 1990. Pudong was quickly transformed over the next few decades from its industrial past into a financial and commercial centre. As well as a large number of skyscrapers housing the offices of corporations, banks and professional service firms, the area also features a number of hotels and shopping centres, and a convention centre by the waterfront. The Oriental Pearl Radio & Television Tower has dominated the skyline of Lujiazui since it was completed in 1995, although there are now two skyscrapers taller than it.\nIn 2015, the Shanghai Free Trade Zone was expanded to include Lujiazui.\n\n\n== Tallest Buildings 170+ ==\n\n\n== Landmark buildings ==\nLandmark buildings in Lujiazui include:\n\nOriental Pearl Tower\nJin Mao Building\nShanghai World Financial Center\nSuper Brand Mall\nShanghai IFC\nBank of China Tower\nShanghai Tower\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nBy water, Lujiazui is linked to the rest of central Shanghai by ferry services from two wharves, located at the northern and southern ends of the area respectively. At the southern end, the Dongchang Road ferry terminal provides river-crossing services across the Huangpu River to central and southern central Shanghai. The most popular ferry service for tourists connects Dongchang Road wharf with Jinling East wharf, located on the Bund. At the north end, the Xichang Inn wharf provides river-crossing services across the Huangpu River to northern central Shanghai. The former Lujiazui ferry wharf, once part of the most popular river crossing in Shanghai, was closed in 1999, with its wharf structure now used as a waterfront seating area.\nBy road, Lujiazui is connected to the rest of central Shanghai by the Yan'an East Road Tunnel, linking the southern end of the Bund with the centre of Lujiazui. Further away from the centre of Lujiazui, the Renmin Road Tunnel and Fuxing East Road Tunnel link southern Lujiazui with southern central Shanghai, while Xinjian Road Tunnel and Dalian Road Tunnel link northern Lujiazui with northern central Shanghai.\nBy metro, Lujiazui is served by Lujiazui station, which is on Shanghai Metro Line 2.\nAdditionally, the Bund Sightseeing Tunnel is a tourist attraction consisting of slow-moving underground vehicles which move between the Bund and Lujiazui accompanied by light and sound effects in the tunnel.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Central business district relations ==\n\n\n=== Sister central business districts ===\nFinancial District and Wall Street, Manhattan, New York City, New York, United States\n\n\n=== Friendship central business districts ===\nFinancial District and Wall Street, Manhattan, New York City, New York, United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Lujiazui still on the rise,\" by Tian Xiuzhen, Shanghai Star. 2004-12-16\n\"Lujiazui to become top biz district,\" Shanghai Daily. 2006-09-14\nShanghaiDaily.com - Area review.",

          "The Oriental Pearl TV tower is a unique one of a kind structure. Supported by three large columns, it has few large spheres, one at the bottom and one at the top. One of the tallest and most unique in the world. It stands out on the skyline in Pudong opposite the Bund.",

Last time I was in Shanghai I went up the World Financial Center and even though it\u2019s far taller, I didn\u2019t like the view as the viewing deck isn\u2019t well designed. I could see for it that the Pearl Tower would be a lot",

The price was CN\u00a5198 for standard entry up to the glass floor and viewing level but CN\u00a5220 includes the Space Port, the bulge that is a bit higher up. Although the view is no better at that level and the space themed display",

          "The Pearl Tower has a number of things to do once you get there. We took the 196 yuan p.p. option which gave entrance to the viewing platform, the glass walkway and the Shanghai museum in the basement. You must travel up the tower first and be prepared to wait in a queue to go",

          "We went up this tower to get a birds eye view of Shanghai and you certainly do get that, at a cost. They charge \u00a325.00 each for this which is quite expensive. You have to queue for the lifts but they are extremely fast and your ears actually pop you go that fast and that high,",
          "The trip up the tower offered a great view of the city. The floor below had a glass floor which was pretty impressive. However, it was the reconstruction on aspects of old Shanghai in the basement that appealed to us most. As there is so little of old Shanghai left it was a",
          "This was really cool to view in person but also from across the river. The majestic appearance was amazing. The lines are incredibly long and truthfully I don't think it is worth the time to do that - - much more impressive to just view it from a distance - especially at night.",
          "Very scenic and good to go before sunset and after sunset to see in natural light and with lights on",
          "I don\u2019t really know when is the best time to visit. But I only had a chance to go on Sunday, and it was sooo crowded. We waited an hour just for the first elevator trip. I don\u2019t recommend going to the highest level, was it space station? I forgot. You go there if you have a 12",
          "It affords a 360 degrees view of Shanghai city and its worth the money. But it took us nearly three hours in the Queue to reach the top. We could hardly enjoy the views as it was very very crowded. Please don't visit during Chinese holidays!!",
          "The trip up to the space capsule, although the view was good, wasn't worth the hour queuing to catch the single lift from the 263th floor. You then are forced to go through 3 other stops, each where you queue for another 30 minutes each, before you finally get out. Not worth the",
          "Felt a bit rushed. Crammed into lifts especially at the end on the way down. Very confusing pricing - not really sure what you got with each ticket.",
          "Best time to go would be in the morning, I went in the afternoon and it was very busy The cost is 120 yuan but when your up there it's well worth it. You reach the 88th observation floor by high speed lift which takes about 45 seconds and you have a 360 degrees view of",
          "I have been here twice. Second time round it was a lot more crowded. Even going up to the top floor there are queues. I would recommend turning the aircon or fan on for the queue as it gets hot with lots of people around waiting to get into the lift. Overall it was a good",
          "We arrived just after 0800am and the number of people was insane. Large tour groups with adults running and aggressively pushing to get to the front of the lines. The lines actually moved really quickly and orderly with only the odd person physically pushing to get to the front.",
          "The tickets can be purchased directly on the sight, but as my friend who is Chinese told me, it is not possible to buy via cash, but only WeChat payment, so I think it is better to book before visiting. Our visit was night visit. Our tour consisted of two level visits, so",
          "We were lucky enough to get VIP tickets so we skipped all the queues, but beware, the queues were insane! People told us they had been queuing for 3 hours! The views of Shanghai are amazing. We also ate in the 360 degree revolving restaurant which was a great experience and a",
          "I decided to visit the Pearl Tower since it is such an iconic landmark in Shanghai. This place is very good. I would recommend getting the CNY 220 package. This takes you up to the 531 Meter level with amazing views of the city. At 531 meters one can see the point where the",
          "I was there and I loved it, and the glass bridges were awesome amazing view and highly recommended for each and every one who visits Shanghai",
          "There were several choices of high rise buildings to get up there to see Shanghai, but this one offers 360 degrees and at different levels so it was more worth. There were transparent floors like see through glass at one level and it was very exciting to take pictures lying",
          "We arrived mid morning on a Sunday and went up after about 30 minutes in queue inside the tower. Not bad for a popular tourist attraction in China. The glass observatory was definitely the highlight for this tower. It was a bit crowded but we managed to get a good space for",
          "There are two basic tickets to the Radio Tower. The first is 99 Yuan the second is all the way to the top and is twice that. There are locations where you can stand on glass and look straight down, that is if you can get through the crowds. There are also places to virtually",
          "We went all the way over and under the Pearl. The building is quite unique and very beautiful. There are multiple exhibitions and combinations/options for a trip up (around 160rmb). It was all cloudy and rainy so we opted out to go up, but the area under and around is quite nice",
          "The views from this place are incredible I would defiantly recommended.Plenty of photos were taken up here.Onnone of the levels you also have a glass floor looking down which really gives a feel for how high up you are. Best time to go we went up at 5 so we got to see it all In",
          "Definitely worth a visit, but only on a clear day. Luckily the day I was here it was clear, at times the cloud ceiling is so low you can\u2019t even see the observatory sphere . There\u2019s a nice 360 glass bottom section here, which is equally scaring and exhilarating to see the long",
          "Perhaps we were tired and fed-up with travel, but this seemed like a slog. In all, we spent an hour and a half getting up and down this. Old, slow lifts, with the usual Chinese queues made this a long wait. I wouldn't bother with the top viewing platform (which they called a",
          "This is a great place to visit in Shanghai. Make sure you reserve a few hours for this tour, since the lines can be really long. The glass bottom is the highlight of the tower. Incredible view of the city.",

          "This is indeed one of the nicest place to visit in Shanghai.Though this is not the tallest building in Shanghai,its really worth it.Its an amazing looking building and the views are awesome.The biggest highlight is the glass bottom viewing point..As many other places ,wifi is",
          "Beautiful place to visit by night. May need to stand in a long queue. Please carry water to drink. Security checks are there but no issues with normal things. You have to come down by one floor from the topmost floor to walk on glass floor.Measured in metres and not floors. Too",
          "I loved my visit here. The glass observatory alone was worth the visit. I did all of the extras: 5D movie, virtual roller coaster, all the floors to visit. It was a fun half of a day. I went first thing in the morning and didn\u2019t wait at all. When I left several hours later, the",
          "Beautiful building. Especially so at night. ( We did not go to the observation deck on this visit. It\u2019s a bit pricy / spends and there is another building just down the road that is much taller. Shanghai tower ). The Pearl is a great Iconic part of the Shanghai skyline.",
          "It is much more then just an observation deck! Make sure to visit the VR rollercoaster and the games floor! Nice gift shop at ground floor.",
          "Brave the queues and get up there, just incredible views of a spectacular city. It's very, very impressive.",
          "We wasted half a day on probably the worst tourist attraction I\u2019ve ever been to. It tested our patience to the limit. The building itself from the outside is spectacular. Inside expect queues...long queues...getting in...getting to the security gate...getting to the",
          "Great views of Shanghai! Never could have imaged how large and how many buildings were in Shanghai without going to the Observation area (second globe). The glass wall/floor area made me a little nervous as there was no limit on how many people could be on the glass at a time.",
          "It is a must go place in Shanghai, the high capsule is not so good, but if you buy the ticket to go there you will cut a big queue, the place that pay the visit is the floor of glass, it is really nice and crazy walk in that glass.",
          "Don\u2019t waste your time and money going inside this iconic building. The line to get in is about 2.5hrs wait if you have pre purchased your ticket, otherwise is longer. The locals will try to get in front of you in line, so be alert. If you are looking to take photos of this",
          "So we took Hop on Hop Off bus over to the tower. It was very crowded and mostly with younger kids. Its certainly impressive, but surrounded mostly by shops. If shopping isn't your thing its kind of once and done thing. We didn't opt to go up. Four stars because of its iconic",
          "I don't know why this building the most popular than other, Every people wanna take pict with this building as a background.. So do I, hahaha.. I think you must take pict with this oriental pearl tower when u go to Shanghai as a sign u ever visit shnghai \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Exceptionally beautiful when lit in glowing colours at night. Going up and looking at the city is nice, but I prefer sitting on a restaurant on the other side of the river and view the magnificent light show on the Oriental Pearl Tower.",
          "iconic building in shanghai which looks an alien base, which build for eye catching and it works, you see people around you making many funny pose for a memorable photo hear, it has an observatory deck and i prefer to go with a taller building",
          "Before going think are you willing to be at long queue. For us the queue to 351m was taking more than 2hours. If you have posibility to order ticket from web do it is worth of money and time. We bought ticket\u2019s from under the tower but better Choice is to buy from the lobby of",
          "Had to opportunity to visit Shanghai Pearl Tower:the queue to go up is very long but once up there;you will be amazed by the beauty of the city. Try going out to the glass walk way outside:everything looks so small but scary also.Worth a visit if you are in Shanghai.",
          "Pearl Tower is a must-see attraction in Shanghai. It's a great family day out, and you will get to see amazing views whether you visit in the day or at night. Highlights include the glass floor in one section and also a great VR rollercoaster! Enjoy...",
          "If you want a spectacular view of Shanghai, hen you have to go to the observation deck of one of the most famous buildings in its skyline\" the Pearl Tower! We went first thing in the morning, so the sky was more clear and there wasn't a long line to take the elevator up. Once",
          "This is one of the most remarkably, compelling and wonderful structures in the world. It is still the icon of modern-day Shanghai, but represents some of the most awkward, ugly and confused design of our, or any, generation. You cannot help but take photos of it, walk to its",
          "Is so unbelievable crowded during summer and is expensive and we spend 4 hrs going up and down in several lines. Not worked your time and money when around the corner you find the amazing Shanghai tower with the best views in the world!",
          "We attempted to visit this tower on a Sunday. Although it was before lunch th queue was 3 hours long after getting tickets. We came back first thing Monday and walked straight in. Pay the extra to go up to the top i think it is worth it particularly on a clear day. Pleased we",
          "Cool tower but way to crowdy. Only went there for the Xiaomi Store, where we bought 2 powerbanks. In conclusion, if you want to go up the tower, be sure to be ready to spend a few hours waiting.",
          "Strolling into Pudong is a must You won't be able probably to take a full picture of the tower and the skyline around, so put phone in the pocket and admire the construction how its done, the sleek line and the Pearl on top. if you are lucky to find a bright sunny day it's a gem",
          "Iconic shaped tower. At night it is beautiful lit with alternating different colours. I real spectacle to watch! You can go up to the sphere second from the top where there is a glass bottom. Gives a nice view with a different perspective. Below the tower is a nice museum",
          "Avoid this restaurant if you can . Queue to the dinner is madness . No queue management n lot of jostling n queue jumping with locals . Never go again though food n services were good .",
          "If you know the weather is going to be good and visibility decent, add this to your list of top 10 things to do in Shanghai! I took Metro Line 2 from East Nanjing Road station and traveled one stop to Lujiazui station. On a weekend, a lot of people are going here from locals,",
          "Give yourselves at least 3 hours to do this Tower justice. The first day we went, the queues had a 3 hour waiting time, so we went the next day at about 8:30 am. Although There was already a short queue - we were in a lift within 1/2 an hour. If you want to go to the space",
          "A tower within the Financial hub of Shanghai. Surrounded by HSBC, Citi and DBS HQ building. A good photo spot. Disney flagship shop is also nearby...",
          "The tower is a mixture between museum and view monument. The variety at the different levels is entertaining and spectacular. Always assuming the it is not to foggy,",
          "This is still shanghai's icon. Super crowded, hope they are able to limit visitors on top to enjoy the view.",
          "Go early and plan to wait in line due to the large crowd. With the full access ticket, go to every level, enjoy the view and take pictures. Besides the view, there is the space exhibit, restaurants, the Shanghai museum and various souvenir stands and food venues. Plenty to",

          "This was the last of the towers we visited that day. Unfortunately it was very busy and we ended up queuing for about 30 minutes to get a lift to the top which wasn't as bad as others have experienced. Try and get there as early as possible for some space Make sure you visit the",
          "The entrance to this attraction can be extremely crowded. Although they have a number of mazes to keep the visitors moving to the elevators, there are only 2 and it takes a while to get to the top. Once there you can see forever, depending on the fog/smog. You can enjoy walking",
          "Wish I got the type B ticket coz it covers everything that I need to see. The space capsule isn\u2019t really worth going into. The transparent observatory and museum are nice. The views from the top aren\u2019t even clear. I prefer the view from ICC in Hong Kong",
          "Prepare to queue for few hours before getting to the highest floor. Walking on the glass floor observation deck is a great experience. The view is beautiful with the colourful surroundings and the buildings.",
          "This tower is in the middle of the financial district and is most impressive. There are two sections of hotel rooms in the globes surrounding the needle. Once inside there are places to eat and shop. Being there in late March afforded us with no long lines although when you get",
          "Great view of the Shanghai skyline. It is worth the trip. The direction signs once inside are not very easy to follow though.",
          "The Pearl Tower is nice to look at but mostly at night. My thoughts anyway. Some months the smog is so bad you are not able to stand at the bottom and see the top, but the end of April was fantastic. The river cruise was nice but they want extra money for seats up front.",
          "More lines. Reasonable price. Decent view. Funky building. Glass floor viewing deck was a good laugh",

        "wiki": "Suzhou (Chinese: \u82cf\u5dde; Suzhounese pronunciation: [s\u0259u ts\u00f8\u028f], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [s\u00fa.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u]), alternately romanized as Soochow, is a major city located in southeastern Jiangsu Province of East China, about 100 km (62 mi) northwest of Shanghai. It is a major economic center and focal point of trade and commerce, and the second largest city in the province, after its capital Nanjing. The city is situated on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the shores of Lake Tai and belongs to the Yangtze River Delta region. Administratively, Suzhou is a prefecture-level city with a population of 4.33 million in its city proper, and a total resident population (as of 2013) of 10.58 million in its administrative area. Its urban population grew at an unprecedented rate of 6.5% between 2000 and 2014, which is the highest among cities with more than 5 million people.Founded in 514 BC, Suzhou has over 2,500 years of history, with an abundant display of relics and sites of historical interest. Around AD 100, during the Eastern Han dynasty, it became one of the ten largest cities in the world mostly due to emigration from Northern China. Since the 10th-century Song dynasty, it has been an important commercial center of China. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Suzhou was a national economic, cultural, and commercial center, as well as the largest non-capital city in the world, until the 1860 Taiping Rebellion. When Li Hongzhang and Charles George Gordon recaptured the city three years later, Shanghai had already taken its predominant place in the nation. Since major economic reforms began in 1978, Suzhou has become one of the fastest growing major cities in the world, with GDP growth rates of about 14% in the past 35 years. With high life expectancy and per capita incomes, Suzhou's Human Development Index ratings is roughly comparable to a moderately developed country, making it one of the most highly developed and prosperous cities in China.The city's canals, stone bridges, pagodas, and meticulously designed gardens have contributed to its status as one of the top tourist attractions in China. The Classical Gardens of Suzhou were added to the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1997 and 2000. Suzhou is often dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" or \"Venice of China\".\n\n\n== Names ==\nDuring the Zhou, a settlement known as Gusu after nearby Mount Gusu (simplified Chinese: \u59d1\u82cf\u5c71; traditional Chinese: \u59d1\u8607\u5c71; pinyin: G\u016bs\u016bsh\u0101n) became the capital of the state of Wu. From this role, it also came to be called Wu as well. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu established a new capital nearby at Hel\u00fc City and this grew into the modern city. During the Warring States period, Hel\u00fc City continued to serve as the local seat of government. From the areas it administered, it became known as Wuxian (lit. \"Wu County\") and Wujun (\"Wu Commandery\"). Under the Qin, it was known as Kuaiji after its greatly enlarged commandery, which was named for the reputed resting place of Yu the Great near modern Shaoxing in Zhejiang.\nThe name Suzhou was first officially used for the city in AD 589 during the Sui dynasty. The s\u016b (\u8607 or \u82cf) in its name is a contraction of the old name Gusu. It refers to the mint perilla (shiso). The zhou \u5dde originally meant something like a province or county (cf. Guizhou), but often came to be used metonymously for the capital of such a region (cf. Guangzhou, Hangzhou, etc.). Suzhou is the Hanyu Pinyin spelling of the Putonghua pronunciation of the name. Prior to the adoption of pinyin, it was variously romanized as Soo-chow, Suchow, or Su-chow.\n\n\n== History ==\nSuzhou, the cradle of Wu culture, is one of the oldest towns in the Yangtze Basin. By the Spring and Autumn period of the Zhou, local tribes named the Gou Wu are recorded living in the area which would become the modern city of Suzhou. These tribes formed villages on the edges of the hills above the wetlands surrounding Lake Tai.\nSima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian records traditional accounts that the Zhou lord Taibo established the state of Wu at nearby Wuxi during the 11th century BC, civilizing the local people and improving their agriculture and mastery of irrigation. The Wu court later moved to Gusu within the area of modern Suzhou. In 514 BC, King Hel\u00fc of Wu relocated his court nearby and called the settlement Hel\u00fc City after himself. His minister Wu Zixu was closely involved with its planning and it was this site that grew into present-day Suzhou. The height of his tower on Gusu Hill (Gusutai) passed into Chinese legend. In 496 BC, King Hel\u00fc was buried at Tiger Hill. In 473 BC, Wu was defeated and annexed by Yue, a kingdom to its southeast; Yue was annexed in turn by Chu in 306 BC. Remnants of the ancient kingdom include pieces of its 2,500-year-old city wall and the gate through it at Pan Gate.\nThe city was originally laid out according to a symbolic three-by-three grid of nine squares, with the royal palace occupying the central position.During the Warring States period, Suzhou was the seat of Wu County and Commandery. Following the Qin Empire's conquest of the area in 222 BC, it was made the capital of Kuaiji Commandery, including lands stretching from the south bank of the Yangtze to the unconquered interior of Minyue in southern Zhejiang. Amid the collapse of the Qin, Kuaiji's governor Yin Tong attempted to organize his own rebellion only to be betrayed and executed by Xiang Liang and his nephew Xiang Yu, who launched their own rebellion from the city.\nWhen the Grand Canal was completed, Suzhou found itself strategically located on a major trade route. In the course of the history of China, it has been a metropolis of industry and commerce on the southeastern coast of China. During the Tang dynasty, the great poet Bai Juyi constructed the Shantang Canal (better known as \"Shantang Street\") to connect the city with Tiger Hill for tourists. In AD 1035, the Suzhou Confucian Temple was founded by famed poet and writer Fan Zhongyan. It became a venue for the imperial civil examinations and then developed into the modern Suzhou High School in the 1910s.\n\nIn February 1130, the advancing Jin army from the north ransacked the city. This was followed by the Mongol invasion in 1275. In 1356, Suzhou became the capital of Zhang Shicheng, one of the leaders of the Red Turban Rebellion against the Yuan dynasty and the self-proclaimed King of Wu. In 1367, Zhang's Nanjing-based rival Zhu Yuanzhang took the city after a 10-month siege. Zhu \u2013 who was soon to proclaim himself the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty \u2013 demolished the royal city in the center of Suzhou's walled city and imposed crushing taxes on the city and prefecture's powerful families. Despite the heavy taxation and the resettlement of some of Suzhou's prominent citizens' to the area of Hongwu's capital at Nanjing, Suzhou was soon prosperous again. During the early Ming, Suzhou Prefecture supervised the Yangtze shoals which later became Shanghai's Chongming Island. For centuries the city, with its surroundings as an economic base, represented an extraordinary source of tax revenue.When the shipwrecked Korean official Choe Bu had a chance to see much of Eastern China from Zhejiang to Liaoning on his way home in 1488, he described Suzhou in his travel report as exceeding every other city. Many of the area's private gardens were constructed by the gentry of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Taipings captured the city in 1860, however, and many of its former buildings and gardens were \"almost... a heap of ruins\" by the time of their recovery by Charles Gordon's Ever-Victorious Army in November 1863. Nonetheless, by 1880, its population was estimated to have recovered to about 500,000, which remained stable for the next few decades. In the late 19th century, the town was particularly known for its wide range of silks and its Chinese-language publishing industry. The town was first opened to direct foreign trades by the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending the First Sino-Japanese War and by the most favored nation clauses of earlier unequal treaties with the Great Powers. The new expatriates opened a European-and-Chinese school in 1900 and the Suzhou railway station, connecting it with Shanghai, opened on July 16, 1906. Just prior to the World War I, there were 7000 silk looms in operation, as well as a cotton mill and a large trade in rice.\n\nAs late as the early 20th century, much of the city consisted of islands connected by rivers, creeks, and canals to the surrounding countryside. Prior to their demolition, the city walls ran in a circuit of about 10 miles (16 km) with four large suburbs lying outside. The Japanese invaded in 1937, and many gardens were again devastated by the end of the war. In the early 1950s, restoration was done on the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Lingering Garden.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe urban core of Suzhou is informally called the \"Old Town\". It is Gusu District. Suzhou Industrial Park is to the east of the old town, and Suzhou High & New Technology Development Zone is to the west. In 2000, the original Wu County was divided into two districts including Xiangcheng and Wuzhong. They now form the northern and southern parts of the city of Suzhou.In 2012, the original Wujiang City became Wujiang District of Suzhou City.\nSuzhou is one of the most prosperous cities in China. Its development has a direct correlation with the growth of its satellite cities, including Kunshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Zhangjiagang, which together with the city of Suzhou form the Suzhou prefecture. The Suzhou prefecture is home to many high-tech enterprises.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSuzhou is on the Lake Tai Plain south of the Yangtze River, about 100 km (60 mi) to the west of Shanghai and just over 200 km (120 mi) east of Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSuzhou has a four-season humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and cool, cloudy, damp winters with occasional snowfall (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa). Northwesterly winds blowing from Siberia during winter can cause temperatures to fall below freezing at night, while southerly or southwesterly winds during the summer can push temperatures above 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F). The hottest temperature recorded since 1951 was at 41.0 \u00b0C (106 \u00b0F) on 7 August 2013, and the lowest at \u22129.8 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) on 16 January 1958.\n\n\n== Cityscape and environment ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Classical Gardens of Suzhou ===\n\nSuzhou is famous for its over 60 Classical Gardens, collectively a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city has the Most UNESCO-recognized gardens in the world.The Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden are among the four most famous classical gardens in China. The Canglang Pavilion, Lion Grove Garden, Humble Administrator's Garden and Lingering Garden, respectively representing the garden styles of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, are called the four most famous gardens in Suzhou. Other gardens inscribed on the World Heritage List include the Couple's Retreat Garden, the Garden of Cultivation, and the Retreat and Reflection Garden.\n\n\n=== Temples ===\nHanshan Temple\nXiyuan Temple\nXuanmiao Temple\nLingyanshan Temple\nChongyuan Temple\nTaipingfang Mosque (\u592a\u5e73\u574a\u6e05\u771f\u5bfa)\n\n\n=== Canals and historic districts ===\n\nThe Suzhou section of the Jiangnan Canal, Grand Canal (China), includes ten city gates and over 20 stone bridges of traditional design and historic areas that have been well preserved, as well as temples and pavilions. \n There are a full 24 waterways in Suzhou near the Grand Canal.In 2015, both 800-year-old Pingjiang Road Historical Block (\u5e73\u6c5f\u8def) and 1,200-year-old Shantang Street Scenic Area (\u5c71\u5858\u8857) were added to the list of China's \"National Historic and Cultural Streets\".Pingjiang Road runs parallel to the Pingjiang River for 1.5 kilometers and is lined with homes and some teahouses. Shantang Street, over twice as long at 3.8 km, is described by the BBC as  retaining \"the alluring qualities of an old canal-side street: whitewashed buildings are completed by red-tasselled lanterns that swing softly in the breeze, adding to the charm of the river bank\".\n\nBoat tours are offered on the waterways of this city that was dubbed the \"Venice of the East\" by Marco Polo because of its criss-crossing canals and stone bridges. The Grand Canal (from Beijing to Zhejiang province) is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n\n=== Resorts and natural reserves ===\nSuzhou Taihu National Tourism and Vacation Zone (\u82cf\u5dde\u592a\u6e56\u56fd\u5bb6\u65c5\u6e38\u5ea6\u5047\u533a) is in the western part of Suzhou, 15 km (9 mi) from the city center.\n\n\n=== Skyscrapers ===\n\nGate to the East is a 301.8 meter, 74-story skyscraper in Suzhou's central business district, built in 2015 at a cost of 700 million USD and is currently the tallest building in Suzhou.\n\n\n=== Pan Gate ===\nPan Gate is on the southwest corner of the Main Canal or encircling canal of Suzhou. Originally built during the Warring States Period in the state of Wu, historians estimate it to be around 2,500 years old. It is now part of the Pan Gate Scenic Area. It is known for the \"three landmarks of Pan Gate\". They are the Ruiguang Pagoda, the earliest pagoda in Suzhou built in 247 BC, the Wu Gate Bridge, the entrance to the gate at that time over the water passage and the highest bridge in Suzhou at the time, and the Pan Gate. The Ruigang Pagoda is constructed of brick with wooden platforms and has Buddhist carvings at its base.\n\n\n=== Baodai Bridge ===\nBaodai Bridge stretches across the Tantai Lake in the suburbs of Suzhou. To raise money to finance the bridge, the magistrate donated his expensive belt, hence the name. The bridge was first built in 806 A.D. in the Tang Dynasty and has 53 arches with a length of 317 meters. It was made out of stone from Jinshan Mountain and is the longest standing bridge of its kind in China. The bridge was included on the list of national monuments (resolution 5-285) in 2001.\n\n\n=== Tiger Hill ===\nThe Tiger Hill is known for its natural environment and historical sites. The hill is so named because it is said to look like a crouching tiger. Another legend states that a white tiger appeared on the hill to guard it following the burial The hill has been a tourist destination for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, as is evident from the poetry and calligraphy carved into rocks on the hill. The Song Dynasty poet, Su Shi said, \"It is a lifelong pity if having visited Suzhou you did not visit Tiger Hill.\"\n\n\n=== Pagodas ===\nYunyan Pagoda (or Huqiu Tower) built in 961 is a Chinese pagoda built on Tiger Hill in Suzhou. It has several other names, including the \"Leaning Tower of China\" (as referred to by historian O.G. Ingles) and the Yunyan Temple Tower. The tower rises to a height of 47 m (154 ft). It is a seven-story octagonal building built with blue bricks. In more than a thousand years the tower has gradually slanted due to forces of nature. Now the top and bottom of the tower vary by 2.32 meters. The entire structure weighs some 7,000,000 kilograms (15,000,000 lb), supported by internal brick columns. However, the tower leans roughly 3 degrees due to the cracking of two supporting columns.Beisi Pagoda or North Temple Pagoda is a Chinese pagoda at Bao'en Temple in Suzhou. It rises nine stories in a height of 76 m (249 ft). It is the tallest Chinese pagoda south of the Yangtze river.\nTwin Pagodas (\u82cf\u5dde\u53cc\u5854) lie in the Dinghui Temple Lane in the southeastern corner of the city proper of Suzhou. They are artistic and natural as they are close at hand. One of them is called Clarity-Dispensing Pagoda and the other Beneficence Pagoda and they are in the same form of building. There are many legends about the one-thousand-year-old pagodas. It is charming that the exquisite and straight Twin Pagoda look like two inserted writing brushes. There was originally a single-storey house with three rooms just like a writing brush holder with the shadows of the two pagodas reclining on its roof at sunset. To the east of the pagoda is a square five-storeyed bell building built in the Ming Dynasty which is exactly like a thick ink stick. So there is a saying that \"the Twin Pagodas are as writing brushes while the bell building as ink stick\".\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe city's major museums include the Suzhou Museum (designed by I. M. Pei), Suzhou Silk Museum, and Suzhou Museum of Opera and Theatre.\n\n\n=== Hospitals ===\nAs a result of its recent rapid population increase, healthcare demand in Suzhou is increasing rapidly. In July 2019, Washington University School of Medicine announced a collaboration with Huici Health Management Co., and the Xiangcheng District, to open the new Huici Medical Center, which will include a 1,000-bed hospital for adult and pediatric patients. Once the hospital is unveiled, Washington University doctors in St. Louis will be able to provide long-distance health-care services to patients in China through a telemedicine program.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Suzhou is predominantly Han Chinese. The official language of broadcast, instruction, etc. is Mandarin Chinese, although many speak a local dialect known as Suzhounese, a member of the Wu language family. In addition to American and European expatriates, there is a large Korean community in Suzhou. The Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) estimated that there were 15,000 Koreans in the municipality in 2014. That year 850 Korean companies operated in Suzhou, and the Koreans made up the largest number of students at the Suzhou Singapore International School.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nSuzhou's economy is based primarily on its large manufacturing sector\u2014China's second largest\u2014including iron and steel, IT and electronic equipment, and textile products. The city's service sector is notably well-developed, primarily owing to tourism, which brought in a total of RMB 152 billion of revenue in 2013. Suzhou's overall GDP exceeded RMB 1.3 trillion in 2013 (up 9.6 percent from the year previous).The city is also one of China's foremost destinations for foreign investment, based on its relative proximity to Shanghai and comparatively low operating costs. The municipal government has enacted various measures to encourage FDI in a number of manufacturing (e.g. pharmaceutical, electronic goods, automobile) and service (e.g. banking, logistics, research services) sectors. Included among these measures is a preferential tax policy for limited partnership venture capital enterprises in the Suzhou Industrial Park.\n\n\n=== Development zones ===\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park ====\n\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) is the largest cooperative project between the Chinese and Singaporean governments. It is beside Jinji Lake, which lies to the east of the Suzhou Old City. On 26 February 1994, Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew represented China and Singapore respectively in signing the Agreement to jointly develop Suzhou Industrial Park (originally called the Singapore Industrial Park). The project officially commenced on 12 May in the same year. SIP has a jurisdiction area of 288 km2 (111 sq mi), of which, the China-Singapore cooperation area covers 80 km2 (31 sq mi) with a planned residential population of 1.2 million.SIP is home to the Suzhou Dushu Lake Science and Education Innovation District, an area of universities and higher education institutions, including Soochow University and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. Suzhou Industrial Park is also a popular residential district for many foreigners who work and live in Suzhou, as well as 'new Suzhou' residents who migrated to the area in search of work opportunities.\n\n\n==== Suzhou Industrial Park Export Processing Zone ====\nThe Suzhou Industrial Park Export Processing Zone was approved to be established by the government in April 2000, with a planning area of 2.9 km2 (1.1 sq mi). It is in Suzhou Industrial Park set up by China and Singapore. Inside the Export Processing Zone, all the infrastructures are of high standard.\n\n\n==== Suzhou New District ====\n\nThe Suzhou New District was established in 1990. In November 1992, the zone was approved to be the national-level hi-tech industrial zone. By the end of 2007, foreign-invested companies had a registered capital worth of US$13 billion, of which US$6.8 billion was paid in. SND hosts now more than 1,500 foreign companies. Some 40 Fortune 500 companies set up 67 projects in the district.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nSuzhou Dongwu currently play in China League Two, the third division of Chinese football. The 13,000 seat Suzhou Industrial Park Sports Arena will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nSuzhou is on the Shanghai-Nanjing corridor which carries three parallel railways. Suzhou railway station, near the city center, is among the busiest passenger stations in China. It is served by the Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway (mostly \"conventional\" trains to points throughout China) and the Shanghai-Nanjing intercity railway (high-speed D- and G-series trains providing frequent service primarily between Shanghai and Nanjing). It takes only 25 minutes to reach Shanghai railway station on the fastest G-series trains and less than 1 hour to Nanjing.\nThe Suzhou North railway station, a few kilometers to the north, is on the Beijing\u2013Shanghai high-speed railway (opened 2011), served by high-speed trains to Beijing, Qingdao, etc.\nOther stations on the Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway and the Shanghai\u2013Nanjing intercity railway serve other points in the same corridor within Suzhou Prefecture-level city, such as Kunshan. In and between Suzhou and Kunshan South railway station, Suzhou Industrial Park railway station now also becomes an important station for people visiting and living in the areas.\nThe northern part of the city, including such county-level cities as Zhangjiagang, Changshu and Taicang, presently has no rail service. However, plans exist for a cross-Yangtze railway from Nantong to the Shanghai metropolitan area (the Shanghai\u2013Nantong railway), which will run through most of these county-level cities. Construction work is expected to start in 2013 and to take five and a half years.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nThe Nanjing-Shanghai Expressway connects Suzhou with Shanghai, alternatively, there is the Yangtze Riverine Expressway and the Suzhou-Jiaxing-Hangzhou Expressway. In 2005, the Suzhou Outer Ring was completed, linking the peripheral county-level cities of Taicang, Kunshan, and Changshu. China National Highway 312 also passes through Suzhou.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\nSuzhou is served by three airports, Sunan Shuofang International Airport (co-owned by Wuxi and Suzhou), Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport ( one hour drive ), Shanghai Pudong International Airport ( two hours drive ).\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\n\nPort of Suzhou, on the right bank of the Yangtze River, dealt with 428 million tons of cargo and 5.86 million TEU containers in 2012, which made it the busiest inland river port in the world by annual cargo tonnage and container volume.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Suzhou Rail Transit currently has four lines in operation and five other lines under construction. The masterplan consists of nine independent lines. Line 1 started operation on April 28, 2012, Line 2 started operation on December 28, 2013, and Line 4 started operation in 2017. As of March 2020, Line 5, Line 6, Line 7 and Line 8 and Line S1 are under construction at the same time.\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nSuzhou Tram system has two routes in the Suzhou New District.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nSuzhou has public bus routes that run into all parts of the city. Fares are flat rated, usually 1 Yuan for a non-air-conditioned bus and 2 Yuan for an air-conditioned one. The Suzhou BRT, a 25-kilometre (16 mi) bus rapid transit system opened in 2008, operates 5 lines using elevated busways and bus-only lanes throughout the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nOpera: Kunqu originates in the Suzhou region, as does the much later Suzhou Opera. Ballad-singing, or Suzhou pingtan, is a local form of storytelling that mixes singing (accompanied by the pipa and sanxian) with portions in spoken dialect.\nSilk: throughout China's Imperial past, Suzhou silk has been associated with high-quality silk products, supplying silks to ancient royal families. By the 13th century, Suzhou was already the center of the profitable silk trade.\nSong brocade: Suzhou's Song brocade, with its flashy colors, exquisite patterns, strong and soft texture, is one of China's three famous brocades, together with Nanjing Yun brocade and Sichuan Shu brocade. Suzhou's brocade production can be traced back to the Five Dynasties. It prospered in the Song Dynasty. After the government moved the capital southward, the country's political and cultural center moved to the Yangtze River area. To cope with the special need of artists, a type of very thin brocade for decorating paintings emerged in Suzhou. These brocades and paintings have been preserved. Whenever people talked about brocade, they mentioned the Song Dynasty, and thus Song brocade got its name and has been well-known ever since.\nHandicrafts: Suzhou embroidery, fans, Chinese musical instruments, scroll mounting, lanterns, mahogany furniture, jade carving, silk tapestry, traditional painting pigments of Jiangenxutang Studio, the New Year's wood-block prints of Taohuawu Studio.\nPaintings\nCalligraphic art\nCuisine: Yangcheng Lake large crab\nSuzhou Silk Hand Embroidery Art\nSuzhou is the original place of \"Jasmine\", a song sung by Chinese singers or actresses thousands of times on the occasions of almost every important meetings or celebrations. Jasmine is the symbol of Suzhou as well as Tai Hu Lake.\nSuzhou Gardens: Gardens in Suzhou have an ancient history. The first garden in Suzhou belonged to the emperor of Wu State in Spring and Autumn Period (600 BC). More than 200 gardens existed in Suzhou between the 16th and 18th centuries. Gardens in Suzhou were built according to the style of Chinese Paintings. Every view in a garden can be seen as a piece of Chinese Painting and the whole garden is a huge piece of Chinese Paintings. At present, the Humble Administrator's Garden, built in 16th, is the largest private garden in Suzhou. It belonged to by Wang Xianchen, an imperial censor.\nSuzhou embroidery together with embroidery of Hunan, Sichuan and Guangdong are called as the \"Four Famous Embroideries\". Suzhou tapestry method is done in fine silks and gold thread. Other art forms found in this area are sculpture, Song brocade, jade and rosewood carving.\nThe Suzhou Museum has a rich collection of relics from many eras. The collection includes revolutionary records, stele carving, folk customs, drama and verse, Suzhou embroidery, silk cloth, gardens, coins and Buddhist artifacts.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nSuzhou High School\nSuzhou No.1 High School\nSuzhou No.10 High School\nSuzhou Experimental High School\nLiangfeng High School\nChangshu High School\nZhenze Middle School\nKunshan Senior High School\nTaicang Senior High School\nSIP Experimental Middle School\nSuzhou Wuxian High School (\u82cf\u5dde\u5434\u53bf\u4e2d\u5b66)\n\n\n=== Universities and colleges ===\nSoochow University\nUniversity of Science and Technology of Suzhou\nRenmin University of China Suzhou Campus\nChangshu Institute of Technology\nJiangsu University of Science & Technology Zhangjiagang Campus\nXi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University\nDuke Kunshan University\n\n\n==== Under construction ====\nNanjing University Suzhou Campus\nNorthwestern Polytechnical University Taicang Campus\n\n\n=== Postgraduate institutions ===\nSoutheast University-Monash University Joint Graduate School\nSuzhou Graduate Town (National University of Singapore and Fudan Joint Graduate School, Nanjing University Graduate School, etc.)\n\n\n=== Others ===\nDulwich College Suzhou\nDulwich International High School Suzhou\nJapanese School of Suzhou\nKedge Business School\nOverseas Chinese Academy of Suzhou (\u82cf\u5dde\u5de5\u4e1a\u56ed\u533a\u6d77\u5f52\u4eba\u624d\u5b50\u5973\u5b66\u6821)\nSkema Business School \u2013 Chinese campus of the French business school\nSuzhou EtonHouse International School\nSuzhou Foreign Language School\nSuzhou Korean School\nSuzhou Singapore International School\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of twin towns and sister cities in China\nPort of Suzhou\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== General references ==\n Baynes, T.

        "wiki": "The Chinese garden is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the Chinese emperors and members of the imperial family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world. They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature.A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, rock works, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe earliest recorded Chinese gardens were created in the valley of the Yellow River, during the Shang Dynasty (1600\u20131046 BC). These gardens were large enclosed parks where the kings and nobles hunted game, or where fruit and vegetables were grown.\nEarly inscriptions from this period, carved on tortoise shells, have three Chinese characters for garden, you, pu and yuan. You was a royal garden where birds and animals were kept, while pu was a garden for plants. During the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC), yuan became the character for all gardens. The old character for yuan is a small picture of a garden; it is enclosed in a square which can represent a wall, and has symbols which can represent the plan of a structure, a small square which can represent a pond, and a symbol for a plantation or a pomegranate tree.A famous royal garden of the late Shang dynasty was the Terrace, Pond and Park of the Spirit (Lingtai, Lingzhao Lingyou) built by King Wenwang west of his capital city, Yin. The park was described in the Classic of Poetry this way:\n\nThe King makes his promenade in the Park of the Spirit,\nThe deer are kneeling on the grass, feeding their fawns,\nThe deer are beautiful and resplendent.\nThe immaculate cranes have plumes of a brilliant white.\nThe King makes his promenade to the Pond of the Spirit,\nThe water is full of fish, who wriggle.Another early royal garden was Shaqui, or the Dunes of Sand, built by the last Shang ruler, King Zhou (1075\u20131046 BC). It was composed of an earth terrace, or tai, which served as an observation platform in the center of a large square park. It was described in one of the early classics of Chinese literature, the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji).According to the Shiji, one of the most famous features of this garden was the Wine Pool and Meat Forest (\u9152\u6c60\u8089\u6797). A large pool, big enough for several small boats, was constructed on the palace grounds, with inner linings of polished oval shaped stones from the sea shores. The pool was then filled with wine. A small island was constructed in the middle of the pool, where trees were planted, which had skewers of roasted meat hanging from their branches. King Zhou and his friends and concubines drifted in their boats, drinking the wine with their hands and eating the roasted meat from the trees. Later Chinese philosophers and historians cited this garden as an example of decadence and bad taste.During the Spring and Autumn period (722\u2013481 BC), in 535 BC, the Terrace of Shanghua, with lavishly decorated palaces, was built by King Jing of the Zhou dynasty. In 505 BC, an even more elaborate garden, the Terrace of Gusu, was begun. It was located on the side of a mountain, and included a series of terraces connected by galleries, along with a lake where boats in the form of blue dragons navigated. From the highest terrace, a view extended as far as Lake Tai, the Great Lake.\n\n\n=== The Legend of the Isle of the Immortals ===\n\nAn ancient Chinese legend played an important part in early garden design. In the 4th century BC, a tale in the Classic of Mountains and Seas described a peak called Mount Penglai located on one of three islands at the eastern end of the Bohai Sea, between China and Korea, which was the home of the Eight Immortals. On this island were palaces of gold and silver, with jewels on the trees. There was no pain, no winter, wine glasses and rice bowls were always full, and fruits, when eaten, granted eternal life.\nIn 221 BC, Ying Zheng, the King of Qin conquered other rival states and unified China under the Qin Empire, which he ruled until 210 BC. He heard the legend of the islands and sent emissaries to find the islands and bring back the elixir of immortal life, without success. At his palace near his capital, Xianyang, he created a garden with a large lake called Lanchi gong or the Lake of the Orchids. On an island in the lake he created a replica of Mount Penglai, symbolizing his search for paradise. After his death, the Qin Empire fell in 206 BC and his capital city and garden were completely destroyed, but the legend continued to inspire Chinese gardens. Many gardens have a group of islands or a single island with an artificial mountain representing the island of the Eight Immortals.\n\n\n=== Han dynasty (206 BC\u2013220 AD) ===\nUnder the Han dynasty (206 BC \u2013 220 AD), a new imperial capital was built at Chang'an, and Emperor Wu built a new imperial garden, which combined the features of botanical and zoological gardens, as well as the traditional hunting grounds.  Inspired by another version of Chinese classic about the Isles of the Immortals, called Liezi, he created a large artificial lake, the Lake of the Supreme Essence, with three artificial islands in the center representing the three isles of the Immortals. The park was later destroyed, but its memory would continue to inspire Chinese garden design for centuries.\nAnother notable garden of the Han period was the Garden of General Liang Ji built under Emperor Shun (125\u2013144 AD). Using a fortune amassed during his twenty years in the imperial court, Liang Ji build an immense landscape garden with artificial mountains, ravines and forests, filled with rare birds and domesticated wild animals. This was one of the first gardens that tried to create an idealized copy of nature.\n\n\n=== Gardens for poets and scholars (221\u2013618 AD) ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Han dynasty, a long period of political instability began in China. Buddhism was introduced into China by Emperor Ming (57\u201375 AD), and spread rapidly. By 495, the city of Luoyang, capital of the Northern Wei dynasty, had over 1,300 temples, mostly in the former residences of believers. Each of the temples had its own small garden.During this period, many former government officials left the court and built gardens where they could escape the outside world and concentrate on nature and literature. One example was the Jingu Yuan, or Garden of the Golden Valley, built by Shi Chong (249\u2013300 AD), an aristocrat and former court official, who in 296 completed a garden ten kilometers northeast of Luoyang. He invited thirty famous poets to a banquet in his garden, and wrote about the event himself:\n\nI have a country house at the torrent of the Golden Valley...where there is a spring of pure water, a luxuriant woods,  fruit trees, bambo, cypress, and medicinal plants. There are fields, two hundred sheep, chickens, pigs, geese and ducks...There is also a water mill, a fish pond, caves, and everything to distract the look and please the heart....With my literary friends, we took walks day and night, feasted, climbed a mountain to view the scenery, and sat by the side of the stream.\nThis visit to the garden resulted in a famous collection of poems, Jingu Shi, or Poems of the Golden Valley, and launched a long tradition of writing poetry in and about gardens.The poet and calligrapher Wang Xizhi (307\u2013365) wrote in his excellent calligraphy the Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion introducing a book recording the event of the Orchid Pavilion Gathering, another famous poetry setting at a country retreat called the \"Orchid Pavilion\". This was a park with a meandering stream. He brought together a group of famous poets, and seated them beside the stream. Then he placed cups of wine in the stream, and let them float. If the cup stopped beside one of the poets, he was obliged to drink it and then compose a poem. The garden of the floating cup (liubei tang), with small pavilions and artificial winding streams, became extremely popular in both imperial and private gardens.The Orchid Pavilion inspired Emperor Yang (604\u2013617) of the Sui dynasty to build his new imperial garden, the Garden of the West, near Hangzhou. His garden had a meandering stream for floating glasses of wine and pavilions for writing poetry. He also used the park for theatrical events; he launched small boats on his stream with animated figures illustrating the history of China.\n\n\n=== Tang dynasty (618\u2013907), First Golden Age of the Classical Garden ===\nThe Tang dynasty (618\u2013907 AD) was considered the first golden age of the classical Chinese garden. Emperor Xuanzong built a magnificent imperial garden, the Garden of the Majestic Clear Lake, near Xi\u2032an, and lived there with his famous concubine, Consort Yang.Painting and poetry reached a level never seen before, and new gardens, large and small, filled the capital city, Chang'an. The new gardens, were inspired by classical legends and poems. There were shanchi yuan,  gardens with artificial mountains and ponds, inspired by the legend of the isles of immortals, and shanting yuan, gardens with replicas of mountains and small viewing houses, or pavilions. Even ordinary residences had tiny gardens in their courtyards, with terracotta mountains and small ponds.These Chinese classical gardens, or scholar's gardens (wenren yuan), were inspired by, and in turn inspired, classical Chinese poetry and painting. A notable example was the Jante Valley Garden of the poet-painter and civil servant Wang Wei (701\u2013761). He bought the ruined villa of a poet, located near the mouth of a river and a lake. He created twenty small landscape scenes within his garden, with names such as the Garden of Magnolias, the Waving Willows, the Kiosk in the Heart of the Bamboos, the Spring of the Golden Powder, and the View-House beside the Lake. He wrote a poem for each scene in the garden and commissioned a famous artist, to paint scenes of the garden on the walls of his villa. After retiring from the government, he passed his time taking boat trips on the lake, playing the cithare and writing and reciting poetry.During the Tang dynasty, plant cultivation was developed to an advanced level, with many plant species being grown by means of plant introduction, domestication, transplantation, and grafting. The aesthetic properties of plants were highlighted, while numerous books on plant classification and cultivation were published. The capital, Chang'an, was a very cosmopolitan city, filled with diplomats, merchants, pilgrims, monks and students, who carried descriptions of the gardens all over Asia. The economic prosperity of the Tang dynasty led to the increasing construction of classical gardens across all of China.\nThe last great garden of the Tang dynasty was the Hamlet of the Mountain of the Serene Spring (Pingquan Shanzhuang), built east of the city of Luoyang by Li Deyu, Grand Minister of the Tang Empire. The garden was vast, with over a hundred pavilions and structures, but it was most famous for its collection of exotic-shaped rocks and plants, which he collected all over China. Rocks of unusual shapes, known as Chinese Scholars' Rocks, often selected to portray the part of a mountain or mountain range in a garden scene, gradually became an essential feature of the Chinese garden.\n\n\n=== Song Dynasty (960\u20131279) ===\n\nThere were two periods of the Song dynasty, northern and southern, and both were known for the construction of famous gardens. Emperor Huizong (1082\u20131135) was an accomplished painter of birds and flowers. A scholar himself, he integrated elements of the scholar garden into his grand imperial garden. His first garden, called The Basin of the Clarity of Gold, was an artificial lake surrounded by terraces and pavilions. The public was invited into the garden in the spring for boat races and spectacles on the lake. In 1117 he personally supervised the building of a new garden. He had exotic plants and picturesque rocks brought from around China for his garden, particularly the prized rocks from Lake Tai. Some of the rocks were so large that, in order to move them by water on the grand canal, he had to destroy all the bridges between Hangzhou and Beijing. In the center of his garden he had constructed an artificial mountain a hundred meters high, with cliffs and ravines, which he named Genyue, or \"The Mountain of Stability.\"  The garden was finished in 1122. In 1127, Emperor Huizong was forced to flee from the Song capital, Kaifeng, when it came under attack by the armies of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. When he returned (as a captive of the Jurchens), he found his garden completely destroyed, all the pavilions burned and the art works looted. Only the mountain remained.\n\nWhile the imperial gardens were the best known, many smaller but equally picturesque gardens were built in cities such as Luoyang. The Garden of the Monastery of the Celestial Rulers in Luoyang was famous for its peonies; the entire city came when they were in bloom. The Garden of Multiple Springtimes was famous for its view of the mountains. The most famous garden in Luoyang was The Garden of Solitary Joy (Dule Yuan), built by the poet and historian Sima Guang (1021\u20131086). His garden had an area of eight mu, or about 1.5 hectares. In the center was the Pavilion of Study, his library, with five thousand volumes. To the north was an artificial lake, with a small island, with a picturesque fisherman's hut. To the east was a garden of medicinal herbs, and to the west was an artificial mountain, with a belevedere at the summit to view the surrounding neighborhoods. Any passer-by could visit the garden by paying a small fee.\n\nAfter fall of Kaifeng, the capital of the Song dynasty was moved to Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou, Zhejiang). The city of Lin'an soon had more than fifty gardens built on the shore of the Western Lake. The other city in the province famous for its gardens was Suzhou, where many scholars, government officials and merchants built residences with gardens. Some of these gardens still exist today, though most been much altered over the centuries.\nThe oldest Suzhou garden that can be seen today is the Blue Wave Pavilion, built in 1044 by the Song dynasty poet Su Shunqing. (1008\u20131048). In the Song dynasty, it consisted of a hilltop viewing pavilion. Other lakeside pavilions were added, including a reverence hall, a recitation hall, and a special pavilion for watching the fish. Over the centuries it was much modified, but still keeps its essential plan.\nAnother Song dynasty garden still in existence is the Master of the Nets Garden in Suzhou. It was created in 1141 by Shi Zhengzhi, Deputy Civil Service Minister of the Southern Song government. It had his library, the Hall of Ten Thousand Volumes, and an adjacent garden called the Fisherman's Retreat. It was extensively remodeled between 1736 and 1796, but it remains one of the best example of a Song Dynasty Scholars Garden.In the city of Wuxi, on the edge of Lake Tai and at the foot of two mountains, there were thirty four gardens recorded by the Song dynasty historian Zhou Mi (1232\u20131308). The two most famous gardens, the Garden of the North (Beiyuan) and the Garden of the South (Nanyuan), both belonged to Shen Dehe, Grand Minister to Emperor Gaozong (1131\u20131162).  The Garden of the South was a classic mountain-and-lake (shanshui) garden; it had a lake with an Island of Immortality (Penglai dao), on which were three great boulders from Taihu. The Garden of the South was a water garden, with five large lakes connected to Lake Tai. A terrace gave visitors a view of the lake and the mountains.\n\n\n=== Yuan dynasty (1279\u20131368) ===\n\nIn 1271, Kublai Khan established the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty in China. By 1279, he annihilated the last resistance of the Song dynasty and unified China under Mongol rule. He established a new capital on the site of present-day Beijing, called Dadu, the Great Capital.\nThe most famous garden of the Yuan dynasty was Kublai Khan's summer palace and garden at Xanadu. The Venetian traveler Marco Polo is believed to have visited Xanadu in about 1275, and described the garden this way:\n\n\"Round this Palace a wall is built, inclosing a compass of 16 miles, and\ninside the Park there are fountains and rivers and brooks, and beautiful\nmeadows, with all kinds of wild animals (excluding such as are of\nferocious nature), which the Emperor has procured and placed there to\nsupply food for his gerfalcons and hawks, which he keeps there in mew. Of\nthese there are more than 200 gerfalcons alone, without reckoning the\nother hawks. The Khan himself goes every week to see his birds sitting in\nmew, and sometimes he rides through the park with a leopard behind him on\nhis horse's croup; and then if he sees any animal that takes his fancy, he\nslips his leopard at it, and the game when taken is made over to\n\nfeed the hawks in mew. This he does for diversion.\"\nThis brief description later inspired the poem Kubla Khan by the English romantic poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\nWhen he established his new capital at Dadu, Kublai Khan enlarged the artificial lakes that had been created a century earlier by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, and built up the island of Oinghua, creating a striking contrast between curving banks of the lake and garden and the strict geometry of what later became the Forbidden City of Beijing. This contrast is still visible today.Despite the Mongol invasion, the classical Chinese scholar's garden continued to flourish in other parts of China. An excellent example was the Lion Grove Garden in Suzhou. It was built in 1342, and took its name from the collection of fantastic and grotesque assemblies of rocks, taken from Lake Tai. Some of them were said to look like the heads of lions. The Kangxi and Qianlong emperors of the Qing dynasty each visited the garden several times, and used it as model for their own summer garden, the Garden of Perfect Splendor, at the Chengde Mountain Resort.In 1368, forces of the Ming dynasty, led by Zhu Yuanzhang, captured Dadu from the Mongols and overthrew the Yuan dynasty. Zhu Yuanzhang ordered the Yuan palaces in Dadu to be burned down.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ===\n\nThe most famous existing garden from the Ming dynasty is the Humble Administrator's Garden in Suzhou. It was built during the reign of the Zhengde Emperor (1506\u20131521) by Wang Xianchen, a minor government administrator who retired from government service and devoted himself to his garden. The garden has been much altered since it was built, but the central part has survived; a large pond full of lotus blossoms, surrounded by structures and pavilions designed as viewpoints of the lake and gardens. The park has an island, the Fragrant Isle, shaped like a boat. It also makes good use of the principle of the \"borrowed view,\" (jiejing) carefully framing views of the surrounding mountains and a famous view of a distant pagoda.Another existing garden from the Ming dynasty is the Lingering Garden, also in Suzhou, built during the reign of the Wanli Emperor (1573\u20131620). During the Qing dynasty, twelve tall limestone rocks were added to the garden, symbolizing mountains. The most famous was a picturesque rock called the Auspicious Cloud-Capped Peak, which became a centerpiece of the garden.A third renowned Ming era garden in Suzhou is the Garden of Cultivation, built during the reign of the Tianqi Emperor (1621\u201327) by the grandson of Wen Zhengming, a famous Ming painter and calligrapher. The garden is built around a pond, with the Longevity Pavilion on the north side, the Fry Pavilion on the east side, a dramatic rock garden on the south, and the creator's study, the Humble House, to the west.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912) ===\n\nThe Qing dynasty was the last dynasty of China. The most famous gardens in China during this period were the Summer Palace and the Old Summer Palace in Beijing. Both gardens became symbols of luxury and refinement, and were widely described by European visitors.\nFather Attiret, a French Jesuit who became court painter for the Qianlong Emperor from 1738 to 1768, described the Jade Terrace of the Isle of Immortality in the Lake of the Summer Palace:\n\n\"That which is a true jewel is a rock or island...which is in the middle of this lake, on which is built a small palace, which contains one hundred rooms or salons...of a beauty and a taste which I am not able to express to you. The view is admirable...\nTheir construction and improvement consumed a large part of the imperial treasury. Empress Dowager Cixi famously diverted money intended for the modernization of the Beiyang Fleet and used it to restore the Summer Palace and the marble teahouse in the shape of boat on Lake Kunming. Both the Summer Palace and Old Summer Palace were destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion and by punitive expeditions of European armies during the nineteenth century, but are now gradually being restored.\nIn addition to the Old Summer Palace and Summer Palace, between 1703 and 1792 the Qing emperors built a new complex of gardens and palaces in the mountains 200 kilometers northeast of Beijing, to escape the summer heat of the capital. It was called the Chengde Mountain Resort, and it occupied 560 hectares, with seventy-two separate landscape views, recreating landscapes in miniature from many different parts of China.  This enormous garden has survived relatively intact.\nRenowned scholar gardens which still exist from this period include the Couple's Retreat Garden (1723\u20131736) and the Retreat & Reflection Garden (1885), both in Suzhou.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Design of the classical garden ==\nA Chinese garden was not meant to be seen all at once; the plan of a classical Chinese garden presented the visitor with a series of perfectly composed and framed glimpses of scenery; a view of a pond, or of a rock, or a grove of bamboo, a blossoming tree, or a view of a distant mountain peak or a pagoda. The 16th-century Chinese writer and philosopher Ji Cheng instructed garden builders to \"hide the vulgar and the common as far as the eye can see, and include the excellent and the splendid.\"\n\nSome early Western visitors to the imperial Chinese gardens felt they were chaotic, crowded with buildings in different styles, without any seeming order. But the Jesuit priest Jean Denis Attiret, who lived in China from 1739 and was a court painter for the Qianlong Emperor, observed there was a \"beautiful disorder, an anti-symmetry\" in the Chinese garden. \"One admires the art with which this irregularity is carried out. Everything is in good taste, and so well arranged, that there is not a single view from which all the beauty can be seen;  you have to see it piece by piece.\"Chinese classical gardens varied greatly in size. The largest garden in Suzhou, the Humble Administrator's Garden, was a little over ten hectares in area, with one fifth of the garden occupied by the pond.  But they did not have to be large. Ji Cheng built a garden for Wu Youyu, the Treasurer of Jinling, that was just under one hectare in size, and the tour of the garden was only four hundred steps long from the entrance to the last viewing point, but Wu Youyu said it contained all the marvels of the province in a single place.The classical garden was surrounded by a wall, usually painted white, which served as a pure backdrop for the flowers and trees. A pond of water was usually located in the center. Many structures, large and small, were arranged around the pond. In the garden described by Ji Cheng above, the structures occupied two-thirds of the hectare, while the garden itself occupied the other third. In a scholar garden the central building was usually a library or study, connected by galleries with other pavilions which served as observation points of the garden features. These structures also helped divide the garden into individual scenes or landscapes. The other essential elements of a scholar garden were plants, trees, and rocks, all carefully composed into small perfect landscapes. Scholar gardens also often used what was called \"borrowed\" scenery (\u501f\u666f jiejing) ; where unexpected views of scenery outside the garden, such as mountain peaks, seemed to be an extension of the garden itself.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nChinese gardens are filled with architecture; halls, pavilions, temples, galleries, bridges, kiosks, and towers, occupying a large part of the space. The Humble Administrator's Garden in Suzhou has forty-eight structures, including a residence, several halls for family gatherings and entertainment, eighteen pavilions for viewing different features of the garden, and an assortment of towers, galleries, and bridges, all designed for seeing different parts of the gardens from different points of view. The garden structures are not designed to dominate the landscape, but to be in harmony with it.\nClassical gardens traditionally have these structures:\n\nThe ceremony hall  (ting), or \u201croom\u201d. A building used for family celebrations or ceremonies, usually with an interior courtyard, not far from the entrance gate.\nThe principal pavilion (da ting), or \u201clarge room\u201d, for the reception of guests, for banquets and for celebrating holidays, such as New Years and the Festival of Lanterns. It often has a veranda around the building to provide cool and shade.\nThe pavilion of flowers (hua ting), or \u201cflower room\u201d. Located near the residence, this building has a rear courtyard filled with flowers, plants, and a small rock garden.\nThe pavilion facing the four directions (si mian ting), or \u201cfour doors room\u201d. This building has folding or movable walls, for opening up a panoramic view of the garden.\nThe lotus pavilion (he hua ting), or \u201clotus room\u201d. Built next to a lotus pond, to see the flowers bloom and appreciate their aroma.\nThe pavilion of mandarin ducks (yuan yang ting), or \u201cmandarin ducks room\u201d. This building is divided into two sections;  one facing north used in summer, facing a lotus pond which provided cool air; and the southern part used in winter, with a courtyard planted with pine trees, which remained evergreen, and plum trees, whose blossoms announced the arrival of spring.In addition to these larger halls and pavilions, the garden is filled with smaller pavilions, (also called ting),or \u201croom\u201d, which are designed for providing shelter from the sun or rain, for contemplating a scene, reciting a poem, taking advantage of a breeze, or simply resting. Pavilions might be located where the dawn can best be watched, where the moonlight shines on the water, where autumn foliage is best seen, where the rain can best be heard on the banana leaves, or where the wind whistles through the bamboo stalks. They are sometimes attached to the wall of another building or sometimes stood by themselves at view points of the garden, by a pond or at the top of a hill. They often are open on three sides.\nThe names of the pavilions in Chinese gardens express the view or experience they offer the visitor:\n\nThe Peak-Worshipping Pavilion (The Lingering Garden) in Suzhou China\nThe Hall of Distant Fragrances (Humble Administrator's Garden) in Suzhou China\nThe Mountain View Tower (Humble Administrator's Garden) inn Suzhou China\nPavilion of the Moon and Wind (Master of the Nets Garden) in Suzhou China\nPavilion in the Lotus Breeze (Humble Administrator's Garden) in Suzhou China\nListening to the Rain Pavilion (Humble Administrator's Garden) in Suzhou China\nWatching the Pines and Appreciating Paintings Hall (Humble Administrator's Garden) in Suzhou China\nSpot of Return for Reading (Lingering Garden) in Suzhou China\nBetween the Mountains and the Water Pavilion (The Couple's Retreat Garden) in Suzhou China\nPavilion Leaning on the Jade (Humble Administrator's Garden) in Suzhou China\nSoft Rain Brings Coolness Terrace (Retreat & Reflection Garden) in Suzhou China\nLasting Spring and Moon Viewing Tower (Retreat & Reflection Garden) in Suzhou ChinaGardens also often feature two-story towers (lou or ge), usually at the edge of the garden, with a lower story made of stone and a whitewashed upper story, two-thirds the height of the ground floor, which provided a view from above of certain parts of the garden or the distant scenery.\nSome gardens have a picturesque stone pavilion in the form of a boat, located in the pond. (called an xie, fang, or shifang). These generally had three parts; a kiosk with winged gables at the front, a more intimate hall in the center, and a two-story structure with a panoramic view of the pond at the rear.\n\nCourtyards (yuan). Gardens contain small enclosed court courtyards,  offering quiet and solitude for meditation, painting, drinking tea, or playing on the cithare.Galleries (lang) are narrow covered corridors which connect the buildings, protect the visitors from the rain and sun, and also help divide the garden into different sections. These galleries are rarely straight; they zigzag or are serpentine, following the wall of the garden, the edge of the pond, or climbing the hill of the rock garden. They have small windows, sometimes round or in odd geometric shapes, to give glimpses of the garden or scenery to those passing through.\nWindows and doors are an important architectural feature of the Chinese garden. Sometimes they are round (moon windows or a moon gate) or oval, hexagonal or octagonal, or in the shape of a vase or a piece of fruit. Sometimes they have highly ornamental ceramic frames. The window may carefully frame a branch of a pine tree, or a plum tree in blossom, or another intimate garden scene.Bridges are another common feature of the Chinese garden. Like the galleries, they are rarely straight, but zigzag (called the Nine-turn bridges) or arch over the ponds, suggesting the bridges of rural China, and providing view points of the garden. Bridges are often built from rough timber or stone-slab raised pathways. Some gardens have brightly painted or lacquered bridges, which give a lighthearted feeling to the garden.Gardens also often include small, austere houses for solitude and meditation, sometimes in the form of rustic fishing huts, and isolated buildings which serve as libraries or studios (shufang).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Artificial mountains and rock gardens ===\n\nThe artificial mountain (jiashan) or rock garden is an integral element of Chinese classical gardens. The mountain peak was a symbol of virtue, stability and endurance in Confucian philosophy and in the I Ching.  A mountain peak on an island was also a central part of the legend of the Isles of the Immortals, and thus became a central element in many classical gardens.\nThe first rock garden appeared in Chinese garden history in Tu Yuan (literally \"Rabbit Garden\"), built during the Western Han dynasty (206 BCE \u2013 9 CE). During the Tang dynasty, the rock was elevated to the status of an art object, judged by its form (xing), substance  (zhi), color (se), and texture (wen), as well as by its softness, transparency, and other factors. The poet Bo Juyi (772\u2013846) wrote a catalog of the famous rocks of Lake Tai, called Taihu Shiji. These rocks, of limestone sculpted by erosion, became the most highly prized for gardens.\nDuring the Song dynasty, the artificial mountains were made mostly of earth. But Emperor Huizong (1100\u20131125) nearly ruined the economy of the Song Empire by destroying the bridges of the Grand Canal so he could carry huge rocks by barge to his imperial garden. During the Ming dynasty, the use of piles of rocks to create artificial mountains and grottos reached its peak. During the Qing dynasty, the Ming rock gardens were considered too artificial and the new mountains were composed of both rocks and earth.The artificial mountain in Chinese gardens today usually has a small view pavilion at the summit. In smaller classical gardens, a single scholar rock represents a mountain, or a row of rocks represents a mountain range.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Water ===\n\nA pond or lake is the central element of a Chinese garden. The main buildings are usually placed beside it, and pavilions surround the lake to see it from different points of view. The garden usually has a pond for lotus flowers, with a special pavilion for viewing them. There are usually goldfish in the pond, with pavilions over the water for viewing them.\nThe lake or pond has an important symbolic role in the garden. In the I Ching, water represents lightness and communication, and carried the food of life on its journey through the valleys and plains. It also is the complement to the mountain, the other central element of the garden, and represents dreams and the infinity of spaces. The shape of the garden pond often hides the edges of the pond from viewers on the other side, giving the illusion that the pond goes on to infinity. The softness of the water contrasts with the solidity of the rocks. The water reflects the sky, and therefore is constantly changing, but even a gentle wind can soften or erase the reflections.The lakes and waterside pavilions in Chinese gardens were also influenced by another classic of Chinese literature, the Shishuo Xinyu by Liu Yiqing (403\u2013444), who described the promenades of the Emperor Jianwen of Jin along the banks of the Hao and the Pu River, in the Garden of the Splendid Forest (Hualin yuan). Many gardens, particularly in the gardens of Jiangnan and the imperial gardens of northern China, have features and names taken from this work.Small gardens have a single lake, with a rock garden, plants and structures around its edge. Middle-sized gardens will have a single lake with one or more streams coming into the lake, with bridges crossing the streams, or a single long lake divided into two bodies of water by a narrow channel crossed by a bridge. In a very large garden like the Humble Administrator's Garden, the principal feature of the garden is the large lake with its symbolic islands, symbolizing the isles of the immortals. Streams come into the lake, forming additional scenes. Numerous structures give different views of the water, including a stone boat, a covered bridge, and several pavilions by the side of or over the water.\nSome gardens created the impression of lakes by places smooth areas of white sand, bordered by rocks, in courtyards. In the moonlight these looked like real lakes. This style of 'dry garden' was later imported into Japan and transformed into the zen garden.\nThe streams in the Chinese garden always follow a winding course, and are hidden from time to time by rocks or vegetation. A French Jesuit missionary, Father Attiret, who was a painter in the service of the Qianlong Emperor from 1738 to 1768, described one garden he saw:\n\n\"The canals are not like those in our country bordered with finely cut stone, but very rustic and lined with pieces or rock, some coming forward, some retreating. which are placed so artistically that you would think it was a work of nature.\"\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Flowers and trees ===\n\nFlowers and trees, along with water, rocks and architecture, are the fourth essential element of the Chinese garden. They represent nature in its most vivid form, and contrast with the straight lines of the architecture and the permanence, sharp edges and immobility of the rocks. They change continually with the seasons, and provide both sounds (the sound of rain on banana leaves or the wind in the bamboo)  and aromas to please the visitor.\nEach flower and tree in the garden had its own symbolic meaning. The pine, bamboo and Chinese plum (Prunus mume) were considered the \"Three Friends of Winter\" (\u6b72\u5bd2\u4e09\u53cb) by the scholars who created classical gardens, prized for remaining green or blooming in winter. They were often painted together by artists like Zhao Mengjian (1199\u20131264). For scholars, the pine was the emblem of longevity and tenacity, as well as constance in friendship. The bamboo, a hollow straw, represented a wise man, modest and seeking knowledge, and was also noted for being flexible in a storm without breaking. Plum trees were revered as the symbol of rebirth after the winter and the arrival of spring. During the Song dynasty, the favorite tree was the winter plum tree, appreciated for its early pink and white blossoms and sweet aroma.The peach tree in the Chinese garden symbolized longevity and immortality. Peaches were associated with the classic story The Orchard of Xi Wangmu, the Queen Mother of the West. This story said that in Xi Wangmu's legendary orchard, peach trees flowered only after three thousand years, did not produce fruit for another three thousand years, and did not ripen for another three thousand years. Those who ate these peaches became immortal. This legendary orchard was pictured in many Chinese paintings, and inspired many garden scenes. Pear trees were the symbol of justice and wisdom.  The word 'pear' was also a homophone for 'quit' or separate,' and it was considered bad luck to cut a pear, for it would lead to the breakup of a friendship or romance. The pear tree could also symbolize a long friendship or romance, since the tree lived a long time.\nThe apricot tree symbolized the way of the mandarin, or the government official. During the Tang dynasty, those who passed the imperial examination were rewarded with the banquet in the garden of the apricot trees, or Xingyuan.\nThe fruit of the pomegranate tree was offered to young couples so they would have male children and numerous descendants. The willow tree represented the friendship and the pleasures of life. Guests were offered willow branches as a symbol of friendship.Of the flowers in the Chinese garden, the most appreciated were the orchid, peony, and lotus (Nelumbo nucifera). During the Tang dynasty, the peony, the symbol of opulence and a flower with a delicate fragrance, was the most celebrated flower in the garden. The poet Zhou Dunyi wrote a famous elegy to the lotus, comparing it to a junzi, a man who possessed integrity and balance. The orchid was the symbol of nobility, and of impossible love, as in the Chinese expression \"a faraway orchid in a lonely valley.\" The lotus was admired for its purity, and its efforts to reach out of the water to flower in the air made it a symbol of the search for knowledge. The chrysanthemum was elegized the poet Tao Yuanming, who surrounded his hermit's hut with the flower, and wrote a famous verse:\n\n\"At the feet of the Eastern fence, I pick a chrysanthemum,\nIn the distance, detached and serene, I see the Mountains of the South.\"\nThe creators of the Chinese garden were careful to preserve the natural appearance of the landscape. Trimming and root pruning, if done at all, tried to preserve the natural form. Dwarf trees that were gnarled and ancient-looking were particularly prized in the miniature landscapes of Chinese gardens.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== \"Borrowing scenery\", time and seasons ===\nAccording to Ji Cheng's 16th century book Yuanye, \"The Craft of Gardens,\" \"borrowing scenery\" (jiejing) was the most important thing of a garden. This could mean using scenes outside the garden, such as a view of distant mountains or the trees in the neighboring garden, to create the illusion that garden was much bigger than it was. The most famous example was the mist-shrouded view of the North Temple Pagoda in Suzhou, seen in the distance over the pond of the Humble Administrator's Garden.\nBut, as Ji Cheng wrote, it could also be \"the immaculate ribbon of a stream, animals, birds, fish, or other natural elements (rain, wind, snow), or something less tangible, such as a moonbeam, a reflection in a lake, morning mist, or the red sky of a sunset.\" It could also be a sound; he recommended locating a pavilion near a temple, so that the chanted prayers could be heard; planting fragrant flowers next to paths and pavilions, so visitors would appreciate their aromas; that bird perches be created to encourage birds to come to sing in the garden, that streams be designed to make pleasant sounds, and that banana trees be planted in courtyards so the rain would patter on their leaves. \"A judicious 'borrowing' does not have a reason.\" Ji Cheng wrote. \"It is born simply of feeling created by the beauty of a scene.\"The season and the time of day were also important elements. Garden designers took into account the scenes of the garden that would look best in winter, summer, spring and autumn, and those best viewed at night, in the morning or afternoon. Ji Cheng wrote: \"In the heart of the tumult of the city, you should choose visions that are serene and refined: from a raised clearing, you look to the distant horizon, surrounded by mountains like a screen; in an open pavilion, a gentle and light breeze invades the room; from the front door, the running water of spring flows toward the marsh.\"Actually borrowing scenery is the conclusive, last chapter of Yuanye that explains borrowing scenery as a holistic understanding of the essence of landscape design in its entirety. The ever-changing moods and appearances of nature in a given landscape in full action are understood by the author as an independent function that becomes an agent for garden making. It is nature including the garden maker that creates.\n\n\n=== Concealment and surprise ===\nAnother important garden element was concealment and surprise. The garden was not meant to be seen all at once, it was laid out to present a series of scenes. Visitors moved from scene to scene either within enclosed galleries or by winding paths which concealed the scenes until the last moment. The scenes would suddenly appear at the turn of a path, through a window, or hidden behind a screen of bamboo. They might be revealed through round \"moon doors\" or through windows of unusual shapes, or windows with elaborate lattices that broke the view into pieces.\n\n\n== In art and literature ==\n\nThe garden plays an important part in Chinese art and literature, and at the same time art and literature have inspired many gardens. The school of painting called \"Shanshui\" (literally 'mountains and water' and with the actual meaning of 'landscape'), which began in the 5th century, established the principles of Chinese landscape painting, which were very similar to those of Chinese gardening. These paintings were not meant to be realistic; they were meant to portray what the artist felt, rather than what he saw.\nThe landscape painter Shitao (1641\u20131720) wrote that he wanted to \"'...create a landscape which was not spoiled by any vulgar banality...\"  He wanted to create a sense of vertigo in the viewer: \"to express a universe inaccessible to man, without any route that led there, like the isles of Bohai, Penglan and Fanghu, where only the immortals can live, and which a man cannot imagine. That is the vertigo that exists in the natural universe. To express it in painting, you must show jagged peaks, precipices, hanging bridges, great chasms. For the effect to be truly marvelous, it must be done purely by the force of the brush.\" This was the emotion that garden designers wanted to create with their scholar rocks and miniature mountain ranges.In his book, Craft of Gardens, the garden designer Ji Cheng wrote: \"The spirit and the charm of mountains and forests must be studied in depth; ...only the knowledge of the real permits the creation of the artificial, so that the work created possesses the spirit of the real, in part because of divine inspiration, but especially because of human effort.\" He described the effect he wanted to achieve in the design of an autumn garden scene: \"The feelings are in harmony with the purity, with the sense of withdrawal. The spirit rejoices at the mountains and ravines. Suddenly the spirit, detached from the world of small things, is animated and seems to penetrate to the interior of a painting, and to promenade there...\"In literature, gardens were frequently the subject of the genre of poetry called \"Tianyuan\", literally 'fields and gardens,' which reached its peak in the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) with such poets as Wang Wei (701\u2013761). The names of the Surging Waves Garden and the Garden of Meditation in Suzhou are taken from lines of Chinese poetry. Within the gardens, the individual pavilions and view points were frequently dedicated to verses of poems, inscribed on stones or plaques. The Moon Comes with the Breeze Pavilion at the Couple's Retreat Garden, used for moon-viewing, has the inscription of a verse by Han Yu:\n\n\"The twilight brings the Autumn\nAnd the wind brings the moon here.\"And the Peony Hall in the Couple's Retreat Garden is dedicated to a verse by Li Bai:\n\n\"The spring breeze is gently stroking the balustrade\nand the peony is wet with dew.\"Wang Wei (701\u2013761) was a poet, painter and Buddhist monk, who worked first as a court official before retiring to Lantian, where he built one of the first wenren yuan, or scholar's gardens, called the Valley of the Jante. In this garden, a series of twenty scenes, like the paintings of a scroll or album, unrolled before the viewer, each illustrated by a verse of poetry.  For example, one scene illustrated this poem:\n\n\"The white rock emerges from the torrent;\nThe cold sky with red leaves scattering:\nOn the mountain path, the rain is fleeing,\nthe blue of the emptiness dampens our clothes.\"The Valley of the Jante garden disappeared, but its memory, preserved in paintings and poems, inspired many other scholar's gardens.The social and cultural importance of the garden is illustrated in the classical novel Dream of the Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin which unfolds almost exclusively in a garden.\n\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\nThe Chinese classical garden had multiple functions. It could be used for banquets, celebrations, reunions, or romance. It could be used to find solitude and for contemplation. It was a calm place for painting, poetry, calligraphy, and music, and for studying classic texts. It was a place for drinking tea and for poets to become happily drunk on wine. It was a showcase to display the cultivation and aesthetic taste of the owner. But it also had a philosophical message.\nTaoism had a strong influence on the classical garden. After the Han dynasty (206 BC \u2013 220 AD), gardens were frequently constructed as retreats for government officials who had lost their posts or who wanted to escape the pressures and corruption of court life in the capital. They chose to pursue the Taoist ideals of disengagement from worldly concerns.For followers of Taoism, enlightenment could be reached by contemplation of the unity of creation, in which order and harmony are inherent to the natural world.The gardens were intended to evoke the idyllic feeling of wandering through a natural landscape, to feel closer to the ancient way of life, and to appreciate the harmony between man and nature.In Taoism, rocks and water were opposites, yin and yang, but they complemented and completed one another. Rocks were solid but water could wear away rock. The deeply eroded rocks from Lake Tai used in the classical garden illustrated this principle.\nBorrowing scenery is a most fundamental idea in Ming period garden making theory (see above).\nThe winding paths and zig-zag galleries bridges that led visitors from one garden scene to another also had a message. They illustrated a Chinese proverb, \"By detours, access to secrets\".According to the landscape historian and architect Che Bing Chiu, every garden was  \"a quest for paradise. of a lost world, of a utopian universe. The scholar's garden participated in this quest; on the one hand the quest for the home of the Immortals, on the other hand the search for the world of the golden age so dear to the heart of the scholar.\"A more recent view of the philosophy of the garden was expressed by Zhou Ganzhi, the President of the Chinese Society of Landscape Architecture, and Academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, in 2007: \"Chinese classical gardens are a perfect integration of nature and work by man. They are an imitation of nature, and fully manifest the beauty of nature.  They can also be seen as an improvement on nature; one from which the light of human artistic genius shines.\"\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\n\n=== Chinese influence on the Japanese garden ===\nThe Chinese classical garden had a notable influence on the early Japanese garden. The influence of China first reached Japan through Korea before 600 AD. In 607 AD, the Japanese crown prince Shotoku sent a diplomatic mission to the Chinese court, which began a cultural exchange lasting for centuries. Hundreds of Japanese scholars were sent to study the Chinese language, political system, and culture. The Japanese Ambassador to China, Ono no Imoko, described the great landscape gardens of the Chinese Emperor to the Japanese court. His reports had a profound influence on the development of Japanese landscape design.During the Nara period (710-794), when the Japanese capital was located at Nara, and later at Heian, the Japanese court created large landscape gardens with lakes and pavilions on the Chinese model for aristocrats to promenade and to drift leisurely in small boats, and more intimate gardens for contemplation and religious meditation.A Japanese monk named Eisai (1141\u20131215) imported the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism from China to Japan, which led to the creation of a famous and unique Japanese gardening style, the Zen garden, exemplified by the garden of  Ry\u014dan-ji. He also brought green tea from China to Japan, originally to keep monks awake during long meditation, giving the basis for the Japanese tea ceremony, which became an important ritual in Japanese gardens.The Japanese garden designer Muso Soseki (1275\u20131351) created the celebrated Moss Garden (Kokedera) in Kyoto, which included a recreation of the Isles of Eight Immortals, called Horai in Japanese, which were an important feature of many Chinese gardens.   During the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333), and particularly during the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573) the Japanese garden became more austere than the Chinese garden, following its own aesthetic principles.\n\n\n=== In Europe ===\n\nThe first European to describe a Chinese garden was the Venetian merchant and traveler Marco Polo, who visited the summer palace of Kublai Khan at Xanadu. The garden of Kublai Khan had a later effect on European culture; In 1797, it inspired the romantic poem, Kubla Khan, by the English romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.Marco Polo also described the gardens of the imperial palace in Khanbaliq, the Mongol name for the city which eventually became Beijing. He described ramparts, balustrades and pavilions surrounding a deep lake full of fish and with swans and other aquatic birds; whose central feature was a manmade hill one hundred steps high and a thousand steps around, covered with evergreen trees and decorated with green azurite stones.The first Jesuit priest, Francis Xavier, arrived in China in 1552, and the priest Matteo Ricci received permission to settle in Beijing in 1601. Jesuit priests began sending accounts of Chinese culture and gardens to Europe. Louis Le Comte, the mathematician to the King of France, travelled to China in 1685. He described how the Chinese gardens had grottos, artificial hills and rocks piled to imitate nature, and did not arrange their gardens geometrically.In the 18th century, as Chinese vases and other decorative objects began to arrive in Europe, there was a surge of popularity for Chinoiserie. The painters Watteau and Fran\u00e7ois Boucher painted Chinese scenes as they imagined them, and Catherine the Great decorated a room in her palace in Chinese style. There was great interest in everything Chinese, including gardens.In 1738, the French Jesuit missionary and painter Jean Denis Attiret, went to China, where he became court painter to the Qianlong Emperor. He described in great detail what he saw in the imperial gardens near Beijing:\n\n\"One comes out of a valley, not by a straight wide alley as in Europe, but by zigzags, by roundabout paths, each one ornamented with small pavilions and grottos, and when you exit one valley you find yourself in another, different from the first in the form of the landscape or the style of the buildings. All the mountains and hills are covered with flowering trees, which are very common here. It is a true terrestrial paradise. The canals are not at all like ours- bordered with cut stone- they are rustic, with pieces of rock, some leaning forward, some backwards, placed with such art you would think they were natural. Sometimes a canal is wide, sometimes narrow. Here they twist, there they curve, as if they were really created by the hills and rocks. The edges are planted with flowers in rock gardens, which seem to have been created by nature. Each season has its own flowers. Aside from the canals, everywhere there are paths paved with small stones, which lead from one valley to the other. These paths also twist and turn, sometimes coming close to the canals, sometimes far away.\"\nAttiret wrote:\n\n\"Everything is truly great and beautiful, both as to the design and the execution: and [the gardens] struck me the more, because I had never seen any thing that bore any manner of resemblance to them, in any part of the world that I had been before.\"The Qianlong Emperor (1711\u20131799) was equally interested in what was going on in Europe. He commissioned the Jesuit priest Father Castiglione, who was trained in engineering, to build fountains for his garden similar to those he had heard about in the gardens at Versailles.\n\nChinese architecture and aesthetics also influenced the English garden. In 1685, the English diplomat and writer Sir William Temple wrote an essay Upon the garden of Epicurus (published in 1692), which contrasted European theories of symmetrical gardens with asymmetrical compositions from China. Temple had never visited China, but he had read the works of European travelers there. He noted that Chinese gardens avoided formal rows of trees and flower beds, and instead placed trees, plants, and other garden features in irregular ways to strike the eye and create beautiful compositions. His observations on the Chinese garden were cited by the essayist Joseph Addison in an essay in 1712, who used them to attack the English gardeners who, instead of imitating nature, tried to make their gardens in the French style, as far from nature as possible.The English landscape garden was already well-established in England in the first part of the 18th century, influenced by the travel to Italy by the British upper class and their desire to have a new style of garden to match the Palladian style of architecture they chose for their country houses, and by the romantic landscapes of Claude Lorraine and other painters, but the novelty and exoticism of Chinese art and architecture in Europe led in 1738 to the construction of the first Chinese house in an English garden, at Stowe House, alongside Roman temples, Gothic ruins and other architectural styles.\n\nThe style became even more popular thanks to William Chambers (1723\u20131796), who lived in China from 1745 to 1747, and wrote a book, The Drawings, buildings, furniture, habits, machines and untensils of the Chinese, published in 1757. He urged western garden designers to use Chinese stylistic conventions such as concealment, asymmetry, and naturalism. Later, in 1772, Chambers published his Dissertation on Oriental Gardening, a rather fanciful elaboration of contemporary ideas about the naturalistic style of gardening in China.Chambers was a fierce critic of Capability Brown, the leading designer of the English landscape garden, which Chambers considered boring. Chambers believed that gardens should be full of surprises. In 1761 he built a Chinese pagoda, house and garden in Kew Gardens, London, along with a mosque, a temple of the sun, a ruined arch, and Palladian bridge. Thanks to Chambers Chinese structures  began to appear in other English gardens, then in France and elsewhere on the continent. Carmontelle added a Chinese pavilion to his garden at Parc Monceau in Paris (1772), and the Duc de Choiseul built a pagoda on his estate at Chanteloup between 1775 and 1778. The Russian Empress Catherine the Great built her own pagoda in the garden of her palace of Tsarskoye Selo, near Saint Petersburg, between 1778 and 1786. Many continental critics disliked the term English Garden, so they began to use the term 'Anglo-Chinois\" to describe the style. By the end of the nineteenth century parks all over Europe had picturesque Chinese pagodas, pavilions or bridges, but there were few gardens that expressed the more subtle and profound aesthetics of the real Chinese garden.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nClassical Gardens of Suzhou\nJi Cheng\nList of Chinese gardens\nList of botanical gardens in China\nPear Garden\nPenjing\nWest Lake\nBorrowed scenery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nSuzhou Classical Gardens",

        "wiki": "Chinese architecture demonstrates an architectural style that developed over millennia in China, before spreading out to influence architecture all throughout East Asia. Since the solidification of the style in the early imperial period, the structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Starting with the Tang dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam, and a varying amount of influence on the architectural styles of Southeast and South Asia including Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and The Philippines.   \nChinese architecture is typified by various features; such as, bilateral symmetry, use of enclosed open spaces, the incorporation of ideas related to feng shui such as directional hierarchies, a horizontal emphasis, and the allusion to various cosmological, mythological, or other symbolism. Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type, ranging from pagodas to palaces. In part because of an emphasis on the use of wood, a relatively perishable material, and due to a de-emphasis on major monumental structures built of less-organic but more durable materials, much of the historical knowledge of Chinese architecture derives from surviving miniature models in ceramic and published planning diagrams and specifications. Some of the architecture of China shows the influence of other types or styles from outside of China, such as the influences on mosque structures originating in the Middle East. Although displaying certain unifying aspects, rather than being completely homogeneous, Chinese architecture has many types of variation based on status or affiliation, such as dependence on whether the structures were constructed for emperors, commoners, or used for religious purposes. Other variations in Chinese architecture are shown in the varying styles associated with different geographic regions and in ethnic architectural design.\n\nThe architecture of China is as old as Chinese civilization. From every source of information\u2014literary, graphic, exemplary\u2014there is strong evidence testifying to the fact that the Chinese have always enjoyed an indigenous system of construction that has retained its principal characteristics from prehistoric times to the present day. Over the vast area from Chinese Turkistan to Japan, from Manchuria to the northern half of French Indochina, the same system of construction is prevalent; and this was the area of Chinese cultural influence. That this system of construction could perpetuate itself for more than four thousand years over such a vast territory and still remain a living architecture, retaining its principal characteristics in spite of repeated foreign invasions\u2014military, intellectual, and spiritual\u2014is a phenomenon comparable only to the continuity of the civilization of which it is an integral part.\nThroughout the 20th century, Chinese architects have attempted to combine traditional Chinese designs into modern architecture (usually government), with great success. Moreover, the pressure for urban development throughout contemporary China required higher speed of construction and higher floor area ratio, which means that in the great cities the demand for traditional Chinese buildings, which are normally less than 3 levels, has declined in favor of modern architecture. However, the traditional skills of Chinese architecture, including major and minor carpentry, masonry, and stonemasonry, are still applied to the construction of vernacular architecture in the vast rural area in China.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Neolithic and early antiquity ===\n\nChinese civilizational cultures developed in the plains along the numerous rivers that emptied into the Bohai and Hongzhow bays. The most prominent of these rivers, the Yellow and the Yangtze, hosted a complex fabric of villages. The climate was warmer and more humid than today, allowing for millet to be grown in the north and rice in the south. There was, however, no single \"origin\" of the Chinese civilization. Instead, there was a gradual multinuclear development between the years 4000 and 2000 BC - from village communities to what anthropologists call cultures to small but well-organized states. 2 of the more important cultures were the Hongshan culture (4700-2900 BC) to the north of Bohai Bay in Inner Mongolia and Hebei Province and the contemporaneous  Yangshao culture (5000-3000 BC) in Henan Province. Between the 2, and developing later, was the Longshan culture (3000-2000 BC) in the central and lower Yellow River valley. These combined areas gave rise to thousands of small states and proto-states by 3000 BC. Some continued to share a common ritual center that linked the communities to a single symbolic order, but others developed along more independent lines. All was not peaceful, and the emergence of walled cities during this time is a clear indication that the political landscape was very much in flux.\nThe Hongshan culture of Inner Mongolia (located along the Laoha, Yingjin, and Daling rivers that empty into Bohai Bay) was scattered over a large area but had a single, common ritual center that consisted of at least 14 burial mounds and altars over several hill ridges. It dates from around 3500 BC but could have been founded ever earlier. Although there is no evidence of village settlements nearby, its size is much larger than one clan or village could support. In other words, though rituals would have been performed here for the elites, the large area implies that audiences for the ritual would have encompassed all the villages of the Hongshan. As a sacred landscape, the center might also have attracted supplicants from even further afield.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== Architectural bilateral symmetry ===\n\nA very important feature in Chinese architecture is its emphasis on articulation and bilateral symmetry, which signifies balance. Bilateral symmetry and the articulation of buildings are found everywhere in Chinese architecture, from palace complexes to humble farmhouses. When possible, plans for renovation and extension of a house will often try to maintain this symmetry provided that there is enough capital to do so. Secondary elements are positioned either side of main structures as two wings to maintain overall bilateral symmetry. The buildings are typically planned to contain an even number of columns in a structure to produce an odd number of bays (\u9593). With the inclusion of a main door to a building in the center bay, symmetry is maintained.\nIn contrast to the buildings,  the Chinese gardens tend to be asymmetrical. The principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow. The design of the classic Chinese garden is based on the ideology of \"Nature and Man in One\", as opposed to the home itself, which is a symbol of the human sphere co-existing with, but separate from nature. So, the arrangement is as flexible as possible to let people feel they are surrounded by and in harmony with nature. The two essential elements of the garden are hill stones and water. The hill stones mean the pursuit of immortality and water represents emptiness and existence. The mountain belongs to yang (static beauty) and the water belongs to yin (dynamic wonder). They depend on each other and complete the whole nature.\n\n\n=== Enclosure ===\nIn much of traditional Chinese architecture, buildings or building complexes take up an entire property but enclose open spaces within themselves. These enclosed spaces come in two forms, the:\nCourtyard (\u9662): The use of open courtyards is a common feature in many types of Chinese architectures. This is best exemplified in the Siheyuan, which has consisted of an empty space surrounded by buildings connected with one another either directly or through verandas.\n\"Sky well\" (\u5929\u4e95): Although large open courtyards are less commonly found in southern Chinese architecture, the concept of an \"open space\" surrounded by buildings, which is seen in northern courtyard complexes, can be seen in the southern building structure known as the \"sky well\". This structure is essentially a relatively enclosed courtyard formed from the intersections of closely spaced buildings and offer small opening to the sky through the roof space from the floor up.These enclosures serve in temperature regulation and in venting the building complexes. Northern courtyards are typically open and facing the south to allow the maximum exposure of the building windows and walls to the sun while keeping the cold northern winds out. Southern sky wells are relatively small and serves to collect rain water from the roof tops. They perform the same duties as the Roman impluvium while restricting the amount of sunlight that enters the building. Sky wells also serve as vents for rising hot air, which draws cool air from the lower stories of the house and allows for exchange of cool air with the outside.\n\n\n=== Hierarchy ===\n\nThe projected hierarchy and importance and uses of buildings in traditional Chinese architecture are based on the strict placement of buildings in a property/complex. Buildings with doors facing the front of the property are considered more important than those facing the sides. Buildings facing away from the front of the property are the least important.\nSouth-facing buildings in the rear and more private location of the property with higher exposure to sunlight are held in higher esteem and reserved for elder members of the family or ancestral plaques. Buildings facing east and west are generally for junior members or branches of the family, while buildings near the front are typically for servants and hired help.Front-facing buildings in the back of properties are used particularly for rooms of celebratory rites and for the placement of ancestral halls and plaques. In multiple courtyard complexes, central courtyards and their buildings are considered more important than peripheral ones, the latter typically being used as storage or servants\u2019 rooms or kitchens.\n\n\n=== Horizontal emphasis ===\nClassical Chinese buildings, especially those of the wealthy, are built with an emphasis on breadth and less on height, featuring an enclosed heavy platform and a large roof that floats over this base, with the vertical walls not well emphasized. Buildings that were too high and large were considered unsightly, and therefore generally avoided. Chinese architecture stresses the visual impact of the width of the buildings, using sheer scale to inspire awe in visitors. This preference contrasts Western architecture, which tends to grow in height and depth. This often meant that pagodas towered above all other buildings in the skyline of a Chinese city.The halls and palaces in the Forbidden City,  have rather low ceilings when compared to equivalent stately buildings in the West, but their external appearances suggest the all-embracing nature of imperial China. These ideas have found their way into modern Western architecture, for example through the work of J\u00f8rn Utzon.\n\n\n=== Cosmological concepts ===\n\nChinese architecture from early times used concepts from Chinese cosmology such as feng shui (geomancy) and Taoism to organize construction and layout from common residences to imperial and religious structures. This includes the use of:\n\nScreen walls to face the main entrance of the house, which stems from the belief that evil things travel in straight lines.\nTalismans and imagery of good fortune:\nDoor gods displayed on doorways to ward off evil and encourage the flow of good fortune\nThree anthropomorphic figures representing Fu Lu Shou (\u798f\u797f\u58fd f\u00fa-l\u00f9-sh\u00f2u) stars are prominently displayed, sometimes with the proclamation \"the three stars are present\" (\u4e09\u661f\u5b85 s\u0101n-x\u012bng-zh\u00e0i)\nAnimals and fruits that symbolize good fortune and prosperity, such as bats and pomegranates, respectively. The association is often done through rebuses.\nOrienting the structure with its back to elevated landscape and ensuring that there is water in the front. Considerations are also made such that the generally windowless back of the structure faces the north, where the wind is coldest in the winter.\nPonds, pools, wells, and other water sources are usually built into the structure.\nAligning a building along a north/south axis, with the building facing south and the two sides facing east and west respectively.The use of certain colors, numbers and the cardinal directions in traditional Chinese architecture reflected the belief in a type of immanence, where the nature of a thing could be wholly contained in its own form. Although the Western tradition gradually developed a body of architectural literature, little was written on the subject in China, and the earliest text, the Kaogongji, was never disputed. However, ideas about cosmic harmony and the order of the city were usually interpreted at their most basic level, so a reproduction of the \"ideal\" city never existed. Beijing as reconstructed throughout the 15th and 16th century remains one of the best examples of traditional Chinese town planning.\n\n\n== Architectural types ==\nThere are various types of Chinese architecture. Some of these relate to the associated use of the structures, such as whether they were built for royals, commoners, or the religious.\n\n\n=== Commoners ===\nDue to primarily wooden construction and poor maintenance, far fewer examples of commoner's homes survive to this day compared to those of nobles. According to Matthew Korman, the average commoner's home did not change much, even centuries after the establishment of the universal style, such as early-20th-century homes, were very similar to late and mid imperial homes in layout and construction.These homes, be they those of bureaucrats, merchants or farmers, tended to follow a set pattern: the center of the building would be a shrine for the deities and the ancestors, which would also be used during festivities. On its two sides were bedrooms for the elders; the two wings of the building (known as \"guardian dragons\" by the Chinese) were for the junior members of the family, as well as the living room, the dining room, and the kitchen, although sometimes the living room could be very close to the center.Sometimes the extended families became so large that one or even two extra pairs of \"wings\" had to be built. This resulted in a U-shaped building, with a courtyard suitable for farm work. Merchants and bureaucrats, however, preferred to close off the front with an imposing front gate. All buildings were legally regulated, and the law held that the number of stories, the length of the building and the colours used depended on the owner's class.\nSome commoners living in areas plagued by bandits built communal fortresses called Tulou for protection. Often favoured by the Hakka in Fujian and Jiangxi, the design of Tulou also shows the Chinese ancient philosophy of harmony between people and environment. People used local materials to build the walls with rammed earth. There is no window to the outside on the lower two floors for defense, but it's open on the inside with a common courtyard and lets people get together easily.\n\n\n=== Imperial ===\nThere were certain architectural features that were reserved solely for buildings built for the Emperor of China. One example is the use of yellow roof tiles, yellow having been the Imperial color; yellow roof tiles still adorn most of the buildings within the Forbidden City. The Temple of Heaven, however, uses blue roof tiles to symbolize the sky. The roofs are almost invariably supported by brackets (\"dougong\"), a feature shared only with the largest of religious buildings. The wooden columns of the buildings, as well as the surfaces of the walls, tend to be red in color. Black is also a famous color often used in pagodas. It was believed that the gods are inspired by the black color to descend to the earth.\nThe Chinese 5-clawed dragon, adopted by the first Ming emperor for his personal use, was used as decoration on the beams, pillars, and on the doors on Imperial architecture. Curiously, the dragon was never used on roofs of imperial buildings.\nOnly the buildings used by the imperial family were allowed to have nine jian (\u9593, space between two columns); only the gates used by the Emperor could have five arches, with the centre one, of course, being reserved for the Emperor himself. The ancient Chinese favored the color red. The buildings faced south because the north had a cold wind.\n\nBeijing became the capital of China after the Mongol invasion of the 13th century, completing the easterly migration of the Chinese capital begun since the Jin dynasty. The Ming uprising in 1368 reasserted Chinese authority and fixed Beijing as the seat of imperial power for the next five centuries. The Emperor and the Empress lived in palaces on the central axis of the Forbidden City, the Crown Prince at the eastern side, and the concubines at the back (therefore the numerous imperial concubines were often referred to as \"The Back Palace Three Thousand\"). However, during the mid-Qing dynasty, the Emperor's residence was moved to the western side of the complex. It is misleading to speak of an axis in the Western sense of a visual perspective ordering facades, rather the Chinese axis is a line of privilege, usually built upon, regulating access\u2014there are no vistas, but a series of gates and pavilions.\n\nNumerology heavily influenced Imperial Architecture, hence the use of nine in much of construction (nine being the greatest single digit number) and the reason why the Forbidden City in Beijing is said to have 9,999.9 rooms\u2014just short of the mythical 10,000 rooms in heaven. The importance of the East (the direction of the rising sun) in orienting and siting Imperial buildings is a form of solar worship found in many ancient cultures, where there is the notion of Ruler being affiliated with the Sun.\nThe tombs and mausoleums of imperial family members, such as the 8th-century Tang dynasty tombs at the Qianling Mausoleum, can also be counted as part of the imperial tradition in architecture. These above-ground earthen mounds and pyramids had subterranean shaft-and-vault structures that were lined with brick walls since at least the Warring States period (481\u2013221 BC).\n\n\n=== Religious ===\n\nGenerally speaking, Buddhist architecture follows the imperial style. A large Buddhist monastery normally has a front hall, housing the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings, followed by a great hall, housing the statues of the Buddhas. Accommodations for the monks and the nuns are located at the two sides. Some of the greatest examples of this come from the 18th-century Puning Temple and Putuo Zongcheng Temple. Buddhist monasteries sometimes also have pagodas, which may house the relics of the Gautama Buddha; older pagodas tend to be four-sided, while later pagodas usually have eight sides.\nDaoist architecture, on the other hand, usually follows the commoners' style. The main entrance is, however, usually at the side, out of superstition about demons which might try to enter the premise (see feng shui.) In contrast to the Buddhists, in a Daoist temple the main deity is located in the main hall at the front, the lesser deities in the back hall and at the sides. This is because Chinese people believe that even after the body has died, the soul is still alive. From the Han grave design, it shows the forces of cosmic yin and yang, the two forces from the heaven and earth that creates eternity.The tallest pre-modern building in China was built for both religious and martial purposes. The Liaodi Pagoda of 1055 AD stands at a height of 84 m (276 ft), and although it served as the crowning pagoda of the Kaiyuan monastery in old Dingzhou, Hebei, it was also used as a military watchtower for Song dynasty soldiers to observe potential Liao dynasty enemy movements.\nThe architecture of the mosques and gongbei tomb shrines of China's Muslims often combines traditional Chinese styles with Middle Eastern influences.\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Urban planning ==\n\nChinese urban planning is based on fengshui geomancy and the well-field system of land division, both used since the Neolithic age. The basic well-field diagram is overlaid with the luoshu, a magic square divided into 9 sub-squares, and linked with Chinese numerology.  In Southern Song dynasty (1131AD), the design of Hongcun city in Anhui was based around \"harmony between man and nature\", facing south and surrounded by mountains and water. According to the theory of the traditional Chinese fengshui geomancy, it is a carefully planned ancient village and show the Human-Nature Intergraded Ecological Planning concept.Since wars happened in northern China very often, people moved to southern China. The building method of a courtyard house was adapted to southern China. The village of Tungyuan in Fujian Province is a good example of a planned settlement that shows the Chinese feng shui elements \u2013 psychological self-defense and building structure \u2013 in the form of material self-defense.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\n\n=== Materials and history ===\n\nWood was originally utilised as a primary building material because it was very common. Also, Chinese people trust that life is connecting with nature and humans should interact with animated things, therefore wood was favored as opposed to stone, which was associated with the homes of the dead. However, unlike other building construction materials, old wooden structures often do not survive because they are more vulnerable to weathering and fires and are naturally subjected to rotting over time. Although now-nonexistent wooden residential towers, watchtowers, and pagodas predated it by centuries, the Songyue Pagoda built in 523 is the oldest extant pagoda in China; its use of brick instead of wood had much to do with its endurance throughout the centuries. From the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) onwards, brick and stone architecture gradually became more common and replaced wooden edifices. The earliest examples of this transition can be seen in building projects such as the Zhaozhou Bridge completed in 605 or the Xumi Pagoda built in 636, yet stone and brick architecture is known to have been used in subterranean tomb architecture of earlier dynasties.\n\nIn the early 20th century there were no known fully wood-constructed Tang Dynasty buildings that still existed; the oldest so far discovered was the 1931 find of Guanyin Pavilion at Dule Monastery, dated 984 during the Song. This was until the architectural historians Liang Sicheng (1901\u20131972), Lin Huiyin (1904\u20131955), Mo Zongjiang (1916\u20131999), and  (1902 \u2013 c. 1960s) discovered that the Great East Hall of Foguang Temple on Mount Wutai in Shanxi was reliably dated to the year 857 in June 1937. The groundfloor dimensions for this monastic hall measures 34 by 17.66 m (111.5 by 57.9 ft). A year after the discovery at Foguang, the main hall of nearby Nanchan Temple on Mount Wutai was reliably dated to the year 782, while a total of six Tang era wooden buildings have been found by the 21st century. The oldest existent fully wooden pagoda that has survived intact is the Pagoda of Fogong Temple of the Liao dynasty, located in Ying County of Shanxi. While the East Hall of Foguang Temple features only seven types of bracket arms in its construction, the 11th-century Pagoda of Fogong Temple features a total of fifty-four.\n\nThe earliest walls and platforms in China were of rammed earth construction, and over time brick and stone became more frequently used. This can be seen in ancient sections of the Great Wall of China, while the brick and stone Great Wall seen today is a renovation of the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644).\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\nFoundations: Most buildings are typically raised on raised platforms (\u81fa\u57fa) as their foundations. Vertical structural beams may rest on raised stone pedestals (\u67f1\u7840) which occasionally rest on piles. In lower class construction, the platforms are constructed of rammed earth platforms that are unpaved or paved with brick or ceramics. In the simplest cases vertical structural beams are driven into the ground directly. Upper class constructions typically have high raised stone paved rammed earth or stone foundations with ornately carved heavy stone pedestals for supporting large vertical structural beams. The vertical beams rest and remain on their pedestals solely by friction and the pressure exerted by the building structure.\nStructural beams: Use of large structural timbers for primary support of the roof of a building. Wooden timber, usually large trimmed logs, are used as load-bearing columns and lateral beams for framing buildings and supporting the roofs. These beams are connected to each other directly or, in larger and higher class structures, tied indirectly together through the use of brackets. These structural timbers are prominently displayed in finished structures. It is not definitively known how the ancient builders raised the huge wooden load bearing columns into position.\nStructural connections: Timber frames are typically constructed with joinery and dowelling alone, seldom with the use of glue or nails. These types of semi-rigid structural joints allow the timber structure to resist bending and torsion while under high compression. Structural stability is further ensured through the use of heavy beams and roofs, which weighs the structure down. The lack of glue or nails in joinery, the use of non-rigid support such as dougong, and the used of wood as structural members allow the buildings to slide, flex, and hinge while absorbing shock, vibration, and groundshift from earthquakes without significant damage to its structure. Dougong has a special function. The rich people applied valuable materials to decorate the Dougong for displaying their wealth. The common people used artwork to express their appreciation to the house.\nWalls: The common use of curtain walls or door panels to delineate rooms or enclose a building, with the general de-emphasis of load-bearing walls in most higher class construction. However, with the reduction in availability of trees in the later dynasties for building structures, the use of load-bearing walls in non-governmental or religious construction increased, with brick and stone being commonly used.\nRoofs: Flat roofs are uncommon while gabled roofs are almost omnipresent in traditional Chinese architecture. Roofs are either built on roof cross-beams or rest directly on vertical structural beams. In higher class construction, roof supporting beams are supported through complex dougong bracketing systems that indirectly connect them to the primary structural beams. Three main types of roofs are found:\nStraight inclined: Roofs with a single incline. These are the most economical type of roofing and are most prevalent in commoner architectures.\nMulti-inclined: Roofs with 2 or more sections of incline. These roofs are used in higher class constructions, from the dwellings of wealthy commoners to palaces.\nSweeping: Roofs with a sweeping curvature that rises at the corners of the roof. This type of roof construction is usually reserved for temples and palaces although it may also be found in the homes of the wealthy. In the former cases, the ridges of the roof are usually highly decorated with ceramic figurines.\nRoof apex: The roof apex of a large hall is usually topped with a ridge of tiles and statues for both decorative purposes as well as to weigh down the layers of roofing tiles for stability. These ridges are often well decorated, especially for religious or palatial structures. In some regions of China, the ridges are sometimes extended or incorporated into the walls of the building to form matouqiang (horse-head walls), which serve as a fire deterrent from drifting embers.\nRoof top decorations: Symbolism can be found from colors of the eaves, roofing materials and roof top decorations. Gold/yellow is an auspicious (good) color, imperial roofs are gold or yellow. They are usually used by the emperor. Green roofs symbolize bamboo shafts, which, in turn, represent youth and longevity.\n\n\n== Classification by structure ==\n\nChinese classifications for architecture include:\n\n\u4ead (Chinese: \u4ead; pinyin: T\u00edng) ting (Chinese pavilions)\n\u81fa (simplified Chinese: \u53f0; traditional Chinese: \u81fa; pinyin: Ta\u00ed) tai (terraces)\n\u6a13 (simplified Chinese: \u697c; traditional Chinese: \u6a13; pinyin: L\u00f3u) lou (multistory buildings)\n\u95a3 (simplified Chinese: \u9601; traditional Chinese: \u95a3; pinyin: G\u00e9) ge (two-story pavilions)\n\u8ed2 (\u8f69) xuan (verandas with windows)\n\u5854 ta (Chinese pagodas)\n\u69ad xie (pavilions or houses on terraces)\n\u5c4b wu (Rooms along roofed corridors)\n\u6597\u62f1 (Chinese: \u6597\u62f1; pinyin: D\u01d2ug\u01d2ng) dougong interlocking wooden brackets, often used in clusters to support roofs and add ornamentation.\n\u85fb\u4e95 Caisson domed or coffered ceiling\n\u5bae (simplified Chinese: \u5bab; traditional Chinese: \u5bae; pinyin: G\u014dng) palaces, larger buildings used as imperial residences, temples, or centers for cultural activities.\n\n\n== Miniature models ==\n\nAlthough mostly only ruins of brick and rammed earth walls and towers from ancient China (i.e. before the 6th century AD) have survived, information on ancient Chinese architecture (especially wooden architecture) can be discerned from more or less realistic clay models of buildings created by the ancient Chinese as funerary items. This is similar to the paper joss houses burned in some modern Chinese funerals. The following models were made during the Han Dynasty (202 BC \u2013 AD 220):\n\nDuring the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420) and the Six Dynasties, miniature models of buildings or entire architectural ensembles were often made to decorate the tops of the so-called \"soul vases\" (hunping), found in many tombs of that period.\n\n\n== Gender in Chinese homes and society ==\nBeyond the physically creative architecture techniques that the Chinese used, there was an \"imaginary architecture\"  that was implemented into a Chinese house. This imaginary architecture projected three major principles, that display a different set of messages about the relations between its inhabitants, the cosmos, and society at large, that each depicts a gender power imbalance. The first design principle was that the Chinese house was the embodiment of Neo-Confucian values. The values of the home incorporated prominently social values, collaborative values of loyalty, and values of respect and service. The values were depicted through how the Chinese home represented generations, gender, and age. Unlike western homes, the Chinese home was not a private space or a place separated from the state. It was a smaller community in itself. A place that sheltered a clan's or family's patrilineal kinship. It was quite common for houses to shelter \"five generations under one roof.\"  In this patrilineal kinship, there are heavily influenced social concepts of Confucianist values from the Five Relationships between \"ruler and subject, father and child, husband and wife, elder and younger brother and friends.\"There is a large emphasis on the unequal relationship between the superior and subordinate. In the case of the relationship between husband and wife, it clearly was male-dominated. Despite this, the husband was still responsible for treating the partner with kindness, consideration, and understanding. \nThe second aspect was that the Chinese house was a cosmic space. The house was designed as a shelter to thwart away evil influences by channeling cosmic energies (qi) through means of incorporating Feng shui (also known as geomancy). Depending on the season, astral cycle, landscape's configuration of hills, rocks, trees, and water streams, and the house's arrangement, orientation, and details of roofs or gates, an arbitrary amount of energy would be produced. However, since the cosmic energy was such an arbitrary concept, it would be used in both moral and immoral ways. The moral way is by adding Feng shui to a local community temple. Yet, it other times Feng shui would be used competitively to raise the value of one's house at the expense of others. For example, if someone built a part of their house against the norm, their house would be considered a threat. Since it was throwing off the cosmic energy. In one detailed account, a fight broke out over Feng shui. Additionally, this methodology was also incorporated inside the home. Symmetry, orientations, arrangements of objects, and cleanliness were important factors to cosmic energy. Even in poorer homes cleanliness and tidiness were highly desired since it would compensate for the cramped quarters. Sweeping was a daily task that was thought to be an act of purifying the room of pollutions such as dirt. As the Chinese historian, Sima Guang writes, \"The servants of the inner and outer quarters and the concubines all rise at the first crow of the cock. After combing their hair, washing, and getting dressed, the male servants should sweep the halls and front courtyard; the doorman and older servants should sweep the middle courtyard, while the maids sweep the living quarters, arrange tables and chairs, and prepare for the toilet of the master and mistress.\" Through cleaning, the gender segregation of the Chinese household can be seen.The third component was that the house was a space of culture, by depicting the Chinese view of humanity. The house was a domestic domain that marked the separation of the undomesticated world. Commonly symbolized through walls and gates. Gates were first a physical barrier and second a kind of notice board for the outside world. Walls were the boundaries of a patriarchal domain. The home culture was also a place where family rules could be enforced, causing divides in the upbringing of the inhabitants. Most commonly, there was a wide gender distinction. Women were often hidden away within the inner walls to do wifely domestic duties. While men would be house representatives. In terms of the marriage duties, \"Men would grow up, marry and likely die in the house win which he, his father and paternal grandfather had been born and in which his mother would live until her death. Women would leave their natal home on marriage to become a stranger in a new house.\" Women wouldn't be accepted into a new home until they aired a child. Often new brides would be treated badly by the senior members of a household. In extreme cases, junior brides were treated like unpaid servants and forced to do unpleasant chores. Additionally, to women, marriage was thought of as a descent into hell. \"The analogy of the wedding process with death is made explicit: the bride describes herself as being prepared for death, and the wedding process as the crossing of the yellow river that is the boundary between this life and the next. Shes appeals for justice, citing the valuable and unrecognized contribution she has made to her family. Her language is bitter and unrestrained, and she even curses the matchmaker and her future husband's family. Such lamenting can take place only within her parents' household and must cease halfway on the road to her new home, when the invisible boundary has been crossed.\" As a result of this, men and women faced two vastly different lives. \nThe confinement of women was a method of controlling their sexuality. It was thought that women needed to be controlled so that they may not get pregnant by an outsider and then try to claim a state in the male's domain. In addition, wives were often represented as \"gossiping troublemakers eager to stir up strife between otherwise devoted brothers, the root of family discord, requiring strict patriarchal control.\"As a result, they were untrusted and were always considered to be involved in an illicit sexual relationship if they were in the company of another male.\nEven though a couple would be married, husbands and wives did not stay in the same private room for long. During the day, men would go out or work in their studies so that they can avoid any unnecessary contact with female relatives. Women weren't allowed to leave the inner perimeter. If a woman had to leave the inner perimeter, they must cover their face with a veil or her sleeve. However, the inner quarters did provide women with some control over the patriarchal order. Since they had their own private room that men were not usually permitted to enter. \nOn all social levels and aspects of the Chinese home, the seclusion of women was ingrained into society. A married woman was a virtually a prisoner in her husband's domain while the husband \"never had to leave his parents or his home, he knew which lineage and which landscape he belonged to from the time he began to understand the world.\"\n\n\n== Influence from outside of China ==\nDespite largely being self-developing, there have been periods where Chinese architecture received significant influence from abroad, particularly during conquest dynasties such as the Yuan and Qing, who tended to be more outward-looking. The ruins of the Yuan capital of Khanbaliq under the Forbidden City in Beijing were analysed by scholars to be both distinct from previous styles and influential to many later architecture. Additionally the import of many Muslim officials, architects and scholars from the Islamic world during the Yuan led to an influx of Islamic design elements, especially in Chinese mosques.The Zhenghai Mosque in Ningbo city, Zhejiang province is a type of Islamic Architecture which appeared in China during the Song dynasty (990 AD). When the Arabic traders arrived at the big commercial city of Ningbo and settled down there, they spread the Muslim culture and built a mosque. Later, more mosques were built around Beijing. The case itself is found in the mosques of Xi'an such as Xi'an Great Mosque and Daxuexi Alley Mosque. Beijing's Mosques also follow essentially the norms of Chinese planning, layout, design, and traditional wooden structure.There are many miniature pagodas in Northeast China. They were built by Buddhists during the Liao dynasty (907-1125), and the dynasty supported the practice of Buddhism. They developed some new types of Buddhist architecture building with bricks. Thus, one can find many such pagodas from Hebei Province to Beijing and Inner Mongolia.\n\n\n== Influence on neighboring Asian countries ==\n\nChinese architecture has been influential in varying degrees in the development of the architecture of many neighboring East Asian countries. After the Tang dynasty, the era when much Chinese culture was imported en masse by neighboring nations, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Japan, Korea, and Mongolia where the East Asian hip-and-gable roof design is ubiquitous.Chinese architecture also has underlying influences in the architecture of various Southeast Asian countries. Certain Chinese architectural techniques were adopted by Thai artisans after trade commenced with the Yuan and Ming dynasty towards Thai architecture. Certain temple and palace roof tops were also built in Chinese-style and Chinese-style buildings can be found in Ayutthaya a nod towards the large numbers of Chinese shipbuilders, sailors and traders who came to the country. In Indonesia, mosques bearing Chinese influence can be found in certain parts of the country. This influence is recent in comparison to other parts of Asia and is largely due to the sizable Chinese Indonesian community. Chinese architectural sensibilities have also influenced Vietnam, where it would also adopt the East Asian hip-and-gable roof style.In South Asia, Chinese architecture has played a significant role in shaping Sri Lankan architecture, alongside influences from India and other parts of Southeast Asia. The Kandyan roof style, for example bears many similarities to the East Asian hip-and-gable roof technique which has its origins in China.The Chinese-origin guardian lion is also found in front of Buddhist temples, buildings and some Hindu temples (in Nepal) across Asia including Japan, Korea, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Cambodia and Laos.\n\n\n== Regional variation ==\nThere is considerable regional variance in traditional Chinese architecture, some of which are very divergent from general layouts. Several of the more notable regional styles include:\n\n\n=== Shanxi architecture ===\n \nShanxi preserves the oldest wooden structures in China from Tang dynasty, including the Foguang Temple and Nanchan Temple. Yungang Grottoes in Datong and numerous Buddhist temples in the sacred Mount Wutai exemplify the religious architectures of China.\nShanxi family compounds are representative of vernacular architecture in North China. In the mountainous areas of Shanxi, yaodong is a type of earth shelter that are commonly found.  \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Lingnan (Cantonese) architecture ===\n \nThe classical Lingnan architecture is used primarily in the southern province of Guangdong and the eastern half of the neighboring Guangxi. It is noted for its use of carvings and sculptures for decorations, green brick, balconies, \"Cold alleys\", \"Narrow doors\", and many other characteristics adaptive to the subtropical region.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Minnan (Hokkien) architecture ===\n \nMinnan architecture, or Hokkien architecture, refers to the architectural style of the Hoklo people, the Han Chinese group who have been the dominant demographic of most of Fujian and Taiwan. This style is noted for its use of swallowtail roofs (heavily decorated upward-curving roof ridges) and \"cut porcelain carving\" for decorations.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Hakka architecture ===\n\nHakka people have been noted for building very distinctive walled villages in order to protect themselves from clan wars.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Gan architecture ===\n\nThe Gan Chinese-speaking province of Jiangxi is noted for its distinct style, making use of bricks, wood, and stones as materials, primarily erected with wooden frames. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Yaodong architecture ===\n\nThe Jin Chinese cultural area of Shanxi and northern Shaanxi are noted for carving their homes into the sides of mountains. The soft rock of the Loess Plateau in this region makes for an excellent insulating material.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tibetan architecture ===\n\n\n=== Xinjiang architecture ===\n\n\n=== Others ===\nAside from the above, there are many other regional styles, such as Hutong, which is prevalent in northern China, Longtang and Shikumen of Haipai (Shanghainese) architecture, and so on.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFletcher, Banister; Cruickshank, Dan, Sir Banister Fletcher's a History of Architecture, Architectural Press, 20th edition, 1996 (first published 1896).

          "Staying in Wuxi on business, didn't manage to get to the temple till about 6ish when the sun was setting. Temple was closed, and there was quite a bit of restoration/scaffolding going on. Nice central location with lots of restaurants about but I didn't stay here too long.",
          "We visited at night to check the lights, it was quite nice, interesting area to walk around. Having small alleys, shops selling various items, and best part was a boat ride through the canal, this was quite nice. There are eateries around, but we didn't try as we had dinner",
          "This is good to buy some cheap gifts and try some street food but there's not much else to it. The temple is nice but like most temples in China it seems to be more of a tourist spot than a genuine temple. You can go up the pogoda which is good on a nice day. It's also in good",
          "It's a wonderful experience to have stroll along the Nanchan. Again, this place has so much to offer."

        "wiki": "Wuxi (Chinese: \u65e0\u9521) is a city in southern Jiangsu province, eastern China, 135 kilometers (84 mi) by car to the northwest of downtown Shanghai, between Changzhou and Suzhou. In 2017 it had a population of 3,542,319, with 6,553,000 living in the entire prefecture-level city area.\nWuxi is a prominent historical and cultural city of China, and has been a thriving economic center since ancient times as a production as an export hub of rice, silk and textiles. In the last few decades it has emerged as a major producer of electrical motors, software, solar technology and bicycle parts. The city lies in the southern delta of the Yangtze River and on Lake Tai, which with its 48 islets is popular with tourists. Notable landmarks include Lihu Park, the Mt. Lingshan Grand Buddha Scenic Area and its 88 meters (289 ft) tall Grand Buddha at Ling Shan statue, Xihui Park, Wuxi Zoo and Taihu Lake Amusement Park and the Wuxi Museum.\nThe city is served by Sunan Shuofang International Airport, which opened in 2004, the Wuxi Metro, opened in 2014, and the Shanghai\u2013Nanjing Intercity High-Speed Railway which connects it to Shanghai. Jiangnan University, a key national university of \u201cProject 211\u201d and center for scientific research, was originally founded in 1902 but was reconstituted in 2001 with the merger of two other colleges.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nWuxi means \"without tin\" literally. The name \"with tin\" (\u6709\u932b) was once adopted during the short-lived Xin Dynasty. Despite varied origin stories, many modern Chinese scholars favor the view that the word is derived from the \"old Yue language\" or, supposedly, the old Kra\u2013Dai languages.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Wuxi can be traced back to Shang dynasty (1600 \u2013 1046 BC).\nThe tin industry thrived in the area in ancient times but it was eventually depleted, so that when Wuxi was established in 202 BCE during the Han dynasty, it was named \"Wuxi\" (Without Tin). Administratively, Wuxi became a district of Biling (later Changzhou) and only during the Yuan dynasty (1206\u20131368) did it become an independent prefecture. Wuxi and Changzhou are considered to be the birthplaces of modern industrialization in China.Agriculture and the silk industry flourished in Wuxi and the town became a transportation hub under the early Tang Dynasty after the opening of the Grand Canal in 609. It became known as one of the biggest markets for rice in China.The Donglin Academy, originally founded during the Song dynasty (960-1279) was restored in Wuxi in 1604. Not a school, it served as a public forum, advocating a Confucian orthodoxy and ethics. Many of its academicians were retired court officials or officials deposed in the 1590s due to factionalism.As a populous county, its eastern part was separated and resulted in the creation of Jinkui county in 1724. Both Wuxi and Jinkui were utterly devastated by the Taiping Rebellion, which resulted in nearly 2/3 of their population being killed. The depleted number of \u201cable-bodied males\u201d (ding, \u4e01) was only of 72,053 and 138,008 individuals in 1865, versus 339,549 and 258,934 in 1830.During the Qing dynasty (1636\u20131912), cotton and silk production flourished in Wuxi. Trade increased with the opening of ports to Shanghai in 1842,  and Zhenjiang and Nanjing in 1858.  Wuxi became a center of the textile industry in China. Textile mills were built in 1894 and silk reeling establishments known as \"filatures\" were built in 1904. Wuxi was remained the regional center for the waterborne transport of grain. The opening of the railways to Shanghai and to the cities of Zhenjiang and Nanjing to the northwest in 1908 further increased the exports of rice from the area. Jinkui xian merged into Wuxi County with the onset of the Republic in 1912.\nMany agricultural laborers and merchants moved to Shanghai in the late 19th century and early 20th century; some prospered in the new factories.After World War II, Wuxi's importance as an economic center diminished, but it remains a regional manufacturing hub. Tourism has increasingly become important. On April 23, 1949, Wuxi was divided into Wuxi City and Wuxi County, and it became a provincial city in 1953 when Jiangsu Province was founded. In March 1995, several administrative changes were made within Wuxi City and Wuxi County to accommodate for Wuxi New District, with the creation of 19 administrative villages such as Shuofang, Fangqian, Xin\u2019an and Meicun. Jiangnan University was originally founded in 1902, before merging with two other colleges in 2001 to form the modern university.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe prefecture-level city of Wuxi administers seven county-level divisions, including 5 districts and 2 county-level cities.

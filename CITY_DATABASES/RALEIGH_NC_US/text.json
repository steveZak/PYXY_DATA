        "wiki": "The North Carolina Museum of Art (NCMA) is an art museum in Raleigh, North Carolina. It opened in 1956 as the first major museum collection in the country to be formed by state legislation and funding. Since the initial 1947 appropriation that established its collection, the Museum has continued to be a model of enlightened public policy with free admission to the permanent collection. Today, it encompasses a collection that spans more than 5,000 years of artistic work from antiquity to the present, an amphitheater for outdoor performances, and a variety of celebrated exhibitions and public programs. The Museum features over 40 galleries as well as more than a dozen major works of art in the nation's largest museum park with 164-acres (0.66 km2). One of the leading art museums in the American South, the NCMA recently completed a major expansion winning international acclaim for innovative approaches to energy-efficient design.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1924, the North Carolina State Art Society formed to generate interest in creating an art museum for the state.  In 1928 the society acquired funds and 75 paintings were first displayed in a series of temporary art exhibition spaces in the Agriculture Building in Raleigh in 1929.  In 1939, NCMA was moved to the former Supreme Court building.\nIn 1947 the state legislature appropriated $1 million to purchase a collection of artworks for the people of North Carolina. The money was used to purchase 139 European and American works. The Samuel H. Kress Foundation matched the appropriation with a gift of 71 works, primarily from the Italian Renaissance. The 1947 state earmarking of funds for an art collection was the first in the United States.\n\n\n=== Morgan Street Location ===\nOn April 6, 1956, the museum opened in the renovated State Highway Division Building on Morgan Street in downtown Raleigh, the state capital. W. R. Valentiner became the museum's first director.  In 1961, the legislature separated the museum from the Art Society, making it a state agency jointly governed by the state and a board of trustees. Ten years later, NCMA became an entity under what is now the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.\n\n\n=== Blue Ridge Road and the Stone Building ===\nIn 1967, the present-day Blue Ridge Road site was chosen as the location for a new building, as the museum had outgrown the Morgan Street location. Designed by Edward Durrell Stone and Associates of New York and Holloway-Reeves Architects of North Carolina, the new building opened in 1983. Stone used spatial experimentation with pure geometric form for the museum by using a square as a basic unit and designing the entire site by manipulating the square form. This was Stone's last major design prior to his death. After he died in 1978, the exterior was changed from white marble to red brick.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\nIn April 2010 the museum opened the new 127,000-square-foot (11,800 m2) West Building, designed by New York-based architects Thomas Phifer and Partners as part of an expansion initiative. The single-story structure, surrounded by sculpture gardens and pools, was created to feature the museum's permanent collection as well as more than 100 new works of art acquired on the occasion of the expansion. Highlights include a gift of 30 Auguste Rodin sculptures and work by artists Roxy Paine, Ursula von Rydingsvard, El Anatsui, Jaume Plensa, Jackie Ferrara, Ellsworth Kelly, and David Park. The project also transformed the museum's East Building into a center for temporary exhibitions, education and public programs, public events, and administrative functions. The project cost $72.3 million. The exterior walls of the West Building are covered with anodized aluminum panels that are canted two degrees back from vertical with seams covered by highly polished steel bands. The roof of the West Building includes parabolic-shaped 6.5 ft (2.0 m) by 37 ft (11 m) coffers, which admit natural light.\n\n\n== Permanent collection ==\n\nThe museum's permanent collection includes European paintings from the Renaissance to the 19th century, Egyptian funerary art, sculpture and vase painting from ancient Greece and Rome, American art of the 18th through 20th centuries, and international contemporary art. Other strengths include African, ancient American, pre-Columbian, and Oceanic art, and Jewish ceremonial objects.\n\n\n=== African ===\nThe museum's African collection originated in the 1970s with historical material from the 19th and 20th centuries, including important items from the Benin Kingdom. Later acquisitions expanded regional coverage to include other parts of sub-Saharan Africa with an eye toward assembling works that demonstrated a particular ethnic style, such as those of the Chokwe and Luba peoples of central Africa. Though much of the collection is rooted in traditional media such as wood, metal, and textiles and derives from established creative traditions, many works date from the mid-20th century and give insight into global exchanges that have taken place on the continent for centuries.\n\n\n=== American ===\nThe museum's American art collection encompasses paintings and sculpture from the late colonial period (mid-18th century) to the advent of modern art in the early 20th century, beginning with three imposing portraits by John Singleton Copley and concluding with paintings by leading American impressionists. In between, the collection addresses many of the themes and subjects of American art history, such as the celebration of wilderness and the search for a national identity; the conflicts over race, immigration, and social class; and the rapid evolution of society from Jefferson's republic of farmers to Rockefeller's industrial dynamo. In December 2018, the museum acquired the 1865 sculpture Saul by William Wetmore Story. \n\n\n=== Ancient American ===\nThe ancient American collection features art from three distinct areas of the Western Hemisphere: Mesoamerica, Central America, and the Andes. The ancient American gallery focuses on Mesoamerica, particularly the art of the ancient Maya. Known for their achievements in science and the arts, the Maya dominated the region for most of two millennia. The museum's collection reflects their religious beliefs, sport, ritual, and daily life.\n\n\n=== Egyptian ===\nAlthough comprising only 38 artifacts, the ancient Egyptian art collection at the North Carolina Museum of Art represents the major periods of ancient Egyptian history, from the Predynastic (Nagada I, 4000\u20133500 BCE) to the Roman (30 BCE \u2013 642 CE) periods. The Museum's oldest artifact is a black-topped red ceramic jar handmade approximately 6,000 years ago. All periods combined, the collection's strength resides in funerary material, which includes the painted coffins of Djed Mut and Amunred, servant statues for chores in the afterlife (called shabtis), and a canopic jar that once contained the mummified liver of a man named Qeny. The remainder of the collection focuses on the many gods worshiped in Egypt.\n\n\n=== European ===\n\nThe museum's strength lies in its European collection. Of the 139 paintings and sculptures purchased with the original appropriation of funds, 123 were European. When these paintings were augmented by the 75 primarily Italian paintings and sculptures given to the museum by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in 1961, they created a European collection that is recognized as one of the finest in the United States. The gallery is primarily a collection of paintings but also includes a number of noteworthy sculptures, including more than 30 bronzes by Auguste Rodin.\n\n\n=== British, Spanish, and French Post\u20131600 ===\nThe museum possesses a number of British portraits, most of which are installed in a gallery devoted to European portraiture and its early American counterpart. The collection features important works by Paul van Somer, Anthony van Dyck, Francis Cotes, Sir William Beechey, Thomas Gainsborough, and Sir Henry Raeburn. The museum's French and Spanish collections include portraits and still lifes by Boudin, Millet, Pissarro, and Monet.\n\n\n=== Italian ===\nThe museum's collection of Italian paintings is one of its most robust. Highlights include a gallery devoted to altarpieces and devotional works from the 16th through 18th centuries, paintings by Titian and Raphael, and 17th-century baroque art.\n\n\n=== Northern European ===\nThe museum's Northern European collection comprises a small but select group of Northern Renaissance paintings and sculptures, an important collection of 17th-century Dutch and Flemish paintings, and a Flemish baroque kunstkamer inspired by 17th-century examples. The 17th-century Dutch and Flemish collections are larger in number and include works by Hendrick Ter Brugghen, Jan Steen, Jan Lievens, Jacob van Ruisdael, and Govaert Flinck, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Peter Paul Rubens, Gerard Seghers, Anthony van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, and Frans Snyders.\n\n\n=== Modern (to circa 1960) ===\nIn West Building the museum's modern collection occupies several rooms with works by the foremost German modern artists of the early 20th century such as Franz Kline and Lyonel Feininger as well first generation of American modernists such as Alberto Giacometti. Cubist and surrealist pieces by Paul Delvaux and Joseph Cornell as well as other Modern masters such as Richard Diebenkorn, Andrew Wyeth, and Alberto Giacometti.\n\n\n=== Judaic ===\n\nThe museum's Judaic art collection celebrates the spiritual life and ceremonies of the Jewish people through ritual objects of artistic excellence. It is one of only two galleries devoted to Judaica in an American art museum. The Judaic Art Gallery features objects from the major Jewish traditions\u2014Ashkenazic, Sephardic, and Oriental\u2014as well as from modern Israel. All objects are designed for use in synagogue worship, observance of the Sabbath and holidays, or ceremonial occasions honoring the life cycle and Jewish home. Examples of objects that are displayed include a Menorah and Torah scrolls.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nIn recent years major acquisitions have helped build a significant collection of contemporary art. A concerted effort has been made to acquire works in new and experimental media, such as Bill Viola\u2019s video The Quintet of Remembrance (2000) and Michal Rovner\u2019s video installation Tfila (2004). Cultural and regional representation has also been expanded, with the museum actively acquiring works by artists of diverse backgrounds. In 2003, the museum started actively collecting contemporary photography. By 2010, the collection totaled over 200 photographs by national and international photographers, including works by Rosemary Laing, Dinh Q. L\u00ea, Vera Lutter, and Lorna Simpson. Recent acquisitions include  Hank Willis Thomas, Kehinde Wiley, and Mickalene Thomas. Two identical figures, each with the dimensions of 377\u00d7235\u00d7245 cm, were recently set up in the museum's garden. Their title is Spiegel I and Spiegel II. They were created from white painted stainless steel in 2010 by the Spanish sculptor and artist Jaume Plensa.\nThe collection also includes a comprehensive survey of North Carolina artists.\n\n\n== Museum Park ==\nEncompassing 164 acres (0.66 km2) of fields, woodlands, and creeks, the Museum Park features more than a dozen site-specific works of art and two miles (3 km) of trails. The campus is the largest museum art park in North America. In the warm weather months, outdoor movies and concerts are presented at the Joseph M. Bryan, Jr., Theater.\n\nThe museum's contemporary art program extends into the landscape surrounding the museum, where artists have created both temporary and permanent site-specific works of art in the Museum Park. As of 2010, art on view in the Park includes works by Thomas Sayre, Vollis Simpson, Martha Jackson-Jarvis, Ledelle Moe and a camera obscura entitled Cloud Chamber for the Trees and Sky by Chris Drury. Other outdoor sculptures\u2014Ronald Bladen's Three Elements, Henry Moore's Large Spindle Piece and Large Standing Figure: Knife Edge\u2014are installed in the gardens surrounding West Building. Picture This, part of the museum's amphitheater, is a monumental work of art designed by artist Barbara Kruger in collaboration with architects and landscape architects.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nSince renovations in 2010, the East Building provides a series of rotating exhibitions  featuring a NC gallery, a photography gallery, education exhibitions, and at least two traveling or temporary exhibitions on display.\n\n\n=== Previous exhibitions ===\nWord Up: The Intersection of Text and Image, July 22, 2012\u2013January 20, 2013\nProject 35, August 19, 2012\u2013June 2, 2013\nEdvard Munch: Symbolism in Print, September 23, 2012\u2013February 10, 2013\nStill-Life Masterpieces: A Visual Feast from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, October 21, 2012\u2013January 13, 2013\nJohn James Audubon\u2019s The Birds of America, November 7, 2010\u2013ongoing\nA Discerning Eye: Julian T.

          "Great museum, made even better by the price (free)! Iris is also a great place for brunch, reservations are recommended. If it\u2019s a nice day, check out the outdoor trails which have diverse art displays along the walk.",

          "Took my 6 and 4 year old (yeah, I know that's brave). Strolled through the Egyptian art, as well as the Rodin pieces.  Rumor is, NC has one of the largest Rodin collections out side of Europe.  I can believe that now after seeing it.  The \u2026",
          "The layout can be a little confusing so make sure to ask for a nap and directions from the front otherwise you can miss a lot of cool art.  If it\u2019s nice outside, make sure you check out the sculpture garden and they often have live music in the lounge In the evenings for an inexpensive evening out",

          "This is an incredible museum... a must-see if you are in Raleigh.  I dragged my husband there with me. He generally is not enthusiastic about visiting museums, but we both were thoroughly impressed with this one. He was so glad that he went \u2026",
          "Great place to take a significant other, or go by yourself to think and relax.",
          "we were calmy hammocking when a security guard of sorts came up to us and told us we could only be in the park if we were moving. they also made all the people who were enjoying picnics leave. We were practicing safe social distancing, \u2026",
          "I love the NCMA. Highly recommend visiting here. The galleries are full of beautiful art and sculptures. I've went with adults or children and enjoyed both. They have a cute scavenger hunt for kids. There is a vast outdoor space with sculptures and interactive exhibits.",

          "Went here on a date with my bf and loved the variety of everything. It's always fascinating to see what our ancestors made/built/were like. I liked the set up they had about pottery and sewing the day I went in the African exhibit. Also the \u2026",

          "Very nice to walk and look at art pieces, thru the wooded areas and to just stretch your legs. My kids always enjoy running around free. We had family over from out of state and brought them here, they really enjoyed it.  Take time and enjoy this place with family, friends or that significant other :)",

          "It is one of the best places for family outings as well as to take kids along. The place in itself is a knowledge hub and the various exhibits depict the features of natural environment.Last week , i went here with my family and the kids in the family had a lot of fun along with learning.",

          "I always enjoy the brisk walk to and from my car in the parking lot. Inside. It's always pleasant.  I only had time for the west building to but will return soon to visit the east building.  Thank you!",
          "The outdoor sculpture park is a great way to enjoy art, get fresh air, and keep your social distance during a pandemic :).",
          "Always a joy. I would highly recommend visiting the cloud chamber for trees and sky, which is essentially a person-sized camera obscura where one can see the trees and sky projected on the floor of the chamber after a period of visual adjustment. Beautiful, mysterious, nestled off the walking path, and very worthwhile.",
          "We very much enjoyed our visit to this museum, with an interesting collection that spans several centuries and types of art. Favorites included the many Rodin sculptures, a few Monets and the entire modern art exhibit. Plan to spend a whole \u2026",

          "Small but nice selection of art, ancient to modern. Out door sculpture gardens are lovely! Cafe is pricey but food is good. Service at cafe is either good or with an attitude. Gift shop is small with lovely items but this too can be pricey. Main museum and outdoor gardens are free.",
          "Rodin exhibit is beautiful!  Hard to believe that the admission is free here!  Really enjoyed the entire place including the cafe for lunch.",
          "Such a wonderful museum! I love how there is both indoor and outdoor exhibits to view. It's a bit warm to walk around during the summer, but I will certainly be coming back in the fall to see everything the outdoor trails have to offer! \u2026",
          "The Museum is having West and East Building.Museum clearly portraits the life of People who lived in America,Europe and Egypt.\nArt works defines the lifestyle of those people\u2019s.\nIt is having a large beautiful grassy Park with small trails. \u2026",
          "Very unique and fun place to visit. It's great for any age. There's so much to see in the outdoor spaces as well as the indoor. They have THE best summer concert series around. The venue is amazing for evening outdoor shows. It's shaded at night so it's not too hot.",
          "A great museum for a day out and it is for free! Nice art selection and friendly service.",
          "Lovely physical location, great stroll through the forested grounds. It unfortunately looks like it is the location where the Smithsonian dumps the art they paid too much for back in the seventies and can't unload elsewhere. One gets the feeling that it is an abandoned paintball range with higher-end obstacles.",
          "Docents can be rude, talk down to patrons and try to control viewing experience. If I want to look at a 3 dimensional piece from different sides, just let me, I'm not disruptive or disrespectful, I'm not dressed poorly or boisterous, and I \u2026",
          "It\u2019s a pretty small museum but the few permanent pieces they have are legit-Rodins sculptures, medieval art and European style paintings. They have a nice walk path that also has large scale installation art and a cafe where I go to just \u2026",

          "We could not go inside because of the virus. However not seen a park full of families and people enjoying themselves in years. Covid sucks but man do I miss this.",
          "Well-lit galleries with beautiful art pieces, well-written and informative tags, and clean spaces. We had a wonderful time and I want to go back and see more of the extensive collection.",
          "This is my favorite place to visit when I\u2019m looking for art in Raleigh. This installation is extraordinary. I have forgotten the name... climbing on the roof and then running around inside while playing my music on the jukebox transformed me into a work of art. I thinkThis is one of the best sculpture gardens on the East Coast.",
          "I love coming here! Fantastic lighting and set up! It's very calming!",
          "This place is totally worth the visit, especially if it's nice outside.  There are lots of outdoor exhibits and trails to walk.",

          "Really cool museum and the outdoor section is awesome if you don't want to pay admission. Definitely some very unique and interesting exhibits, and a nice atmosphere to take someone on a date or just go by yourself. Good balance of a lot of different kinds of art so if you don't like a specific style there's plenty more to look at.",
          "The art museum has a very beautiful park/garden with plenty of interesting sculptures and structures to look at. Their hours are limited on week days though, but at least it's free! It also closes at 5 pm even on weekends, but it's a worthwhile day trip",
          "Amazing first time and truly incredible that the vast majority of what goes on here is free. Definitely something worth taking advantage of.",
          "Campus is so big. Lots of art and structures. Always something to learn about and to do at this site. Lovely place",
          "Great collection! Museum Park has several different trails and picnic areas; good for a walk or to relax. Plenty of free parking as well.",
          "Awesome place to walk around and to have a nice picnic \ud83e\udd17",
          "A must see every time we go to NC State Veterinary University Campus. In good \"bunny\" weather (cool, but clear) we take time to stop and walk the outdoor grounds! Just breathtaking.",
          "The Mexican Modern show was good. Not many of Freida's iconic works, though, but lots of personal, intimate photos.",
          "This is a great easy, and very chill place to visit. They change up the layout quite a bit, so you can visit a couple times a tear and see a lot of new items. This is one of my favorite places to. Is it in the area.",
          "Lovely setting indoor and out. Sculture and paintings from several amazing eras in artistic genres. Wish there was even more!",
          "Well maintained.  Staff available in each section.  During our self guided visit, staff willingly but unobtrusively shared fascinating information about pieces where we lingered.  This visit there were a couple of interactive displays, \u2026",
          "Outstanding largely modern art museum in North Carolina. It\u2019s vast - consisting or two huge main buildings and an enormous sculpture garden. One of the things that constantly surprised me on this most recent road trip was the extraordinary high quality of museums attached to fairly small cities.",
          "The overall vibe of this place is amazing. You not only have the inside artwork to look at, you have the outside as well. This museum is in a great location too because it very close to downtown and also close to events like the state fair, \u2026",
          "Wonderful things to see. Exhibits are amazing. Went during a weekday and it wasn't very crowded.",
          "Great trails, love the pieces of art, and I always hang out in the mini outdoor amphitheatre.",
          "Great concerts, rotating exhibits, strong supporter of the local arts community. Great outdoor area for spring and summer.",
          "Something for everyone. Modern art, Dutch masters, oils, classical, sculptures, and more. Lots of green space around for strolling.",
          "A treasure trove of African art is here. It is definitely a shining spot of culture in the last place your expect in Raleigh.  They also feature events like chamber music, so worth watching their calendar.",
          "The tour guide was not that great but the way they had the art set up was good",
          "Wonderful exhibits, very clean and well put together. Love going here with the family when visiting.",
          "The venue is one of my favorite. However why they make you park at the bottom of the hill and then walk all the way back up it to get to the end of the line is a mystery to me. Two feed lines from the two different lots would have been much more fair. The sound is excellent and the lighting is subdued. Very intimate setting.",
          "Had a blast at a Frida exhibit recently. The grounds look amazing when all the sun flowers are in bloom!",
          "Beautiful interior and great painting/sculpture collection. The outside area is also great for a stroll, a run or whatever you fancy.",

          "Beautiful place to go for a walk or bike ride when it is nice outside, and the indoor portion had an excellent selection of curated exhibits",
          "This is a very nice museum, and I like the fact that the exhibits change periodically. The good news is admission is free, both for the museum's permanent collection and park, which is a work of art within itself. While art museums may seem \u2026",
          "The indoor buildings with the collections is quite large. Definitely will take you a few hours if you really take your time to engulf yourself. There\u2019s not  much description regarding the pieces. I do wish there were more descriptive \u2026",
          "Native to this area and have never been to the museum until today. Definitely loved it, but my by far favorite was the African exhibit!!",
          "Nice convenient art museum for a quick excursion. Plenty of parking, and you can breeze through the exhibits in less than 90 minutes. Not the largest art museum I have been too, which is fine but they still have a nice cross section of art. \u2026",
          "Great open outdoor spaces. Beautiful landscaping and scenery. Check out the bioretention pond!",
          "Amazing look at art history. Loved it here. So serene and beautiful!",
          "Fantastic today. More relaxed atmosphere than in the past. Students weren\u2019t followed around. Security offered relatable information. The atmosphere was way more inviting.",

          "For all men take your lady here. Nice date spot. Free of charge",
          "Came to the museum specifically to see the Frida Kahlo exhibit. It was amazing and I absolutely loved the layout. I will be back to visit the other buildings/exhibits.",
          "awesome! I loved the space and work they had on display! if you're an art fan this is a must go place. perfect for a free and easy date with nice walking paths surrounding the building",
          "Different from other art museums and a great selection of art. Also, a great place to walk and enjoy the outside.",
          "Great place to visit and admire the art. My only qualm being that one of the security guards followed my friends and i around the entire museum and im unsure why.",
          "the museum is divided between two buildings, a new one and an old one. the new building is well lit with diffused natural light and a refreshing place to view art. the old building should be closed off to the public. it's dark and dreary \u2026",
          "Love it, love it, love it.  I am a transplant from the Northeast so I was not sure what kind of culture I would find in my new digs, but I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at the NC Museum of Art.  The campus is a visual spectacle \u2026",
          "You don\u2019t want to miss the stargate art perfect for walking your dogs",
          "I came here for the Frida Khalil exhibit and learned that I\u2019m not a particularly big fan of Frida. However, I really enjoyed the exhibit in addition to everything else the museum had to offer. The cost is quite reasonable and the various exhibits/cafe is a great place to spend a day off.",
          "Fantastic museum. And wonderful outdoor area to run, walk, or bring kids.",
          "I love the NCMA!! And they\u2019re doing really interesting things. Check out the room on the left as you enter the old wing, they\u2019ve got art from the local schools in there\u2014those kids are IMPRESSIVE! They have an exhibit going on now (it\u2019s June \u2026",
          "Wonderful experience. Will definitely go back",
          "Love museums but I wish there was more accessible information on the exhibits. I could be alone but I'd love to see more information than just the creator, title, and short descriptions on each exhibit. Make them longer? Or maybe an exhibit database on a few interactive tablets spread around the museum?",
          "Not very interesting could use more descriptions of the art and more interactive features",
          "Always a great experience. Love that the art options change. I've seen Monet, Rembrandt, Picasso, Norman Rockwell, Ansel Adams, and so many others art and have been amazed each time. I would highly recommend checking out the regular exhibit plus any rotating exhibits that come to town.",
          "Really awesome museum! I was pretty blown away by what they had there. There was a lot of great art from many different periods and I enjoyed it a lot. The outdoor stuff was cool too, it was just super hot and humid out. I picked up some socks from the gift store!",
          "A great place to go for a nice walk.   Varied walking paths for all abilities.  Plenty of kiddie stuff too and outdoor art. The actual museum itself is also very nice with ample,  convenient and free parking.",

          "The easiest review I've ever considered, and written: I've never left the NCMA feeling like I shouldn't have gone.\n\nIt's ALWAYS worth going",
          "We really enjoyed the exhibit of African Art!  North Carolina is very fortunate to have such a first class art museum!  Everything they do is optimal!  If you have an hour to spend or hours to spend you couldn't find a better place in the Raleigh area than the North Carolina Art Museum to spend them.",
          "This is just one of the best spots to visit in Raleigh. You can exercise, picnic, learn, sit in a quite spot to read or work. Not to mention the awesome movies they show in the summer. I never have a bad time here. Pure joy.",
          "World class art museum, with a great variety of modern and classic art -- all set in a beautiful setting.",
          "What's not to love!?! I grew up around free museums in DC, and Raleigh doesn't disappoint. This is definitely one of my favorite art museums. There's always something new. \nJust don't bring your own water bottles inside. I always forget.",
          "I came for a specific exhibit which, although I did enjoy I feel they could have presented it better. They did not make the display with any kind of flow pattern which was inherent so it was just a constant traffic jam or people just \u2026",
          "Love this museum. Enjoyed the Frida Kahlo exhibit. Day of the Dead display is dramatic.",
          "It was amazing in its art and grounds, however the security personnel were very prison guard like and not too sociable or helpful. One even lead me to a restricted area when I asked him how to get to a wall with interesting quotes, very \u2026",

          "We had a docent and the experience.was very different. We only had time for a few pieces but learned SO much. Wonderful experience",
          "Well maybe two stars is a little unfair, maybe not. I came here on a 72 degree day in February, with hopes of taking advantage of the numerous pokestops that were placed here by the creators of Pok\u00e9mon Go. As an avid player of a game that \u2026",
          "Incredible outdoor sculpture garden and trails. The indoor exhibits are fascinating and cover a wide range of periods and styles. A must see for visitors and locals alike.",
          "This Art Gallery is one of the best planned, because it connects its interior Art with its exterior Art. It's an experience you will not want to miss out on - especially on Saturday's when it's free admission to the public, but of course there is a tip pit if you so choose to donate.",
          "Awesome place to visit nice art something new all the time. An walking around outside you can walk your dog",
          "Beautiful surroundings I just did the outside, there are walking and biking trails to see the art work displayed outside. The price is right free.",
          "This museum is not just inside the four walls but spreads out side these boundaries into huge sprawling spaces where some amazing larger than life structures astound you. One needs to get out of the buildings area and start walking on the \u2026",
          "Wife and I were visiting from FL. We loved this place, and ended up spending hours there. Great exhibits and beautiful outdoor park and pathway with more installations and structures. Many pieces are monumental in size taking advantage of the wide open space.",

          "I only got to go in the new building, but it was great, it is full of wonderful art and beautiful modern exhibits. The gift shop is very nice but expensive. No stickers\ud83d\ude26",
          "Such a beautiful gem. Walking trails , interesting exhibits, and plenty of free parking",

          "A beautiful park with much to see and enjoy. The trails are awesome and the grounds are always kept clean. The art installments outside and inside are very interesting. I haven't yet watched a concert at the park but I plan to do so this summer. The restaurant is amazing, as well as the coffee shop!",

          "There are two wings and the outdoor art in landscape setting. The NCMA was greater than I expected with lots of diverse art work. The new wing is a contemporary design, minimalistic, and timeless that allows the art to be the attraction. A good collection of Roudin sculptures",

          "This place is quite amazing. Very fine collections of European and African art. The major flaw is where is art from North Carolina? North Carolina has a deep history of art ranging from pottery to fine furnature and textiles. I left flabbergasted that a museum of this quality",
          "We only had time to thoroughly explore one of the two buildings and I look forward to going back -- to wander the first building again AND the second building. Free, no pressure to make a donation larger than you're comfortable with....and a nice gift shop, too, with friendly",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "William B. Umstead State Park is a North Carolina state park in Wake County, North Carolina in the United States. It covers 5,599 acres (22.66 km2) nestled between the expanding cities of Raleigh, Cary, and Durham, North Carolina. It offers hiking, bridle, and bike trails, boat rentals, camping, picnic areas, and educational programs.\nPart of the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000 mile long system of trails connecting Maine to Florida, runs through the park.\n\n\n== History ==\nLong before the first settlers, the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park was an untamed land. American Bison, elk, bobcats and wolves roamed forests of oak, hickory and beech. Native Americans later inhabited the land and avenues of trade were developed nearby. Such avenues included the Occoneeche trail to the north and the Pee Dee trail to the south. In 1774, land grants opened the area for settlement.\nForests were cleared as agricultural interests sprouted. While early farming efforts were successful, poor cultivation practices and one-crop production led to depletion and erosion of the soil. During the Depression, farmers made futile attempts to grow cotton in worn-out soil around Crabtree Creek.\nIn 1934, under the Resettlement Administration, federal and state agencies united to buy 5,000 acres (20 km2) of this submarginal land to develop a recreation area. The Civilian Conservation Corps, as well as the Works Progress Administration, helped construct the site while providing much needed jobs. Four camps along with day-use and picnic facilities were built and the park opened to the public in 1937.\nThe state purchased this area, known as Crabtree Creek Recreational Demonstration Area, for $1, and more facilities were built as the General Assembly made its first state parks division appropriation in the 1940s. In 1950, more than 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) of the park were established as a separate park for African-Americans. This area was named Reedy Creek State Park. Crabtree Creek Recreational Demonstration Area was renamed a few years later after former Governor William Bradley Umstead because of his conservation efforts. In 1966, the Crabtree Creek and Reedy Creek areas were united under the same name; William B. Umstead State Park was open to everyone.\nPrior to the purchase of the land for public use, it had historically been used for timberland, as well as a site for several mills along Crabtree Creek. Remnants of milling operations can still be found preserved within the park.\nDuring segregation, the Highway 70 entrance was for whites and the Reedy Creek entrance for blacks. Currently, the Reedy Creek entrance is the main entrance to the park for North Carolina State University. Forestry courses use this entrance to examine the trees native to the park. Additionally, many Raleigh runners use this more private entrance to run in an area of the park that is less frequented by tourist and hiking groups. The only real remnant of this segregation of entrances is the lack of a public road that connects both entrances - vehicles that access the park by one entrance cannot go through the park to the other side.\n\n\n== Information ==\nUmstead is bordered by Raleigh-Durham International Airport on the west, Interstate 40 on the south, US 70 on the north, and by the western outskirts of Raleigh on the east.  The main bridle and bike trail is Reedy Creek Road, which is open to traffic in western Raleigh (connecting the North Carolina Museum of Art to the park entrance), closed except to rangers' vehicles as it crosses the park from east to west (a distance of 3.5 miles), and then heads south into Cary where it becomes open to traffic again.  At the edge of the park it connects to Black Creek Greenway and the Lake Crabtree County Park trails.  Crabtree Creek also flows across Umstead; its source is Lake Crabtree right at the park's edge, and it flows eastward throughout much of the southern part of the park (with trails in varying degrees of maintenance along its length) and then crosses Reedy Creek Road to flow north.  The main entrances are the two ends of Reedy Creek Road, two entrances off of Ebenezer Church Road in Raleigh near where Crabtree Creek leaves the park, the official Reedy Creek entrance at the end of Cary's Harrison Avenue, and the park's main entrance at Highway 70 in the north.  The latter are equipped with parking lots, bathrooms, and campgrounds; at the Highway 70 entrance there is also a visitors' center and a campground.  Other important bike and bridle trails include Graylyn Road, connecting the Ebenezer Church entrance to Reedy Creek Road, and Turkey Creek Road, which winds through the northern part of the park; hiking trails include the Company Mill trail in the south and the Sycamore Trail in the north, both of which are loops of moderate difficulty, as well as many others.  Bikes and horses are prohibited on hiking trails.\nUmstead is part of the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion.  The topography is hilly, and it has several artificial lakes (which are very common in Wake County, partially due to a flood control plan implemented over the last half-century).\n\n\n== Piedmont Beech Natural Area ==\nIs a 61-acre (0.25 km2) National Natural Landmark located inside the park, which protects a mixed mesophytic forest and maturing stands of beech trees.  The natural area was designated in 1974.  Access to the area is allowed only by special permit.\n\n\n== Nearby state parks ==\nThe following state parks are within 30 miles (48 km) of Umstead State Park:\n\nEno River State Park (Durham County)\nFalls Lake State Recreation Area\nJordan Lake State Recreation Area\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of National Natural Landmarks in North Carolina\nList of Registered Historic Places in North Carolina\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nCrabtree Creek Recreational Demonstration Area (National Park Service)\nNational Register Historic Districts in Raleigh, North Carolina, RHDC\nCrabtree Creek Recreation Area, RHDC",

          "Given the size of this park, it seems like it should be more fun. However, it's difficult to really interact with the lake since the trails around it are so limited, and the park generally is a bit boring. Some of the smaller county parks and local lakes are actually a lot",

          "Went with my wife for Kayaking fun and it was very pleasant, enjoyable, and inexpensive to do. The lake was quiet and we had it pretty much all to ourselves. But my one suggestion is that if you're not in shape skip this activity. It works the arms, shoulders, and in general",
          "We have gone to this park several times over the last couple of weeks. There are a lot of trails and the park is quite large. There are two or three lakes to fish in and also some campgrounds and cabins that you can rent. It's very nice. We love that there's so much green space",

        "wiki": "Pullen Park is a 66.4-acre (0.27 km2) public park immediately west of downtown Raleigh, North Carolina. It is located on Ashe Avenue and is adjacent to the Main and Centennial campuses of North Carolina State University...covering an area between Western Boulevard and historic Hillsborough Street. Founded in 1887, Pullen Park is the oldest public park in North Carolina.The park features picnic areas, a concessions stand along with several small rides including the Pullen Park Carousel, train, and kiddie boats. Pedal boats are also available for rent seasonally on the park's small lake. The Pullen Aquatic Center, Pullen Arts Center and Theatre in the Park are also located on the park grounds. It is one of the most famous and well-known parks in the Research Triangle region.\nThe East Coast Greenway, a 3,000 mile long system of trails connecting Maine to Florida, runs through Pullen Park.\n\n\n== History ==\nPullen Park was founded on March 22, 1887 when Richard Stanhope Pullen donated farmland to the City of Raleigh expressly to be used as a space for recreational enjoyment of its citizens and visitors.  This land became Pullen Park, the first public park in North Carolina, although its founder, always shying from thanks and publicity, opposed giving it his name.  A \"Committee on Public Parks\" was formed to oversee the transformation from farmland to landscaped park and a Park Keeper was hired in 1888 to oversee these modifications.  Pullen continued his own involvement by taking part in the planning and financing of bridges, roads and paths throughout the park as well as the planting of trees and general landscaping in the park and the neighboring NC State University which was built on land also donated by him.  Pullen's landscape design was in keeping with the times.  He also financed a round pavilion for outdoor entertainment and a fountain, located near the city's first swimming pool (for men only) in 1891.  A congressman from another county donated fifty Japanese carp for the fountain which shows the significance of the park even outside of Raleigh.  In 1895 modifications to the structure and regulations of the pool allowed for its use by women. The pool remained in the same place until it was replaced by the Pullen Aquatic Center in 1992 (see: Aquatic Center).\nIn addition to the many attractions in the park today, there was also a small zoo on site from 1899 to 1938. The park's original steam-powered merry-go-round was replaced by the current carousel in 1921.  The zoo was created following a national trend to incorporate zoological parks in public parks which began in the latter quarter of the nineteenth century.  Beginning with only two raccoons, the collection soon grew in size and variety and by 1903 included an Australian owl, mink, bears, alligators and monkeys and many other species.  The zoo eventually closed, most likely due to the death of the Park Keeper, Wiley Howell, who had maintained the zoo and is the namesake for the park's Lake Howell.\nThe original merry-go-round was purchased for $350 in 1914 from the W.D. Chase Bottling Works of Galesburg, Illinois.  It began operating in 1915 but apparently it was in poor condition because the city decided to purchase a replacement Dentzel carousel only five years later.  (see: Carousel) \nAlthough baseball was unofficially played in Pullen Park for many years \u2013 perhaps even before the land became a park - the officially sanctioned field was not created until the unofficial field was renovated in 1920.  A second field was added later.\nIn 2000 the city began making plans to update the park to accommodate Raleigh's growing population and later invited the citizens to take part in the plans.  Over the past several years many changes have been made, including the removal of an iconic 'Swiss cheese' play structure and other playground equipment.  More notable, however, is the new entrance and additional parking that make the park more accessible to more people.Although Jim Crow laws during that era prohibited African-Americans from using some of the park's facilities (e.g. the swimming pool), the park's main areas were open to everyone, and African-Americans in the community were not denied access to the park overall.  \nAccording to the census of the National Amusement Park Historical Association, Pullen Park is the 14th oldest amusement park in the world.The park was closed from December 14, 2009 to November 18, 2011  for extensive renovations including a new, climate-controlled carousel house, welcome center, concessions building, restroom facilities, and train station.  Site improvements include a new entrance, event spaces, playground, underground utilities and picnic shelters.  Additionally, Lake Howell was drained and dredged for regular lake maintenance and to allow for updates including a new boat dock and apron and the installation of a geothermal energy system.\n\n\n== Founder ==\nRichard Stanhope Pullen was born on September 18, 1822 to Turner and Elizabeth Smith Pullen on a small family farm in Wake County, NC.  Little is known about his early life and education, and even in his later life he shied from the press and recognition.  However, it is known that as a young man he began working for his uncle, Richard Smith, in Raleigh.  Eventually Pullen inherited quite a large sum of money from his uncle and began embarking on developing Raleigh through business endeavors as well as philanthropic projects.  His land and monetary donations contributed to the development of city roads, and what later became Peace College, UNC Greensboro, NC State University, Edenton Street United Methodist Church and, of course, Pullen Park.  He remained actively involved in planning and funding improvements to the park until his death in 1895.  No monument or plaque was erected on park ground commemorating his contributions until 1992, as the city feared that this use would violate the clause that stipulated that the land must be used for recreational purposes. The most recognizable monument to Richard Stanhope Pullen for Raleigh residents is the obelisk on the Pullen family plot in Raleigh's Oakwood Cemetery.  In addition, Pullen Hall at NC State University was named in his honor.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nIn addition to several swing sets, sand areas and other various playground equipment for children of all ages, the park also features lighted tennis courts, two ball fields, a lake with paddle boats, covered and uncovered picnic areas, many picturesque paths and bridges, the Aquatic Center, Arts Center and Theatre in the Park.\nThe Aquatic Center and Arts Center both offer classes to all ages in physical fitness, swimming and arts and crafts (pottery, jewelry making, weaving, glass art, etc.) Plays are performed on a regular basis at the internationally acclaimed Theatre in the Park.\n\n\n=== Pullen Aquatic Center ===\nPullen Aquatic Center, completed in 1992, is one of four city-run, public year-round aquatic centers in Raleigh.  It features an Olympic size swimming pool, a warm water therapy pool, a mezzanine with spectator seating, an outdoor patio, and locker room facilities. The center is open for swimming laps as well as recreational swimming and offers water exercise programs, aquatic therapy programs, a city swim league, and American Red Cross Learn-to-Swim lessons, lifeguard training, and instructor-level classes.\nThe Aquatic Center is also used for several local, state, and regional swimming and diving competitions each year, including the Special Olympics of the annual State Games of North Carolina which are held in May/June.  It is located on Ashe Avenue adjacent to Pullen Park.\n\n\n=== Pullen Arts Center ===\nPullen Arts Center offers classes in pottery, jewelry-making, painting, printmaking, weaving, and glass arts. The center has extensive studios and equipment, as well as instructors and knowledgeable staff to help both the accomplished artist and the novice.  The Arts Center also hosts a summer camp program called Art4Fun for children, and special events and gallery exhibits are held throughout the year.\n\n\n=== Theatre in the Park ===\nTheatre in the Park was originally chartered in 1947.  The name was changed in the early 1970s.\nThis air conditioned indoor theatre facility, located in the northern end of the park, includes a beautiful Season Member Lounge, administrative offices, costume shop, technical workshop, dressing rooms, lobby and a flexible 'black box' performance space. Year-round programming includes no less than four mainstage productions, classes, workshops and independent productions.  The theatre is internationally acclaimed and well known locally for Ira David Wood III's musical comedy adaption of Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol,\" an ongoing annual production since 1974.\n\n\n=== Andy Griffith Statue ===\nAlthough monuments and statues have traditionally been avoided due to the clause that stipulates that the land must only be used for recreational purposes, in 2003, the cable television network TV Land permanently loaned a statue of Andy and Opie Taylor depicting a well known scene from The Andy Griffith Show. The addition of this statue was controversial, as citizens of Mount Airy, North Carolina, which the fictional town of Mayberry was ostensibly based on, believed that the statue should be in their town as opposed to Raleigh. The statue has been vandalized several times and its plaque stolen.  The statue was slightly redesigned to prevent further damage.  A second statue of Andy and Opie was later erected in Mount Airy outside the Andy Griffith museum.\n\n\n=== Red Caboose ===\nA real Norfolk Southern Railway 380 bay window red caboose with a Southern Railway paint scheme is displayed in the park for children to explore.\n\n\n== Rides ==\nThe park features four rides with a nominal charge for each.  Tickets are purchased from the office near the park entrance. Adults are welcome on all rides with the exception of the kiddie boats.\n\n\n=== Kiddie Boats ===\nThe kiddie boats, which are intended only for small children, circle in a small pool at a leisurely pace.\n\n\n=== Paddle Boats ===\nLake Howell's Pedalos are available for rental by the half hour. There must be one person aged 16 or older aboard, and the paddle boats can accommodate up to four people each. Life jackets are available. \n\n\n=== Miniature Train ===\n\nA miniature train, added to the park in 1950, goes through a tunnel and around the park. The tunnel and a second train were added in 1971.  The C.P. Huntington Train is a 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge, one-third sized operational miniature train that has thrilled children of all ages since it was added to the park.  The engine is a near exact replica of a locomotive that was built in 1863 at the Danforth-Cook Locomotive works in Paterson, New Jersey which eventually found its way to San Francisco (by way of Cape Horn) when it was purchased by Central Pacific Railroad where C.P. Huntington was then Vice President. On April 9, 1864, it was christened the C.P. Huntington C.P. #3 after its first run.  The locomotive was slated to be destroyed in 1914 but was saved, restored and renamed, and it now resides in Sacramento, CA.\n\n\n=== Carousel ===\n\nThe Pullen Park Carousel was made circa 1912 by master carver Salvatore Cernigliaro of the Dentzel Carousel Company of Germantown, Pennsylvania.  It contains 52 hand-carved basswood animals, 2 chariots (or sleighs), 18 large gilded mirrors and 18 canvas panels and a Wurlitzer 125 organ made in 1924 by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of North Tonawanda, New York.  The Dentzel Carousel Company was the first American carousel company and while thousands of carousels were made in the U.S., there are only approximately 200 antique carousels left today. Fewer than 25 of those are Dentzel carousels, and only 14 of those remain in operation.  Unfortunately, the carousel is often closed for repairs \u2014 a small price to pay to continue to be able to enjoy this beautiful antique ride when it is in good working condition. Many generations of park visitors have enjoyed riding a giraffe, pony or ostrich on the carousel as a child and continue to pass that tradition along to their own children.  The carousel is considered to be the park's most popular attraction.\nThis particular carousel was originally located in Bloomsbury Park (also in Raleigh near what is now known as Five Points) and was moved to Pullen Park in 1921 when the Raleigh City Board (now City Council) voted to replace the park's original steam powered antique merry-go-round.  Bloomsbury Park, an amusement park founded by Carolina Power & Light (CP&L), was apparently in financial trouble and Pullen Park was able to acquire the carousel for only $1,425 \u2014 one tenth of its original cost.  Despite the bargain purchase, this city expenditure angered many Raleigh residents at the time but they soon acquiesced after the new carousel began operation.\n\nThe current carousel underwent major restoration from 1977 to 1982, during which time the original factory paint was uncovered, documented and conserved.  It was the first time such a restoration attempt had been made.  Each hard carved animal was restored to its exact Munsell Color System paint color, preserving the original paint underneath a layer of shellac while enabling the animals to look just as they were originally painted (#sign).  \nIn 1976 the carousel was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and it is also a designated Raleigh Historic Landmark.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPullen Park (Official Website)",

        "wiki": "The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCMNS) is located in Raleigh, North Carolina as the oldest established museum in North Carolina and the largest museum of its kind in the Southeastern United States. With about 1.2 million visitors annually, as of 2013 it was the state's most popular museum or historic destination among visitors.The museum has four facilities on three campuses: the Nature Exploration Center and Nature Research Center on Jones Street in downtown Raleigh, the Prairie Ridge Ecostation satellite facility and outdoor classroom in northwest Raleigh near William B. Umstead State Park, and the former North Carolina Museum of Forestry in Whiteville. NCMNS is a division of the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe North Carolina State Museum was created in 1879, by combining two existing state-owned collections of geologic and agricultural specimens. The museum was originally housed in the Briggs building on Fayetteville Street. The museum's collections, outreach and education programs, and status grew over the next 60 years under the stewardship of H.H. Brimley. As part of the Department of Agriculture, the State Museum moved in 1887 to a former hotel on Edenton Street across from the Capitol building. An annex was added in 1899, but the entire facility was replaced by a purpose-built building in 1924. The facility was later renamed the North Carolina State Museum of Natural History.In the 1950s and again in the 1990s, shifts in education further expanded the museum's holdings as universities donated their collections to the state.  In 1986, it became the North Carolina State Museum of Natural Sciences.A new building opened later and NCMNS became the largest natural history museum in the Southeast.  Also in 2000, the museum expanded with a new location: the Museum of Forestry in Whiteville was added as a satellite campus; this facility was later overhauled and reopened in 2015 as the NC Museum of Natural Sciences in Whiteville. Another location was added in 2004, with the opening of the Prairie Ridge Ecostation for Wildlife and Learning. The museum expanded its downtown campus in 2012, with the adjacent Nature Research Center.The collection now contains more than 1.7 million specimens of amphibians, reptiles, birds,  fish, mammals, invertebrates, invertebrate and vertebrate fossils, plants, geology, and meteorites.NCMNS is administered by the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.\n\n\n== Nature Exploration Center ==\n\n\n=== First floor ===\n\nNatural Treasures of North Carolina contains dioramas of various wildlife and artifacts pertaining to nature in North Carolina.\nCoastal North Carolina includes exhibits of fish native to North Carolina's coast and inland waterways.\nWRAL 3-D Theater \u2013 3-D films are shown daily in this 250-seat venue.\nBox Office\n\n\n=== Second floor ===\nThe North Carolina: Mountains to the Sea exhibit displays North Carolina's natural habitats from the western mountains through the central Piedmont and on to the Coastal Plain highlighting the interrelationships between them.\nUnderground North Carolina features gems and minerals of North Carolina, as well as ground, soil, and seismic displays.\nThe Nature's Explorers exhibit covers the museum's beginnings, showing the tools and techniques naturalists used 100 years ago to collect and preserve specimens.\nThe Discovery Room is a family-oriented hands-on exhibit for exploring the natural world using a combination of natural, live, and human-made objects.\nSpecial Exhibition gallery.\nA bridge to the museum's new building, which also has a timeline on display.\n\n\n=== Third floor ===\n\nPrehistoric North Carolina chronicles prehistoric life in the state and throughout the southeastern United States.\nThe Terror of the South exhibit features fossil skeletons, including an Acrocanthosaurus.\nThe Tropical Connections section is anchored by a large interactive globe which allows visitors to highlight the climate regions of the Earth.

          "If you're in the area, this museum is a priority. I've never seen so many hands on, adult and children friendly, exhibits at a Science museum before. They have an entire section full of taxidermied and preserved specimens in drawers and cabinets that you can touch and explore.",

        "wiki": "Marbles Kids Museum is a nonprofit children's museum located in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina in the Moore Square Historic District.  \nMarbles was founded in 2007 as a result of the merger between Exploris, an interactive global learning center, and Playspace, a children's museum aimed at preschool through early elementary age children. Marbles mission is to \"..spark imagination, discovery and learning through play.\" \n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nMarbles has several permanent, play-based exhibits that align with five core initiatives -  Ready Set Learn, Be Healthy Be Active, Create Innovate, Explore Experiment and Connect. As of late 2019, museum admission is $7 per person.  \n\n\n== IMAX ==\nMarbles has an IMAX theater on its campus that plays first-run Hollywood features and 45-minute documentary movies.\n\n\n== History ==\nMarbles predecessor Exploris opened in 1999 as a $39.5 million state-of-the-art interactive global learning center. Playspace was an interactive children's museum aimed at preschool through early elementary age children.  The move to the former Exploris space is the third move to a larger location in the museum's history. Playspace was originally located two blocks south of Marbles in City Market. It remained there until the late 1990s, moving to 410 Glenwood Avenue in a former dairy building. The non-profit museum received some funding from Wake County but was largely funded by corporate sponsorships of individual exhibits as well as the $5 per person admission price and memberships. In the summer of 2007, the two museums closed. Playspace moved into Exploris' building, and a new name for the combined museums was chosen. Marbles were selected to reflect the museum's unique two-story stainless steel wall grid inset with over 1.2 million marbles. The name was released to the public on September 29, 2007, the same day the new museum opened to the public.\n\n\n== External links ==\nMarbles Kids Museum\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The boys always have such a wonderful and educational time! It\u2019s cheap and great for kids of all ages to explore their imagination. I gave only four stars because the staff is fine but not always very helpful. It\u2019s a pretty big free for all. When they are busy it\u2019s a mad house!",
          "Great place for families with younger kids, say 10 yr old and younger. Lots of hands on things to do, all tailored around an educational experience. The pirate ship is very popular. Ideal place for a school field trip. Entry fee is cheap, just $7. IMAX theater is extra. Two floors of fun, will keep the kids going for several hours.",
          "Spent 3 hours here recently, my son loves it. There are so many things to keep your little one busy. My only complaint, which isn\u2019t the museum\u2019s fault, is that there are so many \u201cmean\u201d children. One girl reminded me of the kid from problem \u2026",
          "This place is awesome for little ones. I have two 4 year olds and they want to come here every weekend. If you have kids and live in the area I would highly recommend getting a membership here. Ours has absolutely paid for itself!",
          "Nice place for kids. Can enjoy a lot. So many zones which can amaze adults too. Only suggestion, at ticket counter,  staff should let consumer know about the deals they have on admission fees. Such as, people with Bank Of America credit or \u2026",
          "It has many areas for kids to play, it's like a kids heaven, all very safe. Learning opportunities, brain games, all sorts of fun. Clean bathroom, enough to change diapers when needed. Very nice staff, cool store to buy souvenirs. My girl wanted to go back there.",
          "Clean, well staffed children's play area. Lots of indoor learning activities as well as climbing and exploring opportunities. If I saw a down point it would be that in total it maybe too stimulating for some kids. Could use some 'blank\" quiet areas for kids and parents to regenerate and rest .",
          "The kids love running around this place.  It's a fun place to play, even before they're able to engage with the educational aspects of the museum.  That said, it is definitely skewed towards K-3rd grade.  Older elementary will be underwhelmed, I suspect.",
          "Its a great place for kids to have an imagination! There is lots to do as well. One thing I kind of don't like is it is always busy. It would probably help if they opened up another place.",
          "We live in Fay and this place is worth the drive! We became members today.  There is so much to do here your kids will never get bored.  Today\u2019s visit was with boys ages 7,6,5 and one girl 13. They all had a great time using their bodies \u2026",
          "Absolutely amazing kids museum. Can easily spend a whole day here. The staff are always friendly, and do their best to keep the museum in tip top shape. If you live in the area and have kids, a membership is a must.",
          "We came from out of town to visit and it was wonderful. The kids loved it, but I was a little concerned about the shared toys, and yes, all the kids got sick within the week, but whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger....? Worth the long trip for us.",
          "What a great place to take your kids for hours and hours of fun mixed with an educational  experience. We love all the stations. Marbles Museum never gets old. My daughter chooses it again and again! Reasonably priced.",

          "Visited over the Labor Day Holiday and we all had a blast. My kids had so much fun. I couldn't get my son away from the Lego area and my daughter loved the Crafting area. We were with my sister-in-law and 10 month old niece and even they \u2026",
          "Great place for kids to have fun. They have the play areas and even the science and art section.overall good for to keep the little ones engaged for a good few hours. The only main concern would be parking , considering it's location in downtown Raleigh. This place is almost always crowded.",
          "Fun, fun, fun! Great place to spend hours with your family. There are so many hands on, imaginative play exhibits! It's the perfect way to spark the imagination and have  creative fun! Can't wait to return!",
          "Experience varies based visit. The variable being the traffic, which they can accommodate a large amount of but once it hits a certain level, the competition for attractions becomes too high. The educational value of the activities is on \u2026",
          "Amazing! Not from NC but visiting and took my 3 year old here to play for the day. Impressive to say the least. Very clean and open. Will be back when in town for sure.",
          "Marbles is good fun. The two story children's museum has everything from a farm, pirate ship, gardens, camping area, water toys, sandbox, sports area, ball pit/play area, creative areas, and so much more. The staff is always friendly and \u2026",
          "This is an amazing place for kids and adults!  Our 18 month old grandson loves it, especially the water area and the store/shopping area too!  But Saturday\u2019s are hopping, so go early!",
          "Our kids had an absolute great time at this museum. They played with all the interactive exhibits from the vehicles to the musical stairs that play notes and lights as you walk up them. So much going that it is tough to get through it all. \u2026",
          "This place is great! This is one of our favorite children's museums we've visited, and we've visited many! The fire truck, ambulance area is great. Pirate ship and submarine. Piggy bank with slide. All kinds of stuff. We visit any time we're in town.",
          "Our kids love this place. \nThere is IMAX too. \nThe new park across the street is great with the square burger. \nYou will not go wrong with this.\nBirthday parties and adult parties too. \nAdded new golf area, indoor. \nAlways happening. \u2026",
          "This place is a such a cool experience to bring your kids to. I have brought my sister here and it was very fun for not only her but me as well! You are able to play with them and they can also socialize with other kids too. Very cool place!",
          "Drove an hour to come here. Plenty of things to entertain all age range of kids. We brought 4 kids from 4 to 8 years old and spent around 3 hours here and they loved every minute. We came on a Saturday so very busy but there was plenty of things to do.",
          "We took our kids here to celebrate a birthday and it was great! So much for the kids to see and do and the price was great. They offer military discounts which is an added bonus for our large family. A little crowded, but that's to be \u2026",
          "We love Marbles! Get a membership and if you go just a few times you\u2019ll get your monies worth! My Grandkids love the place and I can read while they play. It\u2019s obviously very busy on the weekends but it\u2019s not like you have to wait in big lines to enjoy the place! If you have a 100 or so bucks to spare your kids won\u2019t regret it! \ud83d\ude02",
          "Really nice place for kids! Super great atmosphere \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
          "Truly excellent place for kids. Educational, sensory, imaginative; a wonderful place to take kids to learn, play and explore. The staff are kind, the crafts always change and my kids leave thrilled every time.",
          "Great value for the price. The various themed spaces were generally well curated and the kids had a blast. When we visited they had a BOA promotion, each Bank of America card holder received free entry to the museum. I did not have my card \u2026",
          "Great experience.  Kids really enjoyed it. Alot of different sections with its own theme for kids not to get bored.  Not pricey either.",
          "This place is awesome!  I WISH I was a kid again to take more advantage of the fun they have created that is at the same time educational and inspiring.  Gotta go see an IMax movie there next I think.",
          "I wish so much that there were more places like this for kids. It's fun for adults, teens, kids...everyone! So many activities like cooking, dancing, arts & crafts, blocks, money management, story time, play vehicles...we were there for 2.5 \u2026",
          "The best place for kids to run around and let their imaginations run wild.  Wish they had this in every city.  Have your child wear something bright since it can be hard to keep track of them with so many kids running around.",

          "Great museum for children. Found this in trip advisor for our visit to N. Carolina. Lots of options and there is something for all age ranges. Our toddler was able to play for ours and we had an impromptu volleyball game with another \u2026",

          "My boys love the different exhibits and variety of learning activities within marbles. The price is very affordable for the three to four hours they enjoy each visit.",
          "A very fun place to come with kids, they have so many interesting play options, many of which are hard to recreate at home. I wouldn\u2019t come here too often just because it is a bit overwhelming, but it\u2019s definitely worth a trip!",
          "My 4yo nephew loves this place! He never runs out of things to play with and the staff is always friendly, helpful and present. It feels like a safe place where kids can scream and run and BE KIDS without fear of them hurting themselves, \u2026",
          "Amazing! One of the first places we've felt comfortable turning loose our toddler and just following within eye sight. Wonderful place where children of all ages and play, explore, and touch everything! We're members and look forward to \u2026",
          "Impressed with this truly HANDS ON museum.  The layout is such that adults have breathing room from a comfortable visual distance while children are free to explore.  The only negative is that we didn\u2019t have enough time to explore it more fully!",
          "We had a great time. Awesome place. Lots of things to do. Check their web site for dates/times when you get 50% off of admission.",
          "Yes this place is awesome and kids love it but be prepared for your child to get sick within a few days of visiting. My son got pink eye from our visit last week. There is no hand sanitizer available for use. There should be hand sanitizer in every room. I never see anyone cleaning when we visit. You have been warned!",
          "Great activity for kids! My kids love this place. It\u2019s very affordable and will have your kids active and imagining all day long. There is no shortage of activities to do and the coolest pirate ship. Very cute for kids. It\u2019s very clean and well run. Great museum guys!",
          "Went for the 21+ Star Wars event, and it was a good value for the admission cost. It  was geared more towards the casual fans than the diehards, but what made the event really neat was getting to wander through the museum without kids. The \u2026",
          "Marbles is always great! It is always kept very clean, the staff are friendly and helpful, and my older kids (9, 13, and 14) always have a blast, even as they come into their teen years. We can easily spend the whole day!",
          "It has a wide variety of play areas that are well maintained by attentive staff! Parking is a bit of a struggle but during the week there are parking garages near by and on weekends street parking is free. Extremely fun ^_^",
          "A fun (albeit hectic) place to take the kids. They'll love all the different interactions, activities, sights to take in. You'll all be exhausted by the time you've gone through it all. The smiles on the kids' faces are worth it!",
          "Cool museum for kids. Lots of things to do. However, there is a day camp with kids not greatly supervised and depending on your visit it can become crowded with people.",
          "Great fun! Even had princess tea with costumes! Financially it makes sense to buy a family membership if you're going regularly. For a family of 5 spending over $30bucks a pop doesnt make sense.",
          "It's just a lot of fun and things for the kids to learn and lots of walking but I did enjoy it. So did my Grandson thank you for asking.",

          "What a place! My son had a blast and we will definitely be back. Sadly, I think many parents missed the fun by being on their phones. There was a lot to do with my son and a lot he could do on his own, which is just what a developing child needs.",

          "This was a super fun museum.  We had an 8 year old, 6, and 4.  There was plenty for everyone to play with and also play together.  I especially love the fitness room where kids can get active and jump around on gymnastics type equipment. \u2026",

          "It was actually really fun for my two girls! There's tons of stuff that a child can do at this place. The one thing I would suggest is to have multiple hand sanitizer stations throughout the museum to help reduce sickness.",
          "My husband and I took our 15 month old to Marbles today (Sunday) and we had a fantastic time!! When we arrived around 9:30 there was already a line for tickets but it moved quickly. They were fairly crowded but there was also a \u201cgroup \u2026",

          "This place is impressive!! The mind(s) behind it either have kids and/or are kids at heart for sure. My 1 and 2 year old are happy when they arrive and are mad when I make them leave but most \u201crooms\u201d are excellent for older children. They have hand sanitizer all over the place. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "My kids loved it here and wanted to come back the next day. My only advice: come after lunch on weekdays. Before lunch it's just as crowded as Disney. After lunch it's so empty you'll wonder how they stay in business",
          "It Is a great place for kids.  There is lot to do.  Bathrooms at the end of the day were dirty.",
          "Awesome hands on museum for kids of all ages & adults as well. Even at busy times it is very spacious and doesn't feel crowded. Only downfall about visiting here is trying to find parking downtown and having to feed the meter...they do have a small parking lot behind museum, but fills up quickly all day!!!",
          "Wonderful place My son loved it my 13 year old sister loved it",
          "Wonderful place for kids! My granddaughter spent hours playing, learning and having fun. She didn't wanna leave the place. She loved to play with the food in the kitchen and at the supermarket.  She loved all the entertainment at the second floor. We will come back soon.",
          "Great museum but I went for the adult Star Wars event and as a super fan of Star Wars, this was not the event to go to. Unfortunately, it just catered to the drunk and disorderly crowd of downtown Friday night. Honestly wish there was some \u2026",
          "Not what we were expecting. Would be a good place for younger children.",
          "Our kids could spend DAYS here. Some really great exhibits and learning opportunities through play. We were gifted a membership and have absolutely loved it!",

          "My wife's grandchildren were here for a week and we took them of course to marbles. The minute they hit the front door it was on and they continue to enjoy themselves until we had to go home. It was hard for them to leave but this is what this museum is all about. Totally Interactive and fun!",
          "My daughter loved it will recommend everyone to go there.",
          "The Marbles Kids Museum was highly recommended and did not disappoint! It was so much fun, especially on a rainy day. Each room is a new adventure that gets kid's imaginations working! Parents can also play and enjoy themselves. There are \u2026",

          "Really great place to bring children ages 3-10. All types of activities to peak different interests.",
          "Excellent as always. With one caveat... Their restaurant has been a little disappointing as far as the quality of the fruit. And this is the past several times I've been there. Also today the unsweet tea tasted like it was left over from yesterday. But otherwise, the kids always loved the food!",
          "Love this place! Very engaging and fun way to spend a day with your child. My 9 month old loved it, but is more directed to 2 and up children. Still recommend to any parents, plus has a great IMAX theater in the back",

          "Carried our 19 month grand daughter to Marbles. Had a great time!  Plenty to do for any age youngster.  Staff was very friendly!  We spent about 2 1/2 hours there.  I can easily see a longer stay as she gets older.  Will definitely go back!",
          "We've brought our daughter as a one year old, two year old, and when she was nearly four, and each visit was a unique, fun-filled experience. The exhibits are constantly rotated, and they have wonderful activities for kids off all ages. We highly recommend it!",

          "First time there and it had everything you could think of and more for a kid and/or \"big kid\" to have fun. Loved how kids were learning without even knowing it because they were having too much fun playing. Plan on coming back every time we visit NC",
          "Great place to take your children. Ages up to 15 would do well.",
          "Our 7-year-old asks to come here all the time. We've been here a few times over the last few years and it hasn't changed much. That's not necessarily a bad thing when it's good to begin with! Lots of interactive exhibits to keep your kids happy for an afternoon.",

          "Best children's \"play\" museum I have visited. Good for kids up to about 12-13. Adults should really get reduced or free admition as the entire place is built for children, adults are just tour guides.  My 15yo entertained herself at the \u2026",
          "I love this place went for my birthday with the kids their b day was the day before mine",
          "We literally go here every time we're in Raleigh sometimes multiple times during the same visit. It is a must see if you are in the area, and in our opinion it's worth coming to Raleigh just for the museum.",

          "Took my kids here in 2015. They had a really great time.",

          "it was dope i brought my child there to interact with the others of his species. five stars.",
          "Definitely geared toward younger kids, I think. The compact arrangement makes it difficult to hold your attention on one thing for very long, because from any point in the facility, you can see probably 6 different exhibits, all of which \u2026",
          "Great fun for kids but a little pricey admission.",
          "A wonderful place for kids and adults to spend time together",

          "This is the rating my kids are giving. I would have to agree. Friendly staff and a safe and fun environment. Lots of cool activities. Good place for them to blow off some steam and energy.",

          "Marbles Museum is always a fun time for everyone. There's lots of things for kids off all ages to be occupied with; building, imaginative play, art, athletics, science, IMAX (extra), and so much more. We always come home tired and happy. Lots of seating throughout the museum. Definitely a must do if you have kids!",
          "This museum should be a model for kids' museums in all major cities.  Each child sized room (farm, kitchen, grocery, campsite, under the sea and more) allowed interactive play coupled with hands on learning.  Designed for the under 10 \u2026",

          "There aren\u2019t enough words to share how much we love marbles kids museum! The family membership is your best value if you plan to go more than once or twice. Late night Thursdays are always fun and a cheap night to bring friends! I love that \u2026",
          "Great for what it is...Five stars for five years old and under.. Ennnh two stars for anyone older than five. Not much worthwhile stimulation or educational for much over kindergarteners. What is there is done well for the younger ones and staff and facility are great but rather below anyone older.",
          "This place is huge and full of experiences for kids. Definitely worth a trip.",
          "Great place for children's free play! There are so many different areas for kids to explore.",
          "Never took my 15 month old kid there because I always thought he was too young and wouldn\u2019t have fun - I was wrong. This place has stuff to do for babies who are just starting to sit up! The staff is phenomenal and the parking is great. Will definitely be coming here again.",
          "Place needs some repair, but it's always fun for the kids.",

          "By far this place is better than any other children museum I have been to.",

          "Many things for kids to do. Awesome place on a rain or a regular day.",
          "Best children's  museum I've ever visited. Tons to do, great exhibits. The only thing I think could be improved is that someone needs to tidy up periodically, because it looks like a tornado went through the downstairs area.",
          "Perfect playdate and creative activities we had a blast",
          "Great place to take the kids to place right in the heart of Raleigh. Admission was only $7 and we were able to spend about 3 hours playing. There is plenty of seating for parents to relax while their child plays. While in the area, make \u2026",

          "This was a lot of fun with the kids. They had a blast. We spent about 3 hours there and there was plenty we didn't get to do. There's also a movie theater and cool outdoor area. Another bonus was that our annual passes from the Orlando Science Center got us in for free.",
          "There is only one thing that can make a trip to Marbles a little less enjoyable, and that is a large crowd of people. Other than that, kids and adults can all enjoy at least something about the museum. The price is great, the various \u2026",
          "Had a great tie with the kids, great fun and lots of activities to keep them busy.",
          "It is a cool museum  full of fun and interactive displays for children. However, I feel like it is geared more towards smaller kids. Any child over 7 or 8 isn't going to have as much fun in my opinion. My oldest is 11 and my youngest is 8 and they were pretty bored after 5mins of being there.",

          "One of the most fun kid's museums I've been too! Lots of exploratory areas to peak a child's imagination and engage them in building or playing and just being a kid.

          "Great amazing \ud83d\ude0d experience for family members; cheap movie!",
          "Amazing! Wish the cafe was connected to the building but hear they are working on that. My kids (5 & 7 years old) love this place, and there are so many options for them to stimulate their minds. Even when it\u2019s crowded, there are so many exhibits that it doesn\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t move around. We will be back!",

          "Marbles is great for kids, ours had a blast there. There is loads for the kids to do and plenty of areas to explore so you can easily spend a whole day there. You will need to leave to have lunch. Also try to plan your visit on a Monday, other days can be busy with school",
          "This is a great way to spend a day if you have little ones, there are plenty of things for them to do. I recommend seeing it",
          "I went there for a couple of hours but realised that I could have stayed longer. My 3 year old enjoyed his time there. It is educational as well in its own way. He learnt about power generation and I introduced the concept of a bank to him for the first time. Good fun. I",
          "Marbles is truly engaging for children, but be sure to remind little ones to wash hands and avoid touching their face during play. Unfortunately, kiddos can tend to get sick within a day or two of each visit. Great rainy-day activities!",
          "I took a child I was babysitting to the museum. She was so engaged that she seemed to forget I was there. Most of our time was spent in the money management room. It was a nice time for both.",

          "This is a must stop for families! We took our granddaughter and as an art major, I've been dying for her to get old enough to \"do\" art together and we did on the 2nd floor. Plan ample time as there is SO much to do here. Everyone loved it, kids and adults alike. Highly recommend.",

          "We are members and it is well worth it. There are countless things to do for any child (even those that are children at heart). They have hand sanitizers upon the wall throughout the whole place which is an added bonus. We roughly spend two hours here. My two year old enjoys",
          "Great museum for children. Found this in trip advisor for our visit to N. Carolina. Lots of options and there is something for all age ranges. Our toddler was able to play for ours and we had an impromptu volleyball game with another family. Also love the movie theater that",
          "Great learning experience but it\u2019s like an under staffed mad house. Can\u2019t really enjoy anything because someone is yelling throwing and things are never in the right spot. Broken things everywhere. If u can seem to enjoy anything it\u2019s pretty educational",
          "This museum is designed for children and is packed all the time. Parents bring sick children as well which is so wrong on so many levels.The restroom was dirty and had no hand soap. While the kids are supervised by staff they largely run free through the multi levels. The",

          "An excellent experience for my 6 and 4 and half year old. We had to drag them away from each station so we could see most of it. Even after 4 hours they were still going strong. Great attraction and free parking in the garage on Sundays.",

          "We brought our young son here for a day out. The man with the family in front of us told the unarmed security guard he was a police officer and showed his badge but was told he would need to lock his gun in his car. There were other people who just walked in with large",

          "Definitively worth it! It is wonderful for younger kids (up to 7y.o.), however, the upper levels have some interesting areas that can be fun for all ages. They have lots of hands-on activities and colors. many activities are educational and fun. It is super cheap! I paid $45 for",

          "We took our 2 young grandsons here for an afternoon of fun and they had such a good time that they didn\u2019t want to leave. Our youngest grandson really enjoyed the mini golf in the game room. Our older grandson\u2019s favorite thing was the hockey rink where he played goalie. After",
          "My husband and I have brought our daughter here twice and she loves it! There is so many interactive areas to keep the kid entertained. You can easily pass an hour or 2 here if you really take the time to enjoy each area. Parking directly in front of the museum is possible but",

          "Marbles is a child's delight and a perfect spot to run off energy. If you cannot go on a \"group free\" day, it's helpful to go after lunch when groups start heading out and noise levels go down to tolerable. It's a bargain and we plan to return for an IMAX movie. Their little",

          "Plenty of activities to keep the kids busy for a day. I would suggest parents bring a book or something else to keep them occupied. Kids will be happy to spend 20-30 minutes at each play station. There is enough variety to keep them occupied for a full day if you want to.",

          "We brought our 3 year old granddaughter here and our 9 month old grandson. Of course, there was little for our grandson to do, but it was definitely a stroller friendly environment. Best thing? When you granddaughter asked us the next day if we could go back! Great place!!!!",
          "This is a fabulous place for children. We took our grandchildren recently (ages 3 and 6) and they loved it! Many elementary school classes go there on field trips. Even though the place was full of children on a rainy Saturday, it never seemed crowded. There are so many",
          "I took my kids to the museum just for time pass but my kids enjoyed it So much that I had to bring them again the next day. Kids can play here for the whole day. So many things to play that kids won't go home.",
          "Took my 2 grand children (5/7 year old boys). It is their kind of place. They ran, jumped, skipped, played, etc.. meant for the kids, it has everything. It is educational but in a fun way. It is very reasonable and inexpensive for the amount of fun the boys had. Definitely",
          "My sister and I took the kids out for the day. The kids had so much fun. It was so much for all ages to do. We laughed and had a ball. I recommend to all parents with kids.",
          "My son was 15 months old when we went. He loved it. From the play food to the basketball court to the water table he had a great time! I would definitely stop by if you are in the area!",
          "My kids have gone there several times and always enjoyed it. Now that they are older and becoming tweens they didn't find nearly as fascinating as when they were younger.",
          "We had a blast here. The kids were so excited and used a ton of energy. The big kids had a wonderful time playing too! Fun & educational - highly recommend it!",
          "Lot of fun to go here with kids, or just by yourself. Gets very crowded on the weekends as you would imagine. Parking can be a little challenging but worth it.",
          "My grandchildren love this museum-but I think the word museum is a bit misleading. There are dedicated spaces for pretend play and interactive play. Children are exposed to transportation (bus, boat, ambulance and other fun modes) along with veterinary, kitchen, animals-an",
          "This museum is a great place for kids - I would refer to it as more of a gigantic play zone versus a museum, though. I would say it's best for those 12 and under. The price is right, there is inexpensive parking nearby. My only area for improvement is to have regular staff",
          "The little people (7, 4, and 2) had a blast. Tons of things to do. Fair admission price for the amount of activities. Highly recommend.",
          "This museum had many great, hand on experiences for the kids. You definitely need to dedicate a full day to see and experience everything. My daughter has already asked to go back ASAP!",
          "We have visited Marbles several times with kids, and it is a great place to entertain kids. However, my wife and I really enjoy the iMax theater. We have visited the iMax 3 times, the latest was for the Star Wars movie. The theater has about 300 seats, all are comfortable and",
          "This is what every children's museum should strive for. This place was modeled from a kid's imagination on steroids and it is filled with interactive, educational and most importantly fun exhibits. Each area is large and there are plenty of places for parents to sit and watch",
          "The best children\u2019s museum we have been to, without question. We love it there, so much to do and see. All exhibits were well planned and detailed with kids in mind. Plan to spend at least three hours and even then you will not have time for each exhibit.",
          "It\u2019s been several years since I\u2019ve been to marbles with a little one & the upgrades they\u2019ve made since then were well worth it. It\u2019s a great place for an afternoon of play when it\u2019s too hot, too cold or rainy outside. Definitely will come back again!",
          "This is the most best place to take your children and let them have a blast my nephew loves the water play and everything else that you have for them to play with. I would highly recommend it to anyone.",
          "We took our nephews to Marbles and they had a ball! Lots of interactive activities to keep them occupied and the price is a very affordable $5.",
          "Love coming here with my grand children and nephew. There is plenty to do for ALL age groups. Only $5. Per person to play all day. We all have a great time when we come here.",
          "We were looking for regional things to do on our recent trip here. Taking kids to campus tours, while keeping younger ones entertained....was easy with a stop in to Marbles. So many of the exhibits were interactive and easier for middlers to digest devoid of parents.",
          "We took several of our grandchildren to the museum and they absolutely loved it. Hands on is very important to kids of all ages and Marbles is hands on from start to finish. On this trip the kids were between 3 and 10 years old. Each one found parts of the museum they loved.",
          "We are frequent visitors with our 6 and 8 year old grandchildren. Many areas of hands on fun, experiments and games. Large building blocks, make your ur own race car, pirate ship, hockey rink for playing on socks, and musical stairs. Fun for very young to preteen.",
          "I wish we had more than a day here since our 2 year old really enjoyed her time here. She particularly loved the area immediately after the gift shop. She went from the grocery/kitchen area to the farm area and back so many times that I lost count. I am also the proud owner of",
          "I cannot say enough amazing things about this museum!! There really should be one in very city!! Here's an overview and I truly think visitors with kids should visit. Pros - 1. Toddler area and the intro dress up area is amazing. Easy to manage and watch kids while they run",
          "My family and I had lots of fun at Marbles! There were so many things to do and play with my son, who is 18 months just kept running around and didn't even know where to start. It was fairly crowded when we went but it was also the Thanksgiving Holiday. The price was great.",
          "My husband and I took our 18 month old daughter for something to do. Lots of activities and places for just small kids too. She had a great time playing and looking at all the different exhibits. Will definitely come again.",
          "Sought out this museum as something to do in Raleigh before we went on to the beach. A place where kids can get in hands on without having to have everything explained as at a more sophisticated museum like Museum of Natural Sciences, which they also enjoyed another trip to NC.",
          "I've been here a couple times. It's wonderful for children of all ages. Very clean and well organized. Makes a great day trip!",
          "Visited on a rainy day while visiting Raleigh. Typical kids museum fare, but done well. Lots of nice interactive exhibits to keep kids of all ages entertained for hours. Large enough to handle big crowds.",
          "We live in Durham so this museum is a bit far for us compared to life and science museum. Life and science museum has a lot of outdoor activity area, however, Marbles kids museum is mainly indoor. We only went there every first week each month because of bankofAmerica card free",
          "Love visiting the IMAX theater. I have seen several films there and this theater makes you feel like you are right there! The hands-on activities are great in demonstrating how things work. Go as you will not be disappointed!",
          "We took our 3, 5 and 7 year old grandsons to this museum and they didn't want to leave. The museum is full of hands on activities geared to children. The activities allow the children to play and learn at the same time. We spent 2 1/2 hours at the museum and could have stayed",
          "This is such a fantastic place to spend a morning or afternoon. Entry was $5 per person and it offers so many different activities and is a must for a family with young children.",
          "We love bringing our children to the museum! There are always fun side activists planned and the IMAX theater is right next door. Great rainy day outing. Weekends can get crowded, best to go on a weekday morning.",
          "Took my 4 year old son, his little sister and 6 year old cousin. They had a blast exploring each section of the museum. There is just too much to do in one day. Overall it is a perfect activity for kids. I will definitely go back We also ate lunch at the restaurant. Food",
          "I am from NYC and every summer, my family and I drive from NYC to Florida and back. We like to break up the drive coming back so we can enjoy our vacation just a little longer. I can't remember how I found this place, but we have now made this our destination stop every time we",
          "This is a wonderful option for kids in downtown Raleigh. There are free buses that come from all over the city. There is an I-Max there also. It was surprising inexpensive. There is also a dinning facility there inside but many restaurants in the area.",
          "This place is good for the younger kids, but sometimes it gets quite crowded, especially if you get there when they are having birthday parties, or school outings etc. But the kids seem to like it.",
          "Marbles was like an epic-mega playhouse that seemed really best suited to those 7 and under. My 2 year old had a great time and there were so many different areas to explore. This is less of a \"hands on museum\" and more of a really great indoor play area. It was well staffed and",
          "This is not your ordinary children's museum. It is a totally hands on experiential, learning environment with plenty of helpful staff hovering about to help keep the peace and explain how things work. My grandson never wants to leave when the time is up.",
          "Where can you go to ensure your child exerts lots of energy and will learn a bunch of things at the same time? Marbles, marbles, marbles... We recently went here for Marbles 10th birthday which was filled with a whole lot of fun. The kids could play all night until 10pm, they",
          "We took our two year old daughter here and she loved it. It was nice to go somewhere and just let her lead the way where she was free to touch and play with whatever she wanted. There are so many different areas to explore and learn. Highly recommend!!",
          "Great interactive place for kids!! Our grandkids (5 & 2) loved this place. They could run around with limited supervision, mess everything up and we didn't have to clean up after them! They were enthralled by everything - especially the musical stairs!",
          "Great place to take your kids on a rainy day (and even on a sunny day)!! There are all sorts of activities to captivate your child, my two year old granddaughter was a scientist, a meteorologist, a grocer and most of all, happy and engaged!! There are things for kids of all",
          "About two months after we moved to the Raleigh area in 2008 we decided to explore Marbles with our two toddlers. We meant to stay an hour, stayed the day, and took our entrance receipt back to the register to get credit for the day toward a year long membership. We've remained",
          "This place is great! It's fun to go here each year to see what different types of activities the kids grow to enjoy each time. I've taken a 3 year old, 4 year old, and 5 year old here. We spent probably 2.5 hours but he would've stayed for many more! They have everything you",
          "Wonderful museum for kids and adults. Also, our son and daughter in law got married here (not during museum hours). The staff was terrific. All around good place.",
          "Grandson had the best day and did not want to leave! So many activities to participates and interact with other children. Plenty of activities to interest any youngster. Only $5.00 for each persons admission fee.",
          "Marbles is the perfect answer for rainy days, weird cousin's visit, different levels of playing abilities, awkward kids and holiday entertainment when nothing else is open. Everything is \"hands on\" and there is something interesting and fascinating for every age child up to 10.",
          "Great place for younger kids. My oldest who is now 14 has pretty much outgrown it other than a few sports things but my 10 year old and toddler have a great time. Best time to go is during the week when school is in if possible or on Sundays.",
          "We always go here when our grandchildren are visiting and they all love it!!! They have something for all age groups. Very inexpensive! Only $5 per person",
          "We have been coming to Marbles for about 3 years. We bring our son (who is 6) multiple times a year; making the 2 hour drive there and back. There is always something new and different for him to try at every age. We always end up spending anywhere from 2 hours to 4 hours b/c",
          "This indoor play facility is our granddaughter\u00b4s favorite place in town, with lots of hands-on, creative activities, all materials needed are provided, with helpful and friendly staff to guide you.",
          "With twin 6 year Chinese children who speak little English with us, we spent an entire day enjoying the various activities. Upstairs is more oriented to older children and both the boy and girl were totally immersed in the workshop area. All of the activities appealed to both.",
          "This is a great place to spend the afternoon! We took our two grandsons and they had lots of fun playing and exploring. The museum is two floors of exhibits covering a variety of activities. There is a parking deck close by, so convenient location downtown. The facility also",
          "Great museum for kids. Lots of interesting things to do fir them. The place might be a little noisy for the adults.",
          "A full day of activity for the four year old, we could hardly keep up with her. The museum is both fun and educational for the kids. Highly recommend!",
          "The Marble Kid's Museum is the perfect place for the 2-10 year old child to learn and play. The first floor is geared to the younger child, 2-5, while the second floor caters to the 5-10 year old. But our 6 year old granddaughter enjoyed both floors very much. Her favorite",
          "You can take your kids, or a small or large group of children, and have fun all day. The place is huge with plenty of themes to entertain the little monsters for hours. We take our grandchildren and have almost as much fun by watching them. They serve fairly good food and drinks",
          "We have only lived here for 6 months and have struggled to find a lot of activities for our kids. Marbles is one spot that they absolutely love. We have a 4 and 2 year old and both love their experience. Always a solid choice for our family!",
          "I would recommend this place for children under ten. It seems more geared to them. With that said. Wow wow wow. You do have to pay to get in but it's worth it. Your kid will be occupied for hours. Two floors of education and exercise. Very hands on, let their imagination run",
          "My daughter enjoyed it very much! There are too many undisciplined kids. I truly feel sorry for the cleaning crew. It's as though parents bring their children there and just let their kid do as they please while said parents are staring at their phone the whole time. Kids will",
          "We took two sets of great-grandchildren on different occasion and both had a great time. There are hands-on activities everywhere. Also, there are dress up areas where they can act like firemen, actors, farmers, cooks and bankers. There is a toddler play area away from the",
          "Excellent selection of kid activities from games to crafts and play areas. We spent 6 hours and did not see everything.",
          "Took my grandchildren here and they had a ball. Many things to do for all ages, from my 2 yr old grandchildren to my 12 yr old grandchildren. Will go again.",
          "There is something here for every kid. Great fun! We took our 3 year old nephew here and he loved the water play area. The outdoor music space was also a favourite.",
          "Great family outing for kids. They have different types of hands on activities kids will enjoy. I especially wnjoyed the hand on crafting and sports areas. Check out the calendar for fun events.",
          "My wife and I took our daughter's family to the Marbles Museum (4-2-6 months). They enjoyed themselves, the only draw back was there needed to be more delineation between some of the older kids and the toddlers. Some of the toddlers were having a difficult time with some of",
          "This makes our children's museum look so small! Marbles is two story and has something for all kids. It gets a little busy on weekends, but it's so big that you can always use whatever area you want without feeling too overcrowded. Excellent choice for my 18 month old and my 5",
          "Big kids aren't going to have a lot to do here. It's great if you have preschool children. There are a lot of interactive exhibits and a lot of things for small children to do",
          "While I previously reviewed the museum, I found the CAFE worthy of its own attention. We were pleasantly surprised because previous experiences with museum eateries had been overpriced and less than good tasting. Not here! Prices were reasonable, workers ultra friendly.",
          "My ten year old daughter and I visited today. We had a blast!! I've been to several children's museums across North Carolina, and I must say that Marbles is the best. The admission is very reasonable. We loved the variety of exhibits, but especially enjoyed the life size",
          "Excellent source of learning for children at the same time Hands-On activities a lot of fun. Everything there is geared to using their hands, their minds, and their imaginations. Lots of teaching tools. It's also a lot of fun for adults...very interesting.",
          "Took my 3yr old and 1yr there. Spent at least 2 hrs and could have spent much longer there. Great place with lots of activities for all ages!",
          "This place was recommended to us by a friend who had just visited here. While we were in N.C. for a baseball tournament we took our youngest son here for the day. He LOVED it!!! This place is great for kids and adults. There are so many activities that are hands on and great",
          "Took the whole family, grand parents too. So much for kids of all ages. Interactive fun and even a garden with huge sunflowers. IMAX theater is impressive.",
          "This is simply a Must See; Must Do; Must Experience Museum for children if you are any where near Raleigh! It is professionally designed and executed. Our little guy ran from exhibit to exhibit until he was thoroughly wiped out, and still did not want to leave. The exhibits are",
          "This museum is a place where kids is allowed to hands one explore and learn while playing, it's like a humongous playground yet with a great teaching and learning at the same time",
          "We had a great time. The admission price was $5 per person, which is awesome to us! Our daughters have been once before and have begged us to go back. It was crowded, but honestly, it wasn't bad. There is so much to do.",
          "Are you in Raleigh NC? Do you have kids? If you answered \"yes\" to both, then go to the Marble Kids Museum now. It's perfect for kids -- with a massive \"ball\" room, pirate ship, costume stations, hula hoops, nerf guns, and a movie theater. Get the picture? Parents lean back",
          "I took my four year grandson and he had a blast! He let his imagination run free. He was a vet, grocery checker, doctor, meteorologist and more. Played basketball, surfed .. I can barely remember everything he enjoyed. He wants to go every week. I love seeing him play free",
          "Took the grandkids two weekends in a row and they always have a great time. However, this is a place that requires constant parent supervision, including parents teaching their children to be considerate of other. Damaged and displaced items (toys, etc) are all over the floor",
          "My kids love Marbles. We have spent many wonderful days here. It is wonderful that many of the centers stay consistent yet there are many that change so there is always something familiar but always something new to explore.",
          "Awesome Museum, took my 4 and 5 year old ....One of a kind place in the Raleigh area..This is an inexpensive way to spend a day with kids. There are two floors of fun, hands-on activities and a very relaxing outdoor water and music garden (that's my favorite thing lol). I also",
          "I took my 13 year old grandson here. It is amazing place for kids probably ten and under. All kinds of imagination at work!! Not too exciting for a teenager though. We did enjoy a couple games of checkers, kerplunk, and shot some hoops. But definitely worth the economical entry",
          "This place is the ultimate hands on for ALL ages. So much to learn. So much to do. So many children to help your kids as well. Ages are well mixed, excellent staff, excellent little cafe. Right in the middle of downtown.",
          "Took my 14 month old granddaughter and we had a blast. Play store, aquarium, water splush splash, down at the farm.... Lots of inventive, interactive play spaces.. Crowded but everything still felt safe and well managed. Lots of games, experiments for school age kids as well.",
          "We've gone to Marbles as a family as well on a few of the school field trips. Have been going here since the kids were ages 3/4 and now they are 6/7. Its especially a great place to go on hot, cold or rainy days where you are looking for something inside to do. They have",
          "My daughter and I took my 21-month old granddaughter here to kill time while waiting for family to meet up with us. So it was a spontaneous trip. I figured it would be a great spot to let her run around. I was sooooooo right! She played everywhere. We even participated in an",
          "Many interesting hands on activities for children of all ages, and the adults who accompany them! My granddaughters who are 12, 10 and 5 all had a wonderful time. The only helpful suggestion I have is that there should NOT be hats the children (of course) want to wear in the",
          "A museum of activites centered around children. Really has little to do with marbles and I believe the name Marbles is perhaps the founder. They have activites for a wide range of ages including designated areas just for toddlers. It's educational and stimulates imagination &",
          "My 2 year old had a blast this past weekend. Getting there right when they opened was a good plan as things were significantly less crowded than around lunch when we finally left. Plenty of great spaces for them to play and be kids exploring on the 1st and 2nd floor.",
          "Visited with friends including kids ages 6, 5 and 5.5 - had an amazing time. I was impressed with the many areas of play - each having its own theme or focus. The first floor features a long hall with some great games super sized (Checkers, chess, kur plunk, etc). There is an",
          "Didnt know what to expect when we paid admission to this museum, and being i had a 9 year old and a 14 year old, I wish I wouldve done my homework FIRST!! It's definitely child oriented but the name will fool you. Yes,,, I expected marbles, lol. What we got was childrens",
          "Marbles is so much fun! It's only $5 per person, clean, and they offer so much to do! The parking garage next door is free on the weekends, but we like to go throughout the week. We play with the kids or let them play. There is an IMAX, tons of inside play areas, and an",
          "We go to Marbles about once every other month with our kids, ages 5 and 8 and we're never disappointed. They each find stuff that interests them each time we visit, with favorites of course being the pneumatic, pulley and track system that drops the balls out of the pig's belly",
          "This was a great way for us to spend some time before a family wedding on our visit to Raleigh. Great value and very well done children's museum!",
          "Truly enjoyable and educational. At least once a month we take our 4 and 5 year old boys to run around, read, play and discover new things. Can't recommend it enough. 2-3 hours is just right to fully enjoy (but still leave enough for the next visit).",
          "My 6 year old son is an only child and he loves this place! He can interact with other children his age. He can build things to take home with him. He loves the mechanic area and also loves the make and take art area! We had an amazing time here and they also offer military",
          "We spent 3 hours here with preschoolers (ages 2 and 3 1/2). It is an amazing place for imaginative play. Every exhibit was well-planned and inviting to all ages. Older children would understand the purpose behind the activities but younger children can be engaged and enjoy",
          "Went to a movie here and was very pleasently surprised. I no longer have kids at home, so I wasn't expecting such a nice location or amenities but was pleasently surprised by both.",
          "Lots to do! Obstacles to climb! Science exhibits, rides. Fun for all ages. Sure has improved since I visited 8 years ago! I don't care how old you are you gotta go here! What are you waiting for! Don't forget the IMAX theatre is next door.",
          "I liked it. Definitely for young children. It does have an accompanied IMAX which was fun. The activities are definitely for children 2 -10. My teenage son was quickly bored here.",
          "I went here with my friend and her infant while I was visiting them. I was really amazed at how affordable it was and how much there was to do there. We walked around the whole museum, although most of our time was spent in the infant area. I'm looking forward to coming back",
          "Our four and one year old sons had an absolute blast. This place is so well put together and maintained. The staff is friendly. A definite stop for families with youngsters!",
          "My kids and I went here for the afternoon. They love this place because there are so many hands on activities for them to do. It's fairly cheap at $5 a person. It will probably take you several hours to experience it. It's a good way to get out of the heat for a bit.",
          "My daughter LOVES Marbles. Her favorite areas are the kitchen area and the area with the slide. I've heard a lot of parents say their child gets sick every time they go, but mine never has. I always squirt sanitizer from the wall when we leave each area before going to the next.",
          "This is the best play Museum that I have ever been to, and we have been to quite a few. You cannot beat it and it is very reasonably priced. In fact we loved it so much that we went back the very next day. There is just so much to entertain the kids and get their creativity",
          "Anytime family comes in to town we go to Marbles. It is convenient located in downtown Raleigh and has a parking garage across the street. Food is available next the IMAX theater. It is clean and offers some vegetarian options for our family. It does however need to fix some",
          "there's a lot to do as far as for kids. downtown Raleigh has a lot of good foods to try. everything is in walking distance so it's more easy to get to places",
          "Marbles is a favorite stop for parents with kids under the age of ten. Weekdays are less crowded and quieter. Prepare to spend 2-3 hours and get on the floor with the kids because adults love this place, too. Exhibits change often, but our 2 year old's favorite was the huge foam",
          "Kids 2-12 will enjoy Marbles. Arrive early - it can get crowded. Also, on the weekend there are children's birthday parties going on. There is a very nice gift shop on the premise.",
          "This is the best children's museum that I have been to. We took our grandchildren and they loved it! I felt like we rushed them through it just to see the whole thing. Definitely worth visiting!",
          "First visit! My 6-year old and I went on a rainy Monday (no field trips on Monday) and found lots of space to explore. Loved the piano step stairs and Art Shop--she enjoyed the \"yes you can\" attitude and I enjoyed not worrying about the mess & cleaning up after. We didn't",
          "There's not many places where small children can express themselves, but Marbles is the place to go. Make sure they wear their play clothes, & let them go. From babies to 3rd grade it has something for them all to do. You can get a membership with them that offers members only",
          "This place has so much for the kids to do. It can last an entire day just moving from one attraction to the next. I've gone twice with my daughter and her children and loved watching them have a good time. By the time they walk out they have used all their energy and ready to",
          "This is my favorite place to take my grandkids. They always say \"Marbles\" if I ask them what they want to do. Each time we go it's a different experience. Somedays they play in the kitchen and barbecue area, and make all sorts of dinners for me - other days they are on the",
          "Took grandkids on Mother's Day Eve. As expected, Marbles was jammed. WE had been before so we know what to expect. THe kids (8 and 3) loved every second. THere for nearly 5 hours. They esp. liked the area where there is a fire engine, ambulance, news copter, etc. Play area",
          "It's great when we visit our granddaughter in Cary. It is a clean, modern facility that is perfect for toddlers to eight year olds. The kids can play according to their own interests, and all are having marvelous fun. Parking is on the street, but is usually available right by",

          "We love going to Marbles on a rainy day or when it's too hot, or when it's too cold...or basically anytime! This place has so much for little ones to do on two floors. My toddler can stay busy for hours here. Monday's there are no school groups so that's the best time to go if",
          "Best for younger children. We went for a bday celebration. It was plenty to do but a little too kiddy for my 10 year old.",
          "We take our grandson age 3 frequently and never have any trouble with him being totally engaged in the many activities on two floors. It is kept clean constantly and the staff is excellent. There are many and varied instructional activities to complement the established learning",

          "This place was so much fun for kids. It's interactive so the kids are learning and being creative and they just think they're having fun. I only wish they had activities for older kids 11 and up.",
          "First off, you can't beat the $5 admission. I took my 10 year old nephew, and he had a ball. I liked that they had play areas suitable for different age groups. They also had a cafe inside the museum and a little restaurant attached to the imax theatre.",
          "Cost was a bit much but worth it for several hours of activity by the children. I bring them back every time they are in town.",
          "I have brought my Grandchildren here on many occasions we have always had a wonderful time. Each child is so different and at Marbles they each can find amazing entertainment here. Our age range we have is 9 through 2 and each one always had a blast. Very inexpensive! Staff",
          "We went today and spent 6 hours there. We could have stayed longer but this mommy ran out of energy long before the kiddos did. I was told today was crowded but honestly it didn't seem that bad. If we ever come back to Raleigh, I will definitely bring the kiddos back!",
          "Marbles is fun, and interactive. My 7 y.o. son loves all of the exhibits, and is a great place to let them loose to have some fun!",
          "The regular exhibits are a lot of fun especially for 3-9 year olds and rotating exhibits on the second floor are always fun. There is a baby crawl around area, lots of creative play and new learning experiences too. Great for family or class trip.",

          "What to do with 2 inquisitive grandsons aged 5 & 3? The answer is Marbles. Downtown Raleigh, NC. 2 hr. parking is around the museum and that was just enough time for these 2 to get pooped out. Floor 1 water play area with aprons, submarine with periscope and underwater scenery,",
          "I took the kids here on a short two day trip to see the museums in Raleigh and I'm glad I put this on our list. Three floors of activities all designed to keep the children thinking and moving. From dressing up to grocery shopping to mini hockey... We will be back to Marbles!",
          "Great place for all young children. Probably 2-10 years old. Check to see if a teachers work day first. It might be packed if it is.",
          "On Saturday, I took my Granddaughter to Marbles to participate in Art Saturday. My granddaughter loves creating...pictures, paintings and sketches. On this Saturday, she created a movie set, characters and filmed her creation. We played mancala, and checkers, we ran up and down",
          "This is my kid's favorite place in Raleigh. Everything is hands-on. New things and activities every time we go there. Hop through a bus ( and \"drive it\") and get into a room with all the pretend activities you can imagine: be a chef, a fireman, an EMT, a farmer, a helicopter",
          "Marbles is great for any day to. Get imaginative children out and about. There are so many activities to do here and plenty of space for everyone to get involved. Went here with kids for a day trip along with some site seeing in and around the area. Convenient location for",
          "We go here quite a bit during the summer. There is always something to do and the kids don't seem to get bored. I would recommend coming early as this place can get busy.",
          "We've taken our 2 year old to Marbles many times and always love it. I think we went 3 times before we even made it upstairs! There are so many great exhibits. We bought a year pass on our second trip there and it can pay for itself if you go enough. Enjoy!",
          "Okay folks. You dragged the young ones to and fro doing what you had planned on your trip. Yes, it is time for a wonderful side trip that will be a perfect spot to entertain them. They deserve the 1-3 hour diversion.",
          "Kids of all ages are engaged, having fun and shh, learning at the same time. The skills of a pirate, a submarine crew a doctor, nurse, postal worker or lets drive a bus or make a race car, dance or play games. You can spend hours exploring. My only complaint is that it is soooo",
          "This is an adventure for the young and old at heart. The hands on displays are fun and educational. This is the type of venue that you can go to over and over and never tire of your trip.",
          "My kids loved the museum! But are upset because we had to leave! Lol I'm such an awful parent for making them leave. Anyways we all even got a souvenir...we all painted a picture in their little art area. Such an amazing place for ever different personality. It's a shame we",
          "The place offers different activities for children. I find the majority well suite for children between the ages of 6 and 12 even so there are for other ages. Parking is a challenge. I ended up parking in a meter and got ticketed. Near plenty of shops and restaurants.",
          "Everything is done for kids and they enjoy a lot. A must see with children on this city. It takes at least 2 hours to see everything.",
          "My son came here for a field trip and kept asking to come back with his siblings. We finally did. There is so much to do for the kids and it's all hands on. They loved it! They didn't know what to do. They went from one place to the next. I think they were a bit overwhelmed but",
          "Pros: It is only five dollars a person and you are free to come and go all day. There are two stories of activities to do for kids of all ages. The few staff members that we did see were very friendly and helpful. The activities seemed both educational and fun. Negative: We",
          "We took a 4-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl. The younger loved everything he tried. There is a large room with multiple pretend settings (fire engine, ambulance, grocery store, helicopter, vet office) and the younger could have lived in this room all day. There was also a",

          "For $5.00 per person you get to play all day long! So many great things to play with for infants, toddlers and school aged children! We love the Imax center too! This place is great for a hot or a rainy day! We love Marbles!",
          "I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this place other than its not advertised enough. I heard about this children's museum from a work seminar I attended a couple of weeks ago. We were visiting family here in Raleigh and I decided to take my children. My son is 6, my",
          "My daughter loves Marbles! There are so many different things to explore with your imagination. We always spend the whole day at the museum, and she never gets bored. Only negative is that it is always crowded.",
          "Outstanding children's museum with large variety of highly-interactive exhibit areas. Clean, busy, noisy--but not completely overwhelming. Exhibits include lots of \"transport systems\" that encourage kids to work together to accomplish goals like moving balls and disks; workout",
          "Our 8 and ten year old grandkids still love the place, but I can see that coming to an end soon. Staff do a wonderful job keeping it clean and well-stocked. Can be over-crowded at times. Great place for the two to ten year old set.",
          "I do enjoy going here with my 2 year old. tried once with my 11 {she's a bit mature} and she didn't like it. I will say that I have been during the weekend 1st thing and on a weekday, and it was always crowded. so you are forewarned for the hubby's .",
          "We have taken our 1 year old here a few times and he has such a fantastic time! Ultimately every trip here ends up in him napping for a few hours which is also a huge bonus win for mom and dad! The various sections are very well thought out and designed. It's so much fun",
          "I took my 1 1/2 year old niece here. She loved it!! There are so many things to do and see and touch and play with. She also enjoyed watching the other kids that were there. The employees are so nice. We really liked going outside to the garden and learning about the",
          "Grandkids adore Marbles! They ask all the time for another visit, as they cannot play at every area in the Museum! They also enjoy the Imax theatre and we always have a bite at the little caf\u00e9, and of course the gift shop!",
          "Downstairs has many active play areas - farm, spaceship, ambulance, trains, etc. Upstairs is for older children with giant blocks, race cars,etc.",
          "We could have easily spent hours here, there are various floors you could visit, plus cute outdoor areas featuring a vegetable garden in one area, and a fountain in another where you can make music with pipes, etc. We didn't get through the whole place, but there were areas that",
          "We came here as a day trip to the area. Tickets for two adults and a 3 year old were under $20, so very affordable. My son could do anything in the entire museum minus one section where they were doing crafts for Father's Day with real (small) saws. I wasn't going to attempt",
          "Kids of all ages LOVE Marbles. We visit 2-3 times a year and I have to BEG my kids to leave. They love it! A must-see",

          "My wife and I took our 2 grandsons (3 & 6) for \"DeeDa's Great Adventure\" to Marbles and spent most of the morning there. They loved it and we got to have a lot of interaction with them in the process. Great Place to \"babysit\" the grands.",
          "Lots of fun stuff for the toddlers up to maybe 9 or 10. Older kids not so much. There is lots of room, places to sit, and a nice gift shop.",
          "We were here a few months ago, and my daughter loved it. It kept her busy and entertained. We liked it because it made her happy.",
          "Hands On activities. Go thru at your own pace. Nice staff of young people. Low cost. Displays change, cost of movies are fair if you want to go to IMAX right there. We love to go.",
          "Coming from a big city where museums were so expensive this place is awesome. I was not expecting so many things to do for the price. We have been 3 times and I have a 2 year old and 3.5 year old. Each time they have a ball!! We never get to everything!",
          "This place is awesome, and extremely reasonable!!! My children had a wonderful time. The whole museum is wonderful, and at the 4 hour mark we had to drag our children out. You will not be disappointed.",
          "This is a children wonderland. It is some much to do and see in this museum. It is a fun and learning experience all in one. My niece and nephew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and want to plan a future visit the next time we are in Raleigh. Even as an adult, you can still",
          "Marbles is a great place for children between 2 and 5 years of age. It is a safe place for creative play. I've been to more educational sort of children's museums but this is nice for the younger kids. It does get very busy on the weekend. The staff is usually very friendly.",
          "We went to Apex to visit our son, daughter in law and grandaughter. They planned an excursion to Marbles for the grandkids. Its inexpensive, $5 @ person and will keep the kids entertained for an entire day. I am not a big fan of North Carolina anymore after the legislation",
          "Go on a weekday though, it's quite packed on the weekends, but always has a courteous staff and my kids love it. I am always there for at least 6 hours at a time.",
          "This is a wonderful children's museum. It was very spacious and clean. And the staff was very helpful and worked continuously maintaining the place. Can't wait to come back again!",
          "My granddaughter loves to go to Marbles but she ends up sick after every visit. We feel they need to sanitize the surfaces much better.",
          "This should be the template for kids' activity centres built in every city. Marbles can satisfy the scientist, the builder, the artist, the explorer, the athlete, the puzzle solver and on and on. You can easily spend an entire day with countless return trips!",
          "Our grandchildren are ages 11 to 1. While the youngest one has not had her first visit, the older ones love this place. It is the perfect thing to do when they just need to get out of the house and get rid of some energy. It does get a bit crowded when there are a lot of school",
          "We got there as soon as they opened on a Wednesday. We had about the first 10 minutes for our selfsame. Thank goodness I took pictures. The concept was so cool. But some of the things didn't work. Then bam.. It seemed like 200 kids. My daughter is 5 and it was awful. They were",
          "This is a wonderful museum that actively engages children in creative learning. Our 2 year old granddaughter loved playing in the veterinarian's office. It was outfitted with animal crates, examining tables, stuffed animals, and a washing station. I highly recommend it.",
          "This museum is huge with so many interesting activities for kids. They will love learning in such an interactive, exciting way. They have this really cool hockey rink, fun money activity, a cool pirate ship, and several immersive rooms. It's also very clean.",
          "I've taken my daughter from before one since.. we go at least once every few months. She really enjoys the fish tanks.. and interactive water displays. Also loves the basketball court area and blocks.. it helped her create friends and more in the great environment and it's",
          "This museum is an awesome place to take our \"little people\", for hands on learning and loads of fun! You can spend the entire day entertaining your little ones from water games, human size chess boards, a local grocery store, post office or a replica of dad's work space, with",
          "Lots to do here no matter how many times we come in one year. Something for every age group. Most crowded weekends of course, but still plenty of room. They have demonstrations that my child loves. Also, he loves the indoor hockey rink. I like the Hula Hoops as I see more",
          "Overpriced, small, and crowded. Kids had fun but it should definitely offer more exhibits. I suggest visiting Marbles during the week when crowding is minimal. No parking either.",
          "They have age-appropriate stuff for a wide range. I took a toddler who thoroughly enjoyed himself! Very nice surprises and a great value.",
          "Went with our grandkids, lots of fun activities for younger children, not so much for older kids, has lots of places for adults to set and wait and bathrooms are handy. Nice gift shop",

          "Every time we visit the grandparents my kids, age 2 and 4, beg to go to Marbles. Being form S. Florida, there are several \"kids\" museums, but Marbles out shines them all. What a great experience for kids of all ages (including Dad)!",
          "Found this Museum on Trip Advisor. So happy I did! My kids loved it. So much for them to do. We got there around 11:00 am. Stayed for maybe 4 hours and the kids were tired. If you live near here or are driving through I highly recommend taking your kids here. The people who",

          "This is the second time in a couple years that we have visited Marbles with our Grandson. We really enjoyed our visits. This time it seemed like there were alot more awesome things to do. The weather was nice so we enjoyed the outdoor splash activities as well as the indoor",

          "This is a great children's museum with lots to keep kids busy and happy. There are lots of different areas to explore and play. A word of caution - it gets really busy and crazy. Try to go during the week or right when they open if going on the weekend.",

          "Great children's outing! The children I was with ages (2 and 3) loved this place. There are many different activities for young ones. The children I was with loved the firetruck, helicopter, grocery store and kitchen. Upstairs they they loved the gymnastic activities and the",

          "We went to a grandchild's 2 year birthday party at Marbles. We had a private room and access to all the exhibits, playthings and venues. Everyone seemed to have a good time. It was noisy and I think a bit over the top for a 2 year old party as 2 year olds don't really play",
          "Need to get there when it opens and groups start coming. The place is loud, but what do you expect when a bunch of kids are having a great time. Great variety of areas, from a small bus kids can walk through, a barn with all kinds of stuff animals, a veterinary with cages,",
          "Our son enjoyed his day at Marbles Kids Museum. Lots of fun things to see and do! I will definitely be bringing our two year old this year but I'm afraid at almost 8 our oldest will not enjoy it as much.",

          "My youngest loves this place. I'd say it's great for kids 2/3 through 6/7 yrs old. Two story and has a lot of areas of play for kids. I've been there twice, and my wife has taken the youngest probably 6 - 7 times. We got an annual pass, which was worth it. Parking is",
          "Took our three year old and six year old here, what a fabulous place for kids! Well thought out activities and experiences that kept them both spellbound for hours. We were impressed with how well thought out each area was done. For example, the fire truck had a working nose,",

          "We have visited Marbles on multiple occasions. My daughters are 8 and 11 and have enjoyed going there for several years. You can spend the majority of the day there, and it's inexpensive. It would have gotten five stars if there was more for parents to do.",
          "We have been to many kids museums around the country but this is one of our favorites. The staff are friendly, there is lots of variety, and the entrance cost is ridiculously low. I would say the sweet spot is 3 - 8 BUT our 1.5 year old loved it and even our 12 year old found",
          "Not sure why they call it marbles...but the kids had a blast and loved it. It's less of a museum, and more of a fun play place with lots of activities and different rooms for kids. We went early before the school groups showed up and we're glad to beat the rush of kids. Our kids",
          "I haven't been lately but when we took my grandchildren several years ago - we all had a super time!! So much to do! Lots of interactive. I especially remember the garden and water play area outside. It was great!!",
          "We took a quick trip to Raleigh for a long weekend. It was a family oriented trip with 5 kids between the ages of 3-8. We had a fabulous time at Marbles. I put 3 hours in the parking meter and had to re-up for another 2 hours. All of the kid's were entertained; there was so",

          "We love this place. My boys are now 10 and 12, but still love going here. We've visited many, many times in the last 6 years. It is always fresh and new because they update the exhibits and attractions, but you can still find your tried and true favorites, too. I have fun with",
          "We couldn't believe how amazing the educational and fun elements provided by Marbles were! We spent 2 hours with our 2 year old playing and didn't even make it to the upstairs. For $5.00 admission all day long, this is the best deal in Raleigh!!!! Entertainment & educational",

          "I took my 3yo niece when she came to visit. It cost $5 per person (which I thought was a great deal). I don't know how much the membership is but it seemed like lots of people had them. We went at 9am on Saturday, it wasn't super crowded when we got there but it was PACKED when",
          "One of the best children's museums in the country. Interactive and encourages social interaction between kids who may never have met.",
          "A really fun place to take kids, and super affordable. That being said, it's always crowded so be prepared to deal with a lot of people, and our kids always get sick after going. That being said, it's a great place to go especially on a cold or rainy day!",
          "This is a place for young children ( 10 and younger). It is great for birthday parties. It is not somewhere to go for teenagers unless you are going to the IMAX movie. They have food available at Pogo Cafe.",
          "My kids beg to go to Marbles. They are 6 and 9 years old. Marbles is a fun place to take kids of all ages on a rainy day. True learning through play going on at this place! Your kids (and maybe even you) will be entertained for hours and the price is very reasonable.",

          "Cost to get in is $5 per person and you do have to pay to park (just like everywhere else in Raleigh) There are two floors to the museum, a cafeteria and an Imax movie theater. I took my 7 year old ADHD daughter and she LOVED it! A bit of a sensory overload when we first walked",
          "My 3 year old absolutely loved this place and for $5 a person you can't beat it. However, I wish there was a safety check implemented like they have at Chuck E. Cheeses where you and your family are stamped and checked on the way out. There can be a bunch of people there and",
          "I went with my grandkids. This place is awesome for kids. (Over 10 might be bored) It was all hands on. SO much to do. Kids got a chance to touch and feel and pretend and do so many things that are out there in our adult world. It was only $5 to get in. How can you beat",
          "As an older adult, my favorite part of the museum is the movie theater. Really neat 3-D movies for all ages. Experiments and activities are top-notch, and aimed at differing age groups. My only complaint is that sometimes the adults in charge of these bus-loads of kids do not",
          "Went to Marbles with my daughter soninlaw and 18mo granddaughter on Sunday morning 10:30ish. The cost for entrance was very nominal. There is so much for the little ones to do. All hands on. All inspiring learning, dreaming and creativity. We spent about 2 hours. Upon leaving",
          "We took our 1yr old and my mom had my brothers with her (9yr). While almost every section is able to be used by my son, more so by the older kids, the lack of employees and rules is terrifying. There were so many kids who were smashing the toys, throwing items and running fast",

          "Excellent stop to walk and enjoy the beauty. We're visiting for the weekend and enjoyed the opportunity to get out into nature. The visit was free and the helpful volunteer at the Visitor's Center gave us a map with a tour of what was in bloom at the time of our visit.",

        "wiki": "The North  Carolina State Capitol is the former seat of the legislature of the U.S. state of North Carolina which housed all of the state's government until 1888. The Supreme Court and State Library moved into a separate building in 1888, and the General Assembly moved into the State Legislative Building in 1963. Today, the governor and their immediate staff occupy offices on the first floor of the Capitol.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was built following the destruction by fire of the first North Carolina State House in 1831, and today houses the offices of the Governor of North Carolina. It is located in the state capitol of Raleigh on Union Square at One East Edenton Street. The cornerstone of the Greek Revival building was laid with Masonic honors by the Grand Master of North Carolina Masons Simmons Jones Baker on July 4, 1833. Construction was completed in 1840. It was designed primarily by the architectural firm of Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis.  Often credited solely to that team, the design of the capitol was actually the result of a sequence of work by William Nichols, Sr. and his son William Nichols, Jr., Town and Davis, and then David Paton.\nThe Capitol housed the entire state government until 1888, and the North Carolina General Assembly met in the capitol building until 1961. The legislature relocated to its current location in the North Carolina State Legislative Building in 1963. The North Carolina Supreme Court has also convened in the building in the past, most recently meeting in the capitol's senate chamber in 2005 while the Supreme Court Building was undergoing renovations. The Governor and the governor's immediate staff has continued to occupy offices in the building. The Capitol remains largely unaltered from its 1840 state. Only three rooms have been significantly altered through remodeling: the two committee rooms in the east and west wings of the second floor, which were divided horizontally to provide space for restrooms, and the office in the east wing of the first floor, part of which had to be cut away to permit space for an elevator to be installed in 1951. The Capitol was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973 and the building is located in the Capitol Area Historic District.The first assembly to meet in this building was the 63rd North Carolina General Assembly of 1840-1841 on November 16, 1840.  The last assembly to meet in this building was the 124th North Carolina General Assembly of 1961, which met from February 8 to June 22, 1961.\n\n\n== North Carolina legislature buildings ==\nThe North Carolina General Assembly may have initially met in Tryon Palace after being vacated by the British in 1776.   The assembly met in various locations until a building dedicated for use by the state government was completed in 1794 in Raleigh.  This building was destroyed by fire in 1831.  The North Carolina State Capitol building was the home to the assembly from 1840 to 1961.\n\n\n== Images of the North Carolina State Capitol building ==\nIn the rotunda is a statue of George Washington. The rotunda  statue is a replica of the original statue by Antonio Canova, which was destroyed by a fire in 1831.  A bust of the 29th Governor of North Carolina (1841\u20131845), John Motley Morehead, sits inside the capitol.  A statue of George Washington is on the south side of the capitol. On the east side of the capitol sits a statue of the three Presidents of the United States from North Carolina: James Knox Polk of Mecklenburg County, Andrew Jackson of Union County sitting on horse, and Andrew Johnson of Wake County.  The grounds of the capitol also include statues honoring women of the Confederacy, veterans of the Civil War and Viet Nam War.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of National Historic Landmarks in North Carolina\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Wake County, North Carolina\nList of state and territorial capitols in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNorth Carolina State Capitol\nNC State Capitol Foundation\nThe North Carolina State Capitol: Pride of the State, a National Park Service Teaching with Historic Places (TwHP) lesson plan",

          "Back in the early 1970\u2019s there was a man that sold bags of peanuts so you could feed the resident pigeons ... no more birds about but plenty to see in and out of he building! Self tour anytime you like or call ahead for larger groups or on weekends.",
          "From reading other reviews, I was apprehensive about my visiting the capitol. I have been to others, and yes, many are more ornate. However, this was lacking nothing. There is much history here and it was nice to see samples of how things looked back in the day. The grounds",

          "Even without going inside, I thought it was cool to walk around. Just reading the monuments outside I learned a good amount of history!",
          "You should definitely give it a shot during your visit to Raleigh. The building itself is small, visiting won't take long, and you won't feel overwhelmed with the amount of information. I was there during Christmas season and the building was decorated accordingly. It looked so",
          "You\u2019ll definitely want to include a tour of the NC State Capitol when you\u2019re sightseeing in downtown Raleigh. We recommend visiting on weekends when parking is easy but be sure to check operating hours. The grounds are very interesting as well, with massive trees and a high",

          "The highlight of this visit was the ground and the statutes. I especially liked the Vietnam memorial. Incredible and life like. A great tribute. The south is not forgotten with the memorial to the confederate dead. So much civil war history in this spot. Walk the grounds and",

          "This was once the capitol that houses of the legislature, and the governor, but the legislature moved out. Leaving this \"small\" building referred to as the capitol building exclusively tot he governor only. The grounds are the best thing about the place. Statues all around and",
          "Although I didn't actually go in the capital, I had a great self guided tour around the vicinity. Multiple statues, full of history and beautiful grounds. It's worth stopping by for a look if your in the area.",

          "I saw the capitol, but didn't actually go there. I was nearby at the North Carolina State Library/Archives. I was in town for a genealogy conference and spent 2 days researching before the conference. The staff was well prepared for the onslaught of a large crowd and were",
          "This is much smaller than the capitols of the western states I have visited. This makes it a good accompaniment to the local museums. Be sure to tou all floors and see the Landsdowne Portrait of George Washington. Meanwhile out on the grounds, take in the Vietnam Veterans",
          "While I did not go into the State Capitol (free tours are offered) I did wander around the grounds on an early Sunday morning. The building is located in the heart of Raleigh on slight hill which affords a great view down Fayetteville Street. It is not as impressive a building",
          "We visited this State capitol on May 4th. If you visit it different places around the State Capitol you can park your car in the Alexander Square Parking on 120 South Welmington St. Like all State Capitols there is a check point at the entrance. This is actually not an active",
          "I have mixed feelings about the capital building. The capital, which was built in 1840, isn\u2019t as opulent as some we have visited. It is plain, functional and pretty much original. You do get a feel for what it must have been like when the legislators first met there and I",
          "This place is near NC State. It is nice and quiet when we went to take photos and it is really hot. Maybe 5pm is an ideal time to go here because it is not crowded. It has lots of nice landscape around it and the architecture of the building is really nice.",
          "Free entrance (although donations are requested) to an interesting part of Raleigh history. Well worth an hour of your time to walk through development of NC history",

          "This is a very historical building that has been restored beautifully. The Governors office is still here and we had the unexpected pleasure of actually meeting him. Be sure to visit the third floor for unexpected surprises. The senate and house chambers are very nice and take",
          "If you are visiting Raleigh NC - make sure to walk past the state capitol. I liked the statue by the building. And if you walk straight from capitol building you will be in the downtown area where you will have options for local restaurant, pubs, coffee and shops.",
          "I have been living here since 1998, and I am one of the few people I know who has actually been inside the building. It is a great experience, with good explanations of the building's history and the purpose of the various spaces. I have never known it to be busy or crowded, and",
          "You should take the time to see the history and beauty of the NC State capital. Alot to do and see downtown.",
          "I've been here several times. The city bustle is definitely a distraction. Nonetheless, you still get to appreciate the monuments' presence of dignity.",
          "We were here for a homeschool outing to meet our legislators, listen to sessions on each branch of the government, and toured several of the government buildings. Full of both historical significance and current relevance. We appreciated the friendly, yet business-like manner",

          "It is a must see for anyone visiting downtown. You can take a self guided tour of the interior which is very interesting. You will see the old library and geology room plus the rooms where the Senate and House of Representatives met \"back in the day.\" The grounds with all the",
          "Must see all the statues around the building especially the Vietnam memorial. First week-end of each month there is a ceremony to read POW and MIA names from NC.",
          "Friends of mine decided to tour State Capitols in all 50 states. I joined them for NC State Capitol tour. It was fascinating, Beautiful building. I learned a lot and they said it was in the top 10% of all capitol tours. Highly recommend and I never would have even thought about",
          "I was pleased to see a monument to US Presidents and native sons Andrew Jackson & Andrew Johnson who achieved greatness in spite of humble origins, including indentured servitude for the latter. Also a beautiful statue dedicated to Confederate mothers.",
          "I have not visited the old Capitol Building since I was in junior high. After visiting the Governor's Mansion, one of the host suggested we visit here. The decorations were minimal but very tastefully done. I love the history of this old building.",
          "I simply had to return to this spot throughout my visit of this city. Regardless of the time of day, it offers fantastic photo opportunities; the sky can create some rather dramatic shots with the numerous monuments (and of course, the capitol building!) The grounds are well",
          "This majestic old edifice is no longer used as the venue for the state legislature to convene, that's at the legislative office building nearby. This place itself is a monument to history, and you should take the time to go inside. Leave your knife or other sharp tools in the",
          "In the middle of Raleigh is the State Capitol. It has some wonderful statues and dedications to history. Nothing too fancy as compared to other state capitols but nice enough.",
          "It's amazing how many people neglect the history in their own states. Don't miss the stories represented in the monuments on the Capitol Square. You can thank our soldiers from the War of Northern Aggression, WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam. Visit the monument to the first CSA",
          "While the rotunda is not as impressive as in many other states, it is still nice and worth a visit. You can also see the old legislative rooms. And don't miss going all the way up to the top floor to see the redone old library. Very nice.",
          "Family showed me around and gave me some history. Enjoyed the view of where things happen in government in N.C.",
          "This is a very small walk around, not much to look at with limited seating. Very nice open area to relax",
          "The North Carolina State Capitol building has a fiery history. It is located in downtown Raleigh in the Union Square. The original capital building burned to the ground amidst a mighty fire. During reconstruction a zinc roof was installed. The zinc roof was to safeguard the",
          "If you get a rare chance to see one of the state's top admins at work, congrats! However, the best part of the Capitol is the grounds and the beautiful inside both. The center point of Capitol Square and downtown Raleigh, the building is known for it's beauty. Not used much",
          "This is a Beautiful State Capitol and the entire area around it is very nice. Classic buildings and Southern charm all around. Walk to great restaurants just down the street.",
          "Stopped here with some friends and walked around the building. It has several monuments out side that you can go by and look at. They are several buildings in the area that is neat to the area.",
          "Very surprised how little there is to see here compared to most state capitols. Given NC history there are plenty of opportities for a great display but this is undeveloped for now",
          "It is the historic Capital. We have sen better but still worth the visit. It a self guided tour. The legislative chamber are still as they were.",
          "It is small and unimpressive, a museum rather than a working state capitol. The new Legislative Building is where the Senate and House meet. The Governor's office is in the building; however it is not open to visitors. The Rotunda had a marble statue of George Washington in",
          "Many interesting exhibits to see. Now home to the Governor's office, the old Senate and House chambers are worth visit as well as the old library and State Geology office.",
          "The capitol building packed in more than appears from the outside. Three floors of exhibits from the old senate and house meeting rooms to a beautiful library and a science lab to assess NC's natural resources. It's free, it's pretty fascinating, and I really recommend it.",
          "Not as elaborate as other capitol buildings we have visited, but very enjoyable to be able to wander round this 1840,s capitol building at our own pace on a self guided tour. it was interesting to see the old House and Senate chambers, as well as the library and geologist,s",
          "Very interesting. Great historical artifacts inside capital. Grounds are very pleasant to walk around.",
          "Maybe it's because I live in North Carolina is the reason I thought this place was so amazing. The grounds are beautiful, and you can even tour the inside as well. It is a self-guided tour. History abounds in this one building. Location is great because it is also near many",
          "This building is actually the second North Carolina Capitol building in Raleigh. The first was heavily damaged by fire and torn down. You can visit the chambers used by the House & Senate until they moved to the new Legislative building a few blocks north on Jones St. There is a",
          "If you're as much of a fan of colonial America as I am, you're sure to appreciate this place. An interesting side-note: this building no longer functions as the state Capitol, as the legislature now holds session elsewhere. This doesn't mean it's still not the Capitol though.",
          "Visited the historic house and senate chambers, library, geology room and rotunda. The legislature no longer meets here. Stairs to visitors gallery on third floor are steep. Free self guided tour but guides are available for groups. NC asked General Sherman not to destroy the",
          "The North Carolina State Capitol is a great place to visit. However, do not expect to receive a tour guide upon your visit. Unless, we did not receive one. I do think it is good to see what goes on in the Capitol building, and it is a great place to take kids on a history trip.",
          "Whilst not as grand as some State Capitol buildings we have previously visited it's still worth the time to go and see. The grounds show a variety of sculptures including tributes to the 3 Presidents from the state, Vietnam and world war 2 memorials - all very good.",
          "No gold dome here. Just an average style capitol building. Bus tours with kids means no enjoyment. Don't feel bad if you miss this one.",
          "This place is also great to visit. We can see some parts of the building and read some history about it. We also can see the meeting room and how does it look like.... Not much to see in this building, but still worth it and impressive.",
          "Very nice old state house. Excellent tours of the building . The grounds are also very attractive. Great for history lovers",
          "My 16-year-old grandson and I had an early morning hour to kill in downtown Raleigh, so we stopped in at the Capitol Building. As far as we could tell, we were the first visitors that morning, and when we left 30-40 minutes later, we were still the only visitors. The 3-story",

          "The most interesting thing to do is read the plaques on the wall of the ground floor rotunda to get an understanding of what they saw as important in the past. And it's free.",
          "We love to visit State Capitols and have visited about 30 of them. We were happy to walk around this lovely, historic building and see the nice architecture and features. There is a unique statue of George Washington in the center rotunda. The president is garbed in a Roman",
          "We visited the capitol on north Carolina while visiting . It is real amazing how good the older places are built and how much work went into the building . Free admission makes it a great place to visit",
          "We visited the State Capitol, NC Museum of History and the NC Museum of Natural Science all in the same day. It was all a very pleasant short easy walk around the two block area. Parking was at an open attendant manned lot on the next block over.",
          "It was quite interesting to visit the rooms where the representatives and senators met. There are original desks and other furnishings in them. There are also at least 4 large fireplaces in each of those rooms. There are statues on the grounds and a statue of George",

          "Enjoyed seeing the North Carolina state capital which is very understated. Easy to tour exterior and interior in about an hour. The statues on the exterior are the best part of the tour; I particularly loved the statute honoring the three presidents from North Carolina. We",
          "Historical buildings don't always have a story that tells itself, but this one does! The educational displays walk you through the history. We loved peeking into the Governor's office as it used to be. The House and Senate chambers were full of children learning about state",

          "Certainly the least grand capitol building I've seen. Still very intersting. WAY too many confederate memorials, but what are you gonna do? Fun to stroll around in.",
          "The guards were not very helpful to tourists and one kept talking to another staff member. The governor is the only one with an office in the building which is why the guards are there. There isn't too much architecturally to see. The statue of Washington in a toga is odd.",
          "We did a quick tour and the guy was very informational! I loved hearing all the random facts about NC and the fun stories!",
          "We did a self guided tour and found the building and the history very interesting. The historic flags were amazing. Don't miss the top floor and the geologic office. And notice the chipped stairs from a wheel barrow hauling wood upstairs for the chamber fireplaces.",
          "We were impressed by all the statues of warriors from past wars. Now with all the controversy about the Confederate flag, it is refreshing to see a balanced approach to honoring the soldiers from all past wars. We enjoyed walking around with our two sons who came from CT to",

          "I have visited a number of capital buildings across the United States and was a little disappointed in this one. I feel like the state should try their best to give you an idea about what was accomplished in the state. This building was rather plain and unimpressive. Virginia",

          "The statehouse is newer than one would think and, though the Civil War did come through North Carolina no battles were fought close by - the closes would be Bentonville about 40 miles away. There are statuary, as you would expect but not a lot of direct history. There is,",

          "This capitol building is worth seeing, as NC has done a really good job of not modernizing it over the years. It is about as original as when it was built. The free tour is also worthwhile, as you get more out of the visit. I highly recommend purchasing a \"Capitol Collection\"",
          "We took a quick visit of the capital building. The complex includes some beautiful monuments/statues, but there were some homeless people sleeping on the benches. The actual capital building interior can be toured fairly quickly. Be forewarned that there are lots of stairs,",

        "wiki": "Yates Mill is a fully restored, circa 1756 gristmill located five miles (8 km) south of downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, United States. It is the centerpiece of Historic Yates Mill County Park, in central Wake County. The park features the restored mill; a visitor center with a museum focused on milling and on the natural history of the area, classrooms, an auditorium and space for research conducted by North Carolina State University faculty and students; a 20-acre (81,000 m2) lake; and extensive hiking trails. The park is managed as a native wildlife refuge with a mission to study and interpret the park's cultural, natural and agricultural heritage.\n\n\n== History ==\nYates Mill, one of the oldest buildings in Wake County, is the region's only surviving operable gristmill. For nearly 200 years the water-powered mill produced lumber, milled corn and wheat, and carded wool. The land on which the mill is situated was surveyed for Samuel Pearson in October 1756, and granted to him by the Earl of Granville, one of the North Carolina colony's Lord Proprietors. The original mill was built around at that time. Pearson steadily increased his land holdings, and owned more than 600 acres (2.4 km2) at the time of his death in 1802. In 1819, accumulated debts forced Pearson's son, Simon, to sell the mill and its surrounding acreage at a sheriff's auction. William Boylan, a prominent Raleigh businessman and director of the State Bank, bought the property, and over the next 30 years modernized the mill several times, adding a sawmill in the 1840s.\nIn 1853, Thomas Briggs, John Primrose, and James Penny acquired the mill. A decade later, in the midst of the Civil War, the partners sold the mill and surrounding 94 acres (380,000 m2) to Phares and Roxanna Yates, James Penny's son-in-law and daughter. Penny's involvement in the murder of a Mr. Franklin may have brought on the sale. According to legend, Franklin was a Northern sympathizer who Penny killed for not paying a $700 mill debt. In 1865, Franklin's widow supposedly told Federal troops occupying Raleigh that her husband's death was due to his support for the Union. The soldiers tried to burn the mill by setting fire to the entrance. Charred wooden beams today attest to the unsuccessful attempt.\n\nYates and his descendants operated the mill until 1948, when businessman A. E. Finley acquired the property. Finley constructed a retreat lodge by the millpond for the use of his family and employees. Due to lack of demand, however, the old mill was closed in 1953. Ten years later, North Carolina State University acquired the property, consolidating it into a larger tract to be used as an experimental farm. The mill was mainly used for storage until 1989, when Yates Mill Associates was incorporated to marshal its restoration. The mill narrowly escaped destruction in 1996, when rains unleashed by Hurricane Fran burst its 250-year-old stone dam. In 1996, Yates Mill Associates and Wake County Parks, Recreation and Open Space unveiled a public-private partnership to rehabilitate the dam and mill as part of a 574-acre (2.32 km2) historic and environmental park. Yates Mill is now a designated Raleigh Historic Landmark.\n\n\n== Current use ==\n\nThe mill stood vacant for several years until Yates Mill Associates, Inc. began restoration efforts in 1988. The mill is an example of the Oliver Evans type of grist mill and has been restored to its state as of the mid-19th century. Both the corn and wheat grinding machinery have been restored. Several corn grindings have been held since the mill officially opened to the public on May 20, 2006. The mill is frequently open for historic tours and corn grinding is demonstrated on specific days.\nYates Mill Associates, Inc. restored the mill with donations from governmental agencies, North Carolina State University, foundations, corporations and private citizens. North Carolina State University provided 154 acres (0.62 km2) on a long-term lease and will use the park for ongoing natural history research.\nWake County purchased 16 acres (65,000 m2) to add to the park and The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services have provided access to an adjacent parcel of about 400 acres (1.6 km2) for park use. The Wake County Parks, Recreation and Open Space Department oversaw the development of this 574-acre (2.32 km2) park. The County supervised the construction of the A.E. Finley Center for Education and Research, and provides the personnel and support needed to operate the park. Yates Mill Associates organizes and finances the maintenance of the mill and its demonstration using private donations and volunteer help.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Registered Historic Places in North Carolina\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYates Mill Associates \u2013 Official website\nHistoric Yates Mill County Park \u2013 Park website\nVideo of Yates Mill\nVideo showing the interior and exterior of the Mill from 2016",

          "Family just moved to the area and we were looking for some things to do outside of the city. This was surprisingly nice. There are many walking paths in the area, but not all that have a history like this. You can walk the perimeter, fish off one of the bridges and \"rock hop\" in",
          "Right now I noticed they are only doing actual tours guided tours on Saturdays. So call before you go. We went on a weekday and more able to walk freely around the property but not into the buildings. The scenery is absolutely stunning and knowing that it was built around 1750",

          "We loved this park, and the mill in particular. It wasn't running when we visited, but the views in and around are great. Park is well manicured, and the exhibit at the front is also great. The only thing we wish they had was some kind of vending machine inside the exhibit",
          "This is one of those 'off the beaten path' type places that is sure to please. In addition to the exhibits and locale...did I mention that there is a mill? Yeah, that. They have regular programs for the kids, and it is a great opportunity to escape the standard 'city' events",
          "I've gone a few times now and am never disappointed ! There is usually wildlife of some sort to see during your hike. We saw deer this last time and many different kinds of birds. The forests are magical and the trails are not too hard to walk.",

          "The park's main attraction, the mill, is quite close to the parking lot. Unless you want to walk on the trails around the lake, don't expect to do too much walking. However, the trails are well kept and mostly shaded, so are good for anybody looking to exercise. The new building",
          "A wonderful walk in early fall or spring, try to go when they have the mill running. Always a quiet getaway hidden on the back roads south of Raleigh. In summer, go early to avoid the heat.",
          "The visitor center has informative displays explaining the milling process and history of the Yates Mill. However, the real attraction is the mill itself. If you are able to go on a day that the mill is open for tours and in operation, that is is a definite plus. Tours cost a",

          "This is one of my favorite places to walk, usually with my camera! I am local to this park and visit regularly, I truly love it. I will advise that no pets are allowed as it is a wildlife refuge. The staff do an amazing job keeping people informed with local wildlife information",
          "Surprising to find this jewel next to NCSU animal farms. Come and see it. It's really worth it. Tours in March, we'll be back by then. Nice visitor center and beautiful pictures.",
          "Spectacular oasis in the middle a busy road. You can walk the trails around the park or go by the mill. You are transported into the country even though you are right next to the road. The mill tours are very nice also. Great nature photos.",
          "A great spot for photography, a picnic, or an afternoon walk! The mill is beautiful, and nature and animals are found throughout the trails around the property. A fishing pier and little dock overlook the water.",
          "So glad we stopped here, only wish we could come back in warmer weather to do all the other activities they offer. We visited the Mill and the kids watched the video to learn how it used to operate. They were also able to dress up in period costume which was lots of fun.",
          "If you love nature, there is plenty of it here. Lake, trails, dam, waterfall and yes, the old mill. Take a tour.",
          "Not far from the city off of Lake Wheeler Road is an operational grist mill. They have monthly workshops for the younger ones, a beautiful lake with a dam which is great for photographers. A fishing pier. A wildlife haven. Clean restrooms, picnic areas, classroom. Bring your",
          "This is a nice place to relax and take a hike with nature. We came in the summer and it was hot, but I cant wait to visit next fall once we move to the area. I could just imagine how great the fall foliage is while walking around the lake and mill.",
          "What I enjoyed most about Yates Mill, is the scenery of the place, nestled along the pond the Mill just pops out at you like a jewel. The staff are very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend a tour, because the working of the Mill's grindstones and history is a highlight as",
          "We went on a field trip here last month and it is such a neat place. They do a great job with the tour and the facilities are really nice. You can even buy some cornmeal made there!",
          "Loved it here! Visited while in town and it was a nice change of pace. Just a 10 minute or so drive from town and beautiful farm country all around. The park was lovely and the staff very helpful. Highly recommended.",
          "If you want a very scenic and unique walk through the park, this is the place. The museum is interesting and the mill is a great place to sit and have lunch. Bring a fishing pole and some worms and do a little fishing along the way.",
          "We found this by \"accident\" and it was one of our favorite stops in Raleigh. If you like the outdoors and quiet trails, you should check it out. The visitor center closes at 5 but the grounds are open until sunset (I think the posted time was 7:30 p.m. when we were there 9/23).",
          "We went with our grandchildren they were having a art show and other events. Very nice park. Very clean and the children liked the cows and the ice cream that was made there",
          "This is a great example of a park being able to cater to all walks of life. There's an awesome trail for running, walking, photography or bird watching. There's also a slightly longer/higher trail for those with a need to get their hike on. The main building has bathrooms and",
          "They have had activities that were somewhat interesting, but over all, pretty boring. There is a fake grinding house museum in the welcome center, a pond, and you can take tours of the mill",
          "My boyfriend and I love to get out on Sundays and go hiking and I love to take pictures so he decided to take to the nearby Yates Mill park..and it was a good call on his part. The park sits on 174 pristine areas and includes a pond..hiking trails..a restored grist mill (the",

          "Half of the park is closed down and the water drained for upgrades currently, but when it's fully operating the trails are great. The pond provides wonderful nature watching, birds and turtles particularly. The Mill is massive and very picturesque. Our son likes the viewfinders",
          "The walking paths in the park are shady and relaxing. The visitor center has a lot of information about mills and how they work in addition to information about the history of the area. There are many nice places to take good photographs of the wildlife and the surroundings.",
          "I went with a meet up group and really enjoyed this place. I am a history fan, so this really appeals to me. We enjoyed a guided tour and I learned a lot about the mill and the area. There is a historic tour in Raleigh that I did not know about until this tour. Everyone was",

          "This is a really nicely done park on the south side of Raleigh, and even on a wet, windy January day it was a fun place to visit. It's clearly designed to be an educational site, not only with the working water mill, but also to showcase flora and fauna around the mill pond.",
          "Was a wonderful place to spend the afternoon as a family. There are several walking trails and birding. Took some beautiful pictures of birds, old buildings, the mill, waterfall, farm equipment, etc. Inside, there is a little museum. Kids can play dress up from the olden days as",

          "Our family enjoyed a tour of the mill over Labor Day weekend. Our tour guides did an excellent job of describing the history and mechanics of the mill. Our daughters, ages 15, 13 & 10, really enjoyed being insider the mill and seeing how all the gears and machinery worked. The",

          "This is a great park to visit. We hiked the Millpond Trail which goes around the lake. There are nice views of the mill from across the lake. There are also benches along the trail. We took the guided Mill Heritage tour which is about 1/2 hour long. Gary did an excellent",

          "We hiked the high ridge trail .08 mile, the millpond trail 1 mile, and the creekside trail 2 miles long. It was a peaceful bliss. The millpond and the high ridge trails ended up at a restored mill which actually grinds cornmeal on certain dates of the month. We were able to hike",
          "The Historic Yates Mill County Park was so nice and serene. My husband and I did not want to leave. It takes you back to simpler times. There is ample photography opportunities outside and the facility is very nice and educational as well. The drive to get to the Mill is",

          "This an absolute adorable park. I think it is one of the best parks in this area to have photo sessions, specifically engagement photo sessions due to great backdrops. There's nothing like having your picture taken with the dam flowing with water behind you or the actual mill.",
          "My 3 year old son went here with his class. We walked around the lake and then looked at the Mill. It's really a beautiful location. The kids made it around the lake with no trouble and if you like to take pictures, it's not bad for that either.",

          "Great walk around pond, good nature visitor guide signs what animals and birds and plants to look for. We saw lots of turtles sunning on logs in water. Saw old beaver pond where you can see where beavers gnawed the wood on ends. Saw many geese. Very pleasant clean paths.",

          "I am doing research for a book--so historic sites always interest me. In particular, one of my books features a gristmill from the eighteenth century--so I headed down to Yates Mill park. I wish I'd known about it years ago. It is a beautiful setting and well-maintained.",

          "I've grown up around the corner from Yates Mill Pond, so I've seen it's changes throughout the years from decrepit conditions after it was nearly destroyed by Hurricane Fran, to the revitalized state that it's in now. NC State University did a fantastic job with cleaning up the",

          "Enjoy the museum and walking around the mill unless you are there during a day when the mill is open. Try the trails around the lake but don't expect to get a lot of open shots as the vines obscure a lot of the views. Still a good place to spend a few hours.",

        "wiki": "Raleigh (; RAH-lee) is the capital of the state of North Carolina and the seat of Wake County in the United States. Raleigh is the second-largest city in the state, after Charlotte. Raleigh is known as the \"City of Oaks\" for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city. The city covers a land area of 142.8 square miles (370 km2). The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population as 474,069 as of July 1, 2019. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The city of Raleigh is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the lost Roanoke Colony in present-day Dare County.\nRaleigh is home to North Carolina State University (NCSU) and is part of Research Triangle Park (RTP), together with Durham (home of Duke University and North Carolina Central University) and Chapel Hill (home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The \"Triangle\" nickname originated after the 1959 creation of the Research Triangle Park, located in Durham and Wake counties, among the three cities and their universities. The  Research Triangle region  encompasses the U.S. Census Bureau's Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which had an estimated population of 2,037,430 in 2013. The Raleigh metropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 1,214,516 in 2013.\nMost of Raleigh is located within Wake County, with a very small portion extending into Durham County. The towns of Cary, Morrisville, Garner, Clayton, Wake Forest, Apex, Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina, Knightdale, Wendell, Zebulon, and Rolesville are some of Raleigh's primary nearby suburbs and satellite towns.\nRaleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city. Following the American Revolutionary War when the US gained independence, this was chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol in Union Square at the center. During the American Civil War, the city was spared from any significant battle. It fell to the Union in the closing days of the war, and struggled with the economic hardships in the postwar period related to the reconstitution of labor markets, over-reliance on agriculture, and the social unrest of the Reconstruction Era. Following the establishment of the Research Triangle Park (RTP) in 1959, several tens of thousands of jobs were created in the fields of science and technology, and it became one of the fastest-growing communities in the United States by the early 21st century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Earlier capitals ===\nBath, the oldest town in North Carolina, was the first nominal capital of the colony from 1705 until 1722, when Edenton took over the role. The colony had no permanent institutions of government until the new capital, New Bern, was established in 1743.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nIn December 1770, Joel Lane successfully petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to create a new county. On January 5, 1771, the bill creating Wake County was passed in the General Assembly. The county was formed from portions of Cumberland, Orange, and Johnston counties. The county was named for Margaret Wake Tryon, the wife of Governor William Tryon. The first county seat was Bloomsbury.\nNew Bern, a port town on the Neuse River 35 miles (56 km) from the Atlantic Ocean, was the largest city and the capital of North Carolina during the American Revolution. When the British Army laid siege to the city, that site could no longer be used as capital. From 1789 to 1794, when Raleigh was being built, the state capital was Fayetteville.\nRaleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital in 1788, as its central location protected it from attacks from the coast. It was officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital (incorporated on December 31, 1792 \u2013 charter granted January 21, 1795). The city was named for Sir Walter Raleigh, sponsor of Roanoke, the \"lost colony\" on Roanoke Island.The city's location was chosen, in part, for being within 11 mi (18 km) from Isaac Hunter's Tavern, a popular tavern frequented by the state legislators. No known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site. Raleigh is one of the few cities in the United States that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital. Its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of North, East, West and South. The plan, a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner, was based on Thomas Holme's 1682 plan for Philadelphia.The North Carolina General Assembly first met in Raleigh in December 1794, and granted the city a charter, with a board of seven appointed commissioners and an \"Intendant of Police\" (which developed as the office of Mayor) to govern it. (After 1803 city commissioners were elected.) In 1799, the N.C. Minerva and Raleigh Advertiser was the first newspaper published in Raleigh. John Haywood was the first Intendant of Police.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn 1808, Andrew Johnson, the nation's future 17th President, was born at Casso's Inn in Raleigh. The city's first water supply network was completed in 1818, although due to system failures, the project was abandoned. In 1819 Raleigh's first volunteer fire company was founded, followed in 1821 by a full-time fire company.\nIn 1817, the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina was established and headquartered in Raleigh.\nIn 1831, a fire destroyed the North Carolina State House. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried gneiss being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completions of the new State Capitol and new Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company in 1840.\nIn 1853, the first State Fair was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, Peace College, was established in 1857. Raleigh's Historic Oakwood contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition.\nNorth Carolina seceded from the Union. After the Civil War began, Governor Zebulon Baird Vance ordered the construction of breastworks around the city as protection from Union troops. During General Sherman's Carolinas Campaign, Raleigh was captured by Union cavalry under the command of General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick on April 13, 1865. As the Confederate cavalry retreated west, the Union soldiers followed, leading to the nearby Battle of Morrisville. The city was spared significant destruction during the War.\nDue to the economic and social problems of the post-war period and Reconstruction, with a state economy still overly based on agriculture, it grew little over the next several decades.\n\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, African Americans were emancipated. The Reconstruction era legislature established public education for blacks and whites. Freedmen were often led by free blacks who had become educated before the war. With the help of the Freedmen's Bureau, many freedmen migrated from rural areas to Raleigh. It had an established free black community, more work opportunities, and many freedmen wanted to get out from under white supervision in the rural areas.\nShaw University, the South's first African American college, began classes in 1865 and was chartered in 1875. Its Estey Hall was the first building constructed for the higher education of black women, and Leonard Medical Center was the first four-year medical school in the country for African Americans.\nIn 1867, Episcopal clergy founded St. Augustine's College for the education of freedmen. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the nation's first school for blind and deaf blacks, to be located in Raleigh. In 1874, the federal government constructed the Federal Building in Raleigh, the first federal government project in the South following the Civil War.\nIn 1880, the newspapers News and Observer combined to form The News & Observer. It continues to be Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, was founded as a land-grant college in 1887. The city's Rex Hospital opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as Meredith College, opened in 1891, and in 1898, The Academy of Music, a private music conservatory, was established.\nIn the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and allies were unsuccessful. Based on a white supremacy campaign that returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote also disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office\u2014local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive in the state.\nIt was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. By that time many African Americans had left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for more opportunities. No African American was elected to Congress from North Carolina until 1992.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1912, Bloomsbury Park opened, featuring a popular carousel ride. Relocated to Pullen Park, the Pullen Park Carousel is still operating.\nFrom 1914 to 1917, an influenza epidemic killed 288 Raleighites.In 1922, WLAC signed on as the city's first radio station, but lasted only two years. WFBQ signed on in 1924 and became WPTF in 1927. It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster.\nFollowing immigration by Catholics, on December 12, 1924, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh was officially established by Pope Pius XI. The Sacred Heart Cathedral became the official seat of the diocese with William Joseph Hafey as its bishop.\nThe city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field, opened in 1929. That same year, the stock market crash resulted in six Raleigh banks closing.During the difficult 1930s of the Great Depression, government at all levels was integral to creating jobs. The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, Raleigh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated. The North Carolina Symphony, founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park. In 1939, the State General Assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority to build a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham, with the first flight occurring in 1943.\nIn 1947, Raleigh citizens adopted a council\u2013manager form of government, the current form. Council members are elected from single-member districts. They hire a city manager.\nThe Dorton Arena, a 7,610-seat multi-purpose arena designed by Matthew Nowicki, was opened in 1952 on the grounds of the North Carolina State Fair. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\nRaleigh experienced significant damage from Hurricane Hazel in 1954.\nIn 1953, WNAO-TV, channel 28, became the city's first television station, though it folded in 1957.\nWith the opening of the Research Triangle Park in 1959, Raleigh began to experience a population increase, resulting in a total city population of 100,000 by 1960. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Raleigh's population as 76.4% white and 23.4% black.Following the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the main achievements of the Civil Rights Movement and the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency, political participation and voting by African Americans in Raleigh increased rapidly.\nFrom the early-to-mid 20th century East Hargett Street was known as Raleigh's \"black main street\" and hosted numerous black-owned businesses. The area declined after the city desegregated its establishments.By the early 1970s people in Raleigh were growing increasingly concerned about growth and urban sprawl. Community organizations felt that municipal offices were being too heavily influenced by business interests when the city's population was rapidly growing and various development projects were being proposed. At their behest, the municipal elections were altered so that the mayor was to be directly elected, instead of being selected by the city council. Most city council seats were then made responsible to districts, instead of being held at-large. The 1973 elections were the first contests affected by the reforms. City Councilman Clarence Lightner defeated Raleigh Merchants bureau Executive Director G. Wesley Williams to become Raleigh's first black mayor, and thus the first black mayor in a major white-majority city in the South.In 1976, the Raleigh City and Wake County schools merged to become the Wake County Public School System, now the largest school system in the state and 19th largest in the country.During the 1970s and 1980s, the I-440 beltline was constructed, easing traffic congestion and providing access to most major city roads.\nThe first Raleigh Convention Center (replaced in 2008) and Fayetteville Street Mall were both opened in 1977.

The Neuse River flows through the northeast end of the city.\nRaleigh is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet. This area is known as the \"fall line\" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain. Its central Piedmont location situates Raleigh about two hours west of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, by car and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains. The city is 170 miles (270 km) south of Richmond, Virginia, 278 miles (447 km) south of Washington, D.C., and 166 miles (267 km) northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina. A small portion of the city is located in Durham County.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nRaleigh is divided into several major geographic areas, each of which use a Raleigh address and a ZIP code that begins with the digits 276. PNC Plaza, formerly known as RBC Plaza, is the largest and tallest skyscraper in the city of Raleigh. The tower rises to a height of 538 feet (164 m), with a floor count of 34.\n\n\n==== Downtown and inside-the-beltline neighborhoods ====\n\nThe downtown area is home to historic buildings such as the Sir Walter Raleigh Hotel built in the early 20th century, the restored City Market, the Fayetteville Street downtown business district, which includes the PNC Plaza and Wells Fargo Capitol Center buildings, as well as the North Carolina Museum of History, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, North Carolina State Capitol, William Peace University, the City of Raleigh Museum, Raleigh Convention Center, Shaw University, Campbell University School of Law, and St. Augustine's College. In the 2000s, an effort by the Downtown Raleigh Alliance was made to separate this area of the city into five smaller districts: Fayetteville Street, Moore Square, Glenwood South, Warehouse (Raleigh), and Capital District (Raleigh). Some of the names have become common place among locals such as the Warehouse, Fayetteville Street, and Glenwood South Districts.\nThe Inside the Beltline neighborhoods include Cameron Park, Boylan Heights, Country Club Hills, Coley Forest, Five Points, Budleigh, Glenwood-Brooklyn, Hayes Barton Historic District, Moore Square, Mordecai (home to the historic Mordecai House), Rochester Heights, South Park, Rosengarten Park, Belvidere Park, Woodcrest, Oberlin Village, and Historic Oakwood.

The PNC Arena is also located here adjacent to the North Carolina State Fairgrounds. These are located approximately 2 miles from Rex Hospital.\n\n\n==== North Raleigh ====\nNorth Raleigh is an expansive, diverse, and fast-growing suburban area of the city that is home to established neighborhoods to the south along with many newly built subdivisions and along its northern fringes.

This area is the least developed and least dense area of Raleigh (much of the area lies within the Swift Creek watershed district, where development regulations limit housing densities and construction). The area is bordered to the west by Cary, to the east by Garner, to the southwest by Holly Springs and the southeast by Fuquay-Varina. Neighborhoods in South Raleigh include Eagle Creek, Renaissance Park, Lake Wheeler, Swift Creek, Carolina Pines, Rhamkatte, Riverbrooke, and Enchanted Oaks.\n\n\n==== Southeast Raleigh ====\nSoutheast Raleigh is bounded by downtown on the west, Garner on the southwest, and rural Wake County to the southeast.

Winters are short and generally cool, with a normal January daily mean temperature of 41.0 \u00b0F (5.0 \u00b0C). On average, there are 69 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 2.7 days that fail to rise above freezing. Raleigh receives an average annual rainfall of 43.34 inches (110.1 cm). Annual and monthly (temperature and) precipitation data are in chart below. April is the driest month, with an average of 2.92 inches (74.2 mm) of precipitation. Precipitation is well distributed around the year, with a slight maximum between July and September; on average, July is the wettest month, owing to generally frequent, sometimes heavy, showers and thunderstorms. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of 80.0 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C). There are 48 days per year with highs at or above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C). Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall, but greater potential for extremely heavy rainfall in a one/two day period, owing to occasional threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) packing torrential rainfall. In September 1999, Raleigh recorded its wettest month ever, with over 21 inches of rain, due to torrential rainfall from tropical weather systems, most notably Hurricane Floyd on September 15\u201316. Extremes in temperature have ranged from \u22129 \u00b0F (\u221223 \u00b0C) on January 21, 1985 up to 105 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C), most recently on June 29\u201330 and July 8, 2012. Raleigh falls in USDA hardiness zones 7b (5 \u00b0F to 10 \u00b0F) and 8a (10 \u00b0F to 15 \u00b0F).Raleigh receives an average of 6.0 inches (15.2 cm) of snow in winter. Freezing rain and sleet also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging ice storm. On January 24\u201325, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm \u2013 20.3 inches (52 cm) \u2013 the Winter Storm of January 2000. Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of cold air damming that affects the city due to its proximity to the Appalachian Mountains.  Winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well.\nThe region also experiences occasional periods of drought, during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience hurricanes. In 1996, Hurricane Fran caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees. Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in September 1999 were primary contributors to that month's extreme rainfall of over 21 inches. The most recent hurricane to have a considerable effect on the area was Hurricane Florence in 2018. Tornadoes also have on occasion affected the city of Raleigh, most notably the November 28, 1988 tornado which occurred in the early morning hours and rated an F4 on the Fujita Tornado Scale and affected northwestern portions of the city.

The airport offers service to more than 35 domestic and international destinations and serves approximately 10 million passengers a year. The airport also offers facilities for cargo and general aviation. The airport authority tripled the size of its Terminal 2 (formerly Terminal C) in January 2011.\nPrivate Airport.Private general aviation airports in Raleigh include Triple W Airport (ICAO: K5W5, FAA LID: 5W5).\n\n\n==== Freeways and primary designated routes ====\n\n\n===== Interstate Highways =====\nI-40 traverses the southern part of the city, connecting Raleigh to Durham and Chapel Hill toward the west, and coastal Wilmington, North Carolina to the southeast.\nI-440, Also known locally as the Raleigh Beltline, it makes a loop around the central part of the city. The I-440 route labeling formerly encompassed the entire loop around the city, co-numbered though South Raleigh with I-40. In 2002, the NCDOT removed the I-440 designation from the co-numbered I-40 (southern and southwestern) sections of the loop, and the directional signage on the remaining I-440 portion was changed from Inner/Outer to East/West. The route designation changes were made to avoid driver confusion over the Inner/Outer designations, especially with Raleigh's new \"Outer Beltline\", as I-540 has become known.\nI-540/NC 540 is currently under development.\nI-87, designated September 5, 2017, follows the former route of Interstate 495. It begins at the I-40/I-440 interchange southeast of Raleigh and runs east, meeting I-540 and terminating at Rolesville Road. It is entirely concurrent with US 64. When the route is completed it will link Raleigh to the Norfolk, Virginia area.\n\n\n====== Future ======\nInterstate 42 will begin at I-40 south of Raleigh and will follow US 70 to Morehead City.\n\n\n===== United States Highways =====\nU.S. Route 1 enters the city from the north along Capital Boulevard, joins I-440 around the west side of Raleigh, and leaves the city to the southwest as the US 1/US 64 expressway in Cary.\nU.S. Route 64 is the main east-west route through Raleigh; all segments share routes with another highway. East of the city, US-64/US-264 is known as the Knightdale Bypass. US 64 follows I-440 (as a wrong way concurrency) and I-40 along southern Raleigh, and US 1 to the southwest.  A former alignment, designated as Business US-64, follows New Bern Avenue from the I-440 Beltline to the eastern boundary of the city, where it continues into Knightdale.\nU.S. Route 70 runs roughly northwest-southeast through Raleigh. North of downtown, the route follows Glenwood Avenue into Durham. South of Raleigh, the route (along with US 401 and NC 50) follows South Saunders and South Wilmington Streets into Garner. Through downtown, US 70 uses small segments of several streets, including Wade Avenue, Capital Boulevard, Dawson, and McDowell Streets.\nU.S. Route 264 cosigned with US 64 through East Raleigh.\nU.S. Route 401 north of downtown Raleigh it follows Capital Boulevard and Louisburg Road. South of downtown it is cosigned with US 70 from Wade Avenue southward.\n\n\n===== North Carolina Highways =====\nN.C. Route 54 follows Chapel Hill Road and Hillsborough Street in West Raleigh. The route ends at its interchange with I-440.\nN.C. Route 50 is a north-south route through Raleigh. North of Raleigh it follows Creedmoor Road. NC 50 joins US 70 and later US 401 in downtown Raleigh. The three routes remain together through south Raleigh.\nN.C. Route 98, known as Durham Road in North Raleigh, traverses the extreme northern parts of the city.\n\n\n==== Intercity rail ====\n\nRaleigh's train station is one of Amtrak's busiest stops in the Southern U.S. The station is served by five passenger trains daily: the Silver Star, thrice-daily Piedmont service, and the Carolinian. Daily service is offered between Raleigh and:\n\nCharlotte, with intermediate stops including Cary, Durham, Burlington and Greensboro, North Carolina.\nNew York City, with intermediate stops including Richmond, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; and Philadelphia.\nMiami, with intermediate stops including Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia; as well as Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa, Florida.\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\nPublic transportation in and around Raleigh is provided by GoRaleigh, which operates 33 fixed bus routes, including the R-Line and the Wake-Forest Loop. Although there are 33 routes, some routes are designed to cover multiple other routes at times when they are not served. Depending on the time of the day, and the day of the week, the number of routes operating is between 5 and 29.\nRaleigh is also served by GoTriangle (known formerly as the Triangle Transit Authority, and Triangle Transit). GoTriangle offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Research Triangle Park and several of the region's larger suburban communities. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nNorth Carolina State University also maintains its own transit system, the Wolfline, that provides zero-fare bus service to the general public along multiple routes serving the university's campuses in southwest Raleigh.\nGovernment agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.\nFrom 1995 the cornerstone of Triangle Transit's long-term plan was a 28-mile rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections.\nThe region's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.Greyhound Lines provides an inter-city bus service to Durham, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and other cities.\n\n\n==== Bicycle and pedestrian ====\nThe Maine-to-Florida U.S. Bicycle Route#1 routes through suburban Raleigh, along with N.C. Bicycle Route #2, the \"Mountains To Sea\" route. As of September 2010, maps and signage for both US Bike Route #1 and NC Bike Route #2 are out-of-date for the Raleigh area. N.C. Bicycle Route #5 is routed nearby, connecting Apex to Wilmington and closely paralleling the NCBC Randonneurs 600 kilometer brevet route.\nMost public buses are equipped with bicycle racks, and some roads have dedicated bicycle-only lanes. Bicyclists and pedestrians also may use Raleigh's extensive greenway system, with paths and trails located throughout the city.\nIn May 2011, Raleigh was designated a Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists at the Bronze level.\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Raleigh 36th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.\nIn 2002, the \"Walk [Your City]\" initiative was started in the city which provides a tool kit for neighborhood organizations to post signs giving a distance by bike or foot, with directions in scannable QR code. The movement has spread to more than 400 communities in 55 countries.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\nThe Raleigh Fire Department provides fire protection throughout the city. The North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women, the state's primary correctional facility housing female inmates is based in Raleigh.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nRaleigh has several sister cities:\n Xiangyang, Hubei, China\n Compi\u00e8gne, Oise, Hauts-de-France, France\n Kingston upon Hull, England, United Kingdom\n Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany\n Nairobi, Kenya\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of capitals in the United States\nList of municipalities in North Carolina\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Wake County, North Carolina\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nAmis, Moses N.

          "My biggest pet peeve with art museums is a lot of space and few exhibits. The CAM Museum takes that to an extreme. Big building and less than a dozen exhibits when I was there. They used up a huge room for one exhibit a basketball court with a bunch of squares as people on",
          "I have never been big into the Arts and expression; however, my visit was enlightening, enjoyable, peaceful, appreciative and intriguing. I will definitely return but this time with many exchange students from across the globe.",
          "I've seen pictures online of some of the exhibits and the art museum looked like something I would enjoy so we decided to make a trip to Raleigh to see it. On our visit it was basically empty with only some small art on the wall. I was very disappointed and glad we didn't pay",
          "Great little museum. Only four artists on display while we were there but they were talented. Tour takes less than one hour.",
          "There are only 3 exhibits on, but I liked them all. It was a good air conditioned stop on a hot day. $5 admission.",
          "There was one mural, one painting, and two small sculptures for the admission price of $5. I asked the receptionist to be sure if there wasn't anything else, and she assured me that any other exhibits had closed a week or two before.",
          "I like looking at art for the most part, but unfortunately I found this gallery to be a bit dull after a while. I think if you are an art enthusiast you will love it. They do offer traveling galleries quite often, so some of their galleries change from time to time. I did",
          "I visited here with a group on a Friday afternoon. There were about a dozen patrons including us. Admission was free, although they accept donations. The main exhibit up at the time was the Camstellation, an exhibit of hundreds of 2D work by local artists. The range of media,",

          "This museum is one you have to go to and \"experience it first hand\" to actually understand it, it's just one of those \"ART museums\" !! When I say \"First Friday\", is Electric, I mean, totally awesome! First, to all, First Friday is FREE, so that is a great PLUS! But most of all",

          "This museum is off the beaten path a bit in what is known as the warehouse district in Raleigh. You'd think it would be rough, but instead its quite the bohemian area, with a chocolate factory no less (not worth the visit to see, but worth it to buy the excellent chocolates).",
          "The Contemporary Art Museum of Raleigh is unlike any museum in NC. The artwork is very abstract and they rotate through new art pieces on a monthly basis. Definitely a must see attraction.",

          "This museum has the potential to be great but it falls short of the mark. It lacks contemporary peices. When I visited, there was one contemporary piece, and a bunch of photographs of the Durham bulls stadium. Not very interesting. I don't believe it's worth paying for, wait til",

          "Underwhelmed by the visit today. To start, they were out of brochures so there was no information about the pieces. The space itself is quite small so can not hold many items. The lower level made no sense. An empty room with background noise that looked like maybe it was",

          "My husband and I toured several art museums in the area. This is a small one but not to be overlooked. It was an old factory that has been converted to a museum. Definitely worth a visit.",

          "Not much here. Not near much either, except and outstanding BBQ place called the Pit. If you are an Art fan, the NC Museum of Art is outstanding. That is more toward the airport area of Raleigh. Downtown Raleigh tends to be a wannabee hip place and just doesn't pull it off.",
          "The space is not very large. When you have a lot of large pieces, you really can't fit too many in there. A few of the pieces were, technically, very interesting but some were just pretty lame. Pretzel sticks and pizza boxes are something that a child can throw together -",
          "Fantastic new modern art musem with interactive exhibits in a great space. The CAM was the highlight of downtown Raleigh and a MUST SEE if you have the chance.Entry is $5 and well worth it. Great to see a museum of this quality in a smaller city."

        "wiki": "The Neuse River Trail is a 33-mile (53 km) long paved greenway located in the Raleigh area of North Carolina, running along the banks of the Neuse River from Falls Lake Dam to the town of Clayton. The route passes through the jurisdictions of Raleigh, Wake Forest, Knightdale, and Clayton in Wake and Johnston counties. The Neuse River Greenway trail is part of the Capital Area Greenway system as well as the Mountains-to-Sea Trail that crosses North Carolina from the Great Smoky Mountains to the Outer Banks. Open to both cyclists and pedestrians, the Neuse River Trail is the longest greenway trail in North Carolina and the longest paved trail between northern Virginia and western Georgia.The Neuse River Trail is a part of the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000 mile long system of trails connecting Maine to Florida.\n\n\n== Route ==\nThe Neuse River Trail is split into seven sections, from North to South:\n\nFalls Lake Dam to Horseshoe Farm Park\nHorseshoe Farm Park to Buffaloe Road Athletic Park\nBuffaloe Road Athletic Park to Milburnie Dam\nMilburnie Dam to Anderson Point Park\nAnderson Point Park to Auburn Knightdale Road\nAuburn Knightdale Road to County Line\nCounty Line to North O'Neil Street in Clayton\n\n\n== Bridges ==\nThe Neuse River Trail is notable for its pedestrian bridges that span the Neuse River. Two suspension bridges span the river; one at Skycrest Road and the other at Louisburg Road. Designed by Stewart Inc., the two bridges are 275-foot (84 m) long, 12-foot (3.7 m) wide, feature concrete decks and 45-foot (14 m) tall steel towers. Other bridges over the Neuse River feature a steel truss design, such as the Milburnie Dam bridge. Bridges over wetland and creeks are constructed out of wood.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1976, the Raleigh City Council adopted the Capital Area Greenway System plan of which the Neuse River Corridor was a spine. In 1996, the Raleigh completed the Neuse River Regional Park Master Plan.\nThe major recommendations included in the Neuse River Plan:\n\nThe preservation of the full width of the floodplain along the Neuse River. The plan calls for the corridor to include the 100 year flood plan or extend 150-foot (46 m)) from the riverbank, whichever is greater.\nThe development of a trail system within the corridor with one 10-foot (3.0 m) wide asphalt trail extending the entire length;\nThe development of adjoining upland park areas at a spacing of 2 to 3 miles to provide various recreation opportunities and access points to the river and trail.When Raleigh approved the Neuse River Regional Park Master Plan in 1996 only a 3.5-mile (5.6 km) stretch of trail existed along the Hedingham neighborhood. Since then the city has acquired over 2,000 acres of land along the Neuse river for use as greenway as well as nine parcels of land for future parks.\nIn 2003 Raleigh voters approved a Parks and Recreation Bond Referendum that included $1.474 million for the development of the Upper Neuse Trail. In addition to the City's funding, Federal Enhancement funds of $893,000 and American Reinvestment and Recovery Act funds of $3.25 million were acquired by the Raleigh.\nIn November 2011 the first 6.5-mile (10.5 km) stretch of the Upper Neuse River Greenway opened from Falls Lake Dam to the WRAL Soccer Center. In April 2013, a 20 mile stretch from Horseshoe Farm Park to the Johnston County line officially opened. The last 1-mile (1.6 km) section of the greenway, at the Horseshoe Farm riverbend, was completed in 2014.   It is a connector between the Upper Neuse River section and the rest of the greenway. The town of Clayton's sections of the greenway include the 1.5-mile (2.4 km) Sam's Branch Greenway and the 4-mile (6.4 km) Clayton River Walk on the Neuse. Future plans call for the Greenway to connect with Legend Park and Municipal Park and to eventually extend to Clemmons State Forest - a total of approximately 3-mile (4.8 km). Additional sections will be constructed as funding becomes available.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nNeuse River\nCapital Area Greenway\nMountains-to-Sea Trail\nWRAL Soccer Center\nCliffs of the Neuse State Park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1] - Official Neuse River Greenway Trail website\n[2] - Capital Area Greenway System Map",

          "My husband and I did 26 miles on this trail and it was beautiful. Overhanging trees gave us a lot of shade while riding. There was a soccer park along the way that had bathrooms and water. The trail was wide and plenty of room for passing bikers. This is one of the best rails we",

          "This is a great trail for biking. The trail is mostly level, and is beautiful and peaceful. It does tend to get pretty crowded on weekends, however. You can travel the entire trail for over 20 miles. I would give it 5 stars except for how crowded it gets on weekends.",
          "Great trails to ride your bike, walk or run. Go here often. Meet for group runs and rides. Can get many miles under your belt if you go from start to finish.",
          "My favorite thing about Raleigh is the Neuse River Trail. My favorite \"access point\" is the Buffaloe Road Park access. I love the huge, wood and iron bridges that cross over the Neuse River. On a nice, sunny, day you can see turtles and other wildlife sunbathing. It is",
          "I love hoping over to the Neuse River Trail, it is right down the road from my house. Depending on the direction you go on the trail you can see different things. There is a fairly nice park not too far up the trail from where I usually park off Poole Rd. I enjoy taking my",
          "This trail is wonderful for biking or walking. It's paved and they recently opened the new section making it even better. It runs along the river so there are some really nice views as you go along. Worth a trip!",
          "have walked several sections - always crowded (good thing - no crooks) and clean. Looking to bike the whole thing",
          "Nice parking lot. it is paved and has 1/4 mile markers. it is very clean and perfect for kids to ride bikes on as well.",
          "We took our 18 month old son out for a bike ride. This is a beautiful paved trail and perfect for a bike trailer or BOB stroller, whatever your sport. We took to bike trailer and loved every minute. If you start at the fall dam trailhead there is a nice picnic area at about 4.5",
          "We brought our bikes along on our most recent visit to Raleigh, and the Neuse River Greenway did not disappoint. The paved trail runs 27 miles through suburbs that seem to vanish in the peaceful atmosphere of the trail. It's well-used, so it doesn't feel isolated or creepy, but",
          "I'd reco bikearound Raleigh.com for more great trails like this one. Easily everyone's fav. Watch out for our snake friends in summertime on the path sunning themselves. Now hit the trail! It is magnificent.",
          "In October I experienced a heart episode and after recovery, I decided it's time to get into better shape. Had that not happened I probably would have never found Raleigh's gem The Neuse River Trail. Walking or riding this trail is spectacular. Beginning at Fall's Lake the trail",
          "Extensive and pleasant for biking and hiking. Most of the time it is fairly quiet and peaceful. Note: often times parents let their toddlers roam on the trail and this could be dangerous when cyclist are riding (not their faults). Animals aren't always kept on leashes which is",
          "I enjoyed walking on this trail and all that it offered: the bridges, fresh air, and paved path. Before visiting I tried to identify if there were paths mapped out for 3, 4, 5 miles to no avail. Shortly after arriving and walking a little ways I began seeing 1/4 mile markers",
          "Running, hiking, biking, paddling, birding, or dog walking...it is hard to believe you are in a county of a million people. Wake's one true natural gem!",
          "If you like to be outside, come here. Here are trails to run on and squirrels fir the dog to chase. Last time I was there they were adding more pavement so it should be very nice by now. You are engulfed by greenery and fresh air. Fun place to hang out and you can go to the",
          "The NRT in my opinion is the best greenway in the Raleigh greenway system. The reason for this is there is something for everyone there. If you like scenery the trail parallels the Neuse River therefore always something to see around every corner. If you like exercise",

          "Business trip in Raleigh, had 1/2 day free. Wanting a place to relax, let out the stress. This trail is a total delight. Perfectly maintained (a bit too perfect if you expect a wilder atmosphere). The trail runs along the river with lots of trees. Locals ride their bikes, run",
          "We are from Wisconsin visiting and we totally recommend this trail. We biked for 51 miles and still do not see it all! We crossed over 53 bridges (one way), one is suspended, one tunnel, one waterfall and lots of wildlife.... deer, bluebirds, turtles, turkey vulture and more.",
          "I'm an avid bike rider and have tried most of the Greenway trails in Raleigh. All are fun and generally well done, but the Neuse River Trail is one of the best for riders of all ages. It's well marked and relatively flat over the entire course. I've taken my daughter and",
          "I'm fortunate enough to have the Neuse River Trail less than a mile from my home. In a few minutes, I forget that I live in a city of a half million people. River, trees, birds, deer, wildflowers, and yes snakes and other wildlife, all in a natural setting with a paved path",
          "This part of the greenway follows the Neuse River - for maybe 30 miles. You can see all kinds of wildlife - my favorite was a family of frogs. Lots of friendly bikers and walkers of all ages- and helpful if you get in a pinch.",
          "This trail is great for biking, hiking, or just strolling. There are various places to get on or off, so you determine the length.",
          "Fantastic trail. I ride 45 - 100 miles at a time on it. It's catching on, so you're not alone out there ! Stay to the right, don't let your (leashed) dog stray. There's a long way between water sources and bathrooms.",
          "I have visited this park less than a handful of times but I cant tell you it is very enjoyable. There are bike riders, runners, people in the river and others walking along the mostly paved path beside the river. I have done exercise early in the morning there (7-8am) and the",
          "This trail is not difficult to ride and in most parts is beautiful. Watch out! It is so beautiful that it is easy to ride 20 miles and then realize you have to ride 20 miles back to your car! Unless you're the Lance Armstrong type (drug-free, I hope) and can ride forever, you",
          "My wife and I have been hiking the trail very regularly this year, having walked nearly every step of its 32-mile length. But we have a number of favorite segments that we regularly return to, usually for a daily five-mile walk. We have enjoyed seeing a variety of wildflowers in",

          "I haven't ridden my bike in a while so was shocked I made it all the way from Anderson Point to the Wake/Johnston County line and back. What a nice ride, rolling hills, three hills I had to walk up. Breath taking scenery! No restrooms available on this stretch, except for where",
          "We rode the Neuse River Greenway trail this weekend for over 35 miles on our bikes and only saw ONE car. An amazing accomplishment for Raleigh area. On the greenway north of 440 there are water falls, and even farther north is a rare (and brand new) suspension pedestrian",
          "this is a crowning achievement for our community. We hope visitors will enjoy this trail. It is worth renting bikes and experiencing it first hand. Beautifully done; some shade for summer and not very hilly for leisure biking.",
          "This trail is a joy to use. I have biked the entire 30+ miles of this trail (except for the small section still under construction). Most of the trail is paved there are a few sections of dirt and a few places where you have to go onto roads. The trail is very well maintained",
          "Rode the full trail - had a blast. Trail is in great shape, not too much traffic and shady (important on a hot afternoon)",
          "As visitors to the area, we wanted to experience what the locals liked about living in the area. TripAdvisor ranked this attraction high, #2, so with tennis shoes extracted from the suitcase we headed out to Buffaloe park. Had a little difficulty initially finding the entrance",
          "We love this trail and walk different sections of it multiple times during the week. The weekends are a little busy and there are rude bikers who sneak up on you without warning, so keep your ears open for the sound of wheels behind you if it's a crowded day. Lots of wildlife",
          "We were in Wisconsin for a while and they are really into biking. You can bike for many miles without ever having to ride in traffic. You can bike out to eat and stop by a bike shop and so many people of all demographics use the trails. Now NC has a trail that rivals any",
          "Wow! So beautiful and well maintained! We went on a family bike ride with members of varying physical ability and everyone was happy. Beautiful scenery abounds and you can enjoy in complete safety. HIghly recommended! Easy access throughout the city too!",
          "We enjoyed the beautiful views and sounds of rushing water here. The trail is great for a nice-weather stroll. It is a great place to take photos. I would be here often if I lived in the area.",
          "This trail starts at the Falls of Neuse and wines all the way down Wake County to the Clayton area. Really nice walkway for easy strolls, jogs and bike riding. Well maintained and very scenic walkway. Remember that safety always travels in numbers.",
          "The trail is continually being expanded and will soon cross highway 401. It's currently great fun to go from Burlington Mills all the way up to the falls dam recreation area and the scenic falls lake.",
          "These are such great trails that the city has provided. Get our there and use them. Awesome for bikes, walks, runs, dogs. There are so many miles of it, you can pick a different section each weekend.",
          "Biking or walking the neuse river trail is very relaxing. We have seen Pileated woodpeckers, Barred owls, cardinals, bluebirds and numerous other birds. You can bike from the dam to the soccer fields on Durant and soon it will be connected to another section that almost makes",
          "The Neuse River Trail is a well-maintained, paved trail that crosses back and forth along the Neuse RIver. There are plenty of options for public parking and easy access, but no restroom facilities along the way. Wonderful for walking, running and cycling!",

          "My husband and I walked to try out a new trail for taking a leisurely walk on the weekends. This place was clean, well maintained, and you get the sound of the Neuse River while getting some exercise!",
          "Although I didn't end up walking the entire trail, it's a lovely place for a wander with friends or alone, and I found a few places where I could imagine just relaxing by the lake with a book and chocolate... Perfect place for a quiet, sunny afternoon",
          "The Neuse River Greenway, longest of its kind in the state, offers great exercise and relaxation. It also offers a way residents can connect with and experience some of our most precious and most threatened natural resources - our rivers and wetlands. This greenway connects",
          "I love being outside so I love the attention they have taken to make it a pleasant place to walk. So much fun...might buy a bkie",
          "The trail is great and I suspect will become a destination trail when the last little piece is complete making it nearly a metric century round trip. I have now ridden the Neuse River Trail a number of times in all seasons. Generally the trail runs along the river as you would",
          "This is a really nice trail, really good for those wanting a new scenery. We go here often with our children and dog. We haven't walked the complete trail so I'm not sure how many miles it run, but it is a great attractions to visit.",
          "We love this trail. it is wide and well maintained. The parking is easy and the trialheads are accessible. Great for walking and biking!",
          "Am a casual bicyclist and have ridden both sections of the Neuse River Trail, both the original from this dam to the soccer fields and the newer section from Hwy. 401 to Johnston county. All I can say is, the city of Raleigh has outdone itself! Both sections are well maintained,",
          "Fantastic trail, well planned and maintained. Just one of the outstanding greenway trails in Raleigh, NC. Other cities don't come close to the public attractions of their trails. enjoyed by the whole family all times of the year.",
          "As we live nearby, my wife and I take our road bikes on this path frequently. It is smooth, well maintained and quite pleasant to ride on. Soon (Spring 2014) a small remaining section will be completed and you will be able to ride from Falls Lake dam to the Johnson county line,",
          "The Neuse River trail is a great add to the Wake County Parks system. This is a great place to walk, or ride bikes. The fact that it runs along the Neuse River makes the trail relatively easy with only small hills. It also makes it really pretty along the river. they have",
          "Our son took us for a very pleasant hike along this trail, which is beautiful, clean, well-maintained, and convenient. His family often bikes along this trail as well. A nice reprieve from the city and suburbia. thanks, Raleigh!",
          "Love this trail for biking. There are no streets to cross like on the American Tobacco Trail in Durham. Very scenic and just a really pleasant ride.",

          "I walk this trail frequently and have walked many different sections with my two and a half year old son. The trail is absolutely beautiful, well maintained, and clean. The views along the trail are amazing with its many wetlands, bridges, and boardwalks. Not to mention the",
          "This trail is an 8 foot wide paved path that runs along the Neuse River. It is bordered by trees and is very beautiful. Parts of the path have wooden bridges. Some parts of the path back up to neighborhoods, but it is still very quiet and relaxing. Recommend enjoying this trail",
          "Runs alongside Neuse river and runs for over 23 miles. We've seen deer, turtles, rabbits, and a few snakes. A wonderful place to bike, walk, run, or rollerblade."

Only complaint is while on the paved part, it can get crowded. And many people that go don't seem to be that specially aware. You can also go paddle boating so that's neat.",
          "So my girlfriend and I came down here on vacation from New York State. We were staying in Cary North Carolina and decided to come check out this park because it had some good reviews. This was a very beautiful Park and loved the hike around \u2026",

I also like that there is always a lifeguard on duty!",

        "wiki": "The Mordecai House (also called the Mordecai Plantation or Mordecai Mansion), built in 1785, is a registered historical landmark and museum in Raleigh, North Carolina that is the centerpiece of Mordecai Historic Park, adjacent to the Historic Oakwood neighborhood. It is the oldest residence in Raleigh on its original foundation. In addition to the house, the Park includes the birthplace of President Andrew Johnson, the Ellen Mordecai Garden, the Badger-Iredell Law Office, Allen Kitchen and St. Mark's Chapel, a popular site for weddings. It is located in the Mordecai Place Historic District.\nThe oldest portion of the house was built by Joel Lane for his son, Henry. At one time, the plantation house was the center of a 5,000-acre (20 km2) plantation, one of the largest in Wake County. Lane is considered a founder of Raleigh, as 1,000 acres was sold from his plantation as the site of the city.The house was named after Moses Mordecai, whose first wife, Margaret Lane, had inherited it from her father Henry. After she died, Mordecai married her sister Ann Lane. In 1824, Mordecai hired William Nichols, State Architect at the time, to enlarge the house. The addition was considered a significant work of Nichols, who had also been responsible for remodeling the original building containing the State House. With the addition of the four new rooms in 1826, the Mordecai house was transformed into a Greek Revival mansion.\nThe Mordecai family, descended from immigrant grandfather Moses Mordecai (1707\u20131781) of Bonn, Germany, became one of the original three hundred Jewish families in the United States and one of the few of Ashkenazic Jewish descent. The family members were prominent in local and state affairs. Jacob Mordecai, Moses' father, founded a girls' school in Warrenton, North Carolina. A prominent lawyer, Moses Mordecai was a member of the 1805 Court of Conference. With his first wife Margaret, Moses Mordecai had two sons, Henry and Jacob, and one daughter, Ellen. He and his second wife Ann had a daughter, named Margaret after his late wife, Ann's sister. Henry Mordecai became a prosperous planter at Mordecai House and was elected to the State Legislature. The family were also prominent slave owners, and many slaves, both those who worked in the home and those who worked the fields, lived on the former plantation.  The State Historic site narrates the stories of both the free and enslaved residents, including moving testimonials from three former slaves .  His daughter Margaret Mordecai married and inherited the mansion; her descendants owned and occupied Mordecai House until 1967. \nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Mordecai family sold off land, which was subdivided for the continuing expansion of Raleigh. In 1867, George Washington Mordecai donated land east of the city to establish a Confederate cemetery; he donated another plot for Wake County's first Hebrew Cemetery. (The adjacent Oakwood Cemetery, chartered in 1869, became the namesake of the large suburb that developed in the adjoining wooded land, which was earlier known as Mordecai Grove. In 1974, Oakwood became the first neighborhood in Raleigh to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places.)\nMordecai descendants owned the mansion property until 1967, when the house and its surrounding block were put on the market. Local preservationists protested and the city purchased the property, turning it over to the Raleigh Historic Sites Commission to supervise and develop as a historic park. The commission was able to obtain many original Mordecai furnishings, as well as preserve the family papers and library. Mordecai Historic Park is now managed by the City of Raleigh's Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Department. The Mordecai House is a designated Raleigh Historic Landmark. Mordecai House was featured in a season two episode of Ghost Hunters in which the TAPS team investigated claims of paranormal activity. Mordecai Historic Park has an exclusive paranormal research team since 2017, The Ghost Guild Inc., a registered nonprofit organization that investigates the location at least three times per year and presents their findings at the annual Haunted Mordecai Festival in October.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Registered Historic Places in North Carolina\nList of reportedly haunted places in N.C.\nList of the oldest buildings in North Carolina\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMordecai Historic Park website\nNational Register of Historic Place profile of Mordecai House\nMordecai Community website\nThe Ghost Guild website",

        "wiki": "Raleigh (; RAH-lee) is the capital of the state of North Carolina and the seat of Wake County in the United States. Raleigh is the second-largest city in the state, after Charlotte. Raleigh is known as the \"City of Oaks\" for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city. The city covers a land area of 142.8 square miles (370 km2). The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population as 474,069 as of July 1, 2019. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The city of Raleigh is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the lost Roanoke Colony in present-day Dare County.\nRaleigh is home to North Carolina State University (NCSU) and is part of Research Triangle Park (RTP), together with Durham (home of Duke University and North Carolina Central University) and Chapel Hill (home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The \"Triangle\" nickname originated after the 1959 creation of the Research Triangle Park, located in Durham and Wake counties, among the three cities and their universities. The  Research Triangle region  encompasses the U.S. Census Bureau's Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which had an estimated population of 2,037,430 in 2013. The Raleigh metropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 1,214,516 in 2013.\nMost of Raleigh is located within Wake County, with a very small portion extending into Durham County. The towns of Cary, Morrisville, Garner, Clayton, Wake Forest, Apex, Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina, Knightdale, Wendell, Zebulon, and Rolesville are some of Raleigh's primary nearby suburbs and satellite towns.\nRaleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city. Following the American Revolutionary War when the US gained independence, this was chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol in Union Square at the center. During the American Civil War, the city was spared from any significant battle. It fell to the Union in the closing days of the war, and struggled with the economic hardships in the postwar period related to the reconstitution of labor markets, over-reliance on agriculture, and the social unrest of the Reconstruction Era. Following the establishment of the Research Triangle Park (RTP) in 1959, several tens of thousands of jobs were created in the fields of science and technology, and it became one of the fastest-growing communities in the United States by the early 21st century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Earlier capitals ===\nBath, the oldest town in North Carolina, was the first nominal capital of the colony from 1705 until 1722, when Edenton took over the role. The colony had no permanent institutions of government until the new capital, New Bern, was established in 1743.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nIn December 1770, Joel Lane successfully petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to create a new county. On January 5, 1771, the bill creating Wake County was passed in the General Assembly. The county was formed from portions of Cumberland, Orange, and Johnston counties. The county was named for Margaret Wake Tryon, the wife of Governor William Tryon. The first county seat was Bloomsbury.\nNew Bern, a port town on the Neuse River 35 miles (56 km) from the Atlantic Ocean, was the largest city and the capital of North Carolina during the American Revolution. When the British Army laid siege to the city, that site could no longer be used as capital. From 1789 to 1794, when Raleigh was being built, the state capital was Fayetteville.\nRaleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital in 1788, as its central location protected it from attacks from the coast. It was officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital (incorporated on December 31, 1792 \u2013 charter granted January 21, 1795). The city was named for Sir Walter Raleigh, sponsor of Roanoke, the \"lost colony\" on Roanoke Island.The city's location was chosen, in part, for being within 11 mi (18 km) from Isaac Hunter's Tavern, a popular tavern frequented by the state legislators. No known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site. Raleigh is one of the few cities in the United States that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital. Its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of North, East, West and South. The plan, a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner, was based on Thomas Holme's 1682 plan for Philadelphia.The North Carolina General Assembly first met in Raleigh in December 1794, and granted the city a charter, with a board of seven appointed commissioners and an \"Intendant of Police\" (which developed as the office of Mayor) to govern it. (After 1803 city commissioners were elected.) In 1799, the N.C. Minerva and Raleigh Advertiser was the first newspaper published in Raleigh. John Haywood was the first Intendant of Police.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn 1808, Andrew Johnson, the nation's future 17th President, was born at Casso's Inn in Raleigh. The city's first water supply network was completed in 1818, although due to system failures, the project was abandoned. In 1819 Raleigh's first volunteer fire company was founded, followed in 1821 by a full-time fire company.\nIn 1817, the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina was established and headquartered in Raleigh.\nIn 1831, a fire destroyed the North Carolina State House. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried gneiss being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completions of the new State Capitol and new Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company in 1840.\nIn 1853, the first State Fair was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, Peace College, was established in 1857. Raleigh's Historic Oakwood contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition.\nNorth Carolina seceded from the Union. After the Civil War began, Governor Zebulon Baird Vance ordered the construction of breastworks around the city as protection from Union troops. During General Sherman's Carolinas Campaign, Raleigh was captured by Union cavalry under the command of General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick on April 13, 1865. As the Confederate cavalry retreated west, the Union soldiers followed, leading to the nearby Battle of Morrisville. The city was spared significant destruction during the War.\nDue to the economic and social problems of the post-war period and Reconstruction, with a state economy still overly based on agriculture, it grew little over the next several decades.\n\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, African Americans were emancipated. The Reconstruction era legislature established public education for blacks and whites. Freedmen were often led by free blacks who had become educated before the war. With the help of the Freedmen's Bureau, many freedmen migrated from rural areas to Raleigh. It had an established free black community, more work opportunities, and many freedmen wanted to get out from under white supervision in the rural areas.\nShaw University, the South's first African American college, began classes in 1865 and was chartered in 1875. Its Estey Hall was the first building constructed for the higher education of black women, and Leonard Medical Center was the first four-year medical school in the country for African Americans.\nIn 1867, Episcopal clergy founded St. Augustine's College for the education of freedmen. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the nation's first school for blind and deaf blacks, to be located in Raleigh. In 1874, the federal government constructed the Federal Building in Raleigh, the first federal government project in the South following the Civil War.\nIn 1880, the newspapers News and Observer combined to form The News & Observer. It continues to be Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, was founded as a land-grant college in 1887. The city's Rex Hospital opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as Meredith College, opened in 1891, and in 1898, The Academy of Music, a private music conservatory, was established.\nIn the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and allies were unsuccessful. Based on a white supremacy campaign that returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote also disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office\u2014local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive in the state.\nIt was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. By that time many African Americans had left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for more opportunities. No African American was elected to Congress from North Carolina until 1992.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1912, Bloomsbury Park opened, featuring a popular carousel ride. Relocated to Pullen Park, the Pullen Park Carousel is still operating.\nFrom 1914 to 1917, an influenza epidemic killed 288 Raleighites.In 1922, WLAC signed on as the city's first radio station, but lasted only two years. WFBQ signed on in 1924 and became WPTF in 1927. It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster.\nFollowing immigration by Catholics, on December 12, 1924, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh was officially established by Pope Pius XI. The Sacred Heart Cathedral became the official seat of the diocese with William Joseph Hafey as its bishop.\nThe city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field, opened in 1929. That same year, the stock market crash resulted in six Raleigh banks closing.During the difficult 1930s of the Great Depression, government at all levels was integral to creating jobs. The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, Raleigh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated. The North Carolina Symphony, founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park. In 1939, the State General Assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority to build a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham, with the first flight occurring in 1943.\nIn 1947, Raleigh citizens adopted a council\u2013manager form of government, the current form. Council members are elected from single-member districts. They hire a city manager.\nThe Dorton Arena, a 7,610-seat multi-purpose arena designed by Matthew Nowicki, was opened in 1952 on the grounds of the North Carolina State Fair. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\nRaleigh experienced significant damage from Hurricane Hazel in 1954.\nIn 1953, WNAO-TV, channel 28, became the city's first television station, though it folded in 1957.\nWith the opening of the Research Triangle Park in 1959, Raleigh began to experience a population increase, resulting in a total city population of 100,000 by 1960. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Raleigh's population as 76.4% white and 23.4% black.Following the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the main achievements of the Civil Rights Movement and the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency, political participation and voting by African Americans in Raleigh increased rapidly.\nFrom the early-to-mid 20th century East Hargett Street was known as Raleigh's \"black main street\" and hosted numerous black-owned businesses. The area declined after the city desegregated its establishments.By the early 1970s people in Raleigh were growing increasingly concerned about growth and urban sprawl. Community organizations felt that municipal offices were being too heavily influenced by business interests when the city's population was rapidly growing and various development projects were being proposed. At their behest, the municipal elections were altered so that the mayor was to be directly elected, instead of being selected by the city council. Most city council seats were then made responsible to districts, instead of being held at-large. The 1973 elections were the first contests affected by the reforms. City Councilman Clarence Lightner defeated Raleigh Merchants bureau Executive Director G. Wesley Williams to become Raleigh's first black mayor, and thus the first black mayor in a major white-majority city in the South.In 1976, the Raleigh City and Wake County schools merged to become the Wake County Public School System, now the largest school system in the state and 19th largest in the country.During the 1970s and 1980s, the I-440 beltline was constructed, easing traffic congestion and providing access to most major city roads.\nThe first Raleigh Convention Center (replaced in 2008) and Fayetteville Street Mall were both opened in 1977. Fayetteville Street was turned into a pedestrian-only street in an effort to help the then-ailing downtown area, but the plan was flawed and business declined for years to come. Fayetteville Street was reopened in 2007 as the main thoroughfare of Raleigh's downtown.The 1988 Raleigh tornado outbreak of November 28, 1988, was the most destructive of the seven tornadoes reported in Northeastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia between 1:00 AM and 5:45 AM. The Raleigh tornado produced over $77 million in damage, along with four fatalities (two in the city of Raleigh, and two in Nash County) and 154 injuries. The damage path from the storm was measured at 84 miles (135 km) long, and .5 miles (0.8 km) wide at times. The tornado was rated F4.In 1991, two large skyscrapers in Raleigh were completed, First Union Capitol Center and Two Hannover Square, along with the popular Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek in Southeast Raleigh.\nIn 1996, the Olympic Flame passed through Raleigh while on its way to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Also in 1996, Hurricane Fran struck the area, causing massive flooding and extensive structural damage. In addition, WRAL-TV became the first High-Definition broadcast station in the world.\nIn 1997, the National Hockey League's Hartford Whalers announced their intention to move to Raleigh as the Carolina Hurricanes, becoming the city's first major league professional sports franchise.\nIn 1999, the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (later renamed the RBC Center and now called PNC Arena), opened to provide a home for the Hurricanes and the NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team, as well as an up-to-date major concert venue.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Raleigh was featured prominently in a number of \"Top 10 Lists\", including those by Forbes, MSNBC and Money magazine, due to its quality of life and favorable business climate.In 2001, the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium complex was expanded with the addition of the Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts, Meymandi Concert Hall, Fletcher Opera Theater, Kennedy Theatre, Betty Ray McCain Gallery and Lichtin Plaza.Fayetteville Street reopened to vehicular traffic in 2006. A variety of downtown building projects began around this time including the 34-story RBC Bank Tower, multiple condominium projects and several new restaurants. Additional skyscrapers are in the proposal/planning phase.\nIn 2006, the city's NHL franchise, the Carolina Hurricanes, won the Stanley Cup, North Carolina's first and only professional sports championship.\nWith the opening of parts of I-540 from 2005 to 2007, a new 70-mile (110 km) loop around Wake County, traffic congestion eased somewhat in the North Raleigh area. Completion of the entire loop is expected to take another 15 years.\nIn 2008, the city's Fayetteville Street Historic District joined the National Register of Historic Places.\nIn September 2010, Raleigh hosted the inaugural Hopscotch Music Festival.\nIn January 2011, Raleigh hosted the National Hockey League All-Star Game.\nIn April 2011, a devastating EF-3 tornado hit Raleigh, and many other tornadoes touched down in the state (ultimately the largest, but not the strongest outbreak to ever hit the state), killing 24 people. The tornado tracked northeast through parts of Downtown, East Central Raleigh and Northeast Raleigh and produced $115 million in damages in Wake County. There were 4 fatalities in the city.In September 2015 Holy Trinity Anglican Church was opened; the first church to be built in downtown Raleigh since 1958.On July 26, 2017 the Catholic Diocese of Raleigh dedicated its new cathedral, Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral, the fifth-largest in the United States.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Raleigh occupies a total area of 144.0 square miles (373.0 km2), of which 142 square miles (369 km2) is land and 0.97 square miles (2.5 km2), or 0.76%, is covered by water. The Neuse River flows through the northeast end of the city.\nRaleigh is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet. This area is known as the \"fall line\" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain. Its central Piedmont location situates Raleigh about two hours west of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, by car and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains. The city is 170 miles (270 km) south of Richmond, Virginia, 278 miles (447 km) south of Washington, D.C., and 166 miles (267 km) northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina. A small portion of the city is located in Durham County.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nRaleigh is divided into several major geographic areas, each of which use a Raleigh address and a ZIP code that begins with the digits 276. PNC Plaza, formerly known as RBC Plaza, is the largest and tallest skyscraper in the city of Raleigh. The tower rises to a height of 538 feet (164 m), with a floor count of 34.\n\n\n==== Downtown and inside-the-beltline neighborhoods ====\n\nThe downtown area is home to historic buildings such as the Sir Walter Raleigh Hotel built in the early 20th century, the restored City Market, the Fayetteville Street downtown business district, which includes the PNC Plaza and Wells Fargo Capitol Center buildings, as well as the North Carolina Museum of History, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, North Carolina State Capitol, William Peace University, the City of Raleigh Museum, Raleigh Convention Center, Shaw University, Campbell University School of Law, and St. Augustine's College. In the 2000s, an effort by the Downtown Raleigh Alliance was made to separate this area of the city into five smaller districts: Fayetteville Street, Moore Square, Glenwood South, Warehouse (Raleigh), and Capital District (Raleigh). Some of the names have become common place among locals such as the Warehouse, Fayetteville Street, and Glenwood South Districts.\nThe Inside the Beltline neighborhoods include Cameron Park, Boylan Heights, Country Club Hills, Coley Forest, Five Points, Budleigh, Glenwood-Brooklyn, Hayes Barton Historic District, Moore Square, Mordecai (home to the historic Mordecai House), Rochester Heights, South Park, Rosengarten Park, Belvidere Park, Woodcrest, Oberlin Village, and Historic Oakwood. Inside the Beltline refers to I-440 which used to be called the Beltline before being re-branded to ease driver navigation. These neighborhoods were typically built before World War II.\n\n\n==== Midtown Raleigh ====\n\nMidtown Raleigh is a residential and commercial area just North of the I-440 Beltline and is part of North Raleigh. It is roughly framed by Glenwood/Creedmoor Road to the West, Wake Forest Road to the East, and Millbrook Road to the North. It includes shopping centers such as North Hills and Crabtree Valley Mall. It also includes North Hills Park and part of the Raleigh Greenway System. The term was coined by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, developer John Kane and planning director Mitchell Silver. The News & Observer newspaper started using the term for marketing purposes only. The Midtown Raleigh Alliance was founded on July 25, 2011 as a way for community leaders to promote the area.\n\n\n==== East Raleigh ====\nEast Raleigh is situated roughly from Capital Boulevard near the I-440 beltline to New Hope Road. Most of East Raleigh's development is along primary corridors such as U.S. 1 (Capital Boulevard), New Bern Avenue, Poole Road, Buffaloe Road, and New Hope Road. Neighborhoods in East Raleigh include Hedingham, Longview, Lockwood, Madonna Acres, New Hope, Thompson-Hunter and Wilder's Grove.

The area is bordered to the west by suburban Cary. It is home to North Carolina State University, Meredith College, Pullen Park, Pullen Memorial Baptist Church, the Islamic Association of Raleigh, Cameron Village, Lake Johnson, the North Carolina Museum of Art and historic Saint Mary's School. Primary thoroughfares serving West Raleigh, in addition to Hillsborough Street, are Avent Ferry Road, Blue Ridge Road, and Western Boulevard. The PNC Arena is also located here adjacent to the North Carolina State Fairgrounds. These are located approximately 2 miles from Rex Hospital.\n\n\n==== North Raleigh ====\nNorth Raleigh is an expansive, diverse, and fast-growing suburban area of the city that is home to established neighborhoods to the south along with many newly built subdivisions and along its northern fringes. The area generally falls North of Millbrook Road. It is primarily suburban with large shopping areas. Primary neighborhoods and subdivisions in North Raleigh include Bartons Creek Bluffs, Bedford, Bent Tree, Black Horse Run, Brier Creek, Brookhaven, Coachman's Trail, Crossgate, Crosswinds, Dominion Park, Durant Trails, Ethan's Glenn, Falls River, Greystone Village, Harrington Grove, Hidden Valley, Lake Park, Long Lake, North Haven, North Ridge, Oakcroft, Shannon Woods, Six Forks Station, Springdale Estates, Stonebridge, Stone Creek, Stonehenge, Summerfield, Valley Estates, Wakefield, Weathersfield, Windsor Forest, and Wood Valley.

This area is the least developed and least dense area of Raleigh (much of the area lies within the Swift Creek watershed district, where development regulations limit housing densities and construction). The area is bordered to the west by Cary, to the east by Garner, to the southwest by Holly Springs and the southeast by Fuquay-Varina. Neighborhoods in South Raleigh include Eagle Creek, Renaissance Park, Lake Wheeler, Swift Creek, Carolina Pines, Rhamkatte, Riverbrooke, and Enchanted Oaks.\n\n\n==== Southeast Raleigh ====\nSoutheast Raleigh is bounded by downtown on the west, Garner on the southwest, and rural Wake County to the southeast. The area includes areas along Rock Quarry Road, Poole Road, and New Bern Avenue. Primary neighborhoods include Chastain, Chavis Heights, Raleigh Country Club, Southgate, Kingwood Forest, Rochester Heights, Emerald Village and Biltmore Hills. Coastal Credit Union Music Park (formerly Time Warner Cable Music Pavilion, Alltel Pavilion and Walnut Creek Amphitheatre) is one of the region's major outdoor concert venues and is located on Rock Quarry Road. Shaw University is located in this part of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike much of the southeastern United States, Raleigh has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa). Winters are short and generally cool, with a normal January daily mean temperature of 41.0 \u00b0F (5.0 \u00b0C). On average, there are 69 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 2.7 days that fail to rise above freezing. Raleigh receives an average annual rainfall of 43.34 inches (110.1 cm). Annual and monthly (temperature and) precipitation data are in chart below. April is the driest month, with an average of 2.92 inches (74.2 mm) of precipitation. Precipitation is well distributed around the year, with a slight maximum between July and September; on average, July is the wettest month, owing to generally frequent, sometimes heavy, showers and thunderstorms. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of 80.0 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C). There are 48 days per year with highs at or above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C). Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall, but greater potential for extremely heavy rainfall in a one/two day period, owing to occasional threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) packing torrential rainfall. In September 1999, Raleigh recorded its wettest month ever, with over 21 inches of rain, due to torrential rainfall from tropical weather systems, most notably Hurricane Floyd on September 15\u201316. Extremes in temperature have ranged from \u22129 \u00b0F (\u221223 \u00b0C) on January 21, 1985 up to 105 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C), most recently on June 29\u201330 and July 8, 2012. Raleigh falls in USDA hardiness zones 7b (5 \u00b0F to 10 \u00b0F) and 8a (10 \u00b0F to 15 \u00b0F).Raleigh receives an average of 6.0 inches (15.2 cm) of snow in winter. Freezing rain and sleet also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging ice storm. On January 24\u201325, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm \u2013 20.3 inches (52 cm) \u2013 the Winter Storm of January 2000. Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of cold air damming that affects the city due to its proximity to the Appalachian Mountains.  Winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well.\nThe region also experiences occasional periods of drought, during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience hurricanes. In 1996, Hurricane Fran caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees. Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in September 1999 were primary contributors to that month's extreme rainfall of over 21 inches. The most recent hurricane to have a considerable effect on the area was Hurricane Florence in 2018. Tornadoes also have on occasion affected the city of Raleigh, most notably the November 28, 1988 tornado which occurred in the early morning hours and rated an F4 on the Fujita Tornado Scale and affected northwestern portions of the city. There also was the April 16, 2011 EF3 tornado, which affected portions of downtown and northeast Raleigh and the suburb of Holly Springs.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, the racial composition of the city was: 57.5% White (53.3% non-Hispanic white), 29.3% Black or African American, 4.3% Asian American (1.2% Indian, 0.8% Chinese, 0.7% Vietnamese, 0.5% Korean, 0.4% Filipino, 0.1% Japanese), 2.6% two or more races, 1.4% some other race, 0.5% Native American, and <0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific IslanderIn addition, 11.4% of city residents were Hispanic or Latino Americans, of any race (5.9% Mexican, 1.1% Puerto Rican, 0.9% Salvadoran, 0.6% Dominican, 0.6% Honduran, 0.3% Colombian, 0.3% Cuban, 0.2% Guatemalan, 0.2% Spanish, 0.2% Peruvian, 0.1% Venezuelan, 0.1% Ecuadorian, 0.1% Argentine, 0.1% Panamanian).\nAs of the 2000 United States census, there were 276,093 persons (July 2008 estimate was 380,173) and 61,371 families residing in Raleigh.

The airport offers service to more than 35 domestic and international destinations and serves approximately 10 million passengers a year. The airport also offers facilities for cargo and general aviation. The airport authority tripled the size of its Terminal 2 (formerly Terminal C) in January 2011.\nPrivate Airport.Private general aviation airports in Raleigh include Triple W Airport (ICAO: K5W5, FAA LID: 5W5).\n\n\n==== Freeways and primary designated routes ====\n\n\n===== Interstate Highways =====\nI-40 traverses the southern part of the city, connecting Raleigh to Durham and Chapel Hill toward the west, and coastal Wilmington, North Carolina to the southeast.\nI-440, Also known locally as the Raleigh Beltline, it makes a loop around the central part of the city. The I-440 route labeling formerly encompassed the entire loop around the city, co-numbered though South Raleigh with I-40. In 2002, the NCDOT removed the I-440 designation from the co-numbered I-40 (southern and southwestern) sections of the loop, and the directional signage on the remaining I-440 portion was changed from Inner/Outer to East/West. The route designation changes were made to avoid driver confusion over the Inner/Outer designations, especially with Raleigh's new \"Outer Beltline\", as I-540 has become known.\nI-540/NC 540 is currently under development.\nI-87, designated September 5, 2017, follows the former route of Interstate 495. It begins at the I-40/I-440 interchange southeast of Raleigh and runs east, meeting I-540 and terminating at Rolesville Road. It is entirely concurrent with US 64. When the route is completed it will link Raleigh to the Norfolk, Virginia area.\n\n\n====== Future ======\nInterstate 42 will begin at I-40 south of Raleigh and will follow US 70 to Morehead City.\n\n\n===== United States Highways =====\nU.S. Route 1 enters the city from the north along Capital Boulevard, joins I-440 around the west side of Raleigh, and leaves the city to the southwest as the US 1/US 64 expressway in Cary.\nU.S. Route 64 is the main east-west route through Raleigh; all segments share routes with another highway. East of the city, US-64/US-264 is known as the Knightdale Bypass. US 64 follows I-440 (as a wrong way concurrency) and I-40 along southern Raleigh, and US 1 to the southwest.  A former alignment, designated as Business US-64, follows New Bern Avenue from the I-440 Beltline to the eastern boundary of the city, where it continues into Knightdale.\nU.S. Route 70 runs roughly northwest-southeast through Raleigh. North of downtown, the route follows Glenwood Avenue into Durham. South of Raleigh, the route (along with US 401 and NC 50) follows South Saunders and South Wilmington Streets into Garner. Through downtown, US 70 uses small segments of several streets, including Wade Avenue, Capital Boulevard, Dawson, and McDowell Streets.\nU.S. Route 264 cosigned with US 64 through East Raleigh.\nU.S. Route 401 north of downtown Raleigh it follows Capital Boulevard and Louisburg Road. South of downtown it is cosigned with US 70 from Wade Avenue southward.\n\n\n===== North Carolina Highways =====\nN.C. Route 54 follows Chapel Hill Road and Hillsborough Street in West Raleigh. The route ends at its interchange with I-440.\nN.C. Route 50 is a north-south route through Raleigh. North of Raleigh it follows Creedmoor Road. NC 50 joins US 70 and later US 401 in downtown Raleigh. The three routes remain together through south Raleigh.\nN.C. Route 98, known as Durham Road in North Raleigh, traverses the extreme northern parts of the city.\n\n\n==== Intercity rail ====\n\nRaleigh's train station is one of Amtrak's busiest stops in the Southern U.S. The station is served by five passenger trains daily: the Silver Star, thrice-daily Piedmont service, and the Carolinian. Daily service is offered between Raleigh and:\n\nCharlotte, with intermediate stops including Cary, Durham, Burlington and Greensboro, North Carolina.\nNew York City, with intermediate stops including Richmond, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; and Philadelphia.\nMiami, with intermediate stops including Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia; as well as Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa, Florida.\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\nPublic transportation in and around Raleigh is provided by GoRaleigh, which operates 33 fixed bus routes, including the R-Line and the Wake-Forest Loop. Although there are 33 routes, some routes are designed to cover multiple other routes at times when they are not served. Depending on the time of the day, and the day of the week, the number of routes operating is between 5 and 29.\nRaleigh is also served by GoTriangle (known formerly as the Triangle Transit Authority, and Triangle Transit). GoTriangle offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Research Triangle Park and several of the region's larger suburban communities. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nNorth Carolina State University also maintains its own transit system, the Wolfline, that provides zero-fare bus service to the general public along multiple routes serving the university's campuses in southwest Raleigh.\nGovernment agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.\nFrom 1995 the cornerstone of Triangle Transit's long-term plan was a 28-mile rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections.\nThe region's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.Greyhound Lines provides an inter-city bus service to Durham, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and other cities.\n\n\n==== Bicycle and pedestrian ====\nThe Maine-to-Florida U.S. Bicycle Route#1 routes through suburban Raleigh, along with N.C. Bicycle Route #2, the \"Mountains To Sea\" route. As of September 2010, maps and signage for both US Bike Route #1 and NC Bike Route #2 are out-of-date for the Raleigh area. N.C. Bicycle Route #5 is routed nearby, connecting Apex to Wilmington and closely paralleling the NCBC Randonneurs 600 kilometer brevet route.\nMost public buses are equipped with bicycle racks, and some roads have dedicated bicycle-only lanes. Bicyclists and pedestrians also may use Raleigh's extensive greenway system, with paths and trails located throughout the city.\nIn May 2011, Raleigh was designated a Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists at the Bronze level.\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Raleigh 36th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.\nIn 2002, the \"Walk [Your City]\" initiative was started in the city which provides a tool kit for neighborhood organizations to post signs giving a distance by bike or foot, with directions in scannable QR code. The movement has spread to more than 400 communities in 55 countries.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\nThe Raleigh Fire Department provides fire protection throughout the city. The North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women, the state's primary correctional facility housing female inmates is based in Raleigh.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nRaleigh has several sister cities:\n Xiangyang, Hubei, China\n Compi\u00e8gne, Oise, Hauts-de-France, France\n Kingston upon Hull, England, United Kingdom\n Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany\n Nairobi, Kenya\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of capitals in the United States\nList of municipalities in North Carolina\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Wake County, North Carolina\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nAmis, Moses N.

          "The main exhibits now are by Christina Weisner. One focuses on the Ries Meteorite Impact Crater in Germany, 15 miles across and containing the entire city of Nordlingen, built before anyone understood that the great depression or bowl that nestles the city is actually a",
          "I became a Bob Trotman fan after seeing some of his work at other art museums. When I heard he had an exhibit 20 minutes away I just had to go. The museum is on the North Carolina State University campus and it offers plenty of parking: 1. The NCSU bell tower parking lot",
          "A small gallery with wonderful collections can be seen here. The fees the students pay fund this marvel.",
          "The art exhibit looked like it was done by preschoolers. The photos were ok, would have been more interesting if I was into Blues music. The part worth seeing ( it was 5 star) was the exhibit of Indian pottery, basketry and jewelry...there was some beautiful items in it.",
          "I am not an art guy nor a big museum guy but we treated some out of town friends to the Gregg. Nice layout, comforting environment and some pieces really interesting. Our friends really enjoyed themselves.",

        "wiki": "Raleigh (; RAH-lee) is the capital of the state of North Carolina and the seat of Wake County in the United States. Raleigh is the second-largest city in the state, after Charlotte. Raleigh is known as the \"City of Oaks\" for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city. The city covers a land area of 142.8 square miles (370 km2). The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population as 474,069 as of July 1, 2019. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The city of Raleigh is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the lost Roanoke Colony in present-day Dare County.\nRaleigh is home to North Carolina State University (NCSU) and is part of Research Triangle Park (RTP), together with Durham (home of Duke University and North Carolina Central University) and Chapel Hill (home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The \"Triangle\" nickname originated after the 1959 creation of the Research Triangle Park, located in Durham and Wake counties, among the three cities and their universities. The  Research Triangle region  encompasses the U.S. Census Bureau's Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which had an estimated population of 2,037,430 in 2013. The Raleigh metropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 1,214,516 in 2013.\nMost of Raleigh is located within Wake County, with a very small portion extending into Durham County. The towns of Cary, Morrisville, Garner, Clayton, Wake Forest, Apex, Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina, Knightdale, Wendell, Zebulon, and Rolesville are some of Raleigh's primary nearby suburbs and satellite towns.\nRaleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city. Following the American Revolutionary War when the US gained independence, this was chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol in Union Square at the center. During the American Civil War, the city was spared from any significant battle. It fell to the Union in the closing days of the war, and struggled with the economic hardships in the postwar period related to the reconstitution of labor markets, over-reliance on agriculture, and the social unrest of the Reconstruction Era. Following the establishment of the Research Triangle Park (RTP) in 1959, several tens of thousands of jobs were created in the fields of science and technology, and it became one of the fastest-growing communities in the United States by the early 21st century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Earlier capitals ===\nBath, the oldest town in North Carolina, was the first nominal capital of the colony from 1705 until 1722, when Edenton took over the role. The colony had no permanent institutions of government until the new capital, New Bern, was established in 1743.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nIn December 1770, Joel Lane successfully petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to create a new county. On January 5, 1771, the bill creating Wake County was passed in the General Assembly. The county was formed from portions of Cumberland, Orange, and Johnston counties. The county was named for Margaret Wake Tryon, the wife of Governor William Tryon. The first county seat was Bloomsbury.\nNew Bern, a port town on the Neuse River 35 miles (56 km) from the Atlantic Ocean, was the largest city and the capital of North Carolina during the American Revolution. When the British Army laid siege to the city, that site could no longer be used as capital. From 1789 to 1794, when Raleigh was being built, the state capital was Fayetteville.\nRaleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital in 1788, as its central location protected it from attacks from the coast. It was officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital (incorporated on December 31, 1792 \u2013 charter granted January 21, 1795). The city was named for Sir Walter Raleigh, sponsor of Roanoke, the \"lost colony\" on Roanoke Island.The city's location was chosen, in part, for being within 11 mi (18 km) from Isaac Hunter's Tavern, a popular tavern frequented by the state legislators. No known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site. Raleigh is one of the few cities in the United States that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital. Its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of North, East, West and South. The plan, a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner, was based on Thomas Holme's 1682 plan for Philadelphia.The North Carolina General Assembly first met in Raleigh in December 1794, and granted the city a charter, with a board of seven appointed commissioners and an \"Intendant of Police\" (which developed as the office of Mayor) to govern it. (After 1803 city commissioners were elected.) In 1799, the N.C. Minerva and Raleigh Advertiser was the first newspaper published in Raleigh. John Haywood was the first Intendant of Police.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn 1808, Andrew Johnson, the nation's future 17th President, was born at Casso's Inn in Raleigh. The city's first water supply network was completed in 1818, although due to system failures, the project was abandoned. In 1819 Raleigh's first volunteer fire company was founded, followed in 1821 by a full-time fire company.\nIn 1817, the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina was established and headquartered in Raleigh.\nIn 1831, a fire destroyed the North Carolina State House. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried gneiss being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completions of the new State Capitol and new Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company in 1840.\nIn 1853, the first State Fair was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, Peace College, was established in 1857. Raleigh's Historic Oakwood contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition.\nNorth Carolina seceded from the Union. After the Civil War began, Governor Zebulon Baird Vance ordered the construction of breastworks around the city as protection from Union troops. During General Sherman's Carolinas Campaign, Raleigh was captured by Union cavalry under the command of General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick on April 13, 1865. As the Confederate cavalry retreated west, the Union soldiers followed, leading to the nearby Battle of Morrisville. The city was spared significant destruction during the War.\nDue to the economic and social problems of the post-war period and Reconstruction, with a state economy still overly based on agriculture, it grew little over the next several decades.\n\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, African Americans were emancipated. The Reconstruction era legislature established public education for blacks and whites. Freedmen were often led by free blacks who had become educated before the war. With the help of the Freedmen's Bureau, many freedmen migrated from rural areas to Raleigh. It had an established free black community, more work opportunities, and many freedmen wanted to get out from under white supervision in the rural areas.\nShaw University, the South's first African American college, began classes in 1865 and was chartered in 1875. Its Estey Hall was the first building constructed for the higher education of black women, and Leonard Medical Center was the first four-year medical school in the country for African Americans.\nIn 1867, Episcopal clergy founded St. Augustine's College for the education of freedmen. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the nation's first school for blind and deaf blacks, to be located in Raleigh. In 1874, the federal government constructed the Federal Building in Raleigh, the first federal government project in the South following the Civil War.\nIn 1880, the newspapers News and Observer combined to form The News & Observer. It continues to be Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, was founded as a land-grant college in 1887. The city's Rex Hospital opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as Meredith College, opened in 1891, and in 1898, The Academy of Music, a private music conservatory, was established.\nIn the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and allies were unsuccessful. Based on a white supremacy campaign that returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote also disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office\u2014local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive in the state.\nIt was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. By that time many African Americans had left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for more opportunities. No African American was elected to Congress from North Carolina until 1992.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1912, Bloomsbury Park opened, featuring a popular carousel ride. Relocated to Pullen Park, the Pullen Park Carousel is still operating.\nFrom 1914 to 1917, an influenza epidemic killed 288 Raleighites.In 1922, WLAC signed on as the city's first radio station, but lasted only two years. WFBQ signed on in 1924 and became WPTF in 1927. It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster.\nFollowing immigration by Catholics, on December 12, 1924, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh was officially established by Pope Pius XI. The Sacred Heart Cathedral became the official seat of the diocese with William Joseph Hafey as its bishop.\nThe city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field, opened in 1929. That same year, the stock market crash resulted in six Raleigh banks closing.During the difficult 1930s of the Great Depression, government at all levels was integral to creating jobs. The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, Raleigh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated. The North Carolina Symphony, founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park. In 1939, the State General Assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority to build a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham, with the first flight occurring in 1943.\nIn 1947, Raleigh citizens adopted a council\u2013manager form of government, the current form. Council members are elected from single-member districts. They hire a city manager.\nThe Dorton Arena, a 7,610-seat multi-purpose arena designed by Matthew Nowicki, was opened in 1952 on the grounds of the North Carolina State Fair. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\nRaleigh experienced significant damage from Hurricane Hazel in 1954.\nIn 1953, WNAO-TV, channel 28, became the city's first television station, though it folded in 1957.\nWith the opening of the Research Triangle Park in 1959, Raleigh began to experience a population increase, resulting in a total city population of 100,000 by 1960. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Raleigh's population as 76.4% white and 23.4% black.Following the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the main achievements of the Civil Rights Movement and the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency, political participation and voting by African Americans in Raleigh increased rapidly.\nFrom the early-to-mid 20th century East Hargett Street was known as Raleigh's \"black main street\" and hosted numerous black-owned businesses. The area declined after the city desegregated its establishments.By the early 1970s people in Raleigh were growing increasingly concerned about growth and urban sprawl. Community organizations felt that municipal offices were being too heavily influenced by business interests when the city's population was rapidly growing and various development projects were being proposed. At their behest, the municipal elections were altered so that the mayor was to be directly elected, instead of being selected by the city council. Most city council seats were then made responsible to districts, instead of being held at-large. The 1973 elections were the first contests affected by the reforms. City Councilman Clarence Lightner defeated Raleigh Merchants bureau Executive Director G. Wesley Williams to become Raleigh's first black mayor, and thus the first black mayor in a major white-majority city in the South.In 1976, the Raleigh City and Wake County schools merged to become the Wake County Public School System, now the largest school system in the state and 19th largest in the country.During the 1970s and 1980s, the I-440 beltline was constructed, easing traffic congestion and providing access to most major city roads.\nThe first Raleigh Convention Center (replaced in 2008) and Fayetteville Street Mall were both opened in 1977. Fayetteville Street was turned into a pedestrian-only street in an effort to help the then-ailing downtown area, but the plan was flawed and business declined for years to come. Fayetteville Street was reopened in 2007 as the main thoroughfare of Raleigh's downtown.The 1988 Raleigh tornado outbreak of November 28, 1988, was the most destructive of the seven tornadoes reported in Northeastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia between 1:00 AM and 5:45 AM. The Raleigh tornado produced over $77 million in damage, along with four fatalities (two in the city of Raleigh, and two in Nash County) and 154 injuries. The damage path from the storm was measured at 84 miles (135 km) long, and .5 miles (0.8 km) wide at times. The tornado was rated F4.In 1991, two large skyscrapers in Raleigh were completed, First Union Capitol Center and Two Hannover Square, along with the popular Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek in Southeast Raleigh.\nIn 1996, the Olympic Flame passed through Raleigh while on its way to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Also in 1996, Hurricane Fran struck the area, causing massive flooding and extensive structural damage. In addition, WRAL-TV became the first High-Definition broadcast station in the world.\nIn 1997, the National Hockey League's Hartford Whalers announced their intention to move to Raleigh as the Carolina Hurricanes, becoming the city's first major league professional sports franchise.\nIn 1999, the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (later renamed the RBC Center and now called PNC Arena), opened to provide a home for the Hurricanes and the NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team, as well as an up-to-date major concert venue.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Raleigh was featured prominently in a number of \"Top 10 Lists\", including those by Forbes, MSNBC and Money magazine, due to its quality of life and favorable business climate.In 2001, the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium complex was expanded with the addition of the Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts, Meymandi Concert Hall, Fletcher Opera Theater, Kennedy Theatre, Betty Ray McCain Gallery and Lichtin Plaza.Fayetteville Street reopened to vehicular traffic in 2006. A variety of downtown building projects began around this time including the 34-story RBC Bank Tower, multiple condominium projects and several new restaurants. Additional skyscrapers are in the proposal/planning phase.\nIn 2006, the city's NHL franchise, the Carolina Hurricanes, won the Stanley Cup, North Carolina's first and only professional sports championship.\nWith the opening of parts of I-540 from 2005 to 2007, a new 70-mile (110 km) loop around Wake County, traffic congestion eased somewhat in the North Raleigh area. Completion of the entire loop is expected to take another 15 years.\nIn 2008, the city's Fayetteville Street Historic District joined the National Register of Historic Places.\nIn September 2010, Raleigh hosted the inaugural Hopscotch Music Festival.\nIn January 2011, Raleigh hosted the National Hockey League All-Star Game.\nIn April 2011, a devastating EF-3 tornado hit Raleigh, and many other tornadoes touched down in the state (ultimately the largest, but not the strongest outbreak to ever hit the state), killing 24 people. The tornado tracked northeast through parts of Downtown, East Central Raleigh and Northeast Raleigh and produced $115 million in damages in Wake County. There were 4 fatalities in the city.In September 2015 Holy Trinity Anglican Church was opened; the first church to be built in downtown Raleigh since 1958.On July 26, 2017 the Catholic Diocese of Raleigh dedicated its new cathedral, Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral, the fifth-largest in the United States.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Raleigh occupies a total area of 144.0 square miles (373.0 km2), of which 142 square miles (369 km2) is land and 0.97 square miles (2.5 km2), or 0.76%, is covered by water. The Neuse River flows through the northeast end of the city.\nRaleigh is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet. This area is known as the \"fall line\" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain. Its central Piedmont location situates Raleigh about two hours west of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, by car and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains. The city is 170 miles (270 km) south of Richmond, Virginia, 278 miles (447 km) south of Washington, D.C., and 166 miles (267 km) northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina. A small portion of the city is located in Durham County.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nRaleigh is divided into several major geographic areas, each of which use a Raleigh address and a ZIP code that begins with the digits 276. PNC Plaza, formerly known as RBC Plaza, is the largest and tallest skyscraper in the city of Raleigh. The tower rises to a height of 538 feet (164 m), with a floor count of 34.\n\n\n==== Downtown and inside-the-beltline neighborhoods ====\n\nThe downtown area is home to historic buildings such as the Sir Walter Raleigh Hotel built in the early 20th century, the restored City Market, the Fayetteville Street downtown business district, which includes the PNC Plaza and Wells Fargo Capitol Center buildings, as well as the North Carolina Museum of History, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, North Carolina State Capitol, William Peace University, the City of Raleigh Museum, Raleigh Convention Center, Shaw University, Campbell University School of Law, and St. Augustine's College. In the 2000s, an effort by the Downtown Raleigh Alliance was made to separate this area of the city into five smaller districts: Fayetteville Street, Moore Square, Glenwood South, Warehouse (Raleigh), and Capital District (Raleigh). Some of the names have become common place among locals such as the Warehouse, Fayetteville Street, and Glenwood South Districts.\nThe Inside the Beltline neighborhoods include Cameron Park, Boylan Heights, Country Club Hills, Coley Forest, Five Points, Budleigh, Glenwood-Brooklyn, Hayes Barton Historic District, Moore Square, Mordecai (home to the historic Mordecai House), Rochester Heights, South Park, Rosengarten Park, Belvidere Park, Woodcrest, Oberlin Village, and Historic Oakwood. Inside the Beltline refers to I-440 which used to be called the Beltline before being re-branded to ease driver navigation. These neighborhoods were typically built before World War II.\n\n\n==== Midtown Raleigh ====\n\nMidtown Raleigh is a residential and commercial area just North of the I-440 Beltline and is part of North Raleigh. It is roughly framed by Glenwood/Creedmoor Road to the West, Wake Forest Road to the East, and Millbrook Road to the North. It includes shopping centers such as North Hills and Crabtree Valley Mall. It also includes North Hills Park and part of the Raleigh Greenway System. The term was coined by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, developer John Kane and planning director Mitchell Silver. The News & Observer newspaper started using the term for marketing purposes only. The Midtown Raleigh Alliance was founded on July 25, 2011 as a way for community leaders to promote the area.\n\n\n==== East Raleigh ====\nEast Raleigh is situated roughly from Capital Boulevard near the I-440 beltline to New Hope Road. Most of East Raleigh's development is along primary corridors such as U.S. 1 (Capital Boulevard), New Bern Avenue, Poole Road, Buffaloe Road, and New Hope Road. Neighborhoods in East Raleigh include Hedingham, Longview, Lockwood, Madonna Acres, New Hope, Thompson-Hunter and Wilder's Grove. The area is bordered to the east by the town of Knightdale.\n\n\n==== West Raleigh ====\n\nWest Raleigh lies along Hillsborough Street and Western Boulevard. The area is bordered to the west by suburban Cary. It is home to North Carolina State University, Meredith College, Pullen Park, Pullen Memorial Baptist Church, the Islamic Association of Raleigh, Cameron Village, Lake Johnson, the North Carolina Museum of Art and historic Saint Mary's School. Primary thoroughfares serving West Raleigh, in addition to Hillsborough Street, are Avent Ferry Road, Blue Ridge Road, and Western Boulevard. The PNC Arena is also located here adjacent to the North Carolina State Fairgrounds. These are located approximately 2 miles from Rex Hospital.\n\n\n==== North Raleigh ====\nNorth Raleigh is an expansive, diverse, and fast-growing suburban area of the city that is home to established neighborhoods to the south along with many newly built subdivisions and along its northern fringes. The area generally falls North of Millbrook Road. It is primarily suburban with large shopping areas. Primary neighborhoods and subdivisions in North Raleigh include Bartons Creek Bluffs, Bedford, Bent Tree, Black Horse Run, Brier Creek, Brookhaven, Coachman's Trail, Crossgate, Crosswinds, Dominion Park, Durant Trails, Ethan's Glenn, Falls River, Greystone Village, Harrington Grove, Hidden Valley, Lake Park, Long Lake, North Haven, North Ridge, Oakcroft, Shannon Woods, Six Forks Station, Springdale Estates, Stonebridge, Stone Creek, Stonehenge, Summerfield, Valley Estates, Wakefield, Weathersfield, Windsor Forest, and Wood Valley. The area is served by a number of primary transportation corridors including Glenwood Avenue U.S. Route 70, Interstate 540, Wake Forest Road, Millbrook Road, Lynn Road, Six Forks Road, Spring Forest Road, Creedmoor Road, Leesville Road, Norwood Road, Strickland Road, and North Hills Drive.\n\n\n==== South Raleigh ====\nSouth Raleigh is located along U.S. 401 south toward Fuquay-Varina and along US 70 into suburban Garner. This area is the least developed and least dense area of Raleigh (much of the area lies within the Swift Creek watershed district, where development regulations limit housing densities and construction). The area is bordered to the west by Cary, to the east by Garner, to the southwest by Holly Springs and the southeast by Fuquay-Varina. Neighborhoods in South Raleigh include Eagle Creek, Renaissance Park, Lake Wheeler, Swift Creek, Carolina Pines, Rhamkatte, Riverbrooke, and Enchanted Oaks.\n\n\n==== Southeast Raleigh ====\nSoutheast Raleigh is bounded by downtown on the west, Garner on the southwest, and rural Wake County to the southeast. The area includes areas along Rock Quarry Road, Poole Road, and New Bern Avenue. Primary neighborhoods include Chastain, Chavis Heights, Raleigh Country Club, Southgate, Kingwood Forest, Rochester Heights, Emerald Village and Biltmore Hills. Coastal Credit Union Music Park (formerly Time Warner Cable Music Pavilion, Alltel Pavilion and Walnut Creek Amphitheatre) is one of the region's major outdoor concert venues and is located on Rock Quarry Road. Shaw University is located in this part of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike much of the southeastern United States, Raleigh has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa). Winters are short and generally cool, with a normal January daily mean temperature of 41.0 \u00b0F (5.0 \u00b0C). On average, there are 69 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 2.7 days that fail to rise above freezing. Raleigh receives an average annual rainfall of 43.34 inches (110.1 cm). Annual and monthly (temperature and) precipitation data are in chart below. April is the driest month, with an average of 2.92 inches (74.2 mm) of precipitation. Precipitation is well distributed around the year, with a slight maximum between July and September; on average, July is the wettest month, owing to generally frequent, sometimes heavy, showers and thunderstorms. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of 80.0 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C). There are 48 days per year with highs at or above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C). Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall, but greater potential for extremely heavy rainfall in a one/two day period, owing to occasional threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) packing torrential rainfall. In September 1999, Raleigh recorded its wettest month ever, with over 21 inches of rain, due to torrential rainfall from tropical weather systems, most notably Hurricane Floyd on September 15\u201316. Extremes in temperature have ranged from \u22129 \u00b0F (\u221223 \u00b0C) on January 21, 1985 up to 105 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C), most recently on June 29\u201330 and July 8, 2012. Raleigh falls in USDA hardiness zones 7b (5 \u00b0F to 10 \u00b0F) and 8a (10 \u00b0F to 15 \u00b0F).Raleigh receives an average of 6.0 inches (15.2 cm) of snow in winter. Freezing rain and sleet also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging ice storm. On January 24\u201325, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm \u2013 20.3 inches (52 cm) \u2013 the Winter Storm of January 2000. Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of cold air damming that affects the city due to its proximity to the Appalachian Mountains.  Winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well.\nThe region also experiences occasional periods of drought, during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience hurricanes. In 1996, Hurricane Fran caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees. Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in September 1999 were primary contributors to that month's extreme rainfall of over 21 inches.

The airport offers service to more than 35 domestic and international destinations and serves approximately 10 million passengers a year. The airport also offers facilities for cargo and general aviation. The airport authority tripled the size of its Terminal 2 (formerly Terminal C) in January 2011.\nPrivate Airport.Private general aviation airports in Raleigh include Triple W Airport (ICAO: K5W5, FAA LID: 5W5).\n\n\n==== Freeways and primary designated routes ====\n\n\n===== Interstate Highways =====\nI-40 traverses the southern part of the city, connecting Raleigh to Durham and Chapel Hill toward the west, and coastal Wilmington, North Carolina to the southeast.\nI-440, Also known locally as the Raleigh Beltline, it makes a loop around the central part of the city. The I-440 route labeling formerly encompassed the entire loop around the city, co-numbered though South Raleigh with I-40. In 2002, the NCDOT removed the I-440 designation from the co-numbered I-40 (southern and southwestern) sections of the loop, and the directional signage on the remaining I-440 portion was changed from Inner/Outer to East/West. The route designation changes were made to avoid driver confusion over the Inner/Outer designations, especially with Raleigh's new \"Outer Beltline\", as I-540 has become known.\nI-540/NC 540 is currently under development.\nI-87, designated September 5, 2017, follows the former route of Interstate 495. It begins at the I-40/I-440 interchange southeast of Raleigh and runs east, meeting I-540 and terminating at Rolesville Road. It is entirely concurrent with US 64. When the route is completed it will link Raleigh to the Norfolk, Virginia area.\n\n\n====== Future ======\nInterstate 42 will begin at I-40 south of Raleigh and will follow US 70 to Morehead City.\n\n\n===== United States Highways =====\nU.S. Route 1 enters the city from the north along Capital Boulevard, joins I-440 around the west side of Raleigh, and leaves the city to the southwest as the US 1/US 64 expressway in Cary.\nU.S. Route 64 is the main east-west route through Raleigh; all segments share routes with another highway. East of the city, US-64/US-264 is known as the Knightdale Bypass. US 64 follows I-440 (as a wrong way concurrency) and I-40 along southern Raleigh, and US 1 to the southwest.  A former alignment, designated as Business US-64, follows New Bern Avenue from the I-440 Beltline to the eastern boundary of the city, where it continues into Knightdale.\nU.S. Route 70 runs roughly northwest-southeast through Raleigh. North of downtown, the route follows Glenwood Avenue into Durham. South of Raleigh, the route (along with US 401 and NC 50) follows South Saunders and South Wilmington Streets into Garner. Through downtown, US 70 uses small segments of several streets, including Wade Avenue, Capital Boulevard, Dawson, and McDowell Streets.\nU.S. Route 264 cosigned with US 64 through East Raleigh.\nU.S. Route 401 north of downtown Raleigh it follows Capital Boulevard and Louisburg Road. South of downtown it is cosigned with US 70 from Wade Avenue southward.\n\n\n===== North Carolina Highways =====\nN.C. Route 54 follows Chapel Hill Road and Hillsborough Street in West Raleigh. The route ends at its interchange with I-440.\nN.C. Route 50 is a north-south route through Raleigh. North of Raleigh it follows Creedmoor Road. NC 50 joins US 70 and later US 401 in downtown Raleigh. The three routes remain together through south Raleigh.\nN.C. Route 98, known as Durham Road in North Raleigh, traverses the extreme northern parts of the city.\n\n\n==== Intercity rail ====\n\nRaleigh's train station is one of Amtrak's busiest stops in the Southern U.S. The station is served by five passenger trains daily: the Silver Star, thrice-daily Piedmont service, and the Carolinian. Daily service is offered between Raleigh and:\n\nCharlotte, with intermediate stops including Cary, Durham, Burlington and Greensboro, North Carolina.\nNew York City, with intermediate stops including Richmond, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; and Philadelphia.\nMiami, with intermediate stops including Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia; as well as Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa, Florida.\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\nPublic transportation in and around Raleigh is provided by GoRaleigh, which operates 33 fixed bus routes, including the R-Line and the Wake-Forest Loop. Although there are 33 routes, some routes are designed to cover multiple other routes at times when they are not served. Depending on the time of the day, and the day of the week, the number of routes operating is between 5 and 29.\nRaleigh is also served by GoTriangle (known formerly as the Triangle Transit Authority, and Triangle Transit). GoTriangle offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Research Triangle Park and several of the region's larger suburban communities. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nNorth Carolina State University also maintains its own transit system, the Wolfline, that provides zero-fare bus service to the general public along multiple routes serving the university's campuses in southwest Raleigh.\nGovernment agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.\nFrom 1995 the cornerstone of Triangle Transit's long-term plan was a 28-mile rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections.\nThe region's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.Greyhound Lines provides an inter-city bus service to Durham, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and other cities.\n\n\n==== Bicycle and pedestrian ====\nThe Maine-to-Florida U.S. Bicycle Route#1 routes through suburban Raleigh, along with N.C. Bicycle Route #2, the \"Mountains To Sea\" route. As of September 2010, maps and signage for both US Bike Route #1 and NC Bike Route #2 are out-of-date for the Raleigh area. N.C. Bicycle Route #5 is routed nearby, connecting Apex to Wilmington and closely paralleling the NCBC Randonneurs 600 kilometer brevet route.\nMost public buses are equipped with bicycle racks, and some roads have dedicated bicycle-only lanes. Bicyclists and pedestrians also may use Raleigh's extensive greenway system, with paths and trails located throughout the city.\nIn May 2011, Raleigh was designated a Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists at the Bronze level.\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Raleigh 36th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.\nIn 2002, the \"Walk [Your City]\" initiative was started in the city which provides a tool kit for neighborhood organizations to post signs giving a distance by bike or foot, with directions in scannable QR code.

          "Lots of parking areas around this park. I\u2019ve been walking round there for years, last year was great because you could see eagles nesting. It\u2019s interesting, sometimes you can see turtles and a heron. Good if you like wildlife.",
          "This is a great place to walk your dog if you have one,,ride your bike, play with your children, or just enjoy nature. I find it peaceful in the early mornings.",
          "Similar to Lake Lynn in design. The thrill of eagles nests. Great walking or running trail. Another gem of a Greenway Trail.",
          "Near my parent's home - a gorgeous park to walk/bike/run around the lake. Well maintained. Many birds and ducks along the walk.",
          "Very nice place to walk around. And they have a nesting eagle! There is an art center which frequently has small local exhibits next to one of the parking lots.",
          "This park is located along one of the Greenway paths that weave in and around Raleigh with a free parking lot located off W. Millbrook Road. An 8' wide path circles the Lake for 2 miles and is used by runners, walkers, and bicyclists. Dogs must be leashed. People are generally",
          "I have walked in the Shelley Park around the lake; however I enjoy Lake Lynn more. I find the trail more cumbersome or overgrown and I did not feel as secure. I have friends and they seem to prefer Shelley Lake Park.",
          "Many walks and trips with my family. I have come here since my kids were little and am still going for walks on the weekend. It is worth the trip and a little bit of peace in the middle of Raleigh",
          "I was so embarrassed that Raleigh has let this park go downhill! I went to take a guest from out of town so they could fly a kite in the grass area and it was uncut and goose droppings were everywhere all over the paths the grass! Then my friend wanted to launch a toy boat in",
          "Visiting area for the afternoon and need to wait for a friend to come in at the airport. A pleasant 2 mile walk that was mostly shaded. A great diversion for the afternoon.",
          "I state good walking paths vs great due to massive sand damage from flooding of some variant. Fix the sand wash over and it'd be great here. Walk is only ~2 miles long full loop. Bathroom facilities available.",
          "My wife, two kids, and I had some time to kill before our flight and this was just the place to go. Beautiful, scenic, and very relaxing after a rough weekend traveling. Our fourteen month old loved swinging and playing on the playground and our fourteen year old enjoyed himself",
          "This park has a 2.5 mile paved loop trail with a couple spurs (most paved), as well as a playground for the kids. This is another birding hot spot.",
          "The best thing about the park is the greenway runs through it. You can ride your bike around the lake and take the greenway back the way you came or you can continue to head north.",
          "I have used this facility since 1982 when a significant part of the trail system was gravel. Now the trail system continues around the entire lake/pond. As a marathon runner (46 completed) I used this as my starting point for my long training runs. A runner or cyclist can",
          "Shelley Lake has always been one of my favorite spots. My grown-up kids have fond memories of it. The ducks and geese welcome you as you stand on one of the two wooden bridges. Birdwatchers will find a lot to look at. It is equipped with bathrooms and picnic tables. You will",
          "This lake park is a fantastic place and perfect distance for an afternoon walk. It is a very clean park and there are geese.",
          "The walk around the lake is 2.2 miles. It is mostly in the sun there is some shade along the path. A lot of people were out walking here.",
          "Playground for the kids, walking trail around the lake, wildlife to watch, quiet and great parking. Many dogs and strollers here. Peddle boats in the summer. Sometimes a yoga class is there. Owned by the City of Raleigh and well maintain. Connects to the Greenway if you",

          "This is a great neighborhood park with a nice walking path that I believe is around 1.5 miles long. In the summer there are paddle boats and you can fish from the docks. Great place for kids too as there is a large field at the east section. The park hooks up with other trails",
          "Having grown up in Raleigh, specifically North Hills, I have walked this park for years. Its a good 2 mile hike. There is both sun and shade. If you are biking, check out the links to the Crabtree Creek trail, and you can go a long way on off road pavement.",
          "I came here for a 70 degree day in February. The trail was maintained and was well lit. I saw people walking kids and biking. I would recommend this place.",
          "A smelly lake that connects various parts of the greenway system. Floods often when raining and could use some groundskeeping.",

          "We were looking for a place to throw a frisbee and football around for a bit and decided on Shelley Lake Park. Parking is a breeze and there is a trail that leads straight to a huge field that is perfect for throwing a frisbee. There is also a trail that goes around the lake",
          "I've spent many hours going around this park. Parking at Sertoma makes it easy to access the trail around the lake.",

          "Great Lake to walk around as the scenery changes and very popular with families and dog walkers. Go early morning in summer before it gets hot, great to walk in the afternoon on cooler days. Kids play area by car parking as well",
          "I've gone here many times! I love taking my dog or going for a jog there. It's peaceful and clean. Everyone I come across there are always friendly. There are a lot of dogs there so be aware if you get nervous around them. It's a great place for picnics and reading too. Even",
          "I have lived in Raleigh about a year-and-a-half now and consider Shelley Lake park one of my favorite parks here. Raleigh has a myriad of parks but what I like about Shelley park is all the things you can do there and the trail is just over two miles on one of the trails so it",
          "We have walked around Shelly Lake for 20 years...even when it was recovering from Hurricane Fran. A wonderful, relaxing, and well kept up area--families can take little children to feed ducks; young people can play soccer.",
          "Path circles the lake - 2 mile stretch. Great views and peaceful vibe. I believe there are public restrooms near the bridge on the path.",
          "Shelly Lake is a slice of heaven in Northwest Raleigh. The lake is pretty with a walking trail that meanders around it. There are ducks which people feed, a couple of wooden bridges, a water fountain, bathroom facilities. An Arts center (Sertoma) is on site, and they have a",
          "If you want to have a nice stroll in a general safe environment here it is. I would not walk or run early or be totally unaware but the weekends and this nice wide space in the middle of Raleigh is fine. It would be great if you had some real fish in the water and kids could",
          "Enjoyed the beautiful, cool and sunny weather walking the path around the lake. Peaceful park - no admission fee - nice place to park",
          "I had driven past this park for a few weeks and the lot was often full, so when my wife visited Raleigh with me, I thought it would be a nice place to go. The views around the lake were beautiful and the park is well maintained. It seemed like a good place whether you were",
          "This is a really nice walk around the lake. There's always families out walking and people fishing and playing soccer. There's lots for kids to do and it's pet friendly. There's a bit of an incline in places but overall it's not hard. There are two parking lots and access",
          "A pleasant park with a good, paved walkway around the lake. A couple of steep hills. There is one place to see water fowl, but not terrific for viewing wildlife. Usually lots of nice, friendly people there, so one feels safe.",
          "I live near this park. It's excellent for getting some exercise in during the week, going for a walk with friends, or to watch birds (there are lots of geese and ducks near the boardwalk). The trail itself is well maintained (it is paved), and there a lots of nice little views",
          "I love all the parks in Raleigh... this is a nice 2 mile trail that connects to the greenway. I always bring my dog and she likes it too. Parking in the main lot can be difficult on a nice day. It is partly shady/partly sunny so perfect.",
          "What makes Raleigh and Triangle so great? Places like this dotted throughout the city. This location is also part of Capital Greenway so you can get to it from all over town. I love the fact that it mixes exercise and leisure. One lap is 2.1. Miles, do 3 and you great exercise",
          "it is a nice place to walk or run. a lot of people bring their dog or kids. a few try to fly around on bikes. they have a dock for fishing.",
          "We live close by and can access the park via a greenway that skirts a creek. The walk around the lake is about two miles long, and you can make it longer by exiting the lake by various other greenways. The lake has been filling in a bit over the years but is still a favorite",
          "Raleigh never ceases to amaze me with its parks. This is just one of many throughout the city. There's more activity here on the weekends, which makes it a bit tight if you want to ride a bike. But for walking or running, there's always plenty of space.",
          "This is a popular trail and park with connections to the Raleigh Greenway system on both ends of the lake. The Shelley Lake trail is 2 miles long. There are ducks and geese along the trail which is all paved and fairly flat except for a couple of small hills. Bicyclists also",
          "it fun for humans and the dog/cat. Parking is tight. Though a good place to get exercise. And seems to be safe.",
          "If you want a lovely shaded place to walk with a paved trail, this is the place. Go at your own pace or jog at your heart's content. Ride your bike or walk your dog. About 2 miles and if you want to go longer, go around twice! LOVE it.",
          "I live about 4 miles from the park and walk it every other day with my little dog. More walkers than cyclists, and lots of dog walkers. Completely paved and well kept...not quite as well kept as the Capital Greenway. I've never, ever seen a paddleboat on this lake in four",
          "This has been my favorite park since I was a child. The trails are nice and they have paddleboats in the summer. They have a nice little side creek trail that I absolutely adore near the bridge. They also have a playground and play area. You can no longer feed the ducks.",
          "The park is a nice place to walk/run and relax. There are a few dog owners that walk their dogs off leashes and that is a downs side. I enjoy taking pics and this place provides good opportunities for my hobby",
          "I really like running around the lake, it is a pretty trail and always full of people. Not super \"in nature\" though which may be an appeal or a turn off for some people. Overall a good experience. Locals definitely should go, if a visitor I would recommend Umstead Park instead",
          "Came here midday for a run. Lots of people out using the trails. Very pleasant setting on a nice day.",
          "I try to get to Shelley at least once a week to walk/run with my dog. It's your typical park. Some of the signs are starting to look a little dated and there are geese everywhere. With geese comes goose poop everywhere. It's a great spot though and good for a short walk/run that",
          "Just took my dog around the lake this weekend. The path is filled with families, dogs and runners. The baby ducks are out and so much fun to watch.",
          "Shelley Lake is a great place to walk, run, or bike. Pets are allowed on a leash and you must clean up after them to keep the park clean for everyone to enjoy. There is a water fountain on the park path by the boardwalk/restrooms. Please obey the signs and do not feed the",
          "A leashed and large, female brindle boxer bit my son who was standing on the paved walking path and the owner provided false information (Tom and Lisa Wilson, false #, false vet info. for Zoey), which lead to my 6 yr old needing a series of shots for rabies. Adult owner lied",
          "There is little in the way of control to make sure some idiot doesn't let an aggressive dog run loose or some bicycle rider doesn't go so fast so as to endanger walkers. Not a safe place for family fun.",
          "I was underwhelmed by the lack of maintenance here. Goose poop was everywhere. We have been when it wasnt too bad, but this trip we actually loaded the kids back up and went to the gym!",
          "Shelly Lake has a great variety of greenway paths to walk/run/cycle. The walk just around the lake is about 2 miles, but there are many spur trails so you can make it as long as you want. The paths are wide enought to have bikers pass and are in good condition. It can get",
          "How perfect for a walk and to enjoy the Spring/Fall weather... Everyone was so nice and we met and chatted with several folks. We are older and the three other ladies spoke very little English, but we had a wonderful morning with coffee/donuts and a walk. I was very proud to",
          "nice wooded area to walk and several paths, you can still feed the ducks here. None of the small lakes are good for fishing though.",
          "Shelley Lake is one of my favorite running or walking destinations. It's got a nice little loop with some options for making your route longer or shorter. The picnic areas seem nice and well-kept. Bathrooms are as clean as you can expect for an outdoor destination.",
          "good for a relaxing walk or bike. People come here to walk dogs or push the stroller. Not the most scenic lake by any means. go to lake Johnson in S. Raleigh for that",
          "Pleasant walking path, paddle boats, no motorized vehicles or boats along or on a small scenic lake in the middle of North Raleigh NC.",
          "We go to Shelley Lake all the time. It's a nice place - there's a good trail for walking and places to fish. There's also a bridge from which you can feed the ducks. Gets crowded on weekends!",
          "i liked the walking trails. not much of a park though. great place to sit and relax. Have a picnic or fly a kite.",
          "Though I live Crabtree trail but Shelly Lake is very peaceful and beautiful place for jogging and walk. Those of you who want to take a bus CAT BUS Route 23C drops you at the entrance. I love the lake for its serenity . You can also opt for fishing if you like. Needless to say",
          "Tranquil and beautiful trail around lake. There is a playground for kids and a classes of all types are offered in the building on site.",
          "Love walking this park. It is so much to see and motivates you to keep on walking towards better health.",
          "Used to live near here and we walked ALL the time. Great trails and views.",
          "Raleigh has a lot of these nice \"ponds\" that are surrounded by trees and a walking path. The ponds are simply to catch run off from the surrounding neighborhoods and not swim-able. Nice for a bike ride, a walk or to walk the dog. They are all exactly 2 miles around. Just",
          "Do you like jogging? Then this is a pretty good place to go!",
          "Love to walk the trails at Shelley Lake on a beautiful day. Great place to bring your children and pets also.",
          "The two mile walk around Shelley lake is a great walk at any time of the year. We enjoy it regularly.",
          "I used to love coming here for walks and sometimes still take the dog there. The lake is very nice and they have activities there for the kids",
          "We were in town and family took us to Shelley Lake Park. It's a very nice park that entertained our 3 young boys. As parks go this one was above average...nice lake, great pier around part of the lake, wonderful playground equipment."

          "Fun place! Took my 15 year old here for his birthday party. Even played laser tag with all of them. Go karts, video games, food... This place is full of fun! The beer made it especially nice to relax while the kids ran around and played.",
          "I was in North Carolina on a business trip. On my off day I got to visit this fun park. It was awesome. So many attractions. It felt like a mini theme park. I will definitely be visiting again next time I\u2019m in the area.",

I loved watching my grandson beat this older guy who thought he was going to race by him because he was younger, lol.\nI'd give it 5 stars if the concession stand had a better food selection.",

          "Had an excellent experience at Frankie's it was me and my family first visit and it was absolutely great so many options of games , laser tag , if I'm not mistaking it was 2 or 3 different go kart courses. We had a blast ! Thanks Frankie's",
          "Was not impressed myself with the selection,  but the kids still loved it. Out of the way, and a good place to let the children have some fun. Naturally it cost a bit to partake, and the prizes are just cheap. Kids will probably want to go again.",
          "Okay so this was out first time going and I honestly wasn\u2019t impressed. The staff are not customer friendly (or haven\u2019t been trained properly) and the crowd was younger with little manners. We prefer Dave & Busters and don\u2019t foresee us \u2026",

          "Looking to spend some time having a blast!? Frankies is awesome. Indoor and outdoor fun for all ages keeps everyone entertained for hours. If you need a great spot for a date, family outing, work party, or just to blow some steam off while having fun... this is your spot!",

          "In the area where we live there is nothing like Frankie's. We live in our local bubble most of the time and rarely go to that side of town. We've definitely missed something. Frankie's arcade area is impressive! Variety is the word. Outside \u2026",
          "Frankie's Fun Park was amazing! It was like Dave and Buster's but much better. I went with family ranging in ages between 15 to 32. We did laser tag, virtual shooting, go carts, and an air obstacle course. They had other things to do as \u2026",
          "Come to Frankie\u2019s for a fun time but be ready to spend some money",

Then after spending 50 bucks in the arcade realized the prize section was also closed, so we were all very frustrated in the end.",
          "absolutely love taking my family and wife there. wish they had better deals",
          "Management and 2/3 of staff needs to be FIRED! It feels like it\u2019s kids in managing this place! Younger staff is extremely rude and tend to forget that they're working in a kid play area. We waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged by a team \u2026",
          "My brother came to have a playdate and I needed somewhere to sit and get some work done! I was able to go into the restaurant and work for almost three hours, and I was so pleased! The girl at the counter was so friendly, and the coffee was \u2026",
          "The food here is worse than public school lunch food. The games are cool but there hasn't been anything innovating in a long time. It's just popular because it's the best that we have around. More than likely it will suffer the same fate as adventure landing.",

          "Laser tag was closed and a lot of renovations were happening, but go karts were fun",
          "Amazing place for fun activities with your friends and family. Here one can find 3 types of outdoor go-karting tracks... For kids and adults. Also a pendulum ride and some indoor activities. Laser tag was really good, even better if you're a group of friends. Also there's a cafe. It's an affordable amusement park.",
          "Most of the food is disappointing lately. Looks like the oil needs to be changed in their fryers. Wings are always AWESOME! Highly recommend those!",
          "The staff were very friendly and helpful through out our visit!",
          "This place is great for older kids/adults! Our little ones found it difficult to play most of the games and prices are a little high.",
          "Awesome place to go late night as an adult. A little price for what you get but good fun with friends. Just have to go late enough that all the little kids and parents have left.",
          "Enjoyed the laser tag, min I golf, and 3D ride. Be aware that not all guns work on the 3D ride. Side note...I get that it's not fun for the young staff to deal with a ton of kids and parents, but management should work on customer service \u2026",
          "Frankie\u2019s was a lot of fun! We went on a hot day to cool down and play some arcade games and had a blast. My daughter even won a plushie from the claw machine and got enough tickets to get a little trinket. She was happy! We got out under $40 so I was happy! All in all a pretty good time!",
          "OH MY!!! I had no clue this place existed !! What a fun night with my family. We rode bumper boats and go carts. It was amazing and the children loved it.",
          "We went tonight for the first time and it was a great night. We were celebrating our 13 year old's birthday with friends. One of the boys lost his token card in the air hockey slot and this super nice young man named Matt helped us. He had \u2026",
          "Though we have been to many Frankie Fun Parks this one is by far the smallest. Had to ask staff to wipe down tables in order to sit and eat our meals that again were missing something. We as paying customers should not have to clean nor \u2026",
          "I really like this place as it makes me feel like a child. I like doing the outdoor road course, golf carts, and enjoy the arcade games. It can get extremely busy during the weekends but weekdays are not as bad. The service is quite well and efficient on most days. I like they also have a bar area that can be a nice place to relax.",
          "The place seemed well run. Almost everything we played worked perfect except for buck hunter, player one was broken. The mini golf was in good shape. The prizes are pretty slim choices, because they only use half of the prize counter and \u2026",
          "We Won!! My Son won a one hundred ticket roll twice, and I won a humongous pink pig and a cell phone case. There was construction going on... so, the table space for our birthday party was limited. But fun times as usual, our kids had a ball!",
          "The atmosphere is great for the entire family.  Great customer service displayed by the staff.",
          "All the activities are very very good. Gave just a 4 star because of the cost to do each activities. It's a bit expensive to spend a few hours at this location",
          "Fun place for the kids to run your pockets parents lol be aware! It\u2019s a great place for any kids party & I really think it\u2019s an upgraded version of the Celebration Station no shade lol but it was a cool laid back fun spot for the kiddos. I would definitely revisit!",
          "A great place for 8 and up, and a good place for 5 and up. Check their website before you go to see based on height what rides you can go on. This makes a good birthday party place, and the kids love all the stuff here. The climbing \u2026",
          "I ordered spaghetti and meatballs; there was standing water in the bowl, the cheesy garlic bread left much to be desired! If you are expecting restaurant quality fare, go elsewhere; in addition, service was slow and the establishment isn\u2019t even busy. This was my first and last time eating here.",
          "Fun for the whole family. \n\n4 stars because: I don't like going when they are training the staff it's hard to get help.",
          "It was cool. Staff was nice. A bit on the pricey side",
          "My most recent to Frankie\u2019s was disappointing. About a third of the property is closed or under construction... The staff is mostly teenaged and thus have NO customer service skills. I was astonished to find a cashier in the cafe on her \u2026",
          "Good place for fun. Games, golf and much more for all age groups",
          "For my first visit it was good tried the Lazer tag which was pretty exciting ... I would definitely visit again",
          "Big place and lots of things to do. The VR stuff is a good time.",
          "Good place to spend some time, but it can be cut short because it gets expensive really fast",
          "Took my team from work and we had a blast.  For a few of them it was the first time they had ever driven go carts or played laser tag. We had lots of laughs.",
          "Great place, my 8 year old loves it here!",
          "Excellent service, very good food and very secure park to bring your children to have a nice fun day!",
          "Kids was driving me crazy until I realized they have a whole restaurant with a full bar. Lol",
          "My nieces and nephews love it when I take them here.  I wish Frankie's was around when I was a kid!\n\nLots of fun and not overly expensive for what they have to offer.  Great place to take the whole family!",
          "Great fun for the family. A step up from Dave and Busters. Fun for kids and adults though the place becomes quickly expensive. Expect to spend at least 100$ for a family of 3 to all have some enjoyment. Highly recommend.",
          "Great place to have fun and kill time. Golf and racing car was too much fun. The arcade has variety of games and all are worth giving a try. The place is very neat and clean as well. I must very very well maintained. I had great time \u2026",
          "This used to be one of our favorite places to go with our kids ages 4 thru 10. My ten year olds wanted to go there today for their birthday. We went and we noticed that they took down the fun house portion where kids could play. \n\nNot to \u2026",
          "Lots of fun. They have laser tag, arcade games, cafe, a couple rides, go carts, bumper boats, mini golf and barring cages. Perfect for the kiddos. Expect to spend $50-65 per person for a variety of activities and a snack",
          "We had a lot of fun as a family. Clean and nice workers. Be prepared to have at least $100 to have fun.",
          "Machines Broke.  Had to find attendants for help.  Cashiers didn't want to explain how to redeem tokens (said to read the machine). Horrible prizes for the money spent.   Horrible experience for a BIRTHDAY.",
          "The place is very good for kids . I just wish the food service was a little better.  Took way to long to receive our drinks . Then one of the drinks was left on the counter.  The food we order came out 45 minutes later . I had to ask twice how long would the food be . Other then that when it did come the food was really good \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00",
          "We have been looking for a place to take the kids since moving down from NY Frankie\u2019s is great. The arcade has a great mix of ticket challenge games and traditional arcade cabinets. They also have some higher end VR and 4D games. The mini \u2026",
          "I love this place I have came here for a while and I love it. So domsquad when u come thur tell them nick sent u. U won't regret it.",
          "Its a great place to take a girl out to play and have fun or take your family or kids to have fun win some prizes for a good amound of tickets.",
          "Super fun. Lots of games and attractions and pricing isn't bad either. Pay as you play",
          "Slick track is the slickest I've ever been to. Mini golf is fun and decent challenge. Fun place.",
          "Good place for a work outing or kid's birthday party.  Mini golf is actually not bad, and the slick track is really fun.",
          "very great place overall but price is big. There karting is cool,there arcade,jungle gym,and everything else is awesome too!  If you gave it a 1-3 star i could understand but ill also be surprised. This place is expensive but worth it",
          "It was a very nice experience, really fun and the staff it's very friendly, I had a wonderful time playing and eating here!",
          "Family fun! We had a lot of fun, played some new games!",
          "This place is really awesome! So many, many fun things to do! Great for all ages! Looking for a fun day with family and friends? This is your spot! Don't hesitate :)",
          "There is much to do for small and large gr1oups. Putt putt and gasoline powered go-carts on several progressively difficult tracks are featured draws. Almost every activity has a cost but that also makes it easy to plan the outing. There are multiple outdoor activities and rides as well as a large indoor space.",
          "Frankie's fun park...more like Frankie's awesome park. Games are a little pricey but eh worth it.",
          "Fun place. Grandson had a blast and so did the grandparents.",

          "Fun family place. The go-cart is a must",

          "Wanna try Tokyo drift from 2F2F, this is the place to go!!! Had fun on race tracks, 3D game, laser tags and much more",
          "This place is fun and has a lot of variety to offer. The crowd was a little much to handle. We visited from out of town and may be back. Our only complaint was the prices. Sometimes, arcade games were upwards of $2 and $3. I would say you need about $100 to visit this place to really do anything longer than 20 minutes.",
          "I had soo much fun. The food was terrific. Bar was excellent and I loved the rides.",
          "Kids love it, but money leaves your wallet quickly here. Overall a great way to spend a few hours if you're looking to get out of the weather.",
          "Absolutely a great place for kids AND adults! We spent hours there! Prices are great & they have a full bar attached to a eatery! Definitely will be back!",
          "Family fun! Why did I not know about this fun zone?!?!? My family and I had a great time! Lots of things to do & play for all ages! Did I mention that my young adults 19 & 17 enjoyed themselves \ud83c\udfa4",
          "From what I seen and experience so far is that this amusement park is very nice and well keep. The people who work there are beautiful and well mannered. I would recommend this park to anyone who have young children. It's a nice place to go for anyone of all ages. This park has something for everyone.",
          "A great place for the whole family, a couple or just for friends hanging out! Great fun from laser tag, go cart racing, bumper boats to mini golfing and much more! Plan for a day trip and go have some fun! Plenty of fun for kids and adults! Food at reasonable prices and a fully stocked bar.",
          "We had a great day here. Played a round of mini golf. Grabbed some icees then we walked around. My grandson rode the \ngo carts and bumper boats and had a blast.\nWe will be back.",
          "Something for everyone, from kids to geezers. Indoor and outdoor games and rides. Decent food menu and alcohilic drinks.",
          "Customer service was horrible!! This was our first time going to Frankie\u2019s and not one staff member greeted us. We go in line to pay for put putting and nobody spoke to us just each other. Same for getting the balls and putts. When my \u2026",
          "The family played golf and spent about an hour in the arcade. It's a nice mixture of kids and adult games. About 5 games were out of order, but otherwise no other issues.",
          "Nice fun place really for kids and families. Go karts were a blast",
          "Great place to celebrate your birthday because there's fun for all ages. Nice environment, had a great time!",
          "Weekend getaway to Raleigh. We enjoyed the go karts! Great selection of games inside. Easy process to load cards for my girls. Hubby and I were at the bar. Nice set up for everyone! No complaints.",
          "Lots of fun stuff to do here. Every one is nice, but not super informative. It was my friend's first time, and it has been about 6 years since my last visit. The customer service was friendly, but lacked details. After taking our card the \u2026",
          "Had a great time staff was amazing..  only reason I rated a 4 star is because it's ALOT of money. And the ropes course needs to be replaced and upgraded.",
          "The mini golf is super fun. The course is well made and clean. Its 9$ per person which is extremely cheap for a fun filled afternoon. They also have batting cages my husband tried it and found it good too. The batting cage are 2$ per round.",
          "The games, food and drinks are great but I think there should be definitely some training on the customer service there. If you have any questions they are very short, and you get ignored a lot. I understand that there are teens working there but I\u2019d say the my need customer service training like chick-fila.",
          "I've been going to this place since the early-mid 2000's with my now wife. We took our kids there last weekend and they loved it. Excellent place to bring kids.",
          "There was a lot to do here and the diversity of activities was convenient to have. However, there are a lot of gimmicks to take your money in the arcade area and the putt putt golf course was really boring and homogeneous. Check out the \u2026",
          "Always a bang for your buck never disappoints",
          "Such a cool place for family fun!! Go karts, indoor jungle gym and arcade, bumper boats, virtual reality games, a few carnival style rides, mini golf course, concession food plus a restaurant lounge with full bar. They had something for \u2026",
          "One of my favorite stores to shop at. Everyone here is very friendly & provide excellent customer service. I can get what I need for a great price.",
          "My son loved his racer car experience. Although my son is 3yrs old, they provide to steering wheels which made him think he was actually thr driver. Great family place. Some of the games were out of order but overall fun time.",
          "Their internal card reader system kept failing so you had to wait in line longer for everything. The people behind the counters were less than helpful. The slick track was not even staffed.",
          "Great location to take kids for any event",
          "Prices keep going up and the service keeps getting worse. After waiting about 5 minutes, literally had to wave my hands to get the attention of the FOUR employees chit chatting behind the counter. When one finally asked what we needed, we got serious attitude. So disappointing as Frankie's has always been a favorite date night spot.",
          "Something for everyone. A little pricey but it was worth it overall. Would have preferred better prizes in the arcade like Dave&Busters but that's a personal thing I guess. Great for kids. Also they have like 15 slushie flavors which was random and really cool---try the watermelon flavor it was awesome!",
          "typical arcade and fun center however had three awesome go-kart tracks and a large half putt golf course that was super cool lots of laughs on go-karts made the cost very worthwhile about $140 for four people three children one adult road the go-karts 3 x laser tag one time each and played arcade games",
          "A great local entertainment venue. Lots of activities for kids, whether they be small to large. Note that food took a long time to come to us at the counter service location.  Other than that the prices are relatively low.  Overall, I want to (and plan to) come back soon!  I would highly recommend it!",
          "A very family friendly and fun arcade and small theme park. We have visited multiple times but not ventured to the theme park yet, however there are always queues of families to get out there so I assume it must be as entertaining as the \u2026",
          "Expensive food and its mostly serve yourself. One soda was out of ice and the other out of almost all soda....and it was crazy busy. Condiments were out. Ppl talking orders were slow. Tables weren't cleaned off. \nThe games of course are fine, kids had fun. \nWe likely won't eat there again tho.",
          "Fun is in the name. The kids always love it.  So much to keep everyone entertained.",
          "This place is so amazing! There is go-kart racing, Golf, and a great arcade! I definitely reccomend you to go here!",
          "Initially thought it was a great place until 2 min after my daughter left her phone in the restroom it was STOLEN! The staff came across unbothered and not concerned at all. One young lady didn't even check behind the desk or assist my \u2026",
          "Pretty cool place. Lots of outdoor stuff to do fit kids and adults. Batting cages are horrible though and don't work.",
          "Great place for family & friends! Lots of games to play from carnival like to adventure rides! Besides just in door games there's plenty of outdoor games like batting cages, go-carts, boats & miniature golf. There's also a good variety of \u2026",
          "This place used to be ok but we went today and found out they tore down our kids favorite attraction.   The big 3 story Jungle Gym.  I guess they figured kids were spending too much time in there and not enuf on their arcades. And we all \u2026",
          "The staff was not friendly at all. You pay to do something and they don't even tell you which way to go. They just walk off. The putt putt and fun house were both fun and that's about all. The food was expensive and burnt. Not worth the money.",
          "Best places to have Family fun night!",
          "Kids love it here, so much for them to do all day.",
          "I always enjoy Frankie's even though I'm a grown up :) my son gets to have fun as well as adults. He loves laser tag and putt putt and I quite enjoy the arcade games. Drop zone was a blast! Only issue I has was waiting to redeem our \u2026",
          "The pros: lots (and lots. And even more) of game options- from giant spinning wheels to basketball and bowling. The games my kiddos played have a decent amount of tickets (in the 30-75 range). If you don\u2019t like the arcade, there is still a \u2026",
          "This place was awful...some of the attractions were not working, the employees were ALL young teenagers and most of them that we came in contact with had bad attitudes, I saw no supervision over the employees nor over the outside \u2026",
          "Although this place is extremely popular in the Triangle area, this was my first time going. I played through two courses on the putt putt courses. It had been a long time since I've played putt putt and it showed. The course was fun with plenty of hole in one opportunities. With a few courses it never felt too busy.",
          "Very Good Place to have fun with kids",
          "Go karts was so fun",
          "It was awesome. Great place to go on a date or take the family. If a game does not work call an attendant for assistance.",

          "I've been going to the Frankie's in Charleston since I was a kid. After I moved to Columbia, I've grown to like this one. Compared to the Frankie's in Charleston, this one is bigger so they have more selection with the video games and have \u2026",
          "Need to be bigger and more park in space",
          "Drove 10 miles on Saturday morning with my child to have some fun. These folks didn\u2019t even bother updating their google information to say they were closed for a private corporate party. They didn\u2019t put any signs out or anything. We were \u2026",
          "This place used to be something I would love. Unfortunately they got rid of one of my faviorte things to do (the spider web) and also they always close down the wind glider. \nThe food on the other hand is expensive but it was very good! \u2026",

          "Real fun place for the whole family",
          "Nice enough place, but really overpriced. $8 per person on the go karts, etc. Games are all $1-$4. $32 for four people to ride go karts for 3 minutes?? Not a bad place to spend some time if it wasn't so expensive.",
          "The best of the frankies I've been to.  Been to all of them just about and this location is the better one by far.  Haven't been to the newest one in Charlotte yet but i have a feeling this one is still the better one.",
          "Nice fun place. Lots of nice attractions. In serious need of a bigger location, they've pretty much maxed out the limited space they have. Inadequate parking, good luck finding a free spot.",
          "I love go karts!!! And the rope course was awesome too! This is a great place to go for adults and kids. Be prepared to spend a small fortune.",
          "Lots to do. It\u2019s like a huge Dave & busters/chuck e cheese for all ages. But way better and cheaper prices. The go kart racing was fun and wasn\u2019t short. Food was cheap. Only thing is there was a ton of people. Some lines were long but to be expected. I will definitely visit the charlotte location next.",
          "Very fun place for kids and adults alike but wish they would come up with some sort of deals like Galaxy fun park and Adventure Landing because we go those places often but since Frankie's is so expensive it's gonna be more like an annual \u2026",
          "I liked the place and it was really fun, but there were some down sides. Some rides outside were either too packed or were temporarily shut down so I didn't get to ride that much. Inside it was nice but it was very crowded. Also some of the \u2026",

          "Money trap! Go during the week if you don't want a crowd. On the weekend people come out of the woodwork to partake and the abundance of activities. Benefit of going during the wekend is you could easily play multiple rounds of minigolf and nobody would know any better.",

They have indoor jungle gym for the younger kids, video games arcade for the older ones and adults+ basketball games, inside restaurant, miniature golf....etc, just too many attractions. Check it out for yourself.",
          "Its like a kids casino, i enjoyed the place...... but you better carry some bucks with you though.",
          "Had fun but a lot of machines didn't work and a few employees had major attitudes when asked a question about how things worked. Our First time there so wasn't sure what we needed to do. Didn't deserve attitude.",
          "Was ok alot of construction wish we would have known that",

          "This amusement park had terrible service and absolutely rude.  We had bought tickets and were going to go karts when it started to rain.  They decide to close the slick track and said the road track is open still.  We went over to the road \u2026",
          "The kids can go play and I can have a drink. Can't go wrong with that.",
          "Nice arcade 4 all ages",
          "I would give these folks a better review if they could understand the value of disinfection... my goodness... hundreds of filthy kids touching everything and no purell stations. When the great plague kicks off... frankies... ground zero",
          "There are so many attractions.  My daughter and her friends had a blast!",
          "I enjoyed the go karts very much. We also got to enjoy alcohol beverages at the bar. This fun park Can be on the costly side but you can definitely make it work",
          "Very beautiful place to come with your family and have a great time with the kids",
          "Let me start by saying we had tons of fun with my granddaughter. Would have given 5 stars if the staff would have controlled the teenagers a bit more. I just don't think a public place is where we should be making out and getting to 3rd \u2026",
          "Great selection of things to do and the go karts are really cool.",
          "Had a blast with my sons. Will go back for laser tag. Fun for all ages... Didn't eat there but food smelled good.",

          "The prices of the acarade games are over priced.Some $2.00 and some were $3.00 spent $40.00 on games and \nwon small prizes. Staff looked clueless! Not going back again my first visit was a disaster",
          "We all had a great time! Staff was friendly. We ate at the food court. Food was okay. Stayed there close to 5 hours! Even all of us adults had a fun time.",
          "Great place  for either date nite OR to take the kids and have fun. Food isnt the best but reasonable. Lots of fun",
          "Great place for families with kids. Went there with my boyfriend and still had so much fun.",
          "Great fun even in the rain!",
          "A little busy but a lot of fun. The Chill Lounge even made for a nice oasis, away from the kids and the noise. I only wish there had been some sort of shop to get a t-shirt.",
          "Went to ride go carts for my kids birthday and after being asked to get off and wait because their cart wouldn't run.. twice btw.. they refused to refund the three tickets.. what a waste of time and money we will not be back and I would recommend avoiding this poorly run joke of a  business",
          "Mostly friendly and competent staff, clean, all arcade games were working. The pizza is surprisingly solid. Can't wait to go back and try the golf and go karts when it's not raining!",

          "Super fun I loved the indoor ride it was so fun and the view of the arcade just so beautiful.",
          "Went there for my grandchild\u2019s birthday,the place was great. The food was affordable, and the bathrooms were clean, we enjoyed ourselves.",
          "You would think with all the reviews talking about the rude service that it would have been addressed by now. This was our second visit to the park. Our first experience almost everyone we came into contact with was very unwelcoming and \u2026",

          "Had a great time and the servers at the bar were awesome.",

          "Frankie's is a super fun place go an enjoy I do Everytime",
          "8 year old grandson had a blast! Buy a card for any amount. It works on all the attractions and video games. Helps stay in budget. Great staff, friendly and helpful",
          "Place had a lot to offer, but you blow through money. I was disappointed to see a dollar charge for some games that only gave you one try. My kids died instantly and 2 bucks done in 5 seconds. We did not go to the outside amusements, so I can only comment on the arcade.",
          "Awesome place to go with friends, family or as part of a date. Plenty of room to enjoy yourself and the company of whom you're with. I've never eaten here so I cant speak to the quality of the food.",
          "Fun place but way too crowded and the parking isn't equipped to handle it. The games are fun. Go karting is not as fun for adults due to the low speed of the karts.  Mini golf course and laser tag stands out from the rest.",
          "Had a great time. Great for families and people of all ages. Was way more than I expected and my son had a great 12th birthday.",
          "Always fun and entertaining,  had the best Bartender ever",
          "Great place to distract the kids for a while. It can get a little expensive. Go-Karts are safe. But the games need more variety. Most of the prizes costing 100+ tickets are flimsy toys. Getting 100 tickets requires a lot of tokens and that \u2026",
          "Kids loved it adult friendly",
          "It's very fun and has a lot of different activities for you to do",

          "Very nice place with kids.",
          "At the time of writing this I am 32 years old. A (34 year old) friend insisted on coming here... I can see the appeal for younger kids, they all seemed to be having a blast. There is a full service bar area fully stocked, which is pretty \u2026",
          "So much fun! Its not just for kids its for adults too!! I suggest going with a group bring cash and have fun! With credits on your frankies card you can get prizes too!",
          "Rip off big time. Not even in International Drive Florida (which is super expensive) is as expensive as this place. Is ridiculous. Everything is new, clean and it looks awesome but I think this place is for super rich people because Franky \u2026",
          "Fun, but way over priced for games",

          "Fun for the whole family! Preferably if you have children that are at least 5+ to be able to really enjoy!",
          "Great place to take your family and have fun",
          "Great place to take the kids for a little something different. Up to date games for the kids and they constantly add on. Lots of games and food is good. *The drinks are overpriced and flooded with ice. Bartenders had very nasty attitudes.",
          "Nice place, good food. Had lots of fun with my little one. Games... rides... Expensive. We were there 2.5hrs. Blew 300 bucks. My daughter had fun and that was really the point. Can't visit this place often for that reason though.",
          "Will not be back. Frankie's use to be a decent place games started at a $1.00 now everything has jumped to 1.50 seems greedy a lot of these games are short 1-3 mins . Places like BoxCar offer more games and some start at 0.25 and up. \nI \u2026",
          "Good fun place .mi children Love",
          "great place for kids and family..lots of games, and rides...very reasonable rates.  the food at their eatery was also very good",

          "The rides was and activities for the children are great. The customer service is very poor. Customer service gives more of an attitude like your bothering them. Other than that my kids had a wonderful time.",
          "Awesome place. Lots of options. Love the laser tag",
          "I traveled home to NC for a family reunion and afterwards 13 of us from age 6 to 42 came to frankie to enjoy the remaing of rhe night. We then decided to ride the slick track go carts. After waiting 4 rounds we had our first incidnet when \u2026",
          "Nice place to take the kids. Kids ages 7-17 would really enjoy it. The day we went it got rained out. So they had to cancel outside activities. The go karts were fun. Things are kind of high priced. But overall everything was ok.",
          "This place is an absolute blast! From the go-karts to the VR games! Me and my buddy are coming again, no doubt!",

          "Great time! Atmosphere Awesome great food",
          "Fun, loud, crazy. You can do just about anything here. Mini golf, small rides, go karts, arcade games, duck pin bowling, laser tag, vr games. Food, coffee, beer. Just make sure that you bring plenty of money.",
          "I had a wonderful time and at a very reasonable price my kids had a ball and the food was delicious i will definitely be back once i relocate to the area",
          "It's a really fun place to take your family. We actually just left. However the people at the counter that cash in your tickets are the rudest people I've ever dealt with in my life. The African american young lady with the long hair and \u2026",
          "Clean and friendly service. The food is actually really good as well.",
          "Nice friendly staff, they were very helpful but I guess the cleaning staff took the day off because it was pretty bad in the dining area but I don't know if that's just the usual thing with all the kids being there it's kind of hard to keep it clean.",
          "Great place to have fun",
          "Frankie's is a nice place to spend the day, with frds n family,I do feel as they could lower the amount to play some of there GM's, and also have more  than 3 rides on the outside for adults to enjoy as well,n larger go karts,also it would \u2026",
          "Fun place had a good time",
          "Spend one day with family. We enjoyed a lot. We all were adult, but it was really awesome experience.  This place is for all ages. Thank you Frankie's.",
          "We had an amazing time, but is just you need a lot of tickets for everything, but I highly recommend",
          "Cheap prices and fun to go to. Only issue is that most outdoor rides were closed",
          "Fantastic fun! And I didn't even get to do most attractions, lol. 18 holes, laser tag and a few arcade games with the family and I'm gravy. \n\nFour stars because service could be better, and inside dining area needs attention. \n\nAlso, drove \u2026",

          "Go karts are great, drinks and food are expensive, its ment for children, but the game was on at the bar atleast. I went on a company outing, not a first choice for a company outing in my opinion.",
          "Had alot of fun and this was better than the Frankie's in Greenville,SC.",
          "Fun place.  Rides are expensive considering the length of time one is on a ride. But otherwise a fun spot to take kids too.",
          "What an eventful day we all had a blast.",
          "Awesome time ,good prices, some machines were unavailable but overall it was a great for fun. Good for kids and adults. Some staff could use a smile.",

          "We had a blast on a Friday evening and was amazed at just how many things we could do. From bumper cars to arcade machines, our large group left with a sense of satisfaction at the end of the evening. Quality fun at wonderful prices. Thanks for a  great night!",
          "Arcade was decent but management really needs to implement a no cell phone policy on their employees.  You have to \"bother\" employees to get them to even acknowledge that you are standing in front of them waiting for service.",
          "I love Frankie's Fun Park. There's always a lot to do for anyone and the games and services are well maintained.",
          "I was very pleased with my experience. I have been looking for a nice mini golf place to take the kids and I finally found it! The restaurant has a variety of menu items and is reasonably priced.  The kids playhouse was the best. $8 and they have unlimited playtime.",
          "Great place for kids and adults",
          "My kids and I went here for my sons birthday, and he loved it. My daughter and I did too. They have rides and games for everyone. They also have a good selection of prizes too. I highly recommend going here. You'll have as much fun as your kids.",
          "Expensive but cool when I say expensive I had 3 goes at go cart laser tag once and a few games spent about 120 usd",
          "On a weekend or rainy day this place is super packed and the lines are really long. It's a great place for a family outing or a date night. The staff is very young and unprofessional though.",

The only thing I didn't like were the long lines for the go carts, but I guess not much you can do about that. If you don't like lines don't go on a Friday night.",

The cafeteria is pretty decent, they have pizza in the menu they have Cuban sandwiches and a hummus dish, they have slushies. Cons: its a zest pool of germs \ud83d\ude02.

          "Had some time before a later flight home so I stopped here to check it out. Big place. Spent most of my time playing in the arcade. Good variety of games, a little pricey for some but I enjoyed the variety. Also it was great to see so many light gun games. Would totally go back",

          "My son wanted to celebrate his 8th birthday at Frankies with a friend. They had the best time. We went directly after school so not many people there. No long lines! All staff members provided great customer service. Huge THANKS to Noah Drew who operated both the Go Carts &",
          "My three teens and their younger cousins had a blast here! They drove race cars, played games, climbed to the top of the world, crashed bumper boats, and had tons of fun. I would recommend it to a family who wanted to get out and do something fun!",
          "This is a great place to go when the kids are driving you crazy but be mindful that you can quickly spend a week's worth of groceries. Rides, go carts, mini golf, huge arcade. Pretty well kept, mostly run by students.",
          "Spent a few hours as a family at Frankie's Fun Park. We live very close so it was convenient. Extremely crowded and a bit on the pricey side.",
          "Super activity park. Great rides, gaming machines, crazy golf etc. Just the thing for kids of all ages (8 to 70 !).",
          "Large amusement center with games inside, a restaurant, batting cages, miniature golf, go karts and rides outside. My 10 year old was able to drive go kart by himself and ride lasted around 5 minutes. It's very expense here we spent around $100 ($70 for rides and games and $30",
          "Been here multiple times over the years. Had an excellent nine year old birthday party. It is on the expensive side but extremely fun. Love the laser tag. Food isn't the greatest, but on par with this type of place.",
          "Yes, my entire family including myself simply enjoyed this place so much that we went back everyday that we were on vacation which we never do. We found that it was better to go at night especially for the outdoor activities due to the extreme heat during the day. Arcade games",
          "We went for a 30th. Birthday celebration party with all adults in our group and everyone had lots of fun. Just walking around and watching all of the activity is interesting, especially the water activities.",
          "We accidentally found Frankie's and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. There is something for everyone. My son's and I enjoyed to go-karts especially the Shamrock which lets you draft making it more of a challenge than racing on a figure eight. The indoor arcade has games for all",
          "Frankie's has something for everyone. We have done many of the indoor games including the climbing structure. We have also enjoyed the go karts, mini golf, and bumper boats. It is a bit pricey but it is a great time with the kids.",
          "We hosted my son's 9th birthday party here. We had a blast!! They loved the go carts, fun house, arcade games, and side winder. The birthday package prices were decent since they were able to do 2 attraction rides, $5.00 arcade money, unlimited play in the fun house, 1 pizza,",
          "The BEST Fun Park In the triangle.. One of the finer points about this place is, do your research, set and budget, and bring cash(instead of credit card). THEN STICK TO YOUR BUDGET. I see so many folks not plan properly for a visit here. Decent for a simple outing, they",
          "Took the grandkids there and they went through $100 in less than an hour. An inexpensive bracelet for smaller children should be offered, since most of the rides are geared towards teenagers.",

          "We enjoy going here for the outside mini golf, they have 3 different course which are really good. The games inside are always broke and a waste of money, asking the attendants to get your coins back on a game you just lost them on because the games are broke is always awkward",
          "We go here quite regularly to go putt-putt. I enjoy all 3 courses and they have spent lots of money keeping up the courses. The go carts and other stuff are fun too. Its surprising how much fun adults can have here. But we have never eaten there until recently. The food is",

          "This was a good way to spend the day with our 9 year old son. I'd rate it as above average expense wise however there are attractions are worth doing plus unique. We don't have a Frankie's in Lynchburg, VA. There is indoor and outdoor fun. The food was pricey but very tasty. We",
          "We have been bringing our grandchildren here whenever we visit as a special treat. They are now old enough to do the big go-karts, so racing them is a real treat. We love how each child can get money put onto a reloadable card and they can swipe to their hearts content - or",
          "First time going - went with my daughter's school field trip group. The facility was spacious. Rides and games were in overall very good condition. Restaurant food very tasty. Love the variety of ices drinks. It is not cheap, so bring plenty of money $50+ if you really want to",
          "Miniature golf was a lot of fun, but the arcade games were a rip off. Some of the games charged $2-$2.50 per game and ended within 15 seconds if you were killed. For $2-$2.50 I was expecting my kids to at least get a couple of minutes of game play. Very disappointing. If we come",

          "I spent some time here on a team building excursion, and we all had a great time. I loved the 4D ride/game, and the go carts were fun as well. They have 4 different mini golf courses, which gives plenty of variation. I know the kids love it, but our group of adults had just as",
          "Like all of these fun park places, the cost of the good time is higher than one would like. My little girl loved just spinning the wheel for tickets, but it was 1.50 or 2 dollars per spin. It was her vacation and she loved it though. Each of my crew won fairly big at at least",
          "Frankie's Fun Park is Fun for everyone kids and adults. you will have fun, yes, it is not cheap, but establishments have to make the money to keep it running and keep it safe. they have a lot of thing to do for all ages. Nice restaurant in side as well. Kids will have fun,",

          "We visited here in September 2016 with friends and family. Lots of activities (we did Go Kart, Laser Tag, Slick Track and indoor games) and all were really fun. The Laser Tag was a bit short in length (only 5-6 minutes). They have a nice bar area for adults who want to relax",

          "Very run & laid back for adults & kids. Lots of variety of activities to enjoy. With all the foot traffic of course it was lightly dirty. I love the load card system too. Go karts were awesome. Only reason I rated it 4 was for the dirty floors & restrooms & also the cost of",

          "We went with a group of adult guy friends for some good laughs and fun. It was great, go carts, laser tag, batting cages. Although I had been many times for kids, this was unique and a lot more fun than some thought it would be. A bar in the back provided a good break in",

          "There is nothing special about this place. While there an ok amount of games/attractions to keep you busy, after about an hour or so I was done and board with what was there. I wouldn't suggest eating there. Typical mediocre food for a place of this caliber.",
          "We would definitely go back here again. There is plenty of stuff to do for all ages. However be sure that if you plan on spending very long here at all, that you take plenty of money. We found that we had to keep adding money to our card over and over . We a ate the",

          "From games to rides, cost is a factor. If you have a coupon or get a deal, GRAB IT! Frankie's can be expensive and once you blow through the $$ the kids can get bored. There is a ton to do though and I would recommend it all. Just realize that not everything can be done by",
          "Lots of fun. Clean. Friendly staff. Even the food in the snack bar is pretty decent. I really enjoy visiting Frankie's... Hope you do too!",
          "We went to Frankie's for a date night and had dinner at the Chill Lounge. The service was decent enough (once our server finally came over) and drinks were okay. My salad was quite good but my husband wasn't crazy about the sliders and fries. Overall we felt we paid more than",

          "We stopped here passing thru, we stayed for about 2 1/2 hours and didn't even get done with everything inside, needless to say, we never even got started on the outside. This place is awesome!!!! I can't wait to go back when we have more time to do it all. They have a grill",
          "There is a jungle gym inside, machines, archade so the kids can get tired! And also food is available",
          "Great place to take the kids. They love all the games go karts bumper cars and more. Keep in mind they are a little on the pricey side so plan on dropping cash when you go. Great place for birthday parties as they are always accommodating. Parents have fun too as I alway have to",
          "We found this place by accident. Great places for kids and adults of all ages. Our 3 year old was in arcade heaven and when he was done playing games he played in the jungle gym thing. The coolest part of the jungle gym is that parents sit underneath it with large screen tvs to",
          "We have taken our 3 kids here multiple times over the years and have had a blast! Although this place is expensive, it's worth it for several reasons... they keep the place well staffed, clean and updated. There is still a large indoor play/climbing structure that is literally",

          "In the area to celebrate my Nieces birthday and we ended up at Frankie's. It was really slow on the evening of the 29th of Nov but the weather was great. They rode the go carts several times and it was nice to only have about 10 carts on the track and they didn't have to wait",
          "Best place in town to take your kids. Lots of fun games. Pizza was excellent. My grandson hit the jackpot on his first attempt.",

          "We took our grandchildren there and they had a lot of a fun!!! Seems kept up well and the staff was generally helpful. They have things to do for almost any age. Don't go there without being ready to drop some money. As with most amusement places it is a little pricey.",
          "We were visiting family in Raleigh and my cousin told me she passes this place on her way to work. I checked out the website and suggested we go. It was very warm and not raining so the attractions outside were going. We had a great time especially on the go karts. I enjoyed",
          "I've been to Frankie's many many times and it's such a fun place to go! When you go in, you go to the front desk and they give you a little 'credit card' for the games. You load it with your own money, ($10,$15,$20+), and then with just that little card, you can play every game",
          "We went to the slip and slide go kart track. Arrived and was on the track within 5 minutes! The karts were pretty quick but it was just the two of us on the track which means this wasn't a 5 star review. Reasonably priced and lasted about 10 minutes.",
          "We had a great time! Everything is priced reasonably. The only thing that we didn't like was the baseball cages. The helmets are in horrible condition and there aren't many size options at all. It seems everything about the cages have been neglected. My husband and son both",
          "What a great place to go with friends and enjoy video games, laser tag,skee ball, and more. You get a card and put money onto it which is used for the activities. I love Frankie's. HOWEVER, I don't suggest eating anything there.",
          "This is a great place to come to when you want to have fun with your family and friends. The rides are awesome. The games are awesome. The food is awesome. There something for everyone to do and participate in. I encourage everyone to go out to Frankie's and have a good time!",

          "Mini golf and the go karts were fun for a mixed age group. We were able to get a group rate (10 or more) that made the cost reasonable (~$22 ea) for about 2 hours of play outside. If you do indoor games you will run through your Frankie cash card quickly. We were there on a",
          "I brought my buddies here after a long day of driving. We had a lot of laughs and overall it was a good night. Frankie's is an arcade with a lot of outdoor activities, but have the credit card handy. You need to get a Frankie's Card and load that up. Most games were at least",
          "Love the additional games and rides and they aren't too overly priced but I do wish there was some way to do an unlimited package deal. I almost wanted to grab four random people and split the cost on a party instead of paying for each thing separately. The arcade is crazy huge,",

          "I only recently discovered Frankies - wish I had discovered it sooner. They have all the games and fun stuff of course - they also have a (family) restaurant. What I like is that they also have a grown up bar for the big kids - best of both worlds! :)",
          "I've been to Frankie's twice this year on visits to Raleigh. It always proves to be a fun time (water boats, go-carts, batting cages, laser tag, arcade, etc.) Each time there were no lines at any ride. Although, this is likely due to the a la carte pricing. $5-$7 per 5",
          "I had the displeasure of bringing my boys and their 2 cousins here a few weeks ago. You need to BUY a Frankie's gift card and then load it with real dollars using cash or a credit card. We put $20 on each card and they used all that money in about 30 minutes. The first ride",

          "Be prepared to spend money - even if you only do the arcade games. Actually my family has only done the arcade games, we've never had time to try the outdoor activities, though they look fun. We always enjoy an outing here and winning prizes with our electronic tickets we earn.",
          "I absolutely love the laser tag at Frankies. Amongst the games and other rides, you can spend a few hours and a few hundred if you are not careful but the kid at heart will love it!",
          "We went on a day during drizzle, therefore most of the outdoor attractions were unavailable. The indoor attractions were fun. The one ride that repeatedly lifts and drops is thrilling for young and old kids alike. Nice separate eating area overlooking floor.",
          "The go karts is all we go for. My husband's company had their Christmas party here & it was great. The food was also delightful.",
          "Went to Frankie's with my family and we had a blast. Fun for all ages and even has a restaurant inside. Indoors they have arcades, a small alley, air hockey, laser tag and way more games that my younger one loves. Outdoors they have a rope climbing (that we all did and love),",
          "We went to Frankie's Fun Park one evening while visiting Raleigh and were content with our evening. It is a place that younger children would probably enjoy more than young adults. They had the usual fun park type rides (the laser tag and go karts were fun), but nothing special.",
          "Great for all ages. We usually just go for the mini golf but there are tons of things to do there. It would be a great place to host a birthday party!",
          "My husband and I brought the kids (ages 17, 13, 13, 1) for a good time. The older kids did the high ropes course (loved it!) and we all played a round of golf and then games in the arcade. We were there for 3 hours and spent $100 plus the older kids had some of their own",
          "This is an indoor arcade with a really good outdoor selection of activities as well. My daughter is 4.5 years old so we did not do too much in the way of video games. We had her on the bumper boats and the go karts and we played mini golf. Bumper boats and go karts will let",
          "Today was a first visit there. Lots of fun for hours with the family. The food was good. Pricey but good. Games games and more games. Putt putt, 3 go-cart tracks, water boat ride and more. Its easy to put a dent in your pocket here BUT so much fun.",
          "Took 2 kids there and got a $50 card. They did 3 things each (mini golf, jungle gym, and one game of laser tag) and money was gone. We were barely there any time at all.",
          "Folks they do not have enough staff to man all of the attractions. We were told we would have to wait 30 min for someone to eat their lunch. The manager reported no one else could man the sky rail . This is poor planning on their part and poor customer service. If you want to",
          "I have brought my fair share of kids here over the nine years living in the area and it remains - EXPENSIVE! The noise level is crazy loud and the place is sensory overload.Teens are a better crowd here than the younger set. Again, even when buying a package, you are paying a",
          "The arcade has tons of amusements and games... something for everyone! There are a few outdoor Go-Carts you can go to and one of them is so much fun... chasing your friends around the track. I'm a senior citizen and I had a blast here. They also have miniature golf and kiddie",
          "My Husband and I went. We decided to grab something to eat first.The good was good but expensive. Hint: You can easily share the Italian sub and fries with your friend/partner. They require you to get \"fun cards\" (no tokens) but charge you 25 cents to activate it?!? The games",
          "Very clean and up-to-date place, but game prices are steep, decent prizes are unattainable unless you have stupid amounts of tickets. Really nice cafeteria area renovation!",
          "Great for a fun date or spending time with family. You cant go wrong with spending a few hours here.",
          "We took our 6 and 8 year old boys there but saw older kids there as well. There are so many things to do! We did the arcade games, mini-golf, and playhouse. But they also have laser tag, go-carts and bumper boats. You could spend a serious amount of time there! The arcade",
          "There are tons of things to do Frankie's and for all ages! The staff are friendly. A little pricey but a great place to take your kids for a fun-filled day!",
          "I came to Frankie's fun park three years ago with my fantastic date, although our formal attire (suit and cocktail dress) was slightly over the typical dress of Frankie's customers, I still recommend going all out for a trip to Frankie's. In addition, you can get some great",
          "Maybe trying too hard to be all things to all people. We were there for a bridal shower/bachelorette party, and played miniature golf. The golf venue was beautifully landscaped and extensive, with 3 18-hole courses to choose from. The challenge of the holes came from the",
          "My department went there one afternoon to celebrate one of our members who was leaving our team. We ate and drank and raced go carts! Tons of fun.",
          "It is always fun to go play mini golf! We have even gone in a few times to play the arcade games though as adults I guess we have to let the kids play first haha",
          "Things are just pricey there for pretty much anything you wanna do. Still a great place that kids love.",
          "I'm 31 years old and I enjoy my time every time I go there with friends or with my wife , they have go karts , that I like very much they also have a go kart that can drift .",
          "Very clean, friendly and helpful staff.... Prices to do things were a little high would be my only negative thing",
          "expensive but worth it. the arcade games are better ( or different ) than at other places. especially the star wars battle pod. Love that ! the food is ok as well. we had pizza and sandwiches. have a lot of space and big tables for parties. cant wait to go back.",
          "Frankie's is a great family fun spot. Three differnt mini golf courses to choose from. We played #1. Some difficult holes located in hillsides. Very fun!",
          "We went here on our weekend. I was shocked at the prices of the games. Most were $1.00 or more. We also did the batting cages. The bats and helmets all need replacing. Two of the machines didn't work correctly.",
          "My husband brought me out to Frankie's and we had a great time. Lots of arcade games, go-karts, golf, laser tag. Great time for kids or adults. They also have a restaurant on site.",
          "Very clean place, lots of fun! We didn't try the restaurant but mostly the rides and go-carts. Very helpful staff!",
          "My husband and I went here to waste a few hours and had a good time, way more fun than we expected to have. The outside area has 3 mini golf courses which was nice. Batting cages had multiple speeds and had both baseball and softball pitches which was nice. Did not have to wait",
          "This is a fun place for both kids and adults. Bring $300 for about 2 people a piece between the age of 6 and older to get the full Frankie's experience. Otherwise, $50 will last about 30-45 minutes for one person. Enjoy.",
          "Held my hubby's 40th bday here as had a bar, first time for several folks and had a blast!!! Great drinks, food was good but the atmosphere was perfect, was at night when less kids so had time to enjoy the games we wanted to play.",
          "**This is a review for two visits!** Having just moved here my husband and I have been trying to find places to take our son for family outings on the weekend. We heard of Frankie's and decided to give it a try! We walked in my my three year goes, \"Wow, it's cool!\". We went",
          "For average families the cost is out of their range, it's like the cost for planning a vacation, it's small, so they try to get all the money they can up front, incase you don't come back, if you can't afford it, they don't want you back, the bar food & drinks are top hotels",
          "Went with a group of friends (mid/late twenties) and had a blast! Mid week there is low traffic, so we were able to have fun and stay out of everyone's way. Mini golf competition between guys and girls, the guys spent time in the batting cages, and we played some arcade games.",
          "We went here while we were passing through NC last summer and the kids had so much fun! We didn't get to explore everything because we didn't have enough time. The only draw back is that it can get real expensive, real quick. I will definitely take them back when we are in the",
          "My kids are 14, 11, and 8 years old, so Frankie's is a perfect place to spend an afternoon for some family fun. It doesn't hurt that as parents, we're just big kids too. The only issue is, due to the hefty price tag, it is a rare treat. Last time we went, one attraction, (such",
          "Adventure landing is a crowded, much older alternative om a super busy street. As far as these places go it's ok but has always been super crowded so waits for car rides can be a waste of time.",
          "Go Karts (three levels of skill) Very good indoor arcade and climbing challenges for all ages. Full Bar and Pub food setup (The drinks are not cheap but they don't want you slamming $3 margaritas while the kids are playing) Pretty doable if you are on a budget if you use some",
          "We enjoyed our time at Frankie's. They have a good selection of arcade games along with other outdoor activities. We did not eat in the restaurant but we have heard that it is good. We are definitely going to try it on one of our visits.",
          "I went with friends, I really liked it, I hate that they closed the drift car at the time, so I rode the other one, kind of expensive! I would go back but not constantly",
          "I took my teenage son and a friend to Frankie's. They did two rounds of go carts and went on the ropes course. It cost $22 each, but they had a great time.",
          "im new the area and went to the Brier Creek location in Raleigh. The three people (I thought his name was Chessie but it's not I misunderstood but I can't remember what his name was and Avian and another guy, maybe Derek?) working the go karts were so nice and helpful and it",
          "The day we went it was raining outside. We only tried the inside activities but we want to go back and try it all. We have a 2 year old and a 10 month old. They both loved the merry go round. Our two year old played several other arcade games and had a lot of fun. She",
          "The arcade, mini-golf course, and go-carts are all amazing! The food was also great! I used to go to Frankie's more frequently when I was younger, but I will never forget how amazing it is. Very fun place for families since their kids can blow off all their steam with all of the",
          "OK - my husband and I took our grandchildren to this fun park to celebrate our grandson's 5th birthday. We live 2 hours away and are not accustomed to such large amusement places. I suppose the pricing is average for the area - personally I found .75, $1.00 and $2.00 per play",
          "We need more Frankie's in other States. I moved to Maryland and there's no Frankie's! This would help the population (low-med income families) that cannot afford to get in the gate at the big amusement parks for one and it help give more jobs especially since the unemployment",
          "We love this place for treating the kids on special occasions. Expensive but worth the money. Clean, great variety of attractions for all ages over 5, both indoors and out. Favorites are go carts, ropes course, indoor Fun House, and a great mini golf course. Great to have an",
          "Having an 11yo, wanted to find something \"fun\" for him to do on our trip to Raleigh. Frankies was the perfect spot. He drove go carts, so did my husband. We played a round of family mini golf with many laughs. Love that you can put money on one \"credit card\" and they slide",
          "Frankie's is very expensive! Be prepared! The go cart tracks and options are great and there is a lot to do here, but you will pay for it. Each time you ride a go cart it is $6, the ropes course, $7, small amusement ride $4, spider crawl $5 (for the day on this one), laser tag",
          "My grand kids came to town for a visit and looking for activities for them, we went to Frankies. It pleased me to see the kids having a ball! I'm tempted to return with an adult group after a nice dinner and a couple of cocktails :) I just need to save up a little extra spending",
          "We visited our friends in NC and I had looked up different places to go while there that the kids will enjoy. One of them that stood out is Frankies. Coming from FL where Orlando is only a 3 hr drive from us, we are used to big places with all the rides and services you can",
          "Very expensive, not a lot of game inside kids enjoyed but outside made up for it. Putt putt makes a nice end to the day driving go karts, bumper boats and sky walking was nice.",
          "A cooler summer's evening spent with family who've emigrated to Raleigh. Great selection of things to do keeping kids, adults and families of all kinds entertained. We loved the rides and mini golf with a choice of three courses (I think)! A great treat but I imagine it",
          "Took my grandkids to Frankie's fun park and they had a great time. Each game was a different amount. You can put $25 on a fun card but depending what the child wants to do won't last long. We stayed an hour and a half that was enough for my wallet. The kids had a ball lots",
          "There were games they had that I as a 28 year old have never seen before. It was like dave and busters but they had games even they don't have",
          "I went to Frankie's for my birthday as a treat from my dad. To start things off, I live in Raleigh so there was a good 45 min. ride in the car. When we got there we decided to have some lunch and got some food. We walked around a while trying to find tables, when we did, they",
          "I was looking for something to do with my daughter in the area when a peer mentioned this place. Glad he did...not only did we spend a few hours there on that day we returned the next day with my wife and got in a few rounds of laser tag. I made the mistake of throwing out our",
          "The Go-Karts, laser tag and inside games are fun to do and with us being right down the road, you would think we would go all the time. The issue is that is cost around 50.00 or more every time just to do a few of the activities. The facility is nice and the staff is",
          "I wouldn't pay for the arcade games they seemed over priced, however, the other activities seemed worth the money and my eight year old had a blast especially in the tower. Much better place than chuckie cheese or anything like it. More activities for the whole family. Would go",
          "While most arcades let you play a game for around a quarter, Frankie's charges anywhere from $1 to $3. (Most are a buck fifty to two dollars.) The attractions (Including go-carts and laser tag) range for $6 to $8 dollars. The attractions are very short. A round of laser tag is",
          "This place is a rip off. The spider web for kids most kids play for a few minutes and is $6, the other climbing play ground is the same for $7 for a few minutes kids get bore really quit. The laser tag is a joke for $7 per person a family of 4 is $21 for about 15 minutes. The",
          "I went to Frankie's as a date night with my boyfriend and I wasn't too pleased with it. Their were kids running around everywhere, screaming and yelling...Which is what you can expect with a \"Fun Park\". The tickets are extremely expensive and in my opinion not worth it. We spent",
          "families by day, adults by night...this place is awesome. if you dont mind the \"amusement park\" crowds and some lines you will enjoy this venue. Friday-sunday is the busiest time of the week so expect huge crowds. the earlier in the day the better atmosphere for small children.",
          "Love this place! There are so many fun things to do and since they've revamped the inside area a bit it's even better. The restaurant is pretty good with some great diversity in what they offer. Pretty well priced, it's perfect for a date night or for kids.",
          "This arcade park has both inside and outside play areas. The staff do a great job of being friendly, helpful and available. Frankie's is always updating the games and removing or quickly repairing the games that are old or break. They keep it fresh. Also, no more paper",
          "The place is very clean and well run but you need to be a king to spend much time there. They offer no discounts or package deals. Kids have fun if you can afford to let them play for more than 2hrs.",
          "Scheduled my son's 7th birthday party at Frankie's recently. The service in the food area was atrocious and the manager cut the birthday cake and served it to my son's friends even before we sang Happy Birthday and lit the candles. For a group of 16 kids and approx. 8 parents,",
          "Every summer when we take the trip to Durham for family time we stop a Frankie's at least twice. It has become sort of a tradition. Our kids love it. The games are great for every age group so the adults are not bored, it's safe and the staff are always helpful. The food is",

          "Child, teenager, young adult, and older adults can have fun here. I love that they have a restaurant with at least eatable food. I like the golf however there are a bunch of activities, the cars, the games inside, laser tags, climbing gym area, the paddle boats, batting cages.",

          "Loved the combination of old school and new games and activities. Did care much for the rule that you couldn't play games with a cocktail...but I get it. Also, why did you sell me tickets to the outdoor activities when they are shut down and will remain shut down 1 hour after it",
          "This place was awesome!! My kids loved the karting tracks and video games. It was really expensive though so we could never do it on a regular basis. We gave each child $5 and it lasted 2-3 video games.",
          "My kids LOVE Frankies. LOVE it. I can't say I enjoy going there personally - it can get expensive pretty quickly, it's sprawling so easy to lose sight of someone, and it is chaotic when it's busy. That said, the fact that my kids have so much fun there and that there IS a wide",

          "My kids loved this place, but I found it a bit pricey. There are a lot of activities, both inside and outside, so we did both. It's good for a day when you have nothing to do - but be prepared to spend money on the attractions. It's adds up quickly!",

          "We've been to Frankie's a few times with the kids and always have a great time. W love their boat game where you spray which other with water and the go carts are fun and mini golf has lots of courses. It isn't too too expensive but once you let the kids hit the arcade forget",

          "First I have to say my children have a great time when they go here. But my pocket book always seems to suffer. The putt putt is well maintained and one of the nicest in the area. Go carts for all ages are available. Indoor and outdoor attractions are great but when it rains it",

          "Frankie's is alright. It's exactly what one would expect from those fun plexes that all cities seem to have now with the go carts and miniature golf. It's good for days where the family wants to play without thinking too much. However it's hit or miss with the staff and other",

          "My daughter loved the laser tag and the go carts in particular, but like most similar places it is expensive by the time they did everything they wanted to do and had snacks. It was safe and well managed, and she plans to go again next weekend for another field trip!",

          "My first reaction was that the place was pretty pricey. However, all of the attractions are kept in very good condition, everything appeared to be operated in a safe manner, and we had a good time. The mini-golf was done very well and it's probably the most reasonably priced",

        "wiki": "The North Carolina Executive Mansion (also referred to as the North Carolina Governor's Mansion) is the official residence of the Governor of North Carolina and their family. Building began in the year 1883 and it was designed by architects Samuel Sloan and A.G. Bauer. The first occupants, Governor Daniel G. Fowle and his family, moved into the unfinished building in January 1891. It is an example of Queen Anne style architecture.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original street plan of the city of Raleigh had designated Burke Square as a possible location for the governor's residence. Burke Square was already occupied by the Raleigh Academy by the time the state decided to build and a different site for the house was chosen. The legislature passed a bill in 1883 under Governor Jarvis's prompting, to authorize the construction on Burke Square of Raleigh's third official gubernatorial residence. The bill provided for its major furnishings and required that the governor occupy the new dwelling. Prison labor was used for construction and building materials were used that could be made at the local penitentiary when feasible. Samuel Sloan, of Philadelphia, and his assistant, Aldophus Gustavus Bauer, were chosen as architects. Sloan arrived in Raleigh with his designs for the elaborate structure in April 1883 and work began in early summer. Sloan died in 1885, six years before the completion of the house, and Bauer assumed full responsibility for the remainder of the project. Bauer remained in North Carolina to become one of the state's most important nineteenth-century architects.The bricks for the house were made from Wake County clay and molded by prison labor. Many of these bricks, particularly in the sidewalks surrounding the house, still bear the inscribed names of the men who made them. The sandstone trim came from Anson County. The marble steps in front (later moved to the north side) came from Cherokee County, and oak and heart pine were shipped from all across North Carolina for use in the building.\nSince its initial construction in 1882, few major changes have been made to the building's exterior. Porches on the north and east sides have been enclosed to expand kitchen and security facilities.\nA Neoclassical makeover was undertaken during Governor Angus W. McLean's administration. Many Victorian features were changed or removed, including painting of woodwork; removal of stained glass, balustrades, overmantel mirrors and whatnot shelving; and replacement of columns and pilasters.\nDuring her tenure as first lady, Jeanelle C. Moore (wife of Dan K. Moore) began a campaign for public awareness of the mansion's historic and cultural significance. Her dedication resulted in the formation of the Executive Mansion Fine Arts Committee, a statutory committee which advises and supports the acquisition of gifts, purchases, maintenance and preservation. In 1970, the mansion was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 1974\u201375, the mansion underwent a major renovation which included the plumbing, heating, air conditioning and electrical systems. These interior and exterior rehabilitation projects were crucial to the preservation and continued use of the building.\nIn 1988, the Executive Mansion Fund Inc., a non-profit corporation was created in order to provide further support for restoration and preservation. The fund is charged with soliciting grants, donations, bequests and other contributions and with investing and managing these funds. Its successful Second Century campaign resulted in the establishment of a $2 million endowment. The Executive Mansion Fund Inc. has established a membership organization\u2014the Friends of the Executive Mansion, a group of concerned individual and corporate citizens who wish to support the Executive Mansion through their annual contributions.\n\n\n== Governor's Western Residence ==\nThe State of North Carolina also owns a second residence for the use of the governor, at 45 Patton Mountain Road on Town Mountain near Asheville. It was donated to the state by the Asheville Chamber of Commerce in 1964, in the hope that future governors would spend more time in\u2014and hence pay more attention to\u2014the western portion of the state. The home was built originally in 1939 by Tom Brimer, who was then owner of Good Humor Ice Cream. The 6,000-square-foot (560 m2) mansion sits on 18 acres (73,000 m2) of land.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"North Carolina Executive Mansion\".

          "I visited the Executive Mansion during the Christmas holidays. The rooms were decorated for the season with numerous Gingerbread Houses.",
          "Governor McCrory has been very accomodating and supportive of many Community Non-Profit organizations and during one recent such event honoring leaders of North Carolina in the past, we enjoyed a casual visit and tour of the building. It was very well maintained and the simple",
          "After passing through security ( after all the Governor does live here ) you are greeted by very friendly staff that guide you through the open to the public rooms on the ground floor. A beautiful place and a tribute to all Governors and the people of North Carolina",
          "New Friends of the Carolinas travel group visited the Executive Mansion on their way to the State Capital and were welcomed to a early morning of history and hospitality. This is an informative tour that will surprise and delight the visitor. If you're into history, architecture",
          "The gardens around the Executive mansion are as impressive if not more than the mansion itself. I particularly like the vegetable gardens. They supply the governor and his family with a lot of their fresh produce. The flower collections are very well done. My garden club",
          "Toured the home as a part of a field trip. I love this old home. It is not only beautiful, but what a treasure for North Carolina. We should be proud of this attraction. The staff were very helpful and friendly. This was not my first tour--I love the Holiday tour as well.",
          "This venue, if you can get in, reminds you of old North Carolina and North Carolina history. Each governor puts their stamp on the place.",
          "I had the pleasure of viewing the decorated Executive Mansion during the holiday open house. There was security but they just looked in our purses and had us go through a metal detector. We were then free to look around on the first floor of this historic building. We were also",
          "I did this tour some time ago with a group of friends of mine and it was very nice. You are just allowed to see the lower floor since the upper floor has the private areas where the governor lives. Overall it was a nice experience.",
          "I went there long ago for an open house. Not quite sure what the occasion was. It is decorated in a beautiful way. The lower floor open to the public. We had treats at the dinning table prepared from the chef. It was wonderful. The chef came out of the kitchen to great and say",
          "After seeing reviews and press on the Christmas lights and tours of the Mansion, you can imagine my surprise when I arrived during the day between Christmas and New Years to find the Mansion closed till March. What a waste of taxpayers money to have it lavishly decorated and",
          "I understand that governors can't stay in one place all the time since they are on the go a lot as an elected representative. However, if I were governor, they would have a difficult time pulling me away from this beautiful mansion built to be my home for the next 4-8 years.",
          "The executive mansion is different from most and takes a bit of getting used to. It is attractive on the inside and is considered an architectural gem for Raleigh.",
          "While there are limited tours of the inside, you can drive or walk around the entire space and peek in through the iron fence. The gardens and house are beautiful year-round.",
          "We took several Japanese ladies through the house and gardens. They were very impressed with the house, but even more so with the lovely gardens and bee hives. The guide we had was so sweet! I have only been in the house three times in the last thirty years, but do wish more",
          "Every Christmas the mansion is open to view the magnificent trees and decorations in all the downstairs rooms. The bonus is that local schools are invited to perform during the day. We have talent in Wake County!!!",
          "Take the kids to see this beautiful, historic site. The tour guides (Docent's) are awesome. We went on a school field trip. The 4th graders loved it. They were engaged and entertained during the tour and learned a thing or two along the way.",
          "The North Carolina Executive Mansion is a beautiful jewel that belongs to the people of North Carolina. For some who visit, they leave with the feeling that there should be more to see. However, the other floors of the mansion are used for business offices for the staff,",
          "If you don't go any other time, go at Christmas. This place is so well decorated you'll want to go home and do the same at your own house. Like Biltmore, only a much smaller scale. Lots of history, Fun especially when you have a tour guide given you all the scoop on current and",
          "I went there with some family members to see the Executive Mansion decorated for Christmas. It was lovely.",
          "Lovely area, lovely place to visit. Beautiful historic Oakwood nearby, good restaurants in the area too",
          "The mansion is always a pretty good tour though I'm not sure of the schedule, however it is a must see at Christmas - go after dark to see the lights on the grounds!",
          "Don't get me wrong the house is very cool, and historic. But you see only a few rooms downstairs on the tour. The tour leaves you with the, \"That's it?\" feeling",
          "If you get the opportunity to tour the first floor inside, dont pass it up. Tours are offered around Christmas and around gubernatorial inauguration.",
          "My husband and I took a 'garden tour' which was very disappointing. There wasn't much discussion about the history of the garden, let alone the building. Raleigh could do much better than this, especially since we didn't even get a peek inside on a hot summer day.",
          "Visited the Executive Mansion during the holiday open house. Each room was decorated for the holidays. Very stately home. A must see.",
          "We enjoyed a behind the scenes tour, but I am not sure how often that is available. It is a stately house, and the staff is knowledgeable.",
          "I toured the Mansion on 10/20/11 with a group of about 10 people. The tours are staggered in groups of up to about 15 people, give or take, depending on if there is a school group. First off, the home is gorgeous. I just wish we had been able to see more of it. Basically you",
          "Lovely Executive Mansion , nicer when you're a lunch or dinner guest of the Gov."

        "wiki": "The Research Triangle, commonly referred to as simply The Triangle, is a region in the Piedmont of North Carolina in the United States, anchored by three major research universities: North Carolina State University, Duke University, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, as well as the cities of Raleigh and Durham and the town of Chapel Hill. The nine-county region, officially named the Raleigh\u2013Durham\u2013Cary combined statistical area (CSA), comprises the Raleigh\u2013Cary and Durham\u2013Chapel Hill Metropolitan Statistical Areas and the Henderson Micropolitan Statistical Area.\nA 2019 Census estimate put the population at 2,079,687, making it the second largest combined statistical area in the state of North Carolina behind Charlotte CSA. The Raleigh\u2013Durham television market includes a broader 24-county area which includes Fayetteville, North Carolina, and has a population of 2,726,000 persons.The \"Triangle\" name was cemented in the public consciousness in the 1950s with the creation of Research Triangle Park, home to numerous tech companies and enterprises. Although the name is now used to refer to the geographic region, \"the Triangle\" originally referred to the universities, whose research facilities, and the educated workforce they provide, have historically served as a major attraction for businesses located in the region.Most of the Triangle is part of North Carolina's first, second, and fourth congressional districts.\nThe region is sometimes confused with The Triad, which is a North Carolina region adjacent to and directly west of the Triangle comprising Greensboro, Winston-Salem, and High Point, among other cities.\n\n\n== Counties ==\nDepending on which definition of the Research Triangle region is used, as few as three or as many as 16 counties are included as part of the region. All of these counties when included hold a population of over 2,167,000 people.\nThe three core counties of Wake, Durham and Orange are the homes of the three research universities for which the area is named.\nThe 2019 members of the Research Triangle Regional Partnership are:\n\nChatham\nDurham\nFranklin\nGranville\nJohnston\nLee\nPerson\nWake\nWarren\n\n\n=== NC Regional Councils of Governments Definition ===\nAll counties in the State of North Carolina are in one of 16 regional councils which provide programs and services to local governments.  The Triangle J Council of Governments includes Chatham, Durham, Johnston, Lee, Moore, Orange, and Wake Counties.  The northern Triangle counties of Person, Granville, Franklin, Vance and Warren are part of the Kerr-Tar Regional Council of Governments.\n\n\n=== Office of Management and Budget Definition ===\n\nAs of September 14, 2018, the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineated the Raleigh-Durham-Cary Combined Statistical Area as consisting of two metropolitan and one micropolitan statistical areas.  Those three statistical areas in turn are defined as consisting of a total of nine counties.  The MSAs and their constituent counties are:\n\nDurham-Chapel Hill Metropolitan SA\nChatham County\nDurham County\nGranville County\nOrange County\nPerson County\nHenderson Micropolitan SA\nVance County\nRaleigh-Cary Metropolitan SA\nFranklin County\nJohnston County\nWake CountyPrior to September 2018, the OMB had used the name Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area and it included several additional counties. The Dunn Micropolitan Statistical Area (Harnett County) and Sanford Micropolitan Statistical Area (Lee County) were moved to the Fayetteville-Sanford-Lumberton Combined Statistical Area, while the Oxford Micropolitan Statistical Area (Granville County) was folded into the Durham-Chapel Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Raleigh Metropolitan Statistical Area was also renamed the Raleigh-Cary Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nThe table below outlines the populations of the constituent counties of the Raleigh\u2013Durham-Cary Combined Statistical Area as of July 1, 2019.\n\n\n== Cities ==\n\nThe Triangle region, as defined for statistical purposes as the Raleigh\u2013Durham\u2013Cary CSA, comprises nine counties, although the U.S. Census Bureau divided the region into two metropolitan statistical areas and one micropolitan area in 2003. The Raleigh-Cary metropolitan area comprises Wake, Franklin, and Johnston Counties; the Durham-Chapel Hill metropolitan area comprises Durham, Orange, Chatham, Granville, and Person Counties; and the Henderson micropolitan area comprises Vance County.\nSome area television stations define the region as Raleigh\u2013Durham\u2013Fayetteville. Fayetteville is more than 50 miles (80 km) from Raleigh, but is part of the Triangle television market.\n\n\n=== 15 largest municipalities ===\n\n\n== Education ==\nPublic secondary education in the Triangle is similar to that of the majority of the state of North Carolina, in which there are county-wide school systems (the exception is Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools within Orange County but apart from Orange County Schools). Based in Cary, the Wake County Public School System, which includes the cities of Raleigh and Cary, is the largest school system in the state of North Carolina and the 15th-largest in the United States, with average daily enrollment of 159,949 as of the second month of the 2016\u201317 school year. Other larger systems in the region include Durham Public Schools (about 33,000 students) and rapidly growing Johnston County Schools (about 31,000 students).\n\n\n=== Institutions of higher education ===\n\nCampbell University\nCentral Carolina Community College\nDuke University\nDurham Technical Community College\nLouisburg College\nMeredith College\nNorth Carolina Central University\nNorth Carolina State University\nPiedmont Community College\nShaw University\nSoutheastern Baptist Theological Seminary and The College at Southeastern\nSt. Augustine's College\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nVance-Granville Community College\nWake Technical Community College\nWilliam Peace University\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== College sports ===\nWith the significant number of universities and colleges in the area and the relative absence of major league professional sports, NCAA sports are very popular, particularly those sports in which the Atlantic Coast Conference participates, most notably basketball.\nThe Duke Blue Devils (representing Duke University in Durham), NC State Wolfpack (representing North Carolina State University in Raleigh), and North Carolina Tar Heels (representing the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) are all members of the ACC. Rivalries among these schools are very strong, fueled by proximity to each other, with annual competitions in every sport. Adding to the rivalries is the large number of graduates the high schools in the region send to each of the local universities. It is very common for students at one university to know many students attending the other local universities, which increases the opportunities for \"bragging\" among the schools. The four ACC schools in the state, Duke, North Carolina, North Carolina State, and Wake Forest University (the last of which was originally located in the town of Wake Forest before moving to Winston-Salem in 1956), are referred to as Tobacco Road by sportscasters, particularly in basketball. All four teams consistently produce high-caliber teams. Each of the Triangle-based universities listed has won at least two NCAA Basketball national championships.\nThree historically black colleges, including recent Division I arrival North Carolina Central University and Division II members St. Augustine College and Shaw University also boost the popularity of college sports in the region.\nOther colleges in the Triangle that field intercollegiate teams include Campbell University, Meredith College, and William Peace University.\n\n\n=== Professional sports ===\n\nThe region has only one professional team of the four major sports, the Carolina Hurricanes of the NHL, based in Raleigh. Since moving to the Research Triangle region from Hartford, Connecticut, they have enjoyed great success, including winning a Stanley Cup. With only one top-level professional sports option, minor league sports are quite popular in the region. The Durham Bulls in downtown Durham are a AAA Minor League baseball affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays, and the Carolina Mudcats, based in Zebulon, 10 miles east of Raleigh, are the Advanced-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. In Cary, North Carolina FC plays in the second-level United Soccer League, and the North Carolina Courage began play in the National Women's Soccer League in 2017 after the owner of North Carolina FC bought the NWSL franchise rights of the Western New York Flash and relocated the NWSL franchise to the Triangle.\n\nThe area also had a team in the fledgling World League of American Football \u2013 however, the Raleigh\u2013Durham Skyhawks, coached by Roman Gabriel, did not exactly cover themselves in glory; they lost all 10 games of their inaugural (and only) season in 1991. The team folded after that, being replaced in the league by the Ohio Glory, which fared little better at 1\u20139, ultimately suffering the same fate \u2013 along with the other six teams based in North America \u2013 when the league took a two-year hiatus, returning as a six-team all-European league in 1995.\n\n\n== Commerce ==\nAnchored by leading technology firms, government and world-class universities, medical centers and schools, the area's economy has performed exceptionally well. Significant increases in employment, earnings, personal income, and retail sales are projected over the next 15 years.\nThe region's growing high-technology community includes such companies as IBM, Lenovo, SAS Institute, Cisco Systems, NetApp, Red Hat, EMC Corporation, and Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to high-tech, the region is consistently ranked in the top three in the U.S. with concentration in life science companies. Some of these companies include GlaxoSmithKline, Biogen Idec, BASF, Merck & Co., Novo Nordisk, Novozymes, and Pfizer. Research Triangle Park and North Carolina State University's Centennial Campus in Raleigh support innovation through R&D and technology transfer among the region's companies and research universities (including Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).\nThe area fared relatively well during the late-2000s recession, ranked as the strongest region in North Carolina by the Brookings Institution and among the top 40 in the country.  The change in unemployment during 2008 to 2009 was 4.6% and home prices was 2%.  The Greensboro metropolitan area was listed among the second-weakest and the Charlotte area among the middle in the country.\n\n\n=== Major employers ===\n\n\n=== Major hospitals, medical centers and medical schools ===\n\nThe Research Triangle region is served by these hospitals and medical centers:\nHospitals of the Duke University Health System\nDuke Ambulatory Surgery Center (Durham)\nDuke Children's Hospital and Health Center (Durham)\nDuke Raleigh Hospital (formerly Raleigh Community Hospital)\nDuke University Medical Center (Durham)\nDuke Regional Hospital (formerly Durham Regional Hospital)\nPerson Memorial Hospital (Roxboro)\nHospitals of the UNC Health Care system\nChatham Hospital (Siler City)\nNorth Carolina Cancer Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nNorth Carolina Children's Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nNorth Carolina Memorial Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nNorth Carolina Neurosciences Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nNorth Carolina Women's Hospital (Chapel Hill)\nRex Hospital (Raleigh)\nJohnston Medical Center (Smithfield)\nHospitals of the WakeMed system\nWakeMed Raleigh Campus (formerly Wake Memorial Hospital and Wake Medical Center)\nWakeMed Cary Hospital (formerly Western Wake Medical Center)\nOther hospitals and medical centers\nCentral Regional Hospital,(Butner)\nDurham VA Medical Center (Durham)\nFranklin Regional Medical Center (Louisburg)\nHarnett Health System (Dunn)\nBetsy Johnson Regional Hospital\nAngier Medical Services\nGood Hope Hospital\nBetsy Johnson Cancer Research Clinic\nCentral Harnett Hospital\nMedical Schools\nDuke University School of Medicine\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine\nCampbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Freeways and primary designated routes ===\n\nThe Triangle proper is served by three major interstate highways: I-40, I-85, and I-87 along with their spurs: I-440 and I-540, and seven U.S. Routes: 1, 15, 64, 70, 264, 401, and 501. US Highways 15 and 501 are multiplexed through much of the region as US 15-501. I-95 passes 30 miles east of Raleigh through Johnston County, with I-87 connecting I-95 at Rocky Mount, NC to Raleigh via the US 64\u2013264 Bypass.\nThe two interstates diverge from one another in Orange County, with I-85 heading northeast through northern Durham County toward Virginia, while I-40 travels southeast through southern Durham, through the center of the region, and serves as the primary freeway through Raleigh. The related loop freeways I-440 and I-540 are primarily located in Wake County around Raleigh. I-440 begins at the interchange of US 1 and I-40 southwest of downtown Raleigh and arcs as a multiplex with US 1 northward around downtown with the formal designation as the Cliff Benson/Raleigh Beltline (cosigned with US 1 on three-fourths of its northern route) and ends at its junction with I-40 in southeast Raleigh. I-540, sometimes known as the Raleigh Outer Loop, extends from the US 64\u2013264 Bypass to I-40 just inside Durham County, where it continues across the interstate as a state route (NC 540), prior to its becoming a toll road from the NC 54 interchange to the current terminus at NC Highway 55 near Holly Springs. I-95 serves the extreme eastern edge of the region, crossing north\u2013south through suburban Johnston County.\nU.S. Routes 1, 15, and 64 primarily serve the region as limited-access freeways or multilane highways with access roads. US 1 enters the region from the southwest as the Claude E. Pope Memorial Highway and travels through suburban Apex where it merges with US 64 and continues northeast through Cary. The two highways are codesignated for about 2 miles (3.2 km) until US 1 joins I-440 and US 64 with I-40 along the Raleigh\u2013Cary border. Capital Boulevard, which is designated US 1 for half of its route and US 401 the other is not a limited-access freeway, although it is a major thoroughfare through northeast Raleigh and into the northern downtown area.\nNorth Carolina Highway 147 is a limited-access freeway that connects I-85 with Toll Route NC 540 in northwestern Wake County. The older, toll-free portion of the four-lane route\u2014known as the Durham Freeway or the I.L. \"Buck\" Dean Expressway\u2014traverses downtown Durham and extends through Research Triangle Park to I-40. The Durham Freeway is often used as a detour or alternate route for I-40 through southwestern Durham the Chapel Hill area in cases of traffic accident, congestion or road construction delays. The tolled portion of NC 147, called the Triangle Expressway\u2014North Carolina's first modern toll road when it opened to traffic in late 2011\u2014continues past I-40 to Toll NC 540. Both Toll NC 147 and Toll NC 540 are modern facilities which collect tolls using transponders and license plate photo-capture technology.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nA partnering system of multiple public transportation agencies currently serves the Triangle region under the joint GoTransit branding. Raleigh is served by the Capital Area Transit (CAT) municipal transit system, while Durham has the Durham Area Transit Authority (DATA) system. Chapel Hill is served by Chapel Hill Transit, and Cary is served by C-Tran public transit systems. However, Triangle Transit, formerly called the Triangle Transit Authority (TTA), works in cooperation with all area transit systems by offering transfers between its own routes and those of the other systems. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nPlans have been made to merge all of the area's municipal systems into Triangle Transit, and Triangle Transit also has proposed a regional rail system to connect downtown Durham, downtown Cary and downtown Raleigh with multiple suburban stops, as well as stops in the Research Triangle Park area. The agency's initial proposal was effectively cancelled in 2006, however, when the agency could not procure adequate federal funding. A committee of local business, transportation and government leaders currently are working with Triangle Transit to develop a new transit blueprint for the region, with various modes of rail transit, as well as bus rapid transit, open as options for consideration.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\n\n==== Raleigh\u2013Durham International Airport (RDU) ====\n (IATA: RDU, ICAO: KRDU, FAA LID: RDU)\n\nRaleigh\u2013Durham International Airport (RDU) has nonstop passenger service to 68 destinations with over 450 average daily departures, including nonstop international service to Canada, Europe, and Mexico. It is located near the geographic center of The Triangle, 4 1\u20442 miles (7.2 km) northeast of the town of Morrisville in Wake County. The airport covers 5,000 acres (2,023 ha) and has three runways.In 1939 the General Assembly of North Carolina chartered the Raleigh\u2013Durham Aeronautical Authority, which was changed in 1945 to the Raleigh\u2013Durham Airport Authority. The first new terminal opened in 1955. Terminal A (now Terminal 1) opened in 1981. American Airlines began service to RDU in 1985.\nRDU opened the 10,000-foot (3,000 m) runway, 5L-23R, in 1986. American Airlines opened its north\u2013south hub operation at RDU in the new Terminal C in June 1987, greatly increasing the size of RDU's operations with a new terminal including a new apron and runway. American brought RDU its first international flights to Bermuda, Cancun, Paris and London.\nIn 1996, American Airlines ceased its hub operations at RDU due to Pan Am and Eastern Airlines. Pan Am and Eastern were Miami's main tenants until 1991, when both carriers went bankrupt. Their hubs at MIA were taken over by United Airlines and American Airlines. This created a difficulty in competing with US Airways' hub in Charlotte and Delta Air Lines' hub in Atlanta, Georgia for passengers traveling between smaller cities in the North and South. Midway Airlines entered the market, starting service in 1995 with the then somewhat novel concept of 50-seat Canadair Regional Jets providing service from its RDU hub primarily along the East Coast. Midway, originally incorporated in Chicago, had some success after moving its operations to the midpoint of the eastern United States at RDU and its headquarters to Morrisville, NC. The carrier ultimately could not overcome three weighty challenges: the arrival of Southwest Airlines, the refusal of American Airlines to renew the frequent flyer affiliation it had with Midway (thus dispatching numerous higher fare-paying businesspeople to airlines with better reward destinations), and the significant blow of September 11, 2001. Midway Airlines filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 13, 2001, and ceased operations entirely on October 30, 2003.\nIn February 2000, RDU was ranked as the nation's second fastest-growing major airport in the United States, by Airports Council International, based on 1999 statistics. Passenger growth hit 24% over the previous year, ranking RDU second only to Washington Dulles International Airport. RDU opened Terminal A south concourse for use by Northwest and Continental Airlines in 2001. The addition added 46,000 square feet (4,300 m2) and five aircraft gates to the terminal.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Joel Lane House, also known as Wakefield, was built in 1769, is a historic restored home and museum located in Raleigh, North Carolina. It is the oldest dwelling in Wake County and contains collections of 18th century artifacts and period furnishings. The museum grounds include a detached middle class home built circa 1790, formal city garden, and period herb garden. The house is named after Joel Lane, the \"Father of Raleigh\" and \"Father of Wake County.\" In the late 1760s, Lane settled at Wake Cross Roads located in colonial Johnston County. Lane and his house played a key role in North Carolina's transition from colony to state and in the establishment of Raleigh as the state capital. Joel Lane's plantation manor stood on a small hill, overlooking the future site of Raleigh. Lane owned thousands of acres, which enabled him to be influential in politics.\nLane was a member of the colonial General Assembly, and in 1770 successfully lobbied to create Wake County, at the time a sparsely settled wilderness. The county was named \"Wake\" in honor of Margaret Wake, wife of colonial Governor William Tryon. In 1771, Wake County's first county court is believed to have convened at his home. Lane was appointed a member of the court, a position he held until his death. During the Revolutionary War, Wake Cross Roads was the site of important government meetings, both formal and informal. In 1776, Lane hosted the colony Council of Safety; the following year, he obtained a license for a small inn. From May to June 1781, Lane's property was the setting for a session of the state General Assembly. Lane served in the state Senate in 11 of the 14 sessions from 1782 to 1794. He was also a delegate to the 1789 convention in Halifax that ratified the United States Constitution.\nLane was directly involved in the decision to locate the permanent capital of the state in Wake County. In 1792, the legislature authorized the purchase of 1,000 acres (4 km2) of his land upon which to establish the city of \"Raleigh\" as the new center of state government. The community's western boundary was drawn just east of Lane's house, and a street of the city was named in his honor. After Lane's death in 1795, Lane's house served several owners before being purchased by businessman William Boylan in 1818. The house, along with Montfort Hall, remained in the Boylan family until 1909. During this time, the city of Raleigh absorbed the house into its expanding boundaries. Lane's former plantation became the site of new streets, homes and businesses. In 1911, the house was moved a short distance. In 1927, Lane's house was purchased by the National Society of Colonial Dames of America in the State of North Carolina to ensure its preservation. The organization continues to operate this Raleigh Historic Landmark as a house museum.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Registered Historic Places in North Carolina\nList of the oldest buildings in North Carolina\nTimeline of Raleigh, North Carolina\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nNational Society of Colonial Dames of America\nNational Registry of The Joel Lane House\nHistoric American Buildings Survey (HABS) No. NC-12-D-2, \"Joel Lane House, 728 Hargatt Street, Raleigh, Wake County, NC\", 7 measured drawings, 2 data pages",

          "This place is phenomenal for anyone that loves flowers and nature. The mood is very calm and zen. This is also a great place for family photographer which means that many times it's crowded by photographers and clients. I haven't seen many actually go into the garden to take",

          "Since the gardens are located near my work place, I decided to take my camera to work one day and go visit the gardens. And wow..what a surprise. This place is beautiful. You go back behind the station and you will see the signs that direct you to the gardens. The gardens are",

      "name": "North Carolina State University Memorial Belltower",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The North Carolina State University Memorial Belltower (officially the Memorial Tower,  informally known as the Belltower) is a 115-foot-tall (35 m) free-standing bell tower on the Main Campus of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina Conceived as a war memorial to honor university alumni killed in World War I and the university's overall participation in the conflict, the Belltower now serves as a perpetual memorial for N.C. State students and alumni who gave their lives in the service of the nation. A prominent university symbol, the tower is a popular rallying point for the campus community.\n\n\n== Design and features ==\n\n\n=== Dimensions ===\nThe Belltower is constructed from 1,400 tons of granite quarried at Mount Airy, North Carolina, and rests on a 700-ton square concrete base with an area of 62 square feet, which includes the four sets of concrete steps on each side. The tower itself is 18 square feet at its base, tapering to 14 square feet at its top.\n\n\n=== Exterior architecture ===\nThe tower shaft was designed with a combination of semi-Romanesque Revival features and Collegiate Gothic verticality by William Henry Deacy of the W.W. Leland Studios in New York City. At the top of the tower shaft are 12 carved torches, three on each side.The clock section and the top of the tower were designed in 1935-36 by the North Carolina State department of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and by the N.C. State College architectural department. The clock section consists of a four-faced granite clock 4.0 feet (1.2 m) wide by 7.5 feet (2.3 m) high. The bronze numerals on each clock face were cast by the N.C. State College foundry prior to the clock's actual installation. At each corner of the clock section are two 7.5 feet (2.3 m) tall carved American eagles, eight in all, which support the top of the tower.The top of the tower, including the open bell tower and bell platform, consists of fluted and carved Romanesque pillars and arches, with two pillars on each side. The bell platform is supported at each corner by four rectangular columns. On each face of each rectangular column is carved a full-length Roman battle sword, eight in all, with each sword hilt overlaid by a shield. The battle swords and shields represent war, while the American eagles represent the State College's role in World War I.\n\n\n=== Plans for a carillon ===\nInitial plans for the tower as designed in 1920 included a carillon of 10 bells to be installed following the shaft's completion, with the intention of gradually increasing the number of bells to 54. Those plans were retained when an updated set of blueprints were drawn up in 1935-36. The carillon was to be played by a carillonneur/carillonist from a chamber 85 feet (26 m) above the tower base. It was then thought the initial 10-chime carillon might be installed by 1939 given sufficient funds, but it was not until 1986 that a new carillon was dedicated in honor of university chancellor Carey Bostian and his wife Neita.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter World War I, Vance Sykes, a member of the N.C. State Class of 1907, wrote to college alumni secretary E.B. Owen concerning the building of a monument to honor N.C. State alumni who had been killed in the conflict. This was credited with inspiring a movement within the college community toward the monument's planning and construction.  A five-person Memorial Committee was soon formed, headed by Carroll Lamb Mann (1877-1961), a graduate of the Class of 1899 and a professor of civil engineering, with E. B. Owen as secretary and treasurer. At a meeting of the N.C. State College Alumni Association of New York on October 3, 1919, a resolution was proposed and passed \"that the N.C. State College Alumni Association of New York...suggest as a suitable memorial a clock tower permanently placed, thus obviating the blowing of the 'whistle' on the campus, [with] the clock to have a good loud striking bell and chimes, if the expense is not too great.\" The Memorial Committee considered dozens of proposals before selecting that of the New York alumni chapter.On March 22, 1920, the Memorial Committee unanimously resolved to raise $30,000 ($289,000 in 2018 values) to erect a 90-foot-tall (27 m) bell tower on the N.C. State campus as a lasting tribute to alumni \"who gave their lives in the World War.\" The committee estimated the tower would cost \"in the neighborhood of $10,000,\" ($96,500 in 2018 values) with the clock costing $2,400 and a set of chimes at around $1,500. As of May 1920, $7,000 had been pledged by college alumni toward the memorial fund, along with less than $6,000 in cash donations. William Henry Deacy of the W. W. Leland Studios in New York City was subsequently chosen as the architect. At the annual meeting of the Alumni Association following commencement in May, two of his proposed designs were presented for consideration, \"Design A,\" an 85-foot-tall (26 m) stone and brick adaptation of a colonial church spire, and \"Design B,\" a 115-foot-tall (35 m) tower in \"semi-Romanesque style with Gothic treatment of the vertical lines...it is military in character and recalls very strongly the beautiful towers at West Point.\" \"Design B\" was unanimously approved by the Alumni Association members.On November 9, 1920, Deacy visited the N.C. State campus and consulted with members of the Memorial Committee, by which time plans had been made to lay the tower foundation, with the cornerstone to be laid during the May 1922 commencement week. The final design was for a 115-foot-tall (35 m) bell tower built from local granite and holding an initial carillon of 10 bells with the intention of eventually having a 54-chime carillon. After careful consideration, including soliciting inputs from faculty members and J.P. Pillsbury, the college landscape architect, a site for the tower was chosen to the west of Holladay Hall, \"on the summit of the hill immediately east and on the axis of Pullen Hall.\"The tower foundation, with a final area of 48 square feet, was completed by the May 1921 commencement, with the addition of steps on each side of the base increasing the dimensions of the base to 62 square feet. On May 30, 1921, the Alumni Association decided to build the first section of the tower to a height of 18 feet (5.5 m), with subsequent construction based on the availability of funds. Ultimately, the Memorial Committee decided to build that year to the water table, a height of about 14 feet (4.3 m).  Though just over $19,000 in pledges had been received by then, with $8,000 collected, estimated project costs for completing the tower had risen to $75,000 ($849,000 in 2018 values). The cornerstone of the Memorial Belltower was laid on November 10, 1921 with Masonic rites conducted by the Grand Lodge of North Carolina. Oliver Max Gardner, a former lieutenant governor and future Governor of North Carolina, gave the formal address dedicating the memorial, with over 3,000 college students and alumni in attendance. The first section of the Belltower was completed the following month by the J.D. Sargent Granite Company of Mount Airy, North Carolina, at a cost of $13,900 ($157,000 in 2018 values).Following the completion of the tower foundation and base, construction stopped for over two years, though fundraising efforts continued. On March 6, 1924, with committee chairman Mann presiding, the Memorial Committee convened to discuss erecting the tower's second section, which would add a further 10 feet (3.0 m) in height. Despite some debate over whether to substitute cheaper Indiana limestone for granite, the committee unanimously voted to continue building the tower with Mount Airy granite, which Deacy also fully endorsed. Construction of the second tower section began in June, and was completed by September 1924.By early 1926, the Memorial Committee was able to build a further 10-foot  (3.0 m) section of the tower, with construction entrusted to the J.E. Beaman Construction Company of Raleigh. Graduating classes continued to make pledges for finishing the tower project, though construction again stalled during the Great Depression. Finally, in 1934, the Memorial Committee decided to request federal funding to complete the tower, as it was feared the project would otherwise be delayed indefinitely. In October 1935, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) granted $37,000 ($543,000 in 2018 values) to finish the stonework and  complete the remaining 81 feet (25 m) of the tower shaft. In addition, fundraising efforts had generated $40,000 in pledges. Construction of the tower resumed on April 7, 1936. The stonework was finished in 1937, with student honor societies and the Class of 1938 donating the clock, followed by the Class of 1939's donation of floodlights. The tower was finally dedicated on November 11, 1949, by which time costs had reached $150,000.\n\n\n== Traditions ==\n\n\n=== Lighting ===\n\nThe Belltower is illuminated with red floodlights on Memorial Day, Veterans Day, during spring and winter commencements,  for the inauguration of the President of the University of North Carolina or for the installation of the Chancellor of NC State, and on the university's Founders Day,  an annual day of remembrance honoring university founders and deceased members of the North Carolina State University community. It is also illuminated to celebrate certain academic and athletic achievements, including induction of N.C. State faculty into a National Academy, the awarding of a Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, National Medal or Presidential Early Career Award for Science and Engineering, or the awarding of a North Carolina Award or a Governor\u2019s Award for Excellence, among other distinctions. For categories of athletic achievement, the tower is illuminated to celebrate Atlantic Coast Conference football, men\u2019s basketball, women\u2019s basketball or baseball (series win) victories, select postseason victories for football, men\u2019s basketball, women\u2019s basketball or baseball, ACC championship victories in any team sport, and for national championship victories for any team or individual sport. The tower can also be illuminated for any other celebration or commemoration at the discretion of the university chancellor.\n\n\n=== Krispy Kreme Challenge ===\n\nSince 2004, the Belltower has been the start- and endpoint for the Krispy Kreme Challenge, in which Challenge participants must run a 5 miles (8.0 km) road course leading to a Krispy Kreme Doughnuts shop, eat one dozen doughnuts, and complete the race in under 1 hour. There are also categories for casual participants, who may choose whether to eat some doughnuts or none.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The North Carolina Museum of History is a history museum located in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina. It is an affiliate through the Smithsonian Affiliations program. The museum is a part of the Division of State History Museums, Office of Archives and History, an agency of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrederick Augustus Olds, known as the \"father\" of the North Carolina Museum of History, began collecting items from across North Carolina in the late 19th century. He eventually traversed all 100 counties, at least once, and acquired not only pieces of the past but also the stories associated with them\u2014starting a philosophy that exists to this day at the museum: using stories to relate the past of North Carolina. On December 5, 1902, Olds merged his large private collection with the collection owned and displayed in a room of the State Museum (which has evolved into the modern-day North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences). The assortment of historical artifacts became known as the \"Hall of History\" and was opened to the public. The hall's 37 cases contained items as various as a studded shoe buckle owned by James Iredell to the death mask of Confederate General Robert Hoke. (To honor Olds, a metal statue has been erected on the steps of the current Museum of History building to greet visitors; he is joined by a statue of craftsman Thomas Day and a representative Sauratown woman.)\nThe North Carolina Historical Commission took over the Hall of History in 1914 and moved the collection to the Ruffin Building on the southwest corner of Union Square (where the North Carolina State Capitol sits); however, the hall quickly outgrew that space. The hall was then moved, in 1939, to the Education Building, across from the northwest corner of Union Square, where an area was specifically designed to accommodate both artifacts and exhibits. On July 1, 1965, with continued growth of the collection, need for expanded exhibit space, and an increase in staff, the Hall of History was renamed the North Carolina Museum of History and was identified to become a part of the new Archives and History/State Library Building. That move took place in 1968.On June 16, 1988, the State of North Carolina broke ground at 5 East Edenton Street to begin construction of a new, dedicated building for the museum. Located in part of the block between the State Capitol and the Legislative Building, the museum's permanent home was completed in 1994 for more than $29 million. The new building features a research library, classrooms, a 315-seat auditorium, a design shop, conservation labs, artifact storage space, offices, the Museum Shop, and 55,000 square feet (5,100 m2) of exhibit space on four floors.\n\n\n== Tar Heel Junior Historian Association ==\nOne of the North Carolina Museum of History's best known outreach programs is the Tar Heel Junior Historian Association (THJHA). THJHA inspires and empowers North Carolina students to discover local and state history\u2014in an active, hands-on way. The association also encourages junior historians to share what they learn, often through projects that are planned and completed by students. Many projects are entered into contests and shared during the THJHA Annual Convention in Raleigh. Award-winning projects often become a part of the association's gallery, History in Every Direction.\nAuthorized by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1953, THJHA is a network of free clubs across the state, with members in grades 4\u201312 and at least one adult adviser. Clubs may be sponsored by public, private, or home schools, or by other organizations such as museums and historical societies, 4-H and FFA groups, or scouting programs. Clubs can be any size, from one student and one adviser to hundreds of students and several advisers. THJHA staff at the museum provide support and resources that include a semiannual student magazine Tar Heel Junior Historian.\n\n\n== North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame ==\n\nThe North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame is housed in a 4,000 square feet (370 m2) permanent exhibit gallery on the third floor of the North Carolina Museum of History.  The hall of fame was originally established in February 1963, with support from the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce, \"celebrates excellence and extraordinary achievement in athletics [and] commemorates and memorializes exceptional accomplishments in or connected with the world of sports who have brought recognition and esteem to themselves and to the State of North Carolina.\" The hall inducted its first class of five members in December of that year and, as of 2010, numbered 274 members.\nSince the beginning, inductees, who are elected annually, have donated mementos of their sports careers to the hall of fame. In 1969 officials at the Charlotte Coliseum agreed to display these objects in the corridor of the building, hoping to eventually expand the building to include a room dedicated to the hall. The expansion never occurred, however, and in 1981 the objects were moved to the North Carolina Museum of History, where a dedicated gallery was a part of the new museum's plans.\nMementos on display in the gallery include Richard Petty's race car, Dale Earnhardt's fire suit, North Carolina State University basketball coach Jim Valvano's warm-up suit, Arnold Palmer's Ryder Cup golf bag, Meadowlark Lemon's Harlem Globetrotters basketball uniform, North Carolina State University coach Kay Yow's Olympic team basketball, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill football star Charlie \"Choo Choo\" Justice's jersey.\nBasketball great and Wilmington, North Carolina, native Michael Jordan was conspicuously missing from the hall for many years because, even though he had been selected for induction, he had been \"unable\" to attend the required induction banquet. In 2010, it was announced that Jordan would be formally inducted to the hall. Uniquely, his ceremony was held at halftime of a Charlotte Bobcats game (Jordan owns the NBA team).\n\n\n== North Carolina Museum of History Associates ==\nThe North Carolina Museum of History Associates is the membership arm of the North Carolina Museum of History. The group assists the museum primarily with daily expenses related to acquisitions, publications, and promotional efforts. As state government funds have been reduced over recent years, the importance of member support has grown\u2014in fact, membership revenue is now central to the museum's effort to maintain free programming.\nIn addition to the museum in Raleigh, the Museum of History Associates provide funding and support services to the regional museums of the Division of State History Museums:\n\nGraveyard of the Atlantic Museum, Hatteras\nMuseum of the Albemarle, Elizabeth City\nMuseum of the Cape Fear Historical Complex, Fayetteville\nMountain Gateway Museum and Heritage Center, Old Fort\nNorth Carolina Maritime Museum, locations in Beaufort and SouthportThe Associates also work throughout the state to raise awareness of the museum and its efforts by hosting Museum Days events occasionally in different locations.\n\n\n== North Carolina Museum of History Foundation ==\nThe North Carolina Museum of History Foundation raises funds that enable the Museum of History and the Division of State History Museums (an agency of the Office of Archives and History, North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources) to lead the state in preserving and interpreting the history and culture of the Tar Heel State. The Foundation primarily collects and distributes funds for ongoing efforts related to\n\nexhibitions,\neducational programming,\nartifact acquisition, and\nobject conservation.The Foundation also supports needed capital improvements and directs funds toward building an endowment for future generations. The Foundation is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization; contributions are tax deductible to the fullest extent allowed by law.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMuseum of History blog, A Place & Time and Facebook page\nMuseum of History Associates (membership)\nMuseum of History Foundation (contributions)\nNorth Carolina Department of Cultural Resources official website\nCapital Area Visitor Services",

Admission is free and the things you can see and learn are priceless. I highly recommend anyone who is curious of our states history to visit.",
          "I'm new here from the Pacific Northwest, so I don't know a lot about the history here. Going through the museum was very informative and educational for me.

          "So many things to see, probably could've left out the bricks...we know what they look like. I wish there was a couple more benches to sit for a bit, we were there for about 3 hours and my feet/back was killing me. Kids enjoyed the Indian \u2026",
          "EXTREMELY informative especially about NC history and the role the state has played in US history as well. The staff was very well versed in the institute. My wife who is not big on history THROUGHLY ENJOYED her experience. Parking was easily accessible and the Museum is very nicely equipped for handicapped like me.",
          "Although there are really nice displays, it's pretty sparse on history.  Relative to many other state history museums, this is small.  What they have is high quality and very informative.",
          "Some of the facts in the displays are disputed and others are worded with a clear bias. Overall the displays are well done and the museum has a nice flow to it. If you are just there to walk through and look at the displays and get a \u2026",

          "My wife and I learned a lot at this place. We were really not expecting it to be anything special but it really is a neat place to visit. We are not from North Carolina and had no idea how much history estate really had. They have rotating \u2026",

          "We visited the toy exhibition and it is really cool. It\u2019s amazing to think how the toys were before and some that still exist that where created in that era. Like barbie, play-doh, twister, etc... a good addition to you weekend plans in downtown",

          "Pretty nice but a few homeschool groups had some unruly children who thought it was kosher to run crazy throughout the place, slamming things around and being obnoxious as hell.

          "A terrific place for families to visit and at a bargain price (free/ donations)!",
          "This place is amazing! I can't believe that it's for free with the option to donate. I think everybody should definitely donate at least $5 when they come in to keep this building running. I came here to visit family and we spent hours \u2026",

          "The sheer breadth of the displays is awe inspiring. If you are trying to soak in all the information that are on display - I believe one day is not enough. But a quick tour is also possible to move in a out of the rooms of exhibits. Breadth wise the museum covers from the",

          "The museum is free and the exhibits are typically very good. Go during a special event if possible. It has great information about NC. Don't compare it to the Smithsonians or you will be disappointed, but it holds it own for the city of Raleigh. Worth the visit.",
          "I enjoyed learning about the history of the state, the various displays as well as the dioramas depicting life in NC and the wars that NC citizens were deployed to. I especially liked the pencil sketches made by soldiers, which were very good.",
          "Well done exhibitions of North Carolina through the centuries. I especially enjoyed learning more about tobacco farming and textile mills. We love history and visit many museums, so for us, we've seen some of what was presented elsewhere. Definitely well worth a visit while in",
          "Take a couple hours out of your life just to come here and re-familiarize yourself or familiarize your kids with some local history. I'm from NY, and there's a lot I heard during my visit a couple weeks ago. It may not be anything I'll necessarily need to know later on in life",
          "My husband and I spent several hours at the History Museum it was our second visit after about 12 years. We have visited many State Museums and feel NC and Minnesota are at the top of our list. And to think this museum is free, I hope all NC residents appreciate what they",

          "Admission is free, although there are donations boxes are around the museum. I had a pleasant experience being from Texas I saw some history on North Carolina that i hadn\u2019t known much about. I will say that in my opinion they try to twist some of the history to NC\u2019s benefit",
          "I like when the museums are free of charge (donations are welcomed). It is very interactive and informative. For any age! Also, check the museum store - it has some cool stuff. They had World War I exhibition on the second floor - it was great. As a history nerd, I preferred",

          "This museum covers every part of North Carolina's history. There's a ton of exhibits to go through. The exhibit for sports history was a little disappointing but overall everything else was great. They even have an exhibit for small children. The gift shop here isn't as good",
          "I was very surprised at the quality of this museum. It is not really advertised or even mentioned at the top of the list of places to visit in Raleigh. But I spent 3 hours visiting it and truly enjoyed myself. I won\u2019t comment on the famous drugstore or on the really",

          "Really. I think we would all be willing to pay. I didn't grow up here, so it was a good overview of NC history on the main floor. Upstairs has several exhibits. We had all age groups with us that day. This was a perfect stop. You didn't feel guilty for a short stay, but you",

          "The highlight of the museum is the WWI wing, which contains a number of exhibits that not only tell you about North Carolina's (and the U.S.'s) involvement in WWI, but actually give a bit of a feel of trench warfare. WWI usually doesn't get much attention in museums, so this is",
          "Another free to the public museum not to be missed. Teenagers finished ahead of us and no complaints about the boring history. The curators get props for making the displays vibrant, interesting and easy to digest, helpful representation of women and people of color. Excellent",
          "Had a few hours to kill in downtown Raleigh so thought I'd try this FREE museum--- what did I have to lose??? I have to admit I do not have a huge attention span and history is not my favorite subject but this quaint museum captured my attention for 2.5 hours! I learned so much",
          "The NC History museum is a must see during your time in Raleigh. If you love history this is the place to go. I was amazed at the Drug store exhibit and Carbine Williams work shop. The WWI exhibit was great as well. Not only do you learn about NC history there is an overlap",
          "Great visit as always.......loved the World War 1 exhibit ...and an incredible staff....a must see for sure!",

          "Having worked at the British Museum in London, one of the most amazing museums in the world, of course it takes me a lot to be impressed with other history museums. Although the one in NC is nowhere near the BM, it is definitely worth visiting as it plays an important part in",

          "Again, we visited the History Museum on the same day as the Science Museum and it was fantastic! So much to see and do. A great atmosphere and friendly folks who were knowledgeable about answering any questions. Great way to spend a day!",

          "Excellent museum - lots of fun things to learn, touch, see as well as do! Find out something new! There's also a great courtyard just outside of it where you can sit and chat about what you've seen while you eat something - perhaps you'll grab a bite from a nearby food cart!",
          "In the heart of Raleigh, the NC History museum is a nice way to while away an hour or so, however it is not a singular destination. Go if you are spending time downtown doing other things but if you go just for this you will be disappointed.",
          "I LOVE history, but unless you catch a great traveling exhibit, this museum is a bit lame. We much prefer going next door to the Science Museum. There just wasn't much in the way of interesting stuff.",
          "This is my second time visiting this museum, and just as impressed as the first time. Everything is done so well and thoughtfully. Variety of displays - something for everyone, and that they bring in new exhibits regularly ... We are so lucky to have this resource - may it",
          "Haven't been here in years. I don't know why because the place is awesome! I really enjoyed the exhibits and they had one area about WWI. Amazing and very educational. NC is my adopted state and I learned a lot about NC history. I'll make sure to visit more often in the future.",

          "This is a fantastic museum covering the full history of North Carolina from slavery to the Wright brothers and so much more. A great deal of the exhibits are hands on and interactive. They are as professional and high quality as I have ever seen. It's a must do if you have some",

          "The interactive display is in man made trenches with real sandbags and barbed wire on the top. See a German pillbox. The German machine gunners within had body armor. There is an area of battle sounds that might be a little scary for small children. See and handle some real",
          "I chose the title of the review because special exhibits come and go, but the care and quality of presentation was outstanding everywhere. All those involved in creating them should be rightly proud. The first floor history was an eye-opener - for someone who grew up and lived",
          "Unfortunately, we only had a small window of opportunity to visit here to see some of the exhibits. However, we thought what little we saw demanded a return visit in the future. Considering the State Capitol building and other sites are within walking distance only encouraged us",
          "We were fortunate to be able to visit the museum during a private evening event while in town for a conference. The museum's exhibits do an appreciable job of telling the true history of the state - even the ugly chapters. Looking forward to returning for a visit with the kids.",
          "Worth the trip. Beautiful place with outstanding demonstration of history for all of us. A great restaurant inside as well. We will be back as so much to learn.",
          "The building is deceiving. The museum is really only one floor. The first floor is the gift shop and a theater, second floor is offices, and the third floor is really the only floor with anything. Everything is about North Carolina's history and there is a sports section, civil",
          "As a fourth grade teacher who teaches North Carolina history, I was particularly captivated by the way this museum was arranged. There is so much to see and the exhibits are well done. Plan on spending a great deal of time in this place.",

          "GAH! What can I say? Im a NC museum LOVER, and the History museum is no exception. They delicately tap into the racial divide of Nc which is important. Museums cant be all white washed. They have a great exhibit about the selma march, and about slavery as well as our history",
          "Our family lived in Charlotte for 10 years and I didn't even know this museum existed and can't believe our kids didn't visit for a field trip. We moved away and came back to Greensboro 10 years later and I read about this in Our State magazine. Excellent history of North",
          "We met a guard who directed us to all the interesting exhibits and told us some of the history of the museum. It made it even more enjoyable to hear the local stories about the drug store exhibit especially. Well worth a visit and it's free.",
          "Across the courtyard from the Museum of Natural Sciences this is also a gem. The temporary display when we visited was WWI. That was my grandfathers war and it brought back memories of him and stories he told. A great stop for anyone interested in our history.",
          "After having lived in Wake Forest for 16 years, it took moving to Florida and returning to NC for vacation to finally visit the museum that was practically in our backyard all those years! Plenty of interesting NC historical exhibits to see. Come to learn the history of your",

          "It is free. Plus, the exhibits give you not only the history timeline, but all of the other parts of history. Economics, social life, accomplishments of natives are intertwined with the timeline. Do not skip the special exhibits on the third floor as they really fill out the",

          "Best advice for the Museum of History: don't try to cram it in last minute like we did. It deserves at least a half day of its own. This was so impressive with its walk-through timeline of North Carolina history, from early Native American dwelling replicas through the",
          "It was pretty cool, they had some gift shops but they didn't really have any gifts that tied into the Museum. I was a little let down to be honest. Maybe if they expanded more and had better gifts to choose from.",

          "It's an average museum but they really good specialty exhibits. There's great attention to detail and accuracy.",
          "NC's history isn't pretty. The museum tries very hard to balance the fine line about how much they want to divulge without making the state look bad. Treatment of Native Americans is addressed, but only briefly. Slavery is addressed, but pulls back from showing the atrocities",

          "We went to see the Hugh Morton's North Carolina Photography Exhibit. Very good exhibit with great photography of our state. You will also want to see the remainder of the exhibits. Well worth a trip or stop over in Raleigh.",
          "Even if your interest in history is minimal, you need to go here. Alot to absorb in a very honest forth right offering. You could spend hours here but, it gets somewhat overwhelming. If you do nothing else while in Raleigh, stop here, then head to the Natural Science museum",

          "One of the best museums I have ever visited. On top of that, it is for free. I am a bit biased. Because I come from Europe, I found the history 'lesson' very entertaining and new. I think the exposition is very well done, flows nicely and also I would say that everything",
          "The museum is PACKED with history from the state. Laid out well - but after all - it's history - it's linear. Brought in all of the factors that make the state what it is today - Indians, Explorers, Slaves, Jim Crow laws, Carpet Baggers, etc. The good - the bad. Most of it",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Historic Oak View, also known as the Williams-Wyatt-Poole Farm, is a 19th-century historic farmstead and national historic district located east of downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, United States. Oak View features an early 19th-century kitchen, 1855 farmhouse, livestock barn, cotton gin barn, and tenant house dating to the early 20th century.  The Farm History Center located on site provides information to visitors regarding the history of the Oak View  and the general history of farming in North Carolina.  Aside from the historic buildings, the site also features an orchard, a honey bee hive, a small cotton field, and the largest pecan grove in Wake County.\n\n\n== History ==\nHistoric Oak View traces its history to a land purchase by Benton Southworth Donaldson Williams in eastern Wake County in 1829.  This land was purchased from Arthur Pool for $135 and included 85 acres with several outbuildings none of which remain today. Williams continued to acquire land and holdings over the next 30 years; eventually including the land that houses Oak View's oldest building, the kitchen. In 1855, Williams completed construction of a two-story Greek Revival I house which would become the centerpiece of Oak View farm for the next century.At its pre-Civil War height in 1860, the Williams family owned 10 slaves and produced 27 bales of Cotton per year.  Cotton was considered \"King\" of the South leading up to the Civil War, and even afterwards many farmers including the Williams greatly increased their cotton production.  By the 1880s, 93 percent of Wake County farms, including Oak View, produced cotton with the Williams family growing 82 bales of cotton a year. Following the Civil War, Williams was selected to be one of the four delegates representing Wake County at the 1868 North Carolina Constitutional Convention.  His long-held Unionist views made him few friends in Raleigh during the Civil War, but his close association with Governor Holden ensured his place in deciding North Carolina's future through the Reconstruction. Of the four Wake County delegates' homes, only Oak View has survived.Following Williams' death in 1870, he willed that his land be divided among his children and wife, Burchett. This land remained in Burchett's hands until she died in 1886.  The land, house, and outbuildings were sold at auction to Job P. Wyatt whose family operated the farm for nearly sixty years. Many of the current outbuildings at Oak View were built during the Wyatt ownership including the cotton gin house, livestock barn, and the carriage house.While the Wyatt family owned Oak View, they generally hired a manager to oversee the day-to-day operations. Unlike much of the South which utilized Sharecroppers to farm their land, the Wyatts' property manager lived in the main house and oversaw the tenant farmers who grew both the Wyatt's crops and their own for a wage. While the tenant families sometimes stayed for as little as a year, Oak View continued to have tenant farmers living in small houses on the property until the 1980s.  Despite the farm's success under the Williams family, the Wyatt family rarely made a profit off the farm, \"At the close of each year, (they) would pore over the books to determine whether they could continue operation.\"  Instead, the Wyatt family began using Oak View as a testing ground for their seed company that was based in Raleigh, North Carolina.  This caused them to transition away from predominately growing cotton to growing vegetables and pecans.  The pecan orchard that the Wyatt family planted continues to produce a crop every year and is the largest remaining grove in Wake County.\nEventually, the Wyatt family traded the struggling Oak View to the Gregory-Poole family for a downtown office to help the Wyatt-Quarles Seed Company.   Soon after the trade, James Gregory Poole moved into the farmhouse with his family.  Even though the Pooles only lived at Oak View for three years, they greatly remodeled and updated the property.  Their improvements included building an addition to the house, putting running water in the buildings, and electrifying the property for the first time.  Following their many additions, the Poole family sold the property to James and Mary Bryan in 1944.  The Poole additions were the last major changes to the historic buildings and the property passed in and out of several families' hands before being purchased by Wake County in 1984.  Originally intending to destroy the buildings to build an office park, several local prominent families and descendants banded together to save the property.  In 1991, Historic Oak View was added to the National Register of Historic Places and Oak View was soon turned into a Wake County park.\n\n\n== Current Use ==\n\nThe Wake County Parks, Recreation and Open Space Division was given management of Oak View in 1995, creating the first historic site in the Wake County park system. With the completion of a Farm History Center in 1997, Oak View began to focus on teaching about North Carolina's agricultural history from colonial times to the present. Recently, a historic tenant house has been moved on site at Oak View Historic Park to begin interpretation into the lives of those who lived and worked on the Oak View land.  Today, more than 100,000 visitors come to Oak View each year to learn about North Carolina's agricultural past through programs, events and exhibits.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistoric Oak View County Park",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Pope House Museum, built in 1901, is a restored home once owned by Dr. M. T. Pope, a prominent African-American citizen of Raleigh, North Carolina. The Pope House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999, It was an official project of the Save America\u2019s Treasures Program and the city of Raleigh took over management of it, offering tours for the first time.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince the early 19th century, the area where the Pope House is located has gone through many transformations. When the original governor\u2019s mansion was built at the end of Fayetteville Street on the site of the present Memorial Auditorium, it was thought that fashionable residences would be built nearby. Although a few substantial homes were constructed by white families, when Reverend Henry Martin Tupper moved Shaw University to the neighborhood in 1870, many new African-American residents drawn to Raleigh after the Civil War settled in the area. Pope attended Leonard Medical Center at Shaw University before beginning his medical practice.\n\nBlack professionals began to build homes in the area known as the Third Ward, which included the 500 block of South Wilmington Street. In 1901, Pope decided to build his house in this area. Pope\u2019s neighbors included other prominent African Americans, including another doctor and a pharmacist. His home was located near his office on East Hargett Street, which at the time was the heart of the black business district.Pope installed the latest technology in his home, including combination gas and electric fixtures, a kitchen with running water, a full bathroom on the second floor, coal burning heating stoves, and a telephone. He also installed a call bell system, with buttons in each room and an annunciator in the back hall. Pope began to see patients in the house during the 1920s and 1930s, when his health began to fail. The small area at the rear of the back hall, adjacent to the kitchen, was configured to include a small hand sink and built-in cabinet for instruments.\nAfter Pope married Delia Haywood Phillips in 1907, the couple added a garage and wired the home for electricity. In the 1920s, the original front porch was removed, and the current sleeping porch constructed on brick piers. In the 1940s, the northern half of the first floor space below the porch was enclosed with brick, as it remains today. They eventually had two children, Evelyn and Ruth. After the deaths of their parents, Evelyn and Ruth maintained the family home, though they lived in Durham and Chapel Hill respectively.\nAlthough the Pope House remains in the neighborhood, the area around it has dramatically changed. Older homes and businesses were replaced with office buildings, parking lots and newer homes. The most evident change was the construction of the Raleigh Convention Center directly across the street from the house. Today, the house is in the shadows of skyscrapers that were built in the 1980s and 1990s.\nThe Pope House was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 22, 1999.  The following month the trustees of the Pope Charitable Foundation decided to begin the process of turning the house into a museum. One month later, The Pope House Museum Foundation was incorporated as a non-profit organization. The extensive family papers were sorted and catalogued, and donated to the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 2011 due to financial concerns, the Pope House Museum approached the city of Raleigh about purchasing the Pope House Museum to ensure its survival.  Since the purchase, the Pope House Museum has been managed by Raleigh Parks and Recreation which has opened the Pope House Museum for regular tours for the first time.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in North Carolina\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKenneth Joel Zogry (2008).

        "wiki": "The Moore Square Historic District is a registered historic district located in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, the district is centered on Moore Square, one of two surviving four-acre (1.6 hm) parks from Raleigh's original 1792 plan. The park is named after Alfred Moore, a North Carolina judge who became an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. Originally a residential neighborhood, Moore Square developed into a primary commercial hub in the city throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The district includes East Hargett Street, once known as Raleigh's \"Black Main Street\", because it once contained the largest number of businesses owned by African-Americans in the city. City Market, Marbles Kids Museum/IMAX theatre, Pope House Museum, Artspace, and the Long View Center are located in the Moore Square district. Events that take place in Moore Square include the Raleigh Arts Festival, Artsplosure, Movies in the Park, the Street Painting Festival, and the Moore Square Farmer's Market   The approximate district boundaries include Person, Morgan, Wilmington, and Davie Streets.In addition to its national listing, Moore Square is one of six local historic overlay districts (HOD) in Raleigh.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Registered Historic Places in North Carolina\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Moore Square Historic District at Wikimedia Commons\nMoore Square Art District\nCity Market\nMap of Moore Square Historic District\nNational Register Historic Districts in Raleigh, North Carolina, RHDC\nMoore Square Historic Overlay District, RHDC\nMoore Square National Register of Historic Places form, North Carolina SHPO",

          "Moore Square is a Historic District in Downtown Raleigh. There are festivals held at various times a year. There are also numerous restaurants and attractions nearby from Marbles to the IMAX. The main bus terminal is also in the area if you need to make a connection. Yes, there",
          "Moore Square is great when there is a heavily populated festival. As much as it pains my soul to say this, its the less fortunate population that resides there and it makes for an unsavory experience. There is a church across the way, that allows homeless to sleep on the stoop,",
          "We were walking around Raleigh for something to do and saw a lot of tents and things going on over in this little park like setting so we went over to see what was going on and they were having a vegan and animal rights outing of some sort through out the whole park, it was",
          "It's an acorn... for Raleigh... the city of oaks!! lol It's used to mimic the ball drop in NYC. Bless their hearts!! Hope you make it soon!!",
          "It is a nice place for downtown. Many office buildings. A nice change to have something like this downtown.A nice change of scenery.",
          "Lots of stuff to do around here but there's really not much to do except hang around the other cool stuff nearby (and pen your car).",
          "No need to visit this high crime area park unless there is a festival. The government holds various festivals in this city block and you can judge each on its merits. There were once four such squares. One became the governor's mansion. Another is half Raleigh government parking",
          "I don\u2019t want the title of the review to make you not go to Moore Square if you are in downtown, it is a beautiful place to visit and walk through. That being said, the City of Raleigh over the years has done a great job of cleaning up the park and making a huge police presence",
          "There's a lot of really cool stuff to do around Moore Square, but Moore Square itself wasn't anything particularly special.",
          "We had plans to meet up with someone driving through Raleigh for a short while. I had visions of a take out picnic lunch from one of local restaurants in a vibrant park, or patio dining. I paid $5 to park (?) then, as my son and I walked our dog around waiting for our friend,",
          "We had a perfect day to wander around, check out the military cannons, and enjoy the city. Great place to be. So glad the city doesn't roll up the sidewalks on the weekend.",
          "Moore square has become a place to go in Raleigh. It has the childrens' museum, Imax Theater and much of the art scene. It also has some really good restaurants.",
          "Moore Square is a great location when attending an event. Lots of parking and near city market and a number of restaurants and bars. When there isn't an event, it is filled with homeless people and you want to avoid it.",
          "We are in the area a lot..... We find that there is always at least one person who should be needing some help in the area. Our granddaughter attended school down in that area for two years and it made us very nervous when she had to be there in the evenings. We loved it when",
          "...I think City Market could be a lot more successful if only Moore Square wasn't in such a sad state. I get that the homeless are there because of the bus station and soup kitchens...and I certainly don't know where else they can go. What I do know is that I absolutely will",
          "this sad area is a place where homeless sleep on the park benches. there is nothing remotely attractive about this place. i hate how there is so much money dumped into revamping Raleigh's downtown but this area and the square in front of the Tir Na Nog are squalid and barren.",
          "I don't see how this is listed as an attraction. It's a park for the homeless and is across from the soup kitchen at the Salavation Army. Most of downtown Raleigh is a moribound abandoned area that longs for the \"good old days\" when it was the center of commerce. The city",
          "I try to avoid Moore square. It is where the homeless hang out. Nowever I do enjoy going there when I have something to give away, and I know the homeless will take whatever I have. I do like being able to help them out. but to just go hang out at the park, no. Occationally",
          "This open space is a good place for a picnic if you are visiting other attractions downtown, but there are so many amazing reasonably priced restaurants I'd try first. Events held on the square (like the All About Beer's Raleigh Beer Festival) are fun, but the park itself is",
          "Moore Square has a lot of good stuff around it including some great restaurants and Marbles Kids Museum. However, it is also one of the main locations for Raleigh's homeless. I have been to Moore Square several times and have never felt unsafe and have never been accosted in any",
          "Not worth a trip unless they have an event. Yes it is sketchy and a lot of homeless hang out near here. If you are a traveler the only thing here of interest is the giant acorn - otherwise you don't need to go here.",
          "It is a classic Raleigh landmark but be careful. There are a lot rough folks in this area. The only time I have felt comfortable at Moore Square is during events there when they have loads of Police presence. When I go to one of the surrounding venues or businesses I try to",
          "A find Moore square to be a little sketchy where they don't have an event there. There are places that do food handouts on one side of the square, so the square is usually full of people who are facing desperate times. I wish them well, but it does not make for an inviting",
          "This is a feeding ground for the homeless by the churches and people who do not live in the area. One of the favorites is chicken and the homeless just toss their bones everywhere causing a choking hazard for dogs.",
          "but not much to do here except maybe rest your feet a bit",
          "Rescue mission or church or something feeds the homeless, it gets pretty bad. Many of the homeless could use the help, some can be confrontational and a bit entitled, but the place is packed with homeless on the days that the churches put out food and sunsequently lots of litter",
          "Depending on my mood, I can find something to suit my taste almost every time",
          "Beautiful place... but be careful. The bulk of my time in this area was honestly to do mission work for the homeless.",
          "Moore Square, one of Raleigh's original squares, could be a lovely area. Instead, our spineless city government (this means you, former Mayor Charles Meeker) handed it over to the local bum population. The situation's not helped by a homeless shelter directly across the street.",
          "Sketchy area unless there is an event. If you want to visit the city market (across the street) it is nice. This is one of the very few areas of downtown Raleigh we just pass by.",
          "Moore Square is a regular destination for us, with and without 'out-of-town' visitors. We cruise ArtSpace, dine and listen to music in TirNaNog, enjoy various events (especially FirstFriday), shop/cafe in the historic cobbled streets of City Market, enjoy sidewalk music and",
          "We've been going to MOORE SQUARE for years, whether it be for concerts, events, craft fairs, local vendors, etc. and it's a great place to relax and take in the city. It's in walking distance from Woody's City Market, tons of restaurants, downtown Raleigh, museums, the bus"

        "wiki": "The Warehouse District is a major downtown district in Raleigh, North Carolina, The Warehouse District is a growing arts, restaurant, nightlife, and entrepreneurial district located three blocks west of the Raleigh Convention Center. The district consists of six blocks of spacious red-brick buildings, most of which are re-purposed warehouses, factories and depots.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Warehouse District was built initially as an industrial zone due to its proximity to the rail lines several blocks West of downtown Raleigh. The warehouse, depot, and factory buildings fell out of use in the mid 1950s. Many of the buildings were in a state of disrepair by the late 1970s and early 1980s when artists, designers, and performers began making use of the spaces again, including a young David Sedaris. By the late 1980s much of the district had found use as galleries, studio space, poetry reading space, and woodworking shop. Nightlife venues came to the district in the form of The Berkley and the Capital Coral, Culture Club, and Fallout Shelter in the mid to late 1980s.Today the Warehouse District is home to a number of restaurants in addition to nightlife and art venues, including the legendary The Pit BBQ restaurant. The district now features several craft beer establishments including Crank Arm Brewing, Boylan Street Brewpub, Tasty beverage Company, and Brewmasters Bar & Grill.The 2010s are seeing a surge of business growth in the district, with the largest move by Citrix who will open a 550-employee division headquarters in the former Dillon Supply building in 2014. HQ Raleigh, a co-working space with 45 businesses, announced in 2013 it is moving to the Warehouse District. Local business leaders have said the district is, 'starting to create an entrepreneurial reputation.\"\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\n\n=== Eat and Drink ===\nThe Morgan Street Food Hall\nParkside Restaurant\nThe Pit\nTuscan Blu\nFive Star\nCrank Arm Brewing\nHumble Pie\nJose and Sons\nThe Flying Saucer\nThe District Raleigh\nBoylan Bridge Brewpub\nMoonlight Pizza\nFiction Kitchen\n\n\n=== Art ===\nAntfarm Studios\nDesignbox\nLitmus Gallery\nWilliam-Cozart\n311 West Martin Street Gallery & Studios (311 West Martin Street Gallery & Studios was originally opened by Bob Coster and Jason Craighead as Glance Gallery, and re-named by Tom and Judy Jones in 2007, when they repurposed the space with a number of studios for working artists, as well as a curated gallery featuring outside artists.

          "One the best children\u2019s playground we have visited. Clean, lots of options, accommodates younger and older kids. I only give it 4 stars because I wish they had more shade coverage, especially in the zip lining area. That is very important in the summer especially for young children. Great experience!",
          "Huge well maintained playground. Not ideal for small children. It's difficult to follow a child on the jungle gym when you're pushing another in a stroller. The zipline is very popular with the kids. There are swings, 2 basketball courts, soccer and baseball fields, and a sandbox.",

          "I went with my 1 year old for the first time. It's probably not recommended for 1-2 year old children since they don't really have a lot for that age group on the playground. I say 95% of the playground is aimed towards children 3 year old or older. If you have a child under 3 I recommend you look at other parks in wake county",
          "Great place for kids the best park ive ever visited and my kids love it! They even have places for adults to play",

          "This is one of the best playgrounds I've ever been to. It is huge, has tons of diverse equipment including Zipline style sliders, and lots of climbing elements. There was also a reasonable amount of shade for parents to stand in though not too much for the kids on the playground",
          "High end, artful gourmet choices on the expensive end of the scale, of course. Very attractive decor, attentive service. If quality trumps cost, this would be a good choice.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "William B. Umstead State Park is a North Carolina state park in Wake County, North Carolina in the United States. It covers 5,599 acres (22.66 km2) nestled between the expanding cities of Raleigh, Cary, and Durham, North Carolina. It offers hiking, bridle, and bike trails, boat rentals, camping, picnic areas, and educational programs.\nPart of the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000 mile long system of trails connecting Maine to Florida, runs through the park.\n\n\n== History ==\nLong before the first settlers, the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park was an untamed land. American Bison, elk, bobcats and wolves roamed forests of oak, hickory and beech. Native Americans later inhabited the land and avenues of trade were developed nearby. Such avenues included the Occoneeche trail to the north and the Pee Dee trail to the south. In 1774, land grants opened the area for settlement.\nForests were cleared as agricultural interests sprouted. While early farming efforts were successful, poor cultivation practices and one-crop production led to depletion and erosion of the soil. During the Depression, farmers made futile attempts to grow cotton in worn-out soil around Crabtree Creek.\nIn 1934, under the Resettlement Administration, federal and state agencies united to buy 5,000 acres (20 km2) of this submarginal land to develop a recreation area. The Civilian Conservation Corps, as well as the Works Progress Administration, helped construct the site while providing much needed jobs. Four camps along with day-use and picnic facilities were built and the park opened to the public in 1937.\nThe state purchased this area, known as Crabtree Creek Recreational Demonstration Area, for $1, and more facilities were built as the General Assembly made its first state parks division appropriation in the 1940s. In 1950, more than 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) of the park were established as a separate park for African-Americans. This area was named Reedy Creek State Park. Crabtree Creek Recreational Demonstration Area was renamed a few years later after former Governor William Bradley Umstead because of his conservation efforts. In 1966, the Crabtree Creek and Reedy Creek areas were united under the same name; William B. Umstead State Park was open to everyone.\nPrior to the purchase of the land for public use, it had historically been used for timberland, as well as a site for several mills along Crabtree Creek. Remnants of milling operations can still be found preserved within the park.\nDuring segregation, the Highway 70 entrance was for whites and the Reedy Creek entrance for blacks. Currently, the Reedy Creek entrance is the main entrance to the park for North Carolina State University. Forestry courses use this entrance to examine the trees native to the park. Additionally, many Raleigh runners use this more private entrance to run in an area of the park that is less frequented by tourist and hiking groups. The only real remnant of this segregation of entrances is the lack of a public road that connects both entrances - vehicles that access the park by one entrance cannot go through the park to the other side.\n\n\n== Information ==\nUmstead is bordered by Raleigh-Durham International Airport on the west, Interstate 40 on the south, US 70 on the north, and by the western outskirts of Raleigh on the east.  The main bridle and bike trail is Reedy Creek Road, which is open to traffic in western Raleigh (connecting the North Carolina Museum of Art to the park entrance), closed except to rangers' vehicles as it crosses the park from east to west (a distance of 3.5 miles), and then heads south into Cary where it becomes open to traffic again.  At the edge of the park it connects to Black Creek Greenway and the Lake Crabtree County Park trails.  Crabtree Creek also flows across Umstead; its source is Lake Crabtree right at the park's edge, and it flows eastward throughout much of the southern part of the park (with trails in varying degrees of maintenance along its length) and then crosses Reedy Creek Road to flow north.  The main entrances are the two ends of Reedy Creek Road, two entrances off of Ebenezer Church Road in Raleigh near where Crabtree Creek leaves the park, the official Reedy Creek entrance at the end of Cary's Harrison Avenue, and the park's main entrance at Highway 70 in the north.  The latter are equipped with parking lots, bathrooms, and campgrounds; at the Highway 70 entrance there is also a visitors' center and a campground.  Other important bike and bridle trails include Graylyn Road, connecting the Ebenezer Church entrance to Reedy Creek Road, and Turkey Creek Road, which winds through the northern part of the park; hiking trails include the Company Mill trail in the south and the Sycamore Trail in the north, both of which are loops of moderate difficulty, as well as many others.  Bikes and horses are prohibited on hiking trails.\nUmstead is part of the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion.  The topography is hilly, and it has several artificial lakes (which are very common in Wake County, partially due to a flood control plan implemented over the last half-century).\n\n\n== Piedmont Beech Natural Area ==\nIs a 61-acre (0.25 km2) National Natural Landmark located inside the park, which protects a mixed mesophytic forest and maturing stands of beech trees.  The natural area was designated in 1974.  Access to the area is allowed only by special permit.\n\n\n== Nearby state parks ==\nThe following state parks are within 30 miles (48 km) of Umstead State Park:\n\nEno River State Park (Durham County)\nFalls Lake State Recreation Area\nJordan Lake State Recreation Area\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of National Natural Landmarks in North Carolina\nList of Registered Historic Places in North Carolina\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nCrabtree Creek Recreational Demonstration Area (National Park Service)\nNational Register Historic Districts in Raleigh, North Carolina, RHDC\nCrabtree Creek Recreation Area, RHDC",

          "Went with my wife for Kayaking fun and it was very pleasant, enjoyable, and inexpensive to do. The lake was quiet and we had it pretty much all to ourselves. But my one suggestion is that if you're not in shape skip this activity. It works the arms, shoulders, and in general",
          "We have gone to this park several times over the last couple of weeks. There are a lot of trails and the park is quite large. There are two or three lakes to fish in and also some campgrounds and cabins that you can rent. It's very nice. We love that there's so much green space",

        "wiki": "Hemlock Bluffs Nature Preserve is a joint project between the North Carolina state park system and the Town of Cary in Wake County, North Carolina in the United States.  Located in Cary, it covers approximately 140-acre (0.57 km2) in the Research Triangle region of the state.  The state owns 97-acre (0.39 km2) of the preserve, known as Hemlock Bluffs State Natural Area.  The Town of Cary owns approximately 42-acre (0.17 km2) of the preserve, and the town leases the state's land for management.  The preserve protects a population of Eastern Hemlock trees and other vegetation more typically found further west, in the Appalachian Mountains.  The tall, north-facing bluffs of Swift Creek provide conditions similar enough to the mountains to have allowed the plant communities to have survived there since the last ice age.The Stevens Nature Center is a nature center located on Cary's portion of the preserve, which provides the preserve's core visitor facilities. It provides information about the natural history of the area and the plants and animals that live in the Nature Preserve.The preserve has approximately 3 miles of mulched hiking trails.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFriends of Hemlock Bluffs\nHemlock Bluffs Nature Preserve Trail Map\nHemlock Bluffs Nature Preserve\nStevens Nature Center\nHarold D.

        "wiki": "Raleigh (; RAH-lee) is the capital of the state of North Carolina and the seat of Wake County in the United States. Raleigh is the second-largest city in the state, after Charlotte. Raleigh is known as the \"City of Oaks\" for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city. The city covers a land area of 142.8 square miles (370 km2). The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population as 474,069 as of July 1, 2019. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The city of Raleigh is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the lost Roanoke Colony in present-day Dare County.\nRaleigh is home to North Carolina State University (NCSU) and is part of Research Triangle Park (RTP), together with Durham (home of Duke University and North Carolina Central University) and Chapel Hill (home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The \"Triangle\" nickname originated after the 1959 creation of the Research Triangle Park, located in Durham and Wake counties, among the three cities and their universities. The  Research Triangle region  encompasses the U.S. Census Bureau's Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which had an estimated population of 2,037,430 in 2013. The Raleigh metropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 1,214,516 in 2013.\nMost of Raleigh is located within Wake County, with a very small portion extending into Durham County. The towns of Cary, Morrisville, Garner, Clayton, Wake Forest, Apex, Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina, Knightdale, Wendell, Zebulon, and Rolesville are some of Raleigh's primary nearby suburbs and satellite towns.\nRaleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city. Following the American Revolutionary War when the US gained independence, this was chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol in Union Square at the center. During the American Civil War, the city was spared from any significant battle. It fell to the Union in the closing days of the war, and struggled with the economic hardships in the postwar period related to the reconstitution of labor markets, over-reliance on agriculture, and the social unrest of the Reconstruction Era. Following the establishment of the Research Triangle Park (RTP) in 1959, several tens of thousands of jobs were created in the fields of science and technology, and it became one of the fastest-growing communities in the United States by the early 21st century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Earlier capitals ===\nBath, the oldest town in North Carolina, was the first nominal capital of the colony from 1705 until 1722, when Edenton took over the role. The colony had no permanent institutions of government until the new capital, New Bern, was established in 1743.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nIn December 1770, Joel Lane successfully petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to create a new county. On January 5, 1771, the bill creating Wake County was passed in the General Assembly. The county was formed from portions of Cumberland, Orange, and Johnston counties. The county was named for Margaret Wake Tryon, the wife of Governor William Tryon. The first county seat was Bloomsbury.\nNew Bern, a port town on the Neuse River 35 miles (56 km) from the Atlantic Ocean, was the largest city and the capital of North Carolina during the American Revolution. When the British Army laid siege to the city, that site could no longer be used as capital. From 1789 to 1794, when Raleigh was being built, the state capital was Fayetteville.\nRaleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital in 1788, as its central location protected it from attacks from the coast. It was officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital (incorporated on December 31, 1792 \u2013 charter granted January 21, 1795). The city was named for Sir Walter Raleigh, sponsor of Roanoke, the \"lost colony\" on Roanoke Island.The city's location was chosen, in part, for being within 11 mi (18 km) from Isaac Hunter's Tavern, a popular tavern frequented by the state legislators. No known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site. Raleigh is one of the few cities in the United States that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital. Its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of North, East, West and South. The plan, a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner, was based on Thomas Holme's 1682 plan for Philadelphia.The North Carolina General Assembly first met in Raleigh in December 1794, and granted the city a charter, with a board of seven appointed commissioners and an \"Intendant of Police\" (which developed as the office of Mayor) to govern it. (After 1803 city commissioners were elected.) In 1799, the N.C. Minerva and Raleigh Advertiser was the first newspaper published in Raleigh. John Haywood was the first Intendant of Police.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn 1808, Andrew Johnson, the nation's future 17th President, was born at Casso's Inn in Raleigh. The city's first water supply network was completed in 1818, although due to system failures, the project was abandoned. In 1819 Raleigh's first volunteer fire company was founded, followed in 1821 by a full-time fire company.\nIn 1817, the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina was established and headquartered in Raleigh.\nIn 1831, a fire destroyed the North Carolina State House. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried gneiss being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completions of the new State Capitol and new Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company in 1840.\nIn 1853, the first State Fair was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, Peace College, was established in 1857. Raleigh's Historic Oakwood contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition.\nNorth Carolina seceded from the Union. After the Civil War began, Governor Zebulon Baird Vance ordered the construction of breastworks around the city as protection from Union troops. During General Sherman's Carolinas Campaign, Raleigh was captured by Union cavalry under the command of General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick on April 13, 1865. As the Confederate cavalry retreated west, the Union soldiers followed, leading to the nearby Battle of Morrisville. The city was spared significant destruction during the War.\nDue to the economic and social problems of the post-war period and Reconstruction, with a state economy still overly based on agriculture, it grew little over the next several decades.\n\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, African Americans were emancipated. The Reconstruction era legislature established public education for blacks and whites. Freedmen were often led by free blacks who had become educated before the war. With the help of the Freedmen's Bureau, many freedmen migrated from rural areas to Raleigh. It had an established free black community, more work opportunities, and many freedmen wanted to get out from under white supervision in the rural areas.\nShaw University, the South's first African American college, began classes in 1865 and was chartered in 1875. Its Estey Hall was the first building constructed for the higher education of black women, and Leonard Medical Center was the first four-year medical school in the country for African Americans.\nIn 1867, Episcopal clergy founded St. Augustine's College for the education of freedmen. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the nation's first school for blind and deaf blacks, to be located in Raleigh. In 1874, the federal government constructed the Federal Building in Raleigh, the first federal government project in the South following the Civil War.\nIn 1880, the newspapers News and Observer combined to form The News & Observer. It continues to be Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, was founded as a land-grant college in 1887. The city's Rex Hospital opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as Meredith College, opened in 1891, and in 1898, The Academy of Music, a private music conservatory, was established.\nIn the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and allies were unsuccessful. Based on a white supremacy campaign that returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote also disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office\u2014local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive in the state.\nIt was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. By that time many African Americans had left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for more opportunities. No African American was elected to Congress from North Carolina until 1992.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1912, Bloomsbury Park opened, featuring a popular carousel ride. Relocated to Pullen Park, the Pullen Park Carousel is still operating.\nFrom 1914 to 1917, an influenza epidemic killed 288 Raleighites.In 1922, WLAC signed on as the city's first radio station, but lasted only two years. WFBQ signed on in 1924 and became WPTF in 1927. It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster.\nFollowing immigration by Catholics, on December 12, 1924, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh was officially established by Pope Pius XI. The Sacred Heart Cathedral became the official seat of the diocese with William Joseph Hafey as its bishop.\nThe city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field, opened in 1929. That same year, the stock market crash resulted in six Raleigh banks closing.During the difficult 1930s of the Great Depression, government at all levels was integral to creating jobs. The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, Raleigh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated. The North Carolina Symphony, founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the area now known as William B.

The area declined after the city desegregated its establishments.By the early 1970s people in Raleigh were growing increasingly concerned about growth and urban sprawl. Community organizations felt that municipal offices were being too heavily influenced by business interests when the city's population was rapidly growing and various development projects were being proposed. At their behest, the municipal elections were altered so that the mayor was to be directly elected, instead of being selected by the city council. Most city council seats were then made responsible to districts, instead of being held at-large. The 1973 elections were the first contests affected by the reforms. City Councilman Clarence Lightner defeated Raleigh Merchants bureau Executive Director G. Wesley Williams to become Raleigh's first black mayor, and thus the first black mayor in a major white-majority city in the South.In 1976, the Raleigh City and Wake County schools merged to become the Wake County Public School System, now the largest school system in the state and 19th largest in the country.During the 1970s and 1980s, the I-440 beltline was constructed, easing traffic congestion and providing access to most major city roads.\nThe first Raleigh Convention Center (replaced in 2008) and Fayetteville Street Mall were both opened in 1977.

Fayetteville Street was reopened in 2007 as the main thoroughfare of Raleigh's downtown.The 1988 Raleigh tornado outbreak of November 28, 1988, was the most destructive of the seven tornadoes reported in Northeastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia between 1:00 AM and 5:45 AM. The Raleigh tornado produced over $77 million in damage, along with four fatalities (two in the city of Raleigh, and two in Nash County) and 154 injuries.

The Neuse River flows through the northeast end of the city.\nRaleigh is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet. This area is known as the \"fall line\" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain. Its central Piedmont location situates Raleigh about two hours west of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, by car and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains. The city is 170 miles (270 km) south of Richmond, Virginia, 278 miles (447 km) south of Washington, D.C., and 166 miles (267 km) northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina. A small portion of the city is located in Durham County.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nRaleigh is divided into several major geographic areas, each of which use a Raleigh address and a ZIP code that begins with the digits 276. PNC Plaza, formerly known as RBC Plaza, is the largest and tallest skyscraper in the city of Raleigh. The tower rises to a height of 538 feet (164 m), with a floor count of 34.\n\n\n==== Downtown and inside-the-beltline neighborhoods ====\n\nThe downtown area is home to historic buildings such as the Sir Walter Raleigh Hotel built in the early 20th century, the restored City Market, the Fayetteville Street downtown business district, which includes the PNC Plaza and Wells Fargo Capitol Center buildings, as well as the North Carolina Museum of History, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, North Carolina State Capitol, William Peace University, the City of Raleigh Museum, Raleigh Convention Center, Shaw University, Campbell University School of Law, and St. Augustine's College. In the 2000s, an effort by the Downtown Raleigh Alliance was made to separate this area of the city into five smaller districts: Fayetteville Street, Moore Square, Glenwood South, Warehouse (Raleigh), and Capital District (Raleigh). Some of the names have become common place among locals such as the Warehouse, Fayetteville Street, and Glenwood South Districts.\nThe Inside the Beltline neighborhoods include Cameron Park, Boylan Heights, Country Club Hills, Coley Forest, Five Points, Budleigh, Glenwood-Brooklyn, Hayes Barton Historic District, Moore Square, Mordecai (home to the historic Mordecai House), Rochester Heights, South Park, Rosengarten Park, Belvidere Park, Woodcrest, Oberlin Village, and Historic Oakwood.

It is roughly framed by Glenwood/Creedmoor Road to the West, Wake Forest Road to the East, and Millbrook Road to the North. It includes shopping centers such as North Hills and Crabtree Valley Mall. It also includes North Hills Park and part of the Raleigh Greenway System. The term was coined by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, developer John Kane and planning director Mitchell Silver. The News & Observer newspaper started using the term for marketing purposes only. The Midtown Raleigh Alliance was founded on July 25, 2011 as a way for community leaders to promote the area.\n\n\n==== East Raleigh ====\nEast Raleigh is situated roughly from Capital Boulevard near the I-440 beltline to New Hope Road. Most of East Raleigh's development is along primary corridors such as U.S. 1 (Capital Boulevard), New Bern Avenue, Poole Road, Buffaloe Road, and New Hope Road. Neighborhoods in East Raleigh include Hedingham, Longview, Lockwood, Madonna Acres, New Hope, Thompson-Hunter and Wilder's Grove.

The PNC Arena is also located here adjacent to the North Carolina State Fairgrounds. These are located approximately 2 miles from Rex Hospital.\n\n\n==== North Raleigh ====\nNorth Raleigh is an expansive, diverse, and fast-growing suburban area of the city that is home to established neighborhoods to the south along with many newly built subdivisions and along its northern fringes.

This area is the least developed and least dense area of Raleigh (much of the area lies within the Swift Creek watershed district, where development regulations limit housing densities and construction). The area is bordered to the west by Cary, to the east by Garner, to the southwest by Holly Springs and the southeast by Fuquay-Varina. Neighborhoods in South Raleigh include Eagle Creek, Renaissance Park, Lake Wheeler, Swift Creek, Carolina Pines, Rhamkatte, Riverbrooke, and Enchanted Oaks.\n\n\n==== Southeast Raleigh ====\nSoutheast Raleigh is bounded by downtown on the west, Garner on the southwest, and rural Wake County to the southeast.

Winters are short and generally cool, with a normal January daily mean temperature of 41.0 \u00b0F (5.0 \u00b0C). On average, there are 69 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 2.7 days that fail to rise above freezing. Raleigh receives an average annual rainfall of 43.34 inches (110.1 cm). Annual and monthly (temperature and) precipitation data are in chart below. April is the driest month, with an average of 2.92 inches (74.2 mm) of precipitation. Precipitation is well distributed around the year, with a slight maximum between July and September; on average, July is the wettest month, owing to generally frequent, sometimes heavy, showers and thunderstorms. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of 80.0 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C). There are 48 days per year with highs at or above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C). Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall, but greater potential for extremely heavy rainfall in a one/two day period, owing to occasional threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) packing torrential rainfall. In September 1999, Raleigh recorded its wettest month ever, with over 21 inches of rain, due to torrential rainfall from tropical weather systems, most notably Hurricane Floyd on September 15\u201316. Extremes in temperature have ranged from \u22129 \u00b0F (\u221223 \u00b0C) on January 21, 1985 up to 105 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C), most recently on June 29\u201330 and July 8, 2012. Raleigh falls in USDA hardiness zones 7b (5 \u00b0F to 10 \u00b0F) and 8a (10 \u00b0F to 15 \u00b0F).Raleigh receives an average of 6.0 inches (15.2 cm) of snow in winter. Freezing rain and sleet also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging ice storm. On January 24\u201325, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm \u2013 20.3 inches (52 cm) \u2013 the Winter Storm of January 2000. Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of cold air damming that affects the city due to its proximity to the Appalachian Mountains.  Winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well.\nThe region also experiences occasional periods of drought, during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience hurricanes. In 1996, Hurricane Fran caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees. Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in September 1999 were primary contributors to that month's extreme rainfall of over 21 inches. The most recent hurricane to have a considerable effect on the area was Hurricane Florence in 2018. Tornadoes also have on occasion affected the city of Raleigh, most notably the November 28, 1988 tornado which occurred in the early morning hours and rated an F4 on the Fujita Tornado Scale and affected northwestern portions of the city.

This statistic can most likely be credited to the presence of universities in and around Raleigh, as well as the presence of Research Triangle Park (RTP) to the Northwest.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\n\n\n==== Public ====\nNorth Carolina State University\nWake Technical Community College\n\n\n==== Private ====\nCampbell University Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law (Baptist)\nMeredith College (Baptist)\nMontreat College's School of Professional and Adult Studies (Presbyterian)\nWilliam Peace University (Presbyterian)\nShaw University (Baptist)\nSkema Business School, the first French Business School to open a campus in the USA\nSt. Augustine's University (Episcopal)\n\n\n==== Private, for profit ====\nECPI College of Technology\nThe Medical Arts School\nStrayer University\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary education ===\n\n\n==== Public schools ====\n\nPublic schools in Raleigh are operated by the Wake County Public School System, the largest public school system in the Carolinas. Observers have praised the Wake County Public School System for its innovative efforts to maintain a socially, economically and racial balanced system by using income as a prime factor in assigning students to schools.

The airport offers service to more than 35 domestic and international destinations and serves approximately 10 million passengers a year. The airport also offers facilities for cargo and general aviation. The airport authority tripled the size of its Terminal 2 (formerly Terminal C) in January 2011.\nPrivate Airport.Private general aviation airports in Raleigh include Triple W Airport (ICAO: K5W5, FAA LID: 5W5).\n\n\n==== Freeways and primary designated routes ====\n\n\n===== Interstate Highways =====\nI-40 traverses the southern part of the city, connecting Raleigh to Durham and Chapel Hill toward the west, and coastal Wilmington, North Carolina to the southeast.\nI-440, Also known locally as the Raleigh Beltline, it makes a loop around the central part of the city. The I-440 route labeling formerly encompassed the entire loop around the city, co-numbered though South Raleigh with I-40. In 2002, the NCDOT removed the I-440 designation from the co-numbered I-40 (southern and southwestern) sections of the loop, and the directional signage on the remaining I-440 portion was changed from Inner/Outer to East/West. The route designation changes were made to avoid driver confusion over the Inner/Outer designations, especially with Raleigh's new \"Outer Beltline\", as I-540 has become known.\nI-540/NC 540 is currently under development.\nI-87, designated September 5, 2017, follows the former route of Interstate 495. It begins at the I-40/I-440 interchange southeast of Raleigh and runs east, meeting I-540 and terminating at Rolesville Road. It is entirely concurrent with US 64. When the route is completed it will link Raleigh to the Norfolk, Virginia area.\n\n\n====== Future ======\nInterstate 42 will begin at I-40 south of Raleigh and will follow US 70 to Morehead City.\n\n\n===== United States Highways =====\nU.S. Route 1 enters the city from the north along Capital Boulevard, joins I-440 around the west side of Raleigh, and leaves the city to the southwest as the US 1/US 64 expressway in Cary.\nU.S. Route 64 is the main east-west route through Raleigh; all segments share routes with another highway. East of the city, US-64/US-264 is known as the Knightdale Bypass. US 64 follows I-440 (as a wrong way concurrency) and I-40 along southern Raleigh, and US 1 to the southwest.  A former alignment, designated as Business US-64, follows New Bern Avenue from the I-440 Beltline to the eastern boundary of the city, where it continues into Knightdale.\nU.S. Route 70 runs roughly northwest-southeast through Raleigh. North of downtown, the route follows Glenwood Avenue into Durham. South of Raleigh, the route (along with US 401 and NC 50) follows South Saunders and South Wilmington Streets into Garner. Through downtown, US 70 uses small segments of several streets, including Wade Avenue, Capital Boulevard, Dawson, and McDowell Streets.\nU.S. Route 264 cosigned with US 64 through East Raleigh.\nU.S. Route 401 north of downtown Raleigh it follows Capital Boulevard and Louisburg Road. South of downtown it is cosigned with US 70 from Wade Avenue southward.\n\n\n===== North Carolina Highways =====\nN.C. Route 54 follows Chapel Hill Road and Hillsborough Street in West Raleigh. The route ends at its interchange with I-440.\nN.C. Route 50 is a north-south route through Raleigh. North of Raleigh it follows Creedmoor Road. NC 50 joins US 70 and later US 401 in downtown Raleigh. The three routes remain together through south Raleigh.\nN.C. Route 98, known as Durham Road in North Raleigh, traverses the extreme northern parts of the city.\n\n\n==== Intercity rail ====\n\nRaleigh's train station is one of Amtrak's busiest stops in the Southern U.S. The station is served by five passenger trains daily: the Silver Star, thrice-daily Piedmont service, and the Carolinian. Daily service is offered between Raleigh and:\n\nCharlotte, with intermediate stops including Cary, Durham, Burlington and Greensboro, North Carolina.\nNew York City, with intermediate stops including Richmond, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; and Philadelphia.\nMiami, with intermediate stops including Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia; as well as Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa, Florida.\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\nPublic transportation in and around Raleigh is provided by GoRaleigh, which operates 33 fixed bus routes, including the R-Line and the Wake-Forest Loop. Although there are 33 routes, some routes are designed to cover multiple other routes at times when they are not served. Depending on the time of the day, and the day of the week, the number of routes operating is between 5 and 29.\nRaleigh is also served by GoTriangle (known formerly as the Triangle Transit Authority, and Triangle Transit). GoTriangle offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Research Triangle Park and several of the region's larger suburban communities. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nNorth Carolina State University also maintains its own transit system, the Wolfline, that provides zero-fare bus service to the general public along multiple routes serving the university's campuses in southwest Raleigh.\nGovernment agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.\nFrom 1995 the cornerstone of Triangle Transit's long-term plan was a 28-mile rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections.\nThe region's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.Greyhound Lines provides an inter-city bus service to Durham, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and other cities.\n\n\n==== Bicycle and pedestrian ====\nThe Maine-to-Florida U.S. Bicycle Route#1 routes through suburban Raleigh, along with N.C. Bicycle Route #2, the \"Mountains To Sea\" route. As of September 2010, maps and signage for both US Bike Route #1 and NC Bike Route #2 are out-of-date for the Raleigh area. N.C. Bicycle Route #5 is routed nearby, connecting Apex to Wilmington and closely paralleling the NCBC Randonneurs 600 kilometer brevet route.\nMost public buses are equipped with bicycle racks, and some roads have dedicated bicycle-only lanes. Bicyclists and pedestrians also may use Raleigh's extensive greenway system, with paths and trails located throughout the city.\nIn May 2011, Raleigh was designated a Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists at the Bronze level.\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Raleigh 36th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.\nIn 2002, the \"Walk [Your City]\" initiative was started in the city which provides a tool kit for neighborhood organizations to post signs giving a distance by bike or foot, with directions in scannable QR code. The movement has spread to more than 400 communities in 55 countries.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\nThe Raleigh Fire Department provides fire protection throughout the city. The North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women, the state's primary correctional facility housing female inmates is based in Raleigh.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nRaleigh has several sister cities:\n Xiangyang, Hubei, China\n Compi\u00e8gne, Oise, Hauts-de-France, France\n Kingston upon Hull, England, United Kingdom\n Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany\n Nairobi, Kenya\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of capitals in the United States\nList of municipalities in North Carolina\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Wake County, North Carolina\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nAmis, Moses N.

        "wiki": "The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCMNS) is located in Raleigh, North Carolina as the oldest established museum in North Carolina and the largest museum of its kind in the Southeastern United States. With about 1.2 million visitors annually, as of 2013 it was the state's most popular museum or historic destination among visitors.The museum has four facilities on three campuses: the Nature Exploration Center and Nature Research Center on Jones Street in downtown Raleigh, the Prairie Ridge Ecostation satellite facility and outdoor classroom in northwest Raleigh near William B. Umstead State Park, and the former North Carolina Museum of Forestry in Whiteville. NCMNS is a division of the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe North Carolina State Museum was created in 1879, by combining two existing state-owned collections of geologic and agricultural specimens. The museum was originally housed in the Briggs building on Fayetteville Street. The museum's collections, outreach and education programs, and status grew over the next 60 years under the stewardship of H.H. Brimley. As part of the Department of Agriculture, the State Museum moved in 1887 to a former hotel on Edenton Street across from the Capitol building. An annex was added in 1899, but the entire facility was replaced by a purpose-built building in 1924. The facility was later renamed the North Carolina State Museum of Natural History.In the 1950s and again in the 1990s, shifts in education further expanded the museum's holdings as universities donated their collections to the state.  In 1986, it became the North Carolina State Museum of Natural Sciences.A new building opened later and NCMNS became the largest natural history museum in the Southeast.  Also in 2000, the museum expanded with a new location: the Museum of Forestry in Whiteville was added as a satellite campus; this facility was later overhauled and reopened in 2015 as the NC Museum of Natural Sciences in Whiteville. Another location was added in 2004, with the opening of the Prairie Ridge Ecostation for Wildlife and Learning. The museum expanded its downtown campus in 2012, with the adjacent Nature Research Center.The collection now contains more than 1.7 million specimens of amphibians, reptiles, birds,  fish, mammals, invertebrates, invertebrate and vertebrate fossils, plants, geology, and meteorites.NCMNS is administered by the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.\n\n\n== Nature Exploration Center ==\n\n\n=== First floor ===\n\nNatural Treasures of North Carolina contains dioramas of various wildlife and artifacts pertaining to nature in North Carolina.\nCoastal North Carolina includes exhibits of fish native to North Carolina's coast and inland waterways.\nWRAL 3-D Theater \u2013 3-D films are shown daily in this 250-seat venue.\nBox Office\n\n\n=== Second floor ===\nThe North Carolina: Mountains to the Sea exhibit displays North Carolina's natural habitats from the western mountains through the central Piedmont and on to the Coastal Plain highlighting the interrelationships between them.\nUnderground North Carolina features gems and minerals of North Carolina, as well as ground, soil, and seismic displays.\nThe Nature's Explorers exhibit covers the museum's beginnings, showing the tools and techniques naturalists used 100 years ago to collect and preserve specimens.\nThe Discovery Room is a family-oriented hands-on exhibit for exploring the natural world using a combination of natural, live, and human-made objects.\nSpecial Exhibition gallery.\nA bridge to the museum's new building, which also has a timeline on display.\n\n\n=== Third floor ===\n\nPrehistoric North Carolina chronicles prehistoric life in the state and throughout the southeastern United States.\nThe Terror of the South exhibit features fossil skeletons, including an Acrocanthosaurus.\nThe Tropical Connections section is anchored by a large interactive globe which allows visitors to highlight the climate regions of the Earth.

          "I loved this place cause they have arcades for kids and many more stuff but it's really fun",
          "If I could give this place a 0 I would. After ordering food and having to wait 10-15 min, clean my own table, and have to pay 3.24 for a refill in 100\u00b0 weather after paying over 100$ for my kids here I'm very happy and would love to receive a refill any way possible.!",

          "This place was great. The laser tag was weak, but my kids and huaband loved the go-karts! The arcade was fun, and they had a very large variety of prizes which was nice. It was to hot to play mini golf and the batting cages were closed because of the humidity. But we will definitely be back to try them out.",
          "3 different mini golf courses. Loved the water falls and the flora. Courses could have been cleaned better from leaves and debris, but not that big a deal.",
          "Our group had fun & the employees were very nice. They were in the process of cleaning something outside & the smell was terrible so we stayed inside. The snack area seemed a little sketchy & there were a few unattended children losing their minds. I\u2019m in no hurry to go back but we did have fun!",
          "Went here for miniature golf. The course was fun and challenging. The staff was very nice. The building is starting to look rundown and needs some TLC.",

          "Indoor and outdoor activities.  Friendly staff. Easy to get to.",
          "Good experience here- visited for a friends Birthday party.  These guys have been around for years and still offer Mini golf and go carting.  Facilities are reasonably clean but some areas are starting to show their age.  Staff seemed friendly enough but overwhelmed w the crowd that was there that day.",

          "The lazer tag and minigolf was awesome, my only issue was the batting cages did not work very well, luckly they set it to let us play for 25 minutes. Other than that I had a fantastic time",

          "Most of the later tag vests weren't working. Been like this for quite a while. We left early because it was raining outside. No golf. Pizza was better than expected. Most of the staff was very good. I only ran across two duds. Place has gone down hill over time. Next time I'll try somewhere else.",

          "We went to my daughter BFF birthday party was wonderful. First time there.",
          "There's no rhyme or reason to layout of the building. It was so crowded. They definitely need crowd control or more staff, especially around the counter area",
          "Fun time with mini golf (9.49 for two rounds, three courses available). Will be back!",
          "I was pretty disappointed with this place. Aside from the mini-golf, I feel like I wasted my money there. Many of the arcade games were broken, and the place was sweltering. It was more comfortable outside in 85+ heat that inside the place. \u2026",

          "Love the go-karts",
          "Plenty of good times to be had here! The arcade games aren't the greatest - mostly ticket-earning games that older kids and adults won't find much value in, but it isn't bad. The go kart track is pretty standard, but also decent. The mini \u2026",
          "We took our newly 7 year old here for her birthday on June 11th. It was quite crowded when we first arrived but the gentlemen working the front desk was super helpful. It all went downhill from there. The rest of the staff we interacted \u2026",
          "Fun place to go in Raleigh that is relatively inexpensive. The arcade area is well maintained and they have plenty of staff on hand to help when you lose a token in a game. The go-karts we're pretty fast and there were lots of people riding \u2026",
          "Love it great family day",
          "Challenging golf courses cleverly placed in the space available. Fun.",
          "We played for a while in the arcade. There are plenty of games for whatever you're looking for. Ticket-oriented chance games, skill-based like skeeball, racing, air hockey, DDR, and many more. The place gets very loud and pretty crowded, so \u2026",
          "We went here as a Sunday date to play golf and possibly ride the go-karts. I worked here as a teenager in the late 90's and nothing much has changed; that's not a compliment. The games seem to be the only thing different about the facility. \u2026",
          "Not bad for older kids, was hoping besides the arcade for kids under 6 to have a bit more to do",
          "Never a dull moment of fun! Awesome go carting and lazer tag!",
          "Extermely hot. Machines constantly malfunctioning and workers show no enthusiasm and too small for the crowds. Did not enjoy ANYTHING AT ALL. SORRY FOLKS JUST BEING HONEST",

          "A lot of the games were broken or not functioning properly.",
          "It's fun the staff is nice and helpful",
          "Very loud and obnoxious. Went there with some kids and a few friends and we burned through 200 dollars and we barely even did anything, the minigolf is the only real thing there and even that is done terribly and when your inside good luck \u2026",

          "Took my camp kids here and they had a blast. We did a package where they did unlimited go karts, golf, and laser tag for 2 hours plus they had a certain number of tokens to play games. There was plenty of staff to monitor and assist in all \u2026",
          "This place is a little rundown but the staff is friendly and they have great deals on Groupon.",
          "Great place with an awesome Groupon for two. Really kind staff and a clean establishment. The golf courses could use some more lighting for night-time play, but overall a fun, affordable evening.",
          "Go karts,  mini golf and batting cages are all cool enough for the price. Dont bother with the laser tag, half the guns dont work.",
          "Pretty cool but needs better games",
          "The only reason why I give this place 2 stars is because they don't keep up with the latest technology. Frankies always keeps up with the latest technology. Frankies has cards and the tickets are on your cards not in your pocket and you can \u2026",
          "Parts were very nice but I purchased a unlimited laser tag and after playing one game it was closed down!!",

          "The batting cages are very inconsistent. Some work ok, but some don't work at all. The pitches are all over the place. One of my kids was hit in the face and the other across her knuckles. We won't be back.",
          "Because I love the race cars",
          "I like taking my daughter here, but they need to upgrade really bad, some of those game machines are old as heck, they need to get rid of the coins and do game cards to play those games, so at the end they can just scan the card with points u won, instead of putting those tickets in those old machines,  its 2020, UPGRADE",
          "I love the Friday night family packages!",
          "Not quite the adventure that you would think.",
          "The kids had a blast.  I wanted the mini golf and of course the little race  cars, the kids love\nThem the actually got to do some xtra spins later in the night......",
          "Lot's of fun.",

          "Had my son's 6th bday party here today, everything was amazing. Great deal for a party, includes lots of things.  Accommodating party planner and great hosts/helpers. We did laser tag and it was a lot of fun. Recommended for a day of fun \u2026",
          "Games kept stealing tokens, not enough ticket machines.  Staff was friendly so that deserves 3 stars.",
          "Crowded and staff was not helpful. Go Carts are dangerous. Staff needs to do more to provide safety and prevent the accidents. We probably won't go back.",
          "Had so much fun golfing with my 6 year old! We enjoyed all the inside games as well.",
          "Putt putt really needs to be updated or renovated. Prices at concessions are ridiculously high just for a drink, and most of the games either kept messing up or didnt work at all.",
          "I went with some friends and it was a bit pricey, also th had some tv show playing that kids would be disturbed by. The pizza had to much cheese and it had to much grease. And lazer tag had a glitch and you cant hit or shoot. Also the \u2026",

          "The kids had a great time and the staff was fantastic.",
          "Similar to other amusement type places. Kind of small, the GoKarts and Mini Golf are nice and not too wild for younger kids. The kids wish the arcade was bigger. Age for lasr tag is 7 and up which is difficult if you have both younger and older kids with you",
          "Go-carts, laser tag, mini-golf.... This place is full of fun for the whole family. There are also arcade games and batting cages if those other attractions aren't enough to keep you busy. Really, the best thing is that they run some great \u2026",

          "Best go carts ever!",
          "Great family fun",
          "Great mini golf. Awesome prices unlike Frankies irresponsible pricing. Food prices here for hotdogs are insane tough. Who wants to pay over $5. For a shriveled up hotdog? NOBODY!! Arcade prices are pretty good. Beware, there were 7 games \u2026",
          "Half of the games did not work. Spent majority of the might tracking down a employee to give my kids refunds. Will not be going here anymore.",
          "Maybe I just remember the \"Good 'Ole Days\" but, it seems like arcades these days are no more than Gamblers Anonymous in training.  Kids shoving dollars in no skill machines for tickets to cash in for cheap junk.  Adventure Landing was fun \u2026",

          "We had a blast playing Putt-Putt Golf and playing at the arcade. Are five-year-old absolutely loved his experience of putt putt, it was his second. The staff were friendly and courteous.",
          "A little grimy but the ice cream is good.",
          "Good fun for the kids!",
          "Place needs  maintenance on all their equipment. Some of the arcade games didn\u2019t work. The batting cage is horrible. Overall experience was just disappointing.",

          "This place is definitely an adventure! Mini golf, Lazer tag, batting cages, go-kart racing and an arcade! We've had a great time here. When we arrived there was a school field trip happening so there were a lot of people and they ended up \u2026",
          "Great place for friends and family. Great places for their arcade and also their other options of go karts, mini-golfing, lazer tag, and more. It is a really fun place to take your friends and family and would definitely recommend coming here.",

          "Great visit with wife and son and we won in go carts !!!!",
          "We had a wonderful time last night for my grandsons birthday. Best of all was the staff. From Red who greeted us and made sure we had a great time to the staff on the floor. They just couldn't be nicer. By the way...the pizza is really good!",

          "We only went to play the 18 hole miniature golf and it really was a fun family affair. The holes were well laid out like a scavenger hunt or journey not knowing what the next one will be like or lead too. Great scenery and even places to \u2026",

          "Great for bday parties.. hosts were great. Lasertag was antiquated however.",
          "We use the batting cages alot for softball practice. But today 2 softball slow pitch machines were out of order. Only 1 was working and we had to take turns with several other people. It's fine but would be much better if they all were working. Go-carts are always fun!",
          "They have plenty of arcade games to play in case you get bored with mini golf, laser tag, batting cages, and go cart racing.",
          "Great church outing with our youth",

          "Great Fun for all ages.",
          "Great birthday party location for tweens and up. The arcade games kept eating our coins or not giving out clever tickets. They seemed to have a full staff just in the arcade to un-jamb and reset games or give out comp coins. Food was what \u2026",
          "Nice place to go on a date night.  Even busy there is plentry of room for everyone.",
          "This place is old and run down lots of the games don't work",
          "It was ok. Kids loved the activities.  When they said an hour in the party room they meant an hour. They were moving people out quickly.  They served the kids.  Didnt really serve the adults.",

          "Kids had fun.  Wish they would spray for mosquitos though",
          "Took my niece here on a rainy day during Christmas break. Fun place to run in to for a couple of hours. Please note, I gave it 3 stars for what it is - a local place to stop for a couple  hours of fun. This is no Dave and Busters, Frankie's \u2026",
          "Had a great time on the go carts.",
          "Games were broken, tickets didn't come out..not worth spending money \"coins\" on games. You will never have enough to get a well deserved \"Prize\". I have a 15yr old and she don't want plastic glitter pom poms for 1500 tickets, so we save \u2026",

          "We had lots of fun. It was Super Bowl Sunday and we had the whole place for ourselves.  We played every single game. We also used coupons and got 60 tokens for $10. The kids had a blast. I recommend this place, specially if it's Super Bowl Sunday. Lol.",

          "Its a nice place for fun.. but quite crowded on weekends",
          "Full disclosure - I'm an adult reviewing a game place really designed for kid, but I am a kid at heart. This isn't a bad place to spend an hour or so. Games are reasonably priced + they have go-karts and putt-putt. The issue is, it's really dated and a tad small. If that doesn't matter, then save up a few bucks and play some games!",

          "Been here a few years ago and again last week. Great brews, try a flight if you're unsure. If you home brew, check out the supply store. Grabbed a couple nonperishable supplies as the prices were way better than up here in Md.",
          "We stopped here for a quick drink after dinner and I was very impressed with such a large area with plenty of seating. The staff were very pleasant and $8 for a flight of 4 beers was excellent value. They had a large number to choose from. I got the the First Squeeze American",

          "I went there with a group of +10. The way the place is arranged, it would be difficult to sit all of us together so we stood most of the time. Keep in mind we went when it was cold out so outside wasn't an option. In the summer we could use the other larger tables outside. It's",
          "Stopped in after being out for a few hours and the AC was cold and the beer even colder. While it was not a good day for the dog to be out, a furry friend isn't too far away. As usual, the staff was helpful and made a great recommendation. Will be back when we are in the area.",

          "We had a marketing event here. The space was okay. They had the appropriate AV equipment but I don't think I would do an event here again. It's just not the best space for an event. The beer was great! The staff was nice. They have a small beer garden outside, but it was",
          "Dropped in during a recent visit to NC State University. Only a short drive from campus. Nice large space with bar, many tables, outdoor seating and dart boards! Crowd really began to fill up the place late afternoon on a rainy day. Flights of 4 - 4 oz beers are a nice way",
          "Lots of space for festivities, only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it's far away from the rest of the places. They have a wide selection of beers and most are very tasty. Every now and again this place holds events with food trucks and other Brewers.",

        "wiki": "Yates Mill is a fully restored, circa 1756 gristmill located five miles (8 km) south of downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, United States. It is the centerpiece of Historic Yates Mill County Park, in central Wake County. The park features the restored mill; a visitor center with a museum focused on milling and on the natural history of the area, classrooms, an auditorium and space for research conducted by North Carolina State University faculty and students; a 20-acre (81,000 m2) lake; and extensive hiking trails. The park is managed as a native wildlife refuge with a mission to study and interpret the park's cultural, natural and agricultural heritage.\n\n\n== History ==\nYates Mill, one of the oldest buildings in Wake County, is the region's only surviving operable gristmill. For nearly 200 years the water-powered mill produced lumber, milled corn and wheat, and carded wool. The land on which the mill is situated was surveyed for Samuel Pearson in October 1756, and granted to him by the Earl of Granville, one of the North Carolina colony's Lord Proprietors. The original mill was built around at that time. Pearson steadily increased his land holdings, and owned more than 600 acres (2.4 km2) at the time of his death in 1802. In 1819, accumulated debts forced Pearson's son, Simon, to sell the mill and its surrounding acreage at a sheriff's auction. William Boylan, a prominent Raleigh businessman and director of the State Bank, bought the property, and over the next 30 years modernized the mill several times, adding a sawmill in the 1840s.\nIn 1853, Thomas Briggs, John Primrose, and James Penny acquired the mill. A decade later, in the midst of the Civil War, the partners sold the mill and surrounding 94 acres (380,000 m2) to Phares and Roxanna Yates, James Penny's son-in-law and daughter. Penny's involvement in the murder of a Mr. Franklin may have brought on the sale. According to legend, Franklin was a Northern sympathizer who Penny killed for not paying a $700 mill debt. In 1865, Franklin's widow supposedly told Federal troops occupying Raleigh that her husband's death was due to his support for the Union. The soldiers tried to burn the mill by setting fire to the entrance. Charred wooden beams today attest to the unsuccessful attempt.\n\nYates and his descendants operated the mill until 1948, when businessman A. E. Finley acquired the property. Finley constructed a retreat lodge by the millpond for the use of his family and employees. Due to lack of demand, however, the old mill was closed in 1953. Ten years later, North Carolina State University acquired the property, consolidating it into a larger tract to be used as an experimental farm. The mill was mainly used for storage until 1989, when Yates Mill Associates was incorporated to marshal its restoration. The mill narrowly escaped destruction in 1996, when rains unleashed by Hurricane Fran burst its 250-year-old stone dam. In 1996, Yates Mill Associates and Wake County Parks, Recreation and Open Space unveiled a public-private partnership to rehabilitate the dam and mill as part of a 574-acre (2.32 km2) historic and environmental park. Yates Mill is now a designated Raleigh Historic Landmark.\n\n\n== Current use ==\n\nThe mill stood vacant for several years until Yates Mill Associates, Inc. began restoration efforts in 1988. The mill is an example of the Oliver Evans type of grist mill and has been restored to its state as of the mid-19th century. Both the corn and wheat grinding machinery have been restored. Several corn grindings have been held since the mill officially opened to the public on May 20, 2006. The mill is frequently open for historic tours and corn grinding is demonstrated on specific days.\nYates Mill Associates, Inc. restored the mill with donations from governmental agencies, North Carolina State University, foundations, corporations and private citizens. North Carolina State University provided 154 acres (0.62 km2) on a long-term lease and will use the park for ongoing natural history research.\nWake County purchased 16 acres (65,000 m2) to add to the park and The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services have provided access to an adjacent parcel of about 400 acres (1.6 km2) for park use. The Wake County Parks, Recreation and Open Space Department oversaw the development of this 574-acre (2.32 km2) park. The County supervised the construction of the A.E. Finley Center for Education and Research, and provides the personnel and support needed to operate the park. Yates Mill Associates organizes and finances the maintenance of the mill and its demonstration using private donations and volunteer help.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Registered Historic Places in North Carolina\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYates Mill Associates \u2013 Official website\nHistoric Yates Mill County Park \u2013 Park website\nVideo of Yates Mill\nVideo showing the interior and exterior of the Mill from 2016",

          "I wanted to spend some time outside while my husband was at a work function and this was a beautiful place to do so! They offered tours while I was there but I just wanted to walk around the water and check it out on my own. Walk was quick and fun - enjoyed the guide signs",
          "We were on the last morning of our weekend visit to Raleigh when we saw information about the Historic Yates Mill County Park. We decided to check it out and It turned out to be a great decision. The 174-acre park is open seven days a week from 8:00 am to sunset. The A.E.",
          "Had a lovely day walking around the park. Wish the milll was open to see inside it. Went inside to ask questions at the office and they were more than accomodating for information about that park and even more!!!!",
          "My daughter's prom group came here for pictures. They were beautiful! I've walked the trails, too, very nice.",
          "Yates Mill is a great place for a short walk and photos. The historic site is well interpreted but check ahead to see when tours are scheduled.",
          "I recommend stopping here for an hour or so while visiting Raleigh. We came for a hockey game and wanted to check out some cool spots in Raleigh the day. Not big enough to spend half a day but worth an hour or so.. its cool to see.",
          "Family just moved to the area and we were looking for some things to do outside of the city. This was surprisingly nice. There are many walking paths in the area, but not all that have a history like this. You can walk the perimeter, fish off one of the bridges and \"rock hop\" in",
          "Right now I noticed they are only doing actual tours guided tours on Saturdays. So call before you go. We went on a weekday and more able to walk freely around the property but not into the buildings. The scenery is absolutely stunning and knowing that it was built around 1750",
          "This is a fully functional grist mill. The museum is small but very educational. The only problem is there are many days the mill is closed but the visitor center is open. I recommend you call ahead of time to make sure when the mill is operational if you want to see it",
          "Great place to decompress and walk the trails the colors are gorgeous now. So many places to take family pics",
          "This 575-acre park in southern Wake County, N.C., has a restored 1756 gristmill as its centerpiece. It's an interesting building to behold and sits alongside a dam and waterfall, also worth enjoying and appreciating. The park has several trails, and on the afternoon I was there,",
          "The lake next to the mill is large and picturesque. The mill is a short walk from the entrance. Although you can not enter the mill you can walk around it in three sides. There are some great spots to take shots of the mill. Inside the centre there is a lot to see and read. Kids",

          "We enjoyed the walk and the area, it's beautiful spot. The information in the musuem was well done and so much hands on learning. We didn't stay for the tour but hope to come back and do that one day.",
          "Be sure to visit the web site so you will know when they have the grinding demonstrations and the mill tour (they don't occur on the same days). If you want to tour the mill be prepared to give up your name, date of birth, and address for each person in your group. No getting",

          "This is a gorgeous place and is a trip back through history. The Old Mill is still working, and the presentations are terrific. The guides and workers there demonstrate the process of working the Old Mill. They even grind corn in the old fashioned way. Ground corn can be bought",
          "This is a very nice local park for birding. It has a variety of habitats and gets quite a variety of birds. It is also nest to Mid Pines road which seems to get many relatively rare birds. The park staff is friendly and the mill is an interesting visit. It has a nice trail",
          "Visited with the intent of taking a few photos. I ended up spent 2 hours here. Its a short, easy walk 20 minute walk round the pond. Beautiful restored mill at one end of the walk near the car park. Informative visitors centre too.",
          "This was a great place to walk around the lake, there is fishing available also. The four year old was\"bored\" with our walk but the visitor center had her attention for over an hour. We had to pull her away from all the fun to go to lunch.",
          "Really nice education center, lovely trails and very very photographic spots in this little park. You can spend a couple hours here easily. It would be a nice spot for a picnic.",
          "There is a dock overlooking the water that I always go to lay on for a bit. The mill itself is spectacular with the waterway clearly visible. Many people go here to take pictures.",
          "I stopped by this park with my mom and my mother-in-law last weekend when we were in the Raleigh area. Unfortunately we arrived right before the visitor center closed, but from the minute we spent in there it seemed like they had a lot of interesting information and displays",
          "This is a local gem that many miss; it is very peaceful and a great nature walk. The tour of the mill and how it operated was educational.",
          "This is a nice park to walk around the trails and look out on the pond. In the spring and Summer, the historical society sponsors Mill tours to help with the upkeep and preservation of the mill. It was interesting to hear the history and watch the actual grinding of the Mill. We",

          "The Old Yates Mill has been in existence since before the Revolutionary War! Although it's a short walk (about 1 mile), it's a beautiful spot to enjoy a sunny spring day and enjoy the sights and sounds of nature. Start in the mini-museum where artifacts which have been",
          "Not much to see and learn, but better than nothing :) The water views are a bit murky and the wheel was not turning.",
          "I love hiking trails and nostalgic places. Went there on a Monday. I asked about placing small painted rocks on the trails and explained what they were for. Was told no as they are a 'natural' sanctuary and nothing brought in from the outside was allowed. Fair enough. Started",
          "We had a nice tour. One of the few working mills still left in NC. Interesting to see grain being milled.",

          "We loved this park, and the mill in particular. It wasn't running when we visited, but the views in and around are great. Park is well manicured, and the exhibit at the front is also great. The only thing we wish they had was some kind of vending machine inside the exhibit",
          "This is one of those 'off the beaten path' type places that is sure to please. In addition to the exhibits and locale...did I mention that there is a mill? Yeah, that. They have regular programs for the kids, and it is a great opportunity to escape the standard 'city' events",
          "With not too much time to see the sights of Raleigh this did make the list, and it was well worth while. A nice clear Autumn day with no wind leaving the lake calm and the leaves colourful. A nice peaceful place to explore without having to rush.",
          "The Mill is very picturesque. We took the \"High\" trail and it was easy, yet fun too! Lots of birds, a few turtles and squirrels, but No snakes (Thank God!). Fun Family Outing!",
          "Yates Mill is a great little park of Lake Wheeler Road. We've taken pictures out here the past few years, but it's also fun to go out and walk around. The waterfall near the old mill is great. Beautiful spot in Raleigh.",
          "I decided to stop by Yates Mill after hearing wonderful things about the park. I arrived at 3pm. There was plenty of available parking. The sun sets over the lake so the 3-5pm hours are great for viewing or photography. There's a short walk down to the mill. There are steps on",

          "Lake Wheeler and Yates Mill are a hidden gem in Raleigh. Although the mill building was not open, the visitor center had great exhibits and history of the mill. I was excited to read about the UNC architectural students who took a course in the 1970's that restored the mill",
          "We spent a day in Raleigh recently and went to the Farmer's Market and to Yates Mill. It is a very beautiful place. The old mill has been refurbished and the lake trail is perfect for a 30 minute walk. We saw turtles and lots of birds. At least 5 people were getting",

          "A great place to relax to sit & watch the world go by or take a walk around the trails if you're feeling more energetic. It was very hot & humid the day we visited & it was a last stop off so we just missed the visitor centre but we could still walk down to the mill itself. It's",
          "This park is a nice place to run or hike or just sit and observe nature. The mill itself and the surrounding grounds are gorgeous and a great place to take pictures. There is also a visitor's center with spotless restrooms. The mill is not near any type of food or gas. It",
          "The park's main attraction, the mill, is quite close to the parking lot. Unless you want to walk on the trails around the lake, don't expect to do too much walking. However, the trails are well kept and mostly shaded, so are good for anybody looking to exercise. The new building",
          "A wonderful walk in early fall or spring, try to go when they have the mill running. Always a quiet getaway hidden on the back roads south of Raleigh. In summer, go early to avoid the heat.",
          "The visitor center has informative displays explaining the milling process and history of the Yates Mill. However, the real attraction is the mill itself. If you are able to go on a day that the mill is open for tours and in operation, that is is a definite plus. Tours cost a",

          "Was an absolutely gorgeous place, made me sad to have all the car noise next to such a pastoral setting, but such is progress. Very close to downtown Raleigh and worth the jaunt.",
          "Taking the kids, especially little ones can be fun if you are careful. Be sure to wear good and solid shoes on the little ones. It has been off and on with our oldest child and their interest. But I think from the people we know and what we've seen that isn't uncommon. A",
          "You just have to bring your kids here on a school or homeschool kind of field trip to see the old mill and how it works/worked for sure.",
          "Just happened on this place while passing through. Nice entrance hall with very friendly staff. We walked the trail around the lake. Great photo opportunities. We saw Red Shouldered Hawks, Geese, turtles, snakes, Great Blue Herons, and songbirds of all types in just a short 30",

          "On the way out town...great place for a picnic! The millhouse is uber-cool and the water spillway will be an indelible memory for you and your children. The walking trail is more in tune with an amble instead of a hike. It is really short and laps the lake. The road to get",

        "wiki": "The City of Raleigh Museum is a local history museum associated with Raleigh, North Carolina.  The museum is located in the historic Briggs Hardware Building on Fayetteville Street in downtown Raleigh and has a number of exhibits and programs that are free to the public.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe City of Raleigh Museum grew out of the dream of Raleigh historian Beth Crabtree and after her death, the vision and perseverance of Mary Cates. It was in 1990 that Mary Cates began bringing together a group of advocates for a city-based museum.\nIn 1991 widespread support was shown for the museum and initial steps were taken toward making the dream a reality. In 1993 the museum opened its first exhibit in the Borden Building in Fred Fletcher Park.\nIn 1998 the museum moved to the first floor of the newly restored Briggs Hardware Building on Fayetteville Street in the heart of downtown Raleigh.  It has continued to serve at that location ever since.\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nThe museum operated as a nonprofit until July 2012, when the City of Raleigh assumed operational control. While the City remains in charge of the museum, it is also supported by the nonprofit Friends of the COR Museum. The museum offers a variety of exhibits and educational programs on various aspects of the history of the city.  It also maintains an extensive collection of Raleigh photographs and artifacts as a part of its service to the city.\n\n\n== Friends of the COR Museum ==\nThe Friends supports the mission of the museum through fundraising and other initiatives. It is a 501c(3) organization that previously served as the board for the museum when it operated as a non-profit entity.\n\n\n== External links ==\nCity of Raleigh Museum - City of Raleigh\nFriends of the COR Museum",

        "wiki": "Raleigh (; RAH-lee) is the capital of the state of North Carolina and the seat of Wake County in the United States. Raleigh is the second-largest city in the state, after Charlotte. Raleigh is known as the \"City of Oaks\" for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city. The city covers a land area of 142.8 square miles (370 km2). The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population as 474,069 as of July 1, 2019. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The city of Raleigh is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the lost Roanoke Colony in present-day Dare County.\nRaleigh is home to North Carolina State University (NCSU) and is part of Research Triangle Park (RTP), together with Durham (home of Duke University and North Carolina Central University) and Chapel Hill (home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The \"Triangle\" nickname originated after the 1959 creation of the Research Triangle Park, located in Durham and Wake counties, among the three cities and their universities. The  Research Triangle region  encompasses the U.S. Census Bureau's Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which had an estimated population of 2,037,430 in 2013. The Raleigh metropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 1,214,516 in 2013.\nMost of Raleigh is located within Wake County, with a very small portion extending into Durham County. The towns of Cary, Morrisville, Garner, Clayton, Wake Forest, Apex, Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina, Knightdale, Wendell, Zebulon, and Rolesville are some of Raleigh's primary nearby suburbs and satellite towns.\nRaleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city. Following the American Revolutionary War when the US gained independence, this was chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol in Union Square at the center. During the American Civil War, the city was spared from any significant battle. It fell to the Union in the closing days of the war, and struggled with the economic hardships in the postwar period related to the reconstitution of labor markets, over-reliance on agriculture, and the social unrest of the Reconstruction Era. Following the establishment of the Research Triangle Park (RTP) in 1959, several tens of thousands of jobs were created in the fields of science and technology, and it became one of the fastest-growing communities in the United States by the early 21st century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Earlier capitals ===\nBath, the oldest town in North Carolina, was the first nominal capital of the colony from 1705 until 1722, when Edenton took over the role. The colony had no permanent institutions of government until the new capital, New Bern, was established in 1743.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nIn December 1770, Joel Lane successfully petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to create a new county. On January 5, 1771, the bill creating Wake County was passed in the General Assembly. The county was formed from portions of Cumberland, Orange, and Johnston counties. The county was named for Margaret Wake Tryon, the wife of Governor William Tryon. The first county seat was Bloomsbury.\nNew Bern, a port town on the Neuse River 35 miles (56 km) from the Atlantic Ocean, was the largest city and the capital of North Carolina during the American Revolution. When the British Army laid siege to the city, that site could no longer be used as capital. From 1789 to 1794, when Raleigh was being built, the state capital was Fayetteville.\nRaleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital in 1788, as its central location protected it from attacks from the coast. It was officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital (incorporated on December 31, 1792 \u2013 charter granted January 21, 1795). The city was named for Sir Walter Raleigh, sponsor of Roanoke, the \"lost colony\" on Roanoke Island.The city's location was chosen, in part, for being within 11 mi (18 km) from Isaac Hunter's Tavern, a popular tavern frequented by the state legislators. No known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site. Raleigh is one of the few cities in the United States that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital. Its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of North, East, West and South. The plan, a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner, was based on Thomas Holme's 1682 plan for Philadelphia.The North Carolina General Assembly first met in Raleigh in December 1794, and granted the city a charter, with a board of seven appointed commissioners and an \"Intendant of Police\" (which developed as the office of Mayor) to govern it. (After 1803 city commissioners were elected.) In 1799, the N.C. Minerva and Raleigh Advertiser was the first newspaper published in Raleigh. John Haywood was the first Intendant of Police.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn 1808, Andrew Johnson, the nation's future 17th President, was born at Casso's Inn in Raleigh. The city's first water supply network was completed in 1818, although due to system failures, the project was abandoned. In 1819 Raleigh's first volunteer fire company was founded, followed in 1821 by a full-time fire company.\nIn 1817, the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina was established and headquartered in Raleigh.\nIn 1831, a fire destroyed the North Carolina State House. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried gneiss being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completions of the new State Capitol and new Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company in 1840.\nIn 1853, the first State Fair was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, Peace College, was established in 1857. Raleigh's Historic Oakwood contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition.\nNorth Carolina seceded from the Union. After the Civil War began, Governor Zebulon Baird Vance ordered the construction of breastworks around the city as protection from Union troops. During General Sherman's Carolinas Campaign, Raleigh was captured by Union cavalry under the command of General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick on April 13, 1865. As the Confederate cavalry retreated west, the Union soldiers followed, leading to the nearby Battle of Morrisville. The city was spared significant destruction during the War.\nDue to the economic and social problems of the post-war period and Reconstruction, with a state economy still overly based on agriculture, it grew little over the next several decades.\n\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, African Americans were emancipated. The Reconstruction era legislature established public education for blacks and whites. Freedmen were often led by free blacks who had become educated before the war. With the help of the Freedmen's Bureau, many freedmen migrated from rural areas to Raleigh. It had an established free black community, more work opportunities, and many freedmen wanted to get out from under white supervision in the rural areas.\nShaw University, the South's first African American college, began classes in 1865 and was chartered in 1875. Its Estey Hall was the first building constructed for the higher education of black women, and Leonard Medical Center was the first four-year medical school in the country for African Americans.\nIn 1867, Episcopal clergy founded St. Augustine's College for the education of freedmen. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the nation's first school for blind and deaf blacks, to be located in Raleigh. In 1874, the federal government constructed the Federal Building in Raleigh, the first federal government project in the South following the Civil War.\nIn 1880, the newspapers News and Observer combined to form The News & Observer. It continues to be Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, was founded as a land-grant college in 1887. The city's Rex Hospital opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as Meredith College, opened in 1891, and in 1898, The Academy of Music, a private music conservatory, was established.\nIn the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and allies were unsuccessful. Based on a white supremacy campaign that returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote also disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office\u2014local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive in the state.\nIt was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. By that time many African Americans had left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for more opportunities. No African American was elected to Congress from North Carolina until 1992.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1912, Bloomsbury Park opened, featuring a popular carousel ride. Relocated to Pullen Park, the Pullen Park Carousel is still operating.\nFrom 1914 to 1917, an influenza epidemic killed 288 Raleighites.In 1922, WLAC signed on as the city's first radio station, but lasted only two years. WFBQ signed on in 1924 and became WPTF in 1927. It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster.\nFollowing immigration by Catholics, on December 12, 1924, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh was officially established by Pope Pius XI. The Sacred Heart Cathedral became the official seat of the diocese with William Joseph Hafey as its bishop.\nThe city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field, opened in 1929. That same year, the stock market crash resulted in six Raleigh banks closing.During the difficult 1930s of the Great Depression, government at all levels was integral to creating jobs. The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, Raleigh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated. The North Carolina Symphony, founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park. In 1939, the State General Assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority to build a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham, with the first flight occurring in 1943.\nIn 1947, Raleigh citizens adopted a council\u2013manager form of government, the current form. Council members are elected from single-member districts. They hire a city manager.\nThe Dorton Arena, a 7,610-seat multi-purpose arena designed by Matthew Nowicki, was opened in 1952 on the grounds of the North Carolina State Fair. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\nRaleigh experienced significant damage from Hurricane Hazel in 1954.\nIn 1953, WNAO-TV, channel 28, became the city's first television station, though it folded in 1957.\nWith the opening of the Research Triangle Park in 1959, Raleigh began to experience a population increase, resulting in a total city population of 100,000 by 1960. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Raleigh's population as 76.4% white and 23.4% black.Following the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the main achievements of the Civil Rights Movement and the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency, political participation and voting by African Americans in Raleigh increased rapidly.\nFrom the early-to-mid 20th century East Hargett Street was known as Raleigh's \"black main street\" and hosted numerous black-owned businesses. The area declined after the city desegregated its establishments.By the early 1970s people in Raleigh were growing increasingly concerned about growth and urban sprawl. Community organizations felt that municipal offices were being too heavily influenced by business interests when the city's population was rapidly growing and various development projects were being proposed. At their behest, the municipal elections were altered so that the mayor was to be directly elected, instead of being selected by the city council. Most city council seats were then made responsible to districts, instead of being held at-large. The 1973 elections were the first contests affected by the reforms. City Councilman Clarence Lightner defeated Raleigh Merchants bureau Executive Director G. Wesley Williams to become Raleigh's first black mayor, and thus the first black mayor in a major white-majority city in the South.In 1976, the Raleigh City and Wake County schools merged to become the Wake County Public School System, now the largest school system in the state and 19th largest in the country.During the 1970s and 1980s, the I-440 beltline was constructed, easing traffic congestion and providing access to most major city roads.\nThe first Raleigh Convention Center (replaced in 2008) and Fayetteville Street Mall were both opened in 1977. Fayetteville Street was turned into a pedestrian-only street in an effort to help the then-ailing downtown area, but the plan was flawed and business declined for years to come. Fayetteville Street was reopened in 2007 as the main thoroughfare of Raleigh's downtown.The 1988 Raleigh tornado outbreak of November 28, 1988, was the most destructive of the seven tornadoes reported in Northeastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia between 1:00 AM and 5:45 AM. The Raleigh tornado produced over $77 million in damage, along with four fatalities (two in the city of Raleigh, and two in Nash County) and 154 injuries. The damage path from the storm was measured at 84 miles (135 km) long, and .5 miles (0.8 km) wide at times. The tornado was rated F4.In 1991, two large skyscrapers in Raleigh were completed, First Union Capitol Center and Two Hannover Square, along with the popular Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek in Southeast Raleigh.\nIn 1996, the Olympic Flame passed through Raleigh while on its way to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Also in 1996, Hurricane Fran struck the area, causing massive flooding and extensive structural damage. In addition, WRAL-TV became the first High-Definition broadcast station in the world.\nIn 1997, the National Hockey League's Hartford Whalers announced their intention to move to Raleigh as the Carolina Hurricanes, becoming the city's first major league professional sports franchise.\nIn 1999, the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (later renamed the RBC Center and now called PNC Arena), opened to provide a home for the Hurricanes and the NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team, as well as an up-to-date major concert venue.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Raleigh was featured prominently in a number of \"Top 10 Lists\", including those by Forbes, MSNBC and Money magazine, due to its quality of life and favorable business climate.In 2001, the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium complex was expanded with the addition of the Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts, Meymandi Concert Hall, Fletcher Opera Theater, Kennedy Theatre, Betty Ray McCain Gallery and Lichtin Plaza.Fayetteville Street reopened to vehicular traffic in 2006. A variety of downtown building projects began around this time including the 34-story RBC Bank Tower, multiple condominium projects and several new restaurants. Additional skyscrapers are in the proposal/planning phase.\nIn 2006, the city's NHL franchise, the Carolina Hurricanes, won the Stanley Cup, North Carolina's first and only professional sports championship.\nWith the opening of parts of I-540 from 2005 to 2007, a new 70-mile (110 km) loop around Wake County, traffic congestion eased somewhat in the North Raleigh area. Completion of the entire loop is expected to take another 15 years.\nIn 2008, the city's Fayetteville Street Historic District joined the National Register of Historic Places.\nIn September 2010, Raleigh hosted the inaugural Hopscotch Music Festival.\nIn January 2011, Raleigh hosted the National Hockey League All-Star Game.\nIn April 2011, a devastating EF-3 tornado hit Raleigh, and many other tornadoes touched down in the state (ultimately the largest, but not the strongest outbreak to ever hit the state), killing 24 people. The tornado tracked northeast through parts of Downtown, East Central Raleigh and Northeast Raleigh and produced $115 million in damages in Wake County. There were 4 fatalities in the city.In September 2015 Holy Trinity Anglican Church was opened; the first church to be built in downtown Raleigh since 1958.On July 26, 2017 the Catholic Diocese of Raleigh dedicated its new cathedral, Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral, the fifth-largest in the United States.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Raleigh occupies a total area of 144.0 square miles (373.0 km2), of which 142 square miles (369 km2) is land and 0.97 square miles (2.5 km2), or 0.76%, is covered by water. The Neuse River flows through the northeast end of the city.\nRaleigh is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet. This area is known as the \"fall line\" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain. Its central Piedmont location situates Raleigh about two hours west of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, by car and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains. The city is 170 miles (270 km) south of Richmond, Virginia, 278 miles (447 km) south of Washington, D.C., and 166 miles (267 km) northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina. A small portion of the city is located in Durham County.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nRaleigh is divided into several major geographic areas, each of which use a Raleigh address and a ZIP code that begins with the digits 276. PNC Plaza, formerly known as RBC Plaza, is the largest and tallest skyscraper in the city of Raleigh. The tower rises to a height of 538 feet (164 m), with a floor count of 34.\n\n\n==== Downtown and inside-the-beltline neighborhoods ====\n\nThe downtown area is home to historic buildings such as the Sir Walter Raleigh Hotel built in the early 20th century, the restored City Market, the Fayetteville Street downtown business district, which includes the PNC Plaza and Wells Fargo Capitol Center buildings, as well as the North Carolina Museum of History, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, North Carolina State Capitol, William Peace University, the City of Raleigh Museum, Raleigh Convention Center, Shaw University, Campbell University School of Law, and St. Augustine's College. In the 2000s, an effort by the Downtown Raleigh Alliance was made to separate this area of the city into five smaller districts: Fayetteville Street, Moore Square, Glenwood South, Warehouse (Raleigh), and Capital District (Raleigh). Some of the names have become common place among locals such as the Warehouse, Fayetteville Street, and Glenwood South Districts.\nThe Inside the Beltline neighborhoods include Cameron Park, Boylan Heights, Country Club Hills, Coley Forest, Five Points, Budleigh, Glenwood-Brooklyn, Hayes Barton Historic District, Moore Square, Mordecai (home to the historic Mordecai House), Rochester Heights, South Park, Rosengarten Park, Belvidere Park, Woodcrest, Oberlin Village, and Historic Oakwood. Inside the Beltline refers to I-440 which used to be called the Beltline before being re-branded to ease driver navigation. These neighborhoods were typically built before World War II.\n\n\n==== Midtown Raleigh ====\n\nMidtown Raleigh is a residential and commercial area just North of the I-440 Beltline and is part of North Raleigh. It is roughly framed by Glenwood/Creedmoor Road to the West, Wake Forest Road to the East, and Millbrook Road to the North. It includes shopping centers such as North Hills and Crabtree Valley Mall. It also includes North Hills Park and part of the Raleigh Greenway System. The term was coined by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, developer John Kane and planning director Mitchell Silver. The News & Observer newspaper started using the term for marketing purposes only. The Midtown Raleigh Alliance was founded on July 25, 2011 as a way for community leaders to promote the area.\n\n\n==== East Raleigh ====\nEast Raleigh is situated roughly from Capital Boulevard near the I-440 beltline to New Hope Road. Most of East Raleigh's development is along primary corridors such as U.S. 1 (Capital Boulevard), New Bern Avenue, Poole Road, Buffaloe Road, and New Hope Road. Neighborhoods in East Raleigh include Hedingham, Longview, Lockwood, Madonna Acres, New Hope, Thompson-Hunter and Wilder's Grove.

Winters are short and generally cool, with a normal January daily mean temperature of 41.0 \u00b0F (5.0 \u00b0C). On average, there are 69 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 2.7 days that fail to rise above freezing. Raleigh receives an average annual rainfall of 43.34 inches (110.1 cm). Annual and monthly (temperature and) precipitation data are in chart below. April is the driest month, with an average of 2.92 inches (74.2 mm) of precipitation. Precipitation is well distributed around the year, with a slight maximum between July and September; on average, July is the wettest month, owing to generally frequent, sometimes heavy, showers and thunderstorms. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of 80.0 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C). There are 48 days per year with highs at or above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C). Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall, but greater potential for extremely heavy rainfall in a one/two day period, owing to occasional threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) packing torrential rainfall. In September 1999, Raleigh recorded its wettest month ever, with over 21 inches of rain, due to torrential rainfall from tropical weather systems, most notably Hurricane Floyd on September 15\u201316. Extremes in temperature have ranged from \u22129 \u00b0F (\u221223 \u00b0C) on January 21, 1985 up to 105 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C), most recently on June 29\u201330 and July 8, 2012. Raleigh falls in USDA hardiness zones 7b (5 \u00b0F to 10 \u00b0F) and 8a (10 \u00b0F to 15 \u00b0F).Raleigh receives an average of 6.0 inches (15.2 cm) of snow in winter. Freezing rain and sleet also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging ice storm. On January 24\u201325, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm \u2013 20.3 inches (52 cm) \u2013 the Winter Storm of January 2000. Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of cold air damming that affects the city due to its proximity to the Appalachian Mountains.  Winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well.\nThe region also experiences occasional periods of drought, during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience hurricanes. In 1996, Hurricane Fran caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees. Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in September 1999 were primary contributors to that month's extreme rainfall of over 21 inches. The most recent hurricane to have a considerable effect on the area was Hurricane Florence in 2018. Tornadoes also have on occasion affected the city of Raleigh, most notably the November 28, 1988 tornado which occurred in the early morning hours and rated an F4 on the Fujita Tornado Scale and affected northwestern portions of the city.

The I-440 route labeling formerly encompassed the entire loop around the city, co-numbered though South Raleigh with I-40. In 2002, the NCDOT removed the I-440 designation from the co-numbered I-40 (southern and southwestern) sections of the loop, and the directional signage on the remaining I-440 portion was changed from Inner/Outer to East/West. The route designation changes were made to avoid driver confusion over the Inner/Outer designations, especially with Raleigh's new \"Outer Beltline\", as I-540 has become known.\nI-540/NC 540 is currently under development.\nI-87, designated September 5, 2017, follows the former route of Interstate 495. It begins at the I-40/I-440 interchange southeast of Raleigh and runs east, meeting I-540 and terminating at Rolesville Road. It is entirely concurrent with US 64. When the route is completed it will link Raleigh to the Norfolk, Virginia area.\n\n\n====== Future ======\nInterstate 42 will begin at I-40 south of Raleigh and will follow US 70 to Morehead City.\n\n\n===== United States Highways =====\nU.S. Route 1 enters the city from the north along Capital Boulevard, joins I-440 around the west side of Raleigh, and leaves the city to the southwest as the US 1/US 64 expressway in Cary.\nU.S. Route 64 is the main east-west route through Raleigh; all segments share routes with another highway. East of the city, US-64/US-264 is known as the Knightdale Bypass. US 64 follows I-440 (as a wrong way concurrency) and I-40 along southern Raleigh, and US 1 to the southwest.  A former alignment, designated as Business US-64, follows New Bern Avenue from the I-440 Beltline to the eastern boundary of the city, where it continues into Knightdale.\nU.S. Route 70 runs roughly northwest-southeast through Raleigh. North of downtown, the route follows Glenwood Avenue into Durham. South of Raleigh, the route (along with US 401 and NC 50) follows South Saunders and South Wilmington Streets into Garner. Through downtown, US 70 uses small segments of several streets, including Wade Avenue, Capital Boulevard, Dawson, and McDowell Streets.\nU.S. Route 264 cosigned with US 64 through East Raleigh.\nU.S. Route 401 north of downtown Raleigh it follows Capital Boulevard and Louisburg Road. South of downtown it is cosigned with US 70 from Wade Avenue southward.\n\n\n===== North Carolina Highways =====\nN.C. Route 54 follows Chapel Hill Road and Hillsborough Street in West Raleigh. The route ends at its interchange with I-440.\nN.C. Route 50 is a north-south route through Raleigh. North of Raleigh it follows Creedmoor Road. NC 50 joins US 70 and later US 401 in downtown Raleigh. The three routes remain together through south Raleigh.\nN.C. Route 98, known as Durham Road in North Raleigh, traverses the extreme northern parts of the city.\n\n\n==== Intercity rail ====\n\nRaleigh's train station is one of Amtrak's busiest stops in the Southern U.S. The station is served by five passenger trains daily: the Silver Star, thrice-daily Piedmont service, and the Carolinian. Daily service is offered between Raleigh and:\n\nCharlotte, with intermediate stops including Cary, Durham, Burlington and Greensboro, North Carolina.\nNew York City, with intermediate stops including Richmond, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; and Philadelphia.\nMiami, with intermediate stops including Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia; as well as Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa, Florida.\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\nPublic transportation in and around Raleigh is provided by GoRaleigh, which operates 33 fixed bus routes, including the R-Line and the Wake-Forest Loop. Although there are 33 routes, some routes are designed to cover multiple other routes at times when they are not served. Depending on the time of the day, and the day of the week, the number of routes operating is between 5 and 29.\nRaleigh is also served by GoTriangle (known formerly as the Triangle Transit Authority, and Triangle Transit). GoTriangle offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Research Triangle Park and several of the region's larger suburban communities. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nNorth Carolina State University also maintains its own transit system, the Wolfline, that provides zero-fare bus service to the general public along multiple routes serving the university's campuses in southwest Raleigh.\nGovernment agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.\nFrom 1995 the cornerstone of Triangle Transit's long-term plan was a 28-mile rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections.\nThe region's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.Greyhound Lines provides an inter-city bus service to Durham, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and other cities.\n\n\n==== Bicycle and pedestrian ====\nThe Maine-to-Florida U.S. Bicycle Route#1 routes through suburban Raleigh, along with N.C. Bicycle Route #2, the \"Mountains To Sea\" route. As of September 2010, maps and signage for both US Bike Route #1 and NC Bike Route #2 are out-of-date for the Raleigh area. N.C. Bicycle Route #5 is routed nearby, connecting Apex to Wilmington and closely paralleling the NCBC Randonneurs 600 kilometer brevet route.\nMost public buses are equipped with bicycle racks, and some roads have dedicated bicycle-only lanes. Bicyclists and pedestrians also may use Raleigh's extensive greenway system, with paths and trails located throughout the city.\nIn May 2011, Raleigh was designated a Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists at the Bronze level.\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Raleigh 36th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.\nIn 2002, the \"Walk [Your City]\" initiative was started in the city which provides a tool kit for neighborhood organizations to post signs giving a distance by bike or foot, with directions in scannable QR code. The movement has spread to more than 400 communities in 55 countries.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\nThe Raleigh Fire Department provides fire protection throughout the city. The North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women, the state's primary correctional facility housing female inmates is based in Raleigh.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nRaleigh has several sister cities:\n Xiangyang, Hubei, China\n Compi\u00e8gne, Oise, Hauts-de-France, France\n Kingston upon Hull, England, United Kingdom\n Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany\n Nairobi, Kenya\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of capitals in the United States\nList of municipalities in North Carolina\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Wake County, North Carolina\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nAmis, Moses N.

          "I'm glad Raleigh has its own museum separate from the State Museum of History. But actually only a small portion of the museum is dedicated to a history of the city. The rest is for temporary displays. The display I saw was about local political cartoonist Dwayne Powell. And",

        "wiki": "Lake Crabtree County Park is a park in Wake County, North Carolina.  It is a forested area between Cary, Morrisville, and Raleigh-Durham International Airport, bounded by the northeastern shore of Lake Crabtree, I-40, and Aviation Parkway.  The main entrance is on the Aviation Parkway side and is equipped with two playgrounds (for different age groups), a boat dock (as well as rentable sailboats), bathrooms, an observation tower, and other amenities.  A system of hiking and biking trails crosses through the park, with the most used one (especially by hikers) along the lakeshore.  This trail connects the park entrance to the Black Creek Greenway-Old Reedy Creek Road intersection, near the entrance to William B. Umstead State Park. \nSince 2012, Lake Crabtree County Park has been a host venue for the Valor Games Southeast, a three-day adapted-sports competition for veterans and members of the Armed Forces with disabilities. The park features a wheelchair accessible dock providing unparalleled access to the water for people with disabilities. Since 2016, Lake Crabtree is home to the NC State University Sailing Team, and the host venue for the SailPack Women's Intercollegiate Regatta, as well as the Triangle Tango Regatta, a co-ed fleet racing event, both held in the fall. Community Sailing is a featured activity during the summer at the Lake. The RTP High School sailing program is also located at Lake Crabtree and hosts interscholastic regattas on site.  \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPark website\nWake County Parks, Recreation, and Open Space\nBridge II Sports - Valor Games Southeast\nNC State University Sailing Team\nRTP High School Sailing",

        "wiki": "Roanoke Island () is an island in Dare County on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, United States. It was named after the historical Roanoke Carolina Algonquian people who inhabited the area in the 16th century at the time of English exploration.\nAbout 8 mi (13 km) long and 2 mi (3.2 km) wide, the island lies between the mainland and the barrier islands near Nags Head. Albemarle Sound lies on its north, Roanoke Sound on the eastern, Croatan Sound on the west, and Wanchese CDP lies at the southern end. The town of Manteo is located on the northern portion of the island, and is the county seat of Dare County. Fort Raleigh National Historic Site is on the north end of the island. The island has a land area of 17.95 square miles (46.5 km2) and a population of 6,724 as of the 2000 census.\nLocated along U.S. Highway 64, a major highway from mainland North Carolina to the Outer Banks, Roanoke Island combines recreational and water features with historical sites and an outdoor theater to form one of the major tourist attractions of Dare County.\nThe residents of Roanoke Island are governed by the Dare County Board of Commissioners. They are located within Congressional District 1 of North Carolina.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of Roanoke Island comes from the Roanoke who originally resided on the island for at least 800 years prior to the coming of the English in the New World. The meaning of the word Roanoke itself is derived from the Powhowten language which was geographically close to the Roanoke. Roanoke means \"white beads made from shells\" (or more literally \"things rubbed smooth by hand\"). White beads were used as ornaments and currency for the Coastal Algonquin peoples of Virginia and North Carolina. One of the first governors of Jamestown, Virginia, John Smith records the usage of the word Rawrenock in the Algonquin Powhowaten language.\n\nCuscarawaoke, where is made so much Rawranoke or white beads that occasion as much dissention among the savages, as gold and silver amongst Christians ....\nIn the context of the quote, Rawranoke refers to the items being traded, not people. Roanoke People, were therefore known for the trade of shells that are part of Roanoke Island and the other barrier islands of the Outer Banks. The Roanoke People may have created and exported the white beads and shells abroad.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nIt was, for thousands of years, the site of ancient indigenous settlements. Archeological excavations in 1983 at the Tillett Site at Wanchese have revealed evidence of various cultures dating back to 8000 BC. Wanchese was used as a seasonal fishing village for 1500 years before English colonial settlement. Ancestors of the Algonquian-speaking Roanoke coalesced as a people in about 400.Roanoke Island was the site of the Roanoke Colony, an English settlement initially established in 1585 by Sir Walter Raleigh. A group of about 120 men, women and children arrived in 1587. Shortly after arriving in this New World, colonist Eleanor Dare, daughter of Governor John White, gave birth to Virginia Dare. She was the first English child born in North America. Governor White returned to England later that year for supplies. Due to impending war with Spain, White was unable to return to Roanoke Island until 1590. When he arrived, the colony had vanished. The fate of those first colonists remains a mystery to this day and is one of America's most intriguing unsolved mysteries. Archaeologists, historians, and other researchers continue to work to resolve the mystery. Visitors to the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site can watch The Lost Colony, the second-longest-running outdoor theatre production in the United States, which presents a conjecture of the fate of Roanoke Colony.\nRoanoke Island is one of the three oldest surviving English place-names in the U.S. Along with the Chowan and Neuse rivers, it was named in 1584 by Captains Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe, sent by Sir Walter Raleigh.Another colony, more populous than that of Raleigh, was developed at the island during the American Civil War. After Union forces took over the island in 1862, slaves migrated there for relative freedom, as they were considered contraband by the military, who would not return them to the Confederates. The Army established the Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony in 1863, an important social experiment as part of the US government's developing policies related to the future of the slaves in freedom. The Congregational chaplain Horace James was appointed superintendent of the colony and of other contraband camps in North Carolina. With a view to making it self-sustaining, he had a sawmill built, and freedmen were allotted lands to cultivate. Those who worked for the Army were paid wages. When the United States Colored Troops were founded, many men from the colony enlisted. A corps of Northern teachers was sponsored by the American Missionary Association, and they taught hundreds of students of all ages at the colony.\n\n\n=== Geological formation and Pre-Columbian settlement ===\nSee also Roanoke People and Croatan People.\nThe North Carolinian Coast began to shape into its present form as the Outer Banks Barrier Islands. Previously the North Carolina Coast had extended 50 miles eastward to the edge of the continental shelf. The melting of Northern Hemisphere Glaciers at least 14,000 years ago caused sea levels to rise. The Outer Banks and by extension the land of Roanoke Island began to stabilize around 6,000 B.C. Roanoke Island was originally a large dune ridge facing the Atlantic coastline.Archaeological discoveries at the Tillett site of Wanchese, North Carolina have dated the human occupation of Roanoke Island's land at 8,000 B.C. At the time Native Americans across North America were developing in the Archaic Period. Archaeologists discovered that the land of Roanoke Island was part of the Mainland when it was first inhabited by the first Native Americans. For thousands of years the development of Native Cultures on Roanoke Island corresponded with cultures occurring in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina.\nAround the year 400 AD the area experienced environmental transformation. The sand dune of Roanoke became disconnected from the mainland by water, and inlets in the Outer Banks turned fresh water sounds (lagoons) into brackish ecosystems.  From approximately the years 460 AD to 800 AD the Mount Pleasant Culture had a village on the Tillett Site in southern Roanoke Island within the modern day Wanchese township. After the year 800 AD the village was occupied by the Colington Culture, the Colington Culture was the predecessor to the Roanoke Tribe who were encountered by the 1584 English Expedition.\nThe Roanoke People of the Tillett site had a semi-seasonal life style inhabiting the area from early Spring to early Fall, primarily the village existed for fishing. Shellfish was the main diet of the inhabitants with oysters and clams being the most common food source. Plants including acorns and hackberry nuts. Ronaoke Indians had smoking pipes and used plants such as Cleaver and Plaintain seeds for medicinal purposes. Four burials of Roanoke Indians of various social positions have been found at the site. Roanoke believed that their great warriors and kings lived on in the afterlife but commoners lived only a mortal existence.There were other villages on Roanoke Island prior to European contact, as indicated by English maps and written accounts. Englishman Arthur Barlowe described a palisaded town with nine houses made of Cedar bark on the far north end of Roanoke Island. This second village according to historian David Stick was based on hunting of land animals. All Ronaoke Island villages were likely outlying tributaries of the Sectoan's capital, Dasamonguepeuk, located on the western shore of the Croatan Sound in the modern day mainland of Dare County. Upon contact with the English the Roanoke Tribe had anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 members. The Roanoke Tribe, like many other tribes in the area were loyal to the Secotan. In 1584 Wingina was their king.\n\n\n=== The first colony ===\n\nRoanoke Island was the site of the 16th-century Roanoke Colony, the first English colony in the New World. It was located in what was then called Virginia, named in honor of England's ruling monarch and \"Virgin Queen\", Elizabeth I.\nWhen the English first arrived in 1584, they were accompanied by a Croatoan native and a Roanoke native called Manteo and Wanchese respectively. The two men made history as the first two Native Americans to visit the Kingdom of England as distinguished guests. For over a year they resided in London. On the return journey, the two men witnessed English pirates plundering the Spanish West Indies.\nEnglish Scientist Thomas Harriot recorded the sense of awe with which the Native Americans viewed European technology:\n\nManteo took especially great interest in Western culture, learning the English language and helping Harriot create a phonetic transcription for the Croatoan language. By contrast, Wanchese came to see the English as his captors; upon returning home in 1585, he urged his people to resist colonization at all costs. The legacy of the two Indians and their distinct roles as collaborators and antagonists to the English inspired the names of Roanoke's towns.\nThe first attempted settlement was headed by Ralph Lane in 1585. Sir Richard Grenville had transported the colonists to Virginia and returned to England for supplies as planned. The colonists were desperately in need of supplies, and Grenville's return was delayed. While awaiting his return, the colonists relied heavily upon a local Algonquian tribe. In an effort to gain more food supplies, Lane led an unprovoked attack, killing the Secotan tribe's chieftain Wingina and effectively cutting off the colony's primary food source.As a result, when Sir Francis Drake put in at Roanoke after attacking the Spanish colony of St. Augustine, the entire population abandoned the colony and returned with Drake to England. Sir Richard Grenville later arrived with supplies, only to find Lane's colony abandoned. Grenville returned to England with a Native American he named Raleigh, leaving fifteen soldiers to guard the fort. The soldiers were later killed or driven away by a Roanoke raid led by Wanchese.\n\nIn 1587, the English tried to settle Roanoke Island again, this time led by John White. At that time the Secotan Tribe and their Roanoke dependents were totally hostile to the English, but the Croatoan remained friendly. Manteo remained aligned with the English and attempted to bring the English and his Croatoan tribe together, even after the newcomers mistakenly killed his mother, who was also the Croatoan chief. After the incident Manteo was baptized into the Anglican Church. Manteo was then assigned by the English to be representative of all of the Native nations in the region; this title was mainly symbolic, as only the Croatoan nation followed Manteo. John White, father of the colonist Eleanor Dare and grandfather to Virginia Dare, the first English child born in the New World, left the colony to return to England for supplies. He expected to return to Roanoke Island within three months.\nBy this time, England itself was under threat of a massive Spanish invasion, and all ships were confiscated for use in defending the English Channel. White's return to Roanoke Island was delayed until 1590, by which time all the colonists had disappeared. The whereabouts of Wanchese and Manteo after the 1587 settlement attempt were also unknown. The only clue White found was the word \"CROATOAN\" carved into a post, as well as the letters \"CRO\" carved into a tree.  Before leaving the colony three years earlier, White had left instructions that if the colonists left the settlement, they were to carve the name of their destination, with a Maltese cross if they left due to danger.\"Croatoan\" was the name of an island to the south (modern-day Hatteras Island) where the Croatoan people, still friendly to the English, were known to live. However, foul weather kept White from venturing south to Croatoan to search for the colonists, so he returned to England. White never returned to the New World. Unable to determine exactly what happened, people referred to the abandoned settlement as \"The Lost Colony.\"\nIn the book A New Voyage to Carolina (1709), the explorer John Lawson claimed that the ruins of the Lost Colony were still visible:\n\nLawson also claimed the natives on Hatteras island claimed to be descendants of \"white people\" and had inherited physical markers relating them to Europeans that no other tribe encountered on his journey shared:\n\nFrom the time of the disappearance of the Lost Colony in 1587 to the Battle of Roanoke Island in 1862, Roanoke was largely isolated due to its weather and geography. Sand shoals on the Outer Banks and the North American continental shelf made navigation dangerous, and the lack of a deep-water harbor prevented Roanoke from becoming a major colonial port.\n\n\n=== Intermediate years ===\nAlso see: Province of Carolina and Province of North Carolina\nAfter the failure of the English Roanoke Colony, Native peoples on the island endured for seventy more years. Archaeology from the Tilliet site indicates that the Roanoke population persisted until 1650. Written accounts indicate visible remnants of the final native presence which survived long after the end of the island's native population. A large mound 200 feet tall and 600 feet wide was recorded to exist in Wanchese in the early 1900s; now little evidence remains.The 1650 extinction date corresponds with the final war between the Powhatan Tribe and the Jamestown Colony that took place in 1646. Invaders from Virginia drove the Secotan Tribe out of Outer Banks region.\nSurvivors of the English Invasion fled southwards and became the Machapunga. The Machapunga fought alongside the Tuscarora Indians against English encroachment in 1711. After their defeat most Machapunga settled and adapted to English lifestyle around Hyde County, North Carolina, other Machupunga fled northwards to join the Iroquois Confederation. The North Carolina descendants continued to carry some native customs until 1900 and now live in the Inner Banks of North Carolina.\nSome in the former Croatoan Tribe went to Hatteras Island prior to 1650, maintained good relations with the English and were granted a reservation in 1759. Descendants of the Croatoan-Hatteras tribes later merged with English Communities. The 2000 federal census found that 83 descendants from the Roanoke and Hatteras Tribe lived in Dare County. Others lived in the states of New York, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nWith Roanoke Island open for settlement, English Virginians moved from Tidewater Virginia to Northeast North Carolina's Albremarle Region. In 1665, The Carolina Charter established the colony of Carolina under a rule of landowners called the Lord Proprietors. Carolina under its original name Carolana  included the territory of modern North and South Carolina.  Early organized English towns in North Carolina include Elizabeth City and Edenton. Pioneers crossed southwards across the Albremarle Sound to settle in Roanoke Island. They came primarily to establish fishing communities but also practiced forms of subsistence agriculture on the Northern parts of Roanoke Island. Most of the Pioneers had originally immigrated to the American Colonies from Southern English Parishes such as Kent, Middlesex and the West Country. Upon the creation of the Royal British Province of North Carolina in 1729, Roanoke Island became part of Currituck County. During the rule of the Lord Proprietors, Roanoke Island had been a part of the earlier Currituck Parish. It was during this time that historical families arrived including the Basnights, Daniels, Ehteridge, Owens, Tillets and others.\nOwnership at first belonged to the original Lord Proprietors, who had never visited the area even as Englishmen, and they began to build houses. The Island was owned by both Carolina Governor Sam'L Stevens and Virginian Governor Joshua Lamb. Joshua Lamb inherited the island by marrying Sam'L Steven's widow. The property was then sold and divided to a series of merchants from Boston (then part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony). Ownership by distant, far-away property holders continued until at least the 1750s. A Bostonian by the name of Bletcher Noyes gave power of attorney of his property to local William Daniels. English legal documents indicate the actual presence of settlers in 1676, with the possibility that the first Englishmen had made permanent homes much earlier.There were no incorporated towns until Manteo was founded in 1899. From the 1650s to the Civil War period, the Virginia settlers developed a distinct Hoi Toider dialect across the Outer Banks. The island was ill-suited for commercial agriculture or for a deep water port and remained isolated with little interference from outsiders. The nearby community of Manns Harbor came into being as a small trading post where goods were transported across the Croatan Sound. Unlike inland North Carolina, the British authorities made no roads within or nearby Roanoke and the Tidewater region of North Carolina was avoided entirely. The development of colonial Roanoke Island also depended on the natural opening and closing of inlets on Bodi and Hatteras Islands to its east. As at other times, the Island was also struck by deadly hurricanes.\nDuring the Revolutionary War there were eight recorded encounters fought in nearby Hatteras, Ocracoke and the High Seas. These battles were between local privateers from Edenton against the British Royal Navy. The Royal Navy often had little place to rest during their coastal patrol duty. On August 15, 1776 a British patrol sent foragers to the now extinct Roanoke Inlet in modern-day Nags Head to steal cattle. The Outer Banks Independent Company who was guarding Roanoke Island killed and/or captured the entire party. This battle, while not on Roanoke Island itself, was less than three miles away. Skirmishes involving ships continued until 1780 but no large land battles occurred in the area. Roanoke Island itself was largely spared from war violence and independence for the United States had little effect on local residents.Thirty years later during the War of 1812 the British Royal Navy planned for an Invasion of North Carolina's Outer Banks. The invasion was aborted on Hattaras Island because it was deemed there was nothing worthwhile for the British to occupy or pillage. The force then moved northward to attack Chesapeake Bay communities in Virginia. Roanoke Island continued its isolation until authorities of the Confederate States of America hastily prepared Roanoke Island to defend Coastal North Carolina from the invading Unionist Navy and Army. After passing by Cape Hatteras Union forces attacked Roanoke Island in 1862.\n\n\n=== Civil War years ===\n\nMain Articles: Battle of Roanoke Island and Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island\nDuring the American Civil War, the Confederacy fortified the island with three forts.  The Battle of Roanoke Island (February 7\u20138, 1862) was an incident in the Union North Carolina Expedition of January to July 1862, when Brigadier General Ambrose E. Burnside landed an amphibious force and took Confederate forts on the island.  Afterward, the Union Army retained the three Confederate forts, renaming them for the Union generals who had commanded the winning forces:  Huger became Fort Reno; Blanchard became Fort Parke; and Bartow became Fort Foster. After the Confederacy lost the forts, the Confederate Secretary of War, Judah P. Benjamin, resigned. Roanoke Island was occupied by Union forces for the duration of the war, through 1865.\nThe African slaves from the island and the mainland of North Carolina fled to the Union-occupied area with hopes of gaining freedom. By 1863, numerous former slaves were living on the fringe of the Union camp. The Union Army had classified the former enslaved as \"contrabands,\" and determined not to return them to Confederate slaveholders.  The freedmen founded churches in their settlement and started what was likely the first free school for blacks in North Carolina.\nHorace James, an experienced Congregational chaplain, was appointed by the US Army in 1863 as \"Superintendent for Negro Affairs in the North Carolina District.\" He was responsible for the Trent River contraband camp at New Bern, North Carolina, where he was based.  He also was ordered to create a self-sustaining colony at Roanoke Island  and thought it had the potential to be a model for a new society in which African Americans would have freedom.In addition to serving the original residents and recent migrants, the Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony was to be a refuge for the families of freedmen who enlisted in the Union Army as United States Colored Troops. By 1864, there were more than 2200 freedmen on the island.\nUnder James, the freedmen were allocated plots of land per household, and paid for work for the Army. He established a sawmill on the island and a fisheries, and began to market the many highly skilled crafts by freed people artisans. James believed the colony was a critical social experiment in free labor and a potential model for resettling freedmen on their own lands. Northern missionary teachers, mostly women from New England, journeyed to the island to teach reading and writing to both children and adults, who were eager for education. A total of 27 teachers served the island, with a core group of about six.The colony and Union troops had difficulty with overcrowding, poor sanitation, limited food and disease in its last year. The freedmen had found that the soil was too poor to support subsistence farming for so many people. In late 1865 after the end of the war, the Army dismantled the forts on Roanoke. In 1865, President Andrew Johnson issued an \"Amnesty Proclamation,\" ordering the return of property by the Union Army to former Confederate landowners. Most of the 100 contraband camps in the South were on former Confederate land. At Roanoke Island, the freedmen had never been given title to their plots, and the land was reverted to previous European-American owners.\nMost freedmen chose to leave the island, and the Army arranged for their transportation to towns and counties on the mainland, where they looked for work. By 1867 the Army had abandoned the colony. In 1870 only 300 freedmen were living on the island. Some of their descendants still live there.\n\n\n=== Postbellum period: becoming the seat of Dare County ===\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War the area which is today Dare County was still split between Tyrell, Currituck and Hyde. Roanoke remained a part of Currituck.\nIn 1870 Dare County being named after the famous Virginia Dare became independent from the surrounding areas. Originally in April 1870 The Town of Roanoke Island was christened as the County Seat. In May of that year the town's name was changed to Manteo. The town of Manteo was the first place on in Dare County to have a federal post office. Roanoke Island went from being the outpost of Currituck to being the center of power in the new county. Dare County was allocated lands which included the Mainland, Roanoke Island and the beaches from Cape Hatteras upwards towards Duck.Outside Interest in the history of the Roanoke Island took hold for the first time. The State of the North Carolina protected the historical Fort Raleigh Site that had been the location of the 1584 and 1585 English expeditions. N.C State Senator Zebulon Vance attempted to build a monument in honor of the Colony in 1886 but was rebuffed by Congress because the bill would have distracted attention from Plymouth, Massachusetts.\nThe Town of Manteo grew as the center of business in Dare County, though it was not even the largest community in the county at the time. Buffalo City on the mainland had over 3,000 on the mainland but the community faded after the 1930s. Manteo while technically a new town was a combination of estates of landowners who had already resided on the island for two centuries. The organization of the town did spur new growth, as it became a central hub for the area. The waterfront become a bustling port with a network to Buffalo City, Edenton and Elizabeth City. Local fisherman, boat builders and landowners built fortunes whose wealth was later redistributed into new development.\nThere are five historically registered sites within Downtown Manteo all constructed during the turn of the 20th century. At the time Manteo carried a North American styled Queen Ann architecture combined with unique elements that reflected its coastal Environment. Churches such as Mount Olivet Methodist and Manteo Baptist were early community centers that guided local life. The construction of the island's first Court House symbolized the permanence of organized government. Manteo became Roanoke Island's only incorporated town in 1899.As seasonal tourists began to take interest Roanoke became more aligned with the national American culture. In 1917 the Pioneer Theater was established showing movies from around the country, the theater remains in existence as one of America's remaining small theaters. The transition from a wholly subsistence to a partial consumer economy began to gradually take place on the eve of the construction of the first bridge.\n\n\n=== The first bridge ===\n\nThe communities of Roanoke were transformed by the construction of the first bridge connecting the island eastwards to Nags Head in 1924. For the first time, automobiles were introduced where travel by water or horse had been previously more common.  The Baum bridge marked the first time that higher level infrastructure had been brought to the island. The 1924 bridge would be the only road connection to Roanoke Island for over thirty years. Around the same time, NC 345, Roanoke Island's first paved road for automobiles, was built and covered the entire extent of the land from the marshes of Wanchese to the Northend. The north edge of NC 345 corresponded with a ferry that went to Manns Harbor on the mainland. The North Carolina department of transportation subsidized the Roanoke Island ferry in 1934 to lower ticket costs and this was origin of the modern N.C ferry system.Both Manteo in the north and Wanchese to the south were transformed by the construction of the first Nags Head bridge. Manteo which had previously been a small port reliant on trade with Elizabeth City and Edenton was now connected to a wider transportation network in both the North Carolina and Virginian Tidewater regions. The docks of Downtown Manteo began to decline as the bridge road became the center of commerce. Roanoke Island became industrialized for the first time in Wanchese. In 1936 the Wanchese Fish Cooperation was incorporated by the Daniels family as a processing and packing plant for fish, scallops and shrimp.\nAs Roanoke was introduced to the national market economy by the bridge, its fishing sales and local economy suffered from the Great Depression. Another blow was dealt in a 1933 Outer Banks Hurricane that made landfall in Hatteras before moving northwards toward Nova Scotia. Over 1,000 people lost their homes across Eastern North Carolina and 24 fatalities were reported. The waterfront of Manteo was destroyed by a severe fire in 1939.\nIn response to the crisis, the New Deal came to Roanoke Island to provide desperately needed employment and to highlight Roanoke's importance to the history of the United States. The outdoor theater play The Lost Colony written by Paul Green, began in 1936 and attracted the visit of President Franklin Roosevelt in 1937. The Lost Colony continues its performance every summer season. The onset of WWII with the German declaration of war in December, 1941 affected the island directly.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nIn 2001, Dare County erected a marble monument to the Freedmen's Colony at the Fort Raleigh Historic Site.\nIt is listed as a site within the National Underground Railroad to Freedom Network of the National Park Service.\nHome and burial place of Andy Griffith\n\n\n== The \"Mother Vine\" ==\nPossibly the oldest cultivated grapevine in the world is the 400-year-old scuppernong \"Mother Vine\" growing on Roanoke Island.

          "This was another enthralling national historic site. It's actually historic for many different reasons. It was military, an underground railroad stop, involved in the beginning of radio, and of course, the lost colony, also the name of the movie we watched. My boys did the",

          "Beautiful site with tasteful/informative displays. Started our tour with a 15 min movie then moved through the displays in another 15 min. As with all NPS sites, we learned a lot and left content that our tax dollars are being well spent. Recommendation: plan to stay for at",

          "First time here. Learned a lot, we will come back when we have more time now that we know what\u2019s here. We watched a short film and learned a lot",
          "Fort Raleigh is a very interesting historic site. The play \"The Lost Colony\" also goes on during the summer. There is a small museum describing the history of the area. You can then walk around and see the remains of the fort. It is a small park so, unless you see the play, you",
          "Had a great afternoon walking around Fort Raleigh. A beautiful afternoon and the Fort area was very clean and laid out well.",

          "The Park Rangers were very good as they all seem to be at any National Park. The exhibit hall and show were very well done. The place was not mobbed, which was good, I don't like crowds. If you're coming to the Outer Banks, you should pick up a bit of history that is really the",
          "Medley of exhibits about the area\u2019s history. Various methods of delivery interesting information. Rangers were very interesting and informative with visitors of all ages.",
          "Really interesting for the whole family. Go and watch the 17 minute film first which explains what happened in the first colony. As others have said, not much to see but it's amazing to think that this was the first settlement and intriguing to think what did actually happen",
          "It's good to commemorate this first attempt at English settlement in the New World. It's also a great story. Problem is no one is for sure this was where the settlement was. It was probably close but the earthwork is a reconstruction. Outside of this, there's not much more to",
          "The exhibits and movie were quite interesting. I learned some things that I didn't know about the Lost Colony area. The employees were all so friendly and were willing to listen to my husband talk about history. (He really appreciated them taking time for him.) I didn't realize",

          "Two captivating stories in one historic site! The Park Rangers presented the story of the Lost Colony of Roanoke Island and the Freedman's Colony. It was hot and sticky and the flies were biting, but the history was amazing. Of course the Lost Colony story is familiar, but I",

          "Nice movie dramatizing the lost colony and exhibits plus history of the area. Trails to earthen works interesting plus ranger talks.",
          "We took the time to view the video and it was very informative. The artifacts were also well displayed.",
          "First time visit after 20 years of going to Nags Head and Manteo. For history buffs, take your time and walk the trails out through the pine forest. Take time to imagine what took place on this small piece of land. Excellent museum and staff.",
          "My wife and I are very interested in the history of the lost colony. We expected a lot more out of the site here, but were ultimately underwhelmed. There is definitely a wonderful amount of history here, including quite a few things we didn't know such as the Freedman Colony,",
          "This visitor center has a very good video giving background history of the site, as well as some archaeological artifacts. The various theories about the fate of the Lost Colony are explained. We wished that there were more of the artifacts that have been found over the years on",

          "I have always wanted to learn more about the area so this was a must see for me. I was very impressed how the Ranger interacted with my 6 and 7 year old grandchildren. The exhibits are very good and the film really explainded the story. We took the walk on the nature trail",
          "Since a child, I was fascinated by the story of the lost colony. To actually visit was a dream. The visitor center is well stocked with exhibits, an informative movie and a store. There are regularly scheduled ranger talks- check at desk for details.",
          "The mystery remains a mystery but I learned quite a bit about the Lost Colony and events of the time. Rain kept my outdoor exploration to a minimum but I did explore a bit and the museum was very informative.",

          "I've always been fascinated by the Lost Colony. And I adore history. This was the perfect place to start our vacation on the Outer Banks. The ranger talk was great and he told us about a local link to the Dare Stones - another fascinating part to this mystery! The museum is",
          "I visited Fort Raleigh National Historic Site on Roanoke Island in the town of Manteo on my 2nd day here. It is a must to see for history buffs. The visitor center houses a good exhibit collection, short film and gift shop. The grounds itself are where the English colonists",
          "Super interesting but more so because of the history of the place rather than what was actually there. The visitors center had good info and knowledgeable staff and it was cool to see the remnants but there\u2019s not a whole lot else.",
          "Great place to visit with interesting history! Teach the kids a little history while on vacation! Why did the colonists vanish? No one knows!!",
          "The Junior Ranger book is arranged to make good historical connections but make sure to allow at least 1 hour to complete them, you pick them up at the fort. Friendly rangers. The walkways were varied, some had ground up rubber matting and some were gravel.",
          "I learned something new. I did not realize that the Lost Colony was established on Roanoke Island and the OBX protected the first settlers from the hurricanes. There was a very peaceful park. After parking our car, we discovered the visitor center was closed owing to a",
          "It's one of my favorite parts of our annual Outer Banx trip. If you love history, its awesome. If you don't know your history, it's a must see!",
          "It's shouldn't be surprising that there isn't much left from a settlement from over 400 years ago, especially since they went missing. However, the visitor center is really quite good and modern, and the grounds enjoyable to walk with sea-side access. Come during the summer",
          "This is the site of a small fort constructed by the original colonists of the first English attempt to settle North America. The actual site of the colony is unknown. The site itself is a bit underwhelming, just a star-shaped earthworks that was about 40 feet across. The",
          "This being our first time in the OBX, we wanted to get a much info on the area as possible. Also, the list colony has always been interesting to us. The visitor's center was extremely nice with an informative video and plenty of artifacts for a colony that just disappeared.",
          "Learned all kinds of stuff that School House Rock left out. This was the first place that England tried to colonize, only a hundred years after Columbus' discovery when Queen Elizabeth I was ruling (think Shakespeare.) Friendly native Americans tried to help the newcomers,",
          "This is a nice quiet place for walking, it not a lot to see here if you are not going to the theatre",
          "We looked about but site was not much without the play. We toured the welcome center and digs. The place was a bit disappointing.",
          "Not really sure what I expected to see here, but I really saw nothing. The fort is nothing more than a mound of dirt. We were too late in the year to catch the play, and there was little else there. They did however have some good walking trails. I wouldn't go back.",
          "The video presentation and displays were interesting and informative. It's nice that this site is free so everyone can see this important part of American history.",
          "Very nice staff and helpful too. The grounds at Fort Raleigh are lush and beautiful. There are signs along the paths to explain what happened where you are standing. Take bug spray.",
          "This national park is free and should not be missed if you are interested in history. There is a very interesting museum full of artifacts and a film that explains what happened at Roanoke. You can walk to see some ruins and the stage for the outdoor play The Lost Colony if it",
          "This free museum is small but has well designed, informative, and interactive exhibits, as well a movie about the lost colony of Roanoke and a tour of the old fort site. The nature trails lead all around the site and to the beach. The A/C feels great on a hot day and the staff",
          "You can walk the trails and view the archeology that has occured on the site. It is an on going mystery with several theories of possible outcomes. There is a play, the Lost Colony, that has been around for over 80 years.",
          "Don't miss this National Park with a beautiful forest and available hikes.This is the site of an original colony that was forgotten by England for a few years.",
          "When I was a kid growing up 3 hours from here I always wanted to experience Manteo and the Lost Colony. As an adult I could have waited longer. If this is where the colony settled and eventually disappeared, I would expect more information about a great mystery in the state of",
          "Fort Raleigh National Historic Site is a wonderful place. Its small but packed with a lot of history. A visit there is well worth your time. There are several short hiking paths that snake through the grounds. The Visitors Center has very good information about the site and the",
          "Yes, interesting, not outstanding. Like the visitors center, but it\u2019s a small building. Everything very well presented. Nice gardens. The theater was nice for the kids, they played on the set for hours. Looking forward to catch a play Good for bringing your picnic and find one",
          "Unless you are attending the outdoor drama put on every evening for a considerable cost, there isn't much to see here. The visitor center is good though with fine artifacts and facts about England's first attempt at colonizing the New World. The 17 minute film is also good.",
          "I started at the visitor center and saw the 17 minute movie which gave a good introduction to the Lost Colony story. Then I took a look at the other exhibits. As I was finishing up, a park ranger announced she was about to give a talk, so we all followed her outside to an area",
          "Great visitors center, informative interesting 17 minute movie about the Lost Colony. We walked to the remains of the old fort and saw the theater where the Lost Colony play is presented each evening. Best part was the outdoor talk in a seated area by the Ranger He presented",
          "Went to this site mainly to learn about the Freedmen's Colony and Ranger Byron did not fail to provide its history. Learned a lot about how the slaves found freedom on this island located south of the Mason-Dixon Line, during the Civil War. Loved the monument for the Freedmen's",
          "My kids really enjoyed the visitor center. Not a huge place but didn\u2019t need to be. Several hands on items & lots of interesting history. The small path outside was about perfect for them on a hot day... This portion is free but if you, realize the play does cost, there is also a",
          "We drove from Nags Head, across the bridge to Roanoke Island, and up the middle of the island to Fort Raleigh National Park. The visitor center had a film about the Lost Colony settled by the English is 1595. We heard a national park interpreter tell about the colony and the",
          "In the welcome center, we were warmly greeted and directed toward an area where a park ranger was giving a quick history lesson. He was very knowledgeable and ended with a very positive message. The grounds seemed nice, but we were unable to see all of it.",
          "We had a wonderful ranger give us an hour lesson on the first settlers and the lost colony. He knew a great deal of information and clearly loved his job!",
          "A nice place to visit to learn more about the first English settlement. Ronoake Island is such a mystery and the disappearance of the first settlers. There is a welcome center with displays, video and information to read. Outside you will see an earthworks, trail's and",
          "The rangers were very knowledgeable and the short video brought things together well. Thought there might be a little more there. But very informative.",
          "I am quite interested in history, so drove all the way out to this place only to discover that there is NOTHING there. The visitors center has a reasonable explanation of what had happened there, but one could stay home and read a book or an internet explanation and save the",
          "The kids had no idea about this part of our history! Public schools seem to be very poor with American history. The kids were very interested in learning about this episode in time and we augmented their curiosity with several books from the gift shop",
          "Expected a little more from this. The hut where they talk about the area is adequate and very friendly and then we walked out to the amphitheater which isn\u2019t a long walk. The recreated earth mounds were a little anticlimactic. Overall just a nice stroll through the woods tho.",
          "Really interesting to see where the colony of Roanoke started out. There was also a marker commemorating Virginia Dare. The visitor center was also really neat also.",
          "What American child was not spell-bound in grade school by the mystery of Roanoke? Probably every American schoolchild for the last 100 years was taught about this enigma of history. With that kind of tail wind, you would expect a world-class NHP. Sadly this is not the case.",
          "We were looking for more about the lost colony of Roanoke and decided to stop in after taking our 5 year old to the aquarium. Nice facilities and exhibits that provided information on the history. Exhibits had a lot of artifacts from the time period as well as interactive",
          "Don\u2019t skip the visitor center and do watch the movie. It\u2019s only 17 minutes long but gives you all the background information you need. The exhibit in the center is also intersting.Outside there is not much to see; but it\u2019s a nice walk through the wooded area.",
          "Allthough there is not that much to see (except from a renovated mound of earth were a stronghold once stood) You can take a walk through the woods. The museum itself tells a lot about the first colonists. And please see the movie, takes about 20 minutes.",
          "We always like to get out and learn about history in our National Parks and this was a great place. There is so much history in this area - it makes learning fun. I mean who wouldn't want to learn more about the colonists that disappeared! We spent most of our time outside on",
          "This was a great stop. There was a short movie telling the story of the Lost Colony and lots of exhibits on the history of Roanoke Island. A ranger is also there to answer questions. It's close to the Elizabethan Gardens too!",
          "This park is worth a visit, spend about an hour and talk to the friendly staff. I enjoy the history surrounding the early English settlements in this area, and there are many books worth reading about theories of the lost settlement (e.g., book by James Horn) before visiting the",
          "This was the site of the first colonists who disappeared back in 1584. The interactive museum has great in providing background of the historical importance. The introductory film helped answer some of our own questions.",
          "We visited Manteo Island last April as part of a \"Carolina Coast\" driving tour and stopped here after the Festival Park. This site was a nice complement to that one, and although the museum exhibits were somewhat overlapping at both places, we enjoyed seeing them and walking",
          "Such a fascinating place to visit, to be standing in the place of the original settlement. It was a beautiful walk out to the grass sight. A nice display of history inside the building and my boys were able to stamp their passports.",
          "Roanoke Island was the site of the first English settlement in 1584. The ultimate fate of the settlers who comprised this \u201clost colony\u201d remains unknown, providing us with America\u2019s first mystery. Fort Raleigh National Historic Site preserves the location of the original",
          "Learn about the \"Lost Colony\" those brave souls who were the first from England trying to settle in the New World.",
          "We visited on Thanksgiving Day and the site, museum, and gift shop were opened. The museum is small but informative. The lady working in the gift shop was very friendly and helpful. We toured the site which in learning more about the Lost Colony.",
          "We went out of our way to see this park and I'm glad it was free. You get the gist of the place in their very modest visitors center with its video from the 1980's. Place could use a refresh. I guess the show is the big draw. No ranger talks when we were there, so you might",
          "This is a National Park located on Roanoke Island in the Outer Banks of North Carolina commemorating the first English colony in America. It\u2019s about 15 miles from the Wright Brothers National Memorial in Kill Devil Hills and is reachable via a toll-free bridge. Entrance is",
          "Fort Raleigh has an excellent visitors center with an informative short film and a bookstore. You can walk around the area too.",
          "The movie is a great way to start the visit, but don't miss a ranger's talk. They are interesting and entertaining, even for the kids. Very small park. Unusual that they don't have a donation box. They do have a bookstore. The trails are very easy and not long. We would",
          "Here you will learn about the first English Settlement that landed and established residency here in 1584. This site also tells the history of Native Americans and African Americans also living on Roanoke Island.",
          "This is a small attraction but was definitely worth the trip. It is free admission to tour the visitors center and exhibits. This was great for anyone who likes colonial history.",
          "Nice walk. I love history and this site is where one of the first English settlements in the New World was started.",
          "Have past this on several occasions, even walked through the woods, but this time we did the Visitors Centre, certainly worth the time. Interesting film about the Lost Colony. We took time to go to the waters edge and look at the possibility of the original village being",
          "I have always been fascinated by the lost colony, since studying about it in grade school. I was so excited to visit the site and listen to the ranger's lecture. It was unbelievable to b e looking at the recreation of the original fort!",
          "We brought friends of ours on a visit to OBX and due to the high winds from Irma we spent time away from the beach. We found Fort Raleigh on Trip Advisor and decided to check it out. We have been coming to OBX for over 25 years and never new Fort Raleigh existed. It was quite",
          "We had a cloudy non beach day so we decided to see things that we had only read about or seen on TV. The National Park Service operates this site. It is free to the public. We were able to visit the museum, gift shop and grounds. there is a reconstructed dirt fort on the",
          "We had a lovely day to wander the grounds around the fort and to read lots of the interesting and very informative exhibits on display in the small museum. Much is written about the group of settlers who sailed from England and landed on Roanoke Island in hopes of making a",
          "I was very impressed with the quality of the museum portion of this park. Wow! Very interactive and informative. The lecture portion was also very good (about the Freedmen's colony). I learned some new facts and found the topic to be timely.",
          "For people who are fascinated with the Lost Colony of Roanoke this is a great place to visit. History comes alive when you get to walk the land of historically significant place. The visitors center is very informative and staff was super friendly",
          "Great place for a rainy day. This national historic site preserves and interprets England's first chosen location for a permanent colony, dating back to 1584. But it's more than just the lost colony. Also represented are the Native Americans of the time, the Civil War period,",
          "We enjoyed the ranger talk on the so called Dare stones. Learned about the lost colony and town of Manteo, NC",
          "Lots of interactive stuff for the whole family to do. A great place to spend a day when the weather isn't cooperating with the beach.",
          "Truth is that after being eaten alive by mosquitoes at the Elizabethan Gardens, we weren't up for roaming the site so we spent our time in the Visitor's Center. There's a very interesting movie about the Lost Colony, some great exhibits but what what caught our attention was",
          "Very good orientation movie, 17 minutes. It may be a tad old but holds up. Artifacts from archeological digs were very interesting.",
          "It was nice historical marker. Not very big or much to do in the area. Nice visitor center just can't spend a lot of time there.",
          "The information is presented very well. It is a fascinating story. Be sure to watch the short film for background and spend time in the visitor's center. I was quite impressed with the historical presentation through interactive audio visual exhibits. My grandson, however,",
          "This site relates findings about The Lost Colony and archeological efforts to determine what happened to it. There is a good 17-minute movie, wonderful archeological and descriptive displays and more. Also good ranger talks and Jr. Ranger activities. Other aspects also",
          "We stopped here to learn more about the Lost Colony. I highly recommend watching the short video (I think it was around 17ish minutes) that they have at the visitors center. It was very educational about what happened. We also walked around the grounds on the trails that they",
          "This was on our list of places to see on our trip to the Outer Banks, and it was well worth the stop. The museum has a great display and also a good video. The walk out to the 'site' was short, even with two in our party that use canes, it was doable . The park ranger was giving",
          "Good place to do some walking, take in nature's beauty and get a breif history lesson. There are gardens that you have to pay for and a show you have to purchase tickets for as well.",
          "It's not that this place is bad, there is interesting history here. But there is just not a lot to it. It took my wife and I maybe an hour to walk the entire place.",
          "We visited Fort Raleigh with our family and spent time in the museum and walking to the fort. The museum itself is small but bright with interesting displays in a couple of rooms about the early history of the area from the 1500's. Algonquian artifacts are displayed along with",
          "Admission is free but there's nothing other than a nice visitor center/museum and some earthworks close by outside. Be sure to do the Ranger talk, she was great - and watch the video (17 mins) They do not know what happened to these people but a new archaeological site has",
          "I love National Parks and we visit them when we are near one. I was a bit disappointed in Fort Raleigh. There just wasn't much to the park. The film they have is the best part. It is very well done and informative. However, with this being the biggest mystery of early America",
          "Very informative museum, grounds, fort, and theater. Don't miss the movie in the visitor center. And the Lost Colony play is a MUST!!",
          "The Fort Raleigh site on Roanoke Island mainly covers the history of the \"lost colony\" on that island. Since the colony wasn't there long, and was lost, there isn't much to see by way of artifacts or building sites. We took a short walk to a sample of what the fort would have",
          "If you have any interest in the history of the area and the lost colony this is the place to start. Movie at the visitor center is definitely worth seeing, along with all the displays. Walk out to the earthen fort and enjoy the grounds.",
          "We enjoyed walking through the visitor center, trails, and out to the beach of Croatan Sound in the vicinity of the first landing. There is a reconstructed earthen fort, nice picnic area and nearby Elizabethan Gardens. We visited the park before the outdoor play, \"The Lost",

          "First of all, this is a National Park. But there was no admission fee. That makes it a bargain IF it's worth visiting. And it was. When we first arrived, we spent some time in the visitors center. This is a good way to learn much about the Lost Colony and the logistics and",
          "I have always been fascinated by Roanoke colony. The story, the folklore, the mystery. It was pretty awesome to see in person! Nice visitor center, really peaceful walking around, and nice trails with lots of history. This attraction also is free! I would combine this with",
          "No charge to get in here. Lots of parking available. A few short nature trails. Nice views of the sound. The Visitor Center of course is staffed by knowledgable, friendly people. There's a short film with the history of the area and some artifacts on display. The main draw here",
          "The visitor center is well done and does a good job at explaining the history of the site. I would definitely take the time to watch the video; it was really informative and interesting. They have a little scavenger hunt that little ones can do, as they look around the visitor",

          "For those who value historical visits, this fort has plenty of history, from the early colonial period through the Civil War. There are earthworks to be seen on the site of the first earthen fort where several digs have revealed more 16th century history. In addition, there was",

          "The fort area is interesting along with the small visitors center. Small wooded area where the fort is has a few information boards to read. The park is free to get into and just off the main road, so worth the trip. Id skip the gardens there though. It's $9 each person",
          "Anyone familiar with American history knows about the lost settlement at Roanoke and the mystery that surrounds exactly what happened to this first settlers. No, there is not much actual \"stuff\" to see here, but some pretty good recreations of the Earthen Fort and a nice film.",

          "We have been fascinated with this part of history, so we know we'd enjoy it. The museum is well done & the brief movie is good for adults & older children. With so little known about the early colony, I was particularly thankful for the detailed drawings that were preserved.",
          "Small museum and gift shop but the 17 minute movie and exhibits made us aware of the expedition and exploration of these brave people who made their way to what would become America. It also showed the greed of man as they began displacing the Natives that were in the area.",
          "This was all news to me, so we took our time here and explored the area. It has a couple of great little trails that lead to a gorgeous beach too. A lot of historical information, and the rangers are more than happy to give you more information. I highly recommend a visit",

          "If you want to learn all about the first settlement and continue to fuel the mystery, visit here. The only concern is that there remains a lot of speculation. The site has a lot of reading and a theater that shows the most incredibly boring 30 minute video. We were blessed to",

          "The visitor centre is outstanding. Exhibits and video do a very good job of informing you of the fascinating history of the site. Original fort earthworks are interesting and forest walk is pretty. Well worth a visit!",
          "Very informative and historical. While walking the grounds in early morning, you could almost \"feel\" the presence of the colonists. Michael is extremely knowledgeable, and his knowledge of this area could fill a history text. Thanks for your time Michael. Highly recommended!!",

          "A nice day trip when combined with other attractions on Manteo (like the Elizabethan gardens right next door, downtown, the Elizabeth II ship, a cruise in the sound, or shopping.) This historic site was smallish and we ended up walking from it next door to look at the flowers",
          "I went to Fort Raleigh today and once again have to congratulate the Park Service staff at this site. They are the most helpful, well informed and friendly people I've ever met at a National Park site. Also the displays at the Visitor's Center are wonderful - very clear",
          "There isn't much to see of any \"fort\" so that is confusing here. But this is still worth a visit to see the video about the \"Lost Colony\". Fascinating story! And then they have wonderful exhibits about that group of settlers here. Lovely grounds to walk in the shade.",
          "If you are a History Buff ,you will relish the visit. The Site enables you to learn about the Lost Colony of Roanoke which has defied explanation all these years. Do not expect any traces of the colony or re creation here. You would be better off to start with the short",

          "We usually try to start any visit to a National Site or Park by watching the video. This was especially important at this location because there is not too much to see since the area was last inhabited in the 1500's! The Park Ranger presentation was also very interesting and",
          "If you go to the Outer Banks, you really should stop here. The rangers and the other staff are super friendly and knowledgeable. No admission charged. We really enjoyed our short visit. Next time we will return for \"The Lost Colony production.",

          "I went to Fort Raleigh when i was on vacation a few weeks ago, and really enjoyed it. The museum is very cool and has very nice exhibits on the Lost Colony. We went on a ranger talk that was great and very informative. Our ranger, Amanda did a great job telling us about what",

          "There's not a lot to see here but we still had a nice walk. A park ranger was giving a talk outside the fort that didn't sound particularly interesting in the 5 minutes we stayed around for. our heads in there. That was probably the coolest part.",

          "This is a very small NHS, but still full of information and history. It will not take all day, just a few hours. Lots of shade and an air conditioned visitor center. Rangers were knowledgeable and friendly. The kids loved earning their badges through the Junior Ranger",
          "The museum is nice and modern and features some great exhibits about the history of the area, including the Lost Colony. There was also a film about the doomed colony that piques guests' interest about the place. A short walk away from the museum/visitor center is a",

          "This was our second yearly visit, and they have redone the foyer and some of the display rooms. It's VERY nice, and they have added a lot more interactive displays, which the kids liked. They also love seeing the earthen fort (our six-year old still remembered the 'big ditch",

          "My wife and I walked through the historic site while waiting to view The Lost Colony. The exhibit is great considering their 'exhibits' are almost purely what was left behind from the actual Lost colony. Plenty of informational bloops to keep you informed. A short and pleasant",

          "This visitor center run by the Park Service is one of the better displays that I have seen. It gives good information for The Lost Colony, what happened in the Civil War, some information on slaves, and the displays pertain to pots that the colonists used, weapons,",
          "Most of what was in here about the colony was already covered in other attractions. I learned a couple of more things, but mainly I liked the air conditioning.",
          "My family loves history and loves to learn, this was a must-see for us. We love museums and such. The trails were beautiful, the staff was informive. Our 5 yo loved the artifacts found and the educational videos available. They did seem alittle dated but they were interesting to",
          "This is a great place for everyone especially for those intrigued with history. Fort Raleigh is the site of the first English colony aka \"The Lost Colony\" because the residents vanished. The museum tells the story of the colony and the mystery that surrounds it. You can browse",
          "At time of visit the NPS exhibits and films seem dated-- and not much on site- but one of those that again must be on the 'must visit' list. The friendliness and wealth of knowledge via the NPS ranger on duty- easily brought this to the five star recommendation - but as noted -",
          "There isn't a tremendous amount to see here--but that doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile. We attended The Lost Colony play the evening before, and it helped to \"feel\" this site. Do some pre-research on this lost colony and then enter into the presence of those who hoped for life",
          "There is a show (play) that is put on outside and there is a cost. I was not able to see the show, but it sounded very good. The visitor's center is small, but you do watch an informative short video explaining Mr. Raleigh and the fort. There are exhibits that show the dress of",
          "We loved Fort Raleigh. If you got to The Lost Colony visiting Fort Raleigh is a must. We enjoyed the exhibits and particularly liked the Ranger presentation. We learned a great deal and not just about Sir Walter Raleigh's ill-fated colony. If you carry school children to see",
          "While it is true that this site is small and not very glamourous, everyone should visit here at least once. Roanoke Colony was of vital importance, the history and mystery of this location should send chills up and down your spine. The museum is small but nice, the film is",
          "We have been here several times. The visitor's center has a good display with parts that change every year so there is always something new to see. The rangers have always been very helpful and there are several programs they offer that help explain the history of the area.",
          "This historic site offers another piece of the Outer Banks puzzle, telling the story of the first attempted settlement of the area and offering insight into the lives of the original habitants. It's not the most glamourous tourist attraction but it's an important one!",
          "The site itself is not all that exciting, but watching the movie and reading the history is very important. Take the time to look back and see where we came from!",
          "The Visitors Center boasts new, historically accurate, compelling displays that are an education in themselves -- so different from when I spent a summer near there in 1970! The grounds are beautiful and peaceful; the nature trail, exceptional; and the Waterside Theater is a",

          "Don't expect excitement, but it was a nice free thing to do. We enjoyed the little nature trail (perfect for a 15 month old and 3 year old that enjoy \"exploring\") and learning about the lost colony was interesting. And the rangers and staff were all friendly.",
          "We really enjoyed the film and the Park Ranger was nice and helpful. The trails were well maintained and the view of the water from the audience of the \"lost colony\" theater is INCREDIBLE!",
          "We enjoyed this place. Make sure to watch the 18 minute video. Our daughter completed the junior ranger packet and received her badge. We learned a lot!",
          "It is the first permanent colony in the United States. The 17 minute video at the beginning will orient you to the history. They do a good job portraying history from both the Native and European perspective. There are a few interesting exhibits, but nothing particularly",
          "A stop at Fort Raleigh National Historic Site won't take long, but it's worthwhile. We started at the visitor center with the small display. A very interesting video about the lost colony is shown in the theater -- it's not long, but it very effectively tells the story of Fort",

          "The staff was very friendly and helpful. A short movie about the lost colony of roanoke. The site is obviously minimal but the overall experience was worth it. It was raining so we didn't go into the Elizabethian Gardens (fee $8) which looked really nice. We should probably",
          "I found the ranger talk on the lost colony by ranger bob to be very informative. He certainly was very knowlageable and seemed genuinely interested in the topic. We enjoyed one of the nature trails and the walk to the earthen fort. The museum was also very informative. We were",
          "We were there too late for the play about the Lost Colony, but the Park Service guide gave a 30-45 minute talk about what they've been able the learn about the people in this colony. It was very interesting and the guide was very informative. Sorry, but we can't remember her",
          "The visitor center is set on beautifully landscaped grounds and, though small, contains several fascinating exhibits. An interesting and well-made film was starting just as we walked in, so we watched, and it provided an excellent introduction to Roanoke Island's early history.",

          "Museum was small but interesting, had hands on activities for kids including dress up as pirates and settlers. Overall didn't take very long and is easy to get to from Nags Head or Manteo. Outdoor theater would be a great place to see a show.",
          "Information about the Lost Colony and Sir Walter Raleigh's involvement with many expeditions to Roanoke Island and the surrounding areas. Well maintained by the National Parks Service with an informative staff",
          "Pros: The site will only take you an hour at most if you read every single thing in the museum and walk really slowly around the trail. I did learn about the freeman's colony on the island and that was interesting. It is free (I would have been highly upset if I had to pay",

          "Really interesting and beautiful natural park and museum. We learned about the possible new information about what might be under the patches on the original map showing the lost colony. Is it under the nearby golf course? We also listened to a talk by knowledgable Ranger Bob",
          "Interesting, quick visit. There are several rooms with information & artifacts, as well as costumes and props from the Lost Colony production. The earthern fort isn't anything amazing, but our children liked seeing it, as well as the Lost Colony stage. The staff is eager to",
          "Where the heck did those settlers go? Small museum area with nice graphics and displays. A twenty minute movie reviews the details of the area. There's a connection to the Freedom Trail here as well. A short walk to a building site (not much to see). Very quiet and peaceful.",
          "I originally planned to skip this attraction in favor of others in the area. However, I had extra time so I dropped by. I was happy that I did. The only true tangible attraction here is the earthen fort, which is not very photogenic and not all that impressive. However, the",
          "I really enjoyed stopping in here. The fort is a short reconstructed palisade and a mound, but the movie in the visitor center is excellent and gives a good overview of what happened to the Roanoke settlement. There is also a memorial related to the Underground railroad to check",
          "Love this place. Great place to take the kids for a visit to our history like none other. The children learn so much here as well as the adults.",
          "We really enjoyed walking thru the paths of this site. It was very quiet and restful and ful of interesting history tidbits. No charge was a pleasant surprise also.",
          "I had heard the story of Roanoke and I wanted to see the place for myself. It is free to enter and they show a video of the story and then we walked around the park - very interesting.",
          "I really enjoyed the short documentary film about Sir Walter Raleigh, John White, Virginia Dare and the Lost Colony. Even though I grew up in Virginia, I did not remember this part of history, at all. There are a lot of displays and the park employees are very helpful. Be",

          "The visitors center was very nice and the staff very friendly. The short video they show ended up being the high point. I expected a bit more. The Fort really is just a patch of grass with a flag in the center. There are some nice paths to walk on, but that's it. Maybe during",
          "The displays are limited since the artifacts they have dug up are limited to a few cases. But if you are in the area, is it a worthwhile stop to get the entire picture, including all the different theories of what could have happened to those 118 people who disappeared, without",
          "There is a small visitor center with some nice displays. Other than the restored earthworks there isn't much else to see along the short trail that goes through the grounds.",
          "if you want to know where and how the first settlers lived this is a must place to",
          "Would of stayed and enjoyed but we came to the conclusion the settlers didn't disappear, the mosquitos ate them alive!",
          "Yes, there's not much to see here beyond the ruins of the original earthen works fort, but if you are into early American history. you will enjoy visiting this National Park. The video was well done and left the viewer wanting to learn even more about the lost colony - where",
          "We had a good visit to the historic site. We viewed a 17 minute movie showing the history of what they think happened. We then stolled in the woods to see the site. As many have said, there isn't much to see after 400+ years but it is historic. If you are interested in",
          "Before making our fall break trip to the outer banks, we came to Trip Advisor and read the reviews for the area attractions. Fort Raleigh is the supposed location of the Roanoake Colony. First, the parking lot and road leading to the park are also used by Elizabethan Gardens and",
          "Don't go even though this is free. This park is embarrassing because of the pathetic exhibits that fail to tell the Lost Colony story. The Lost Colony is a FASCINATING story with intrique, mystery and historic complexities, but the musem and park certainly fail to convey a",
          "I love National Park properties, and this was a nice way to spend a couple hours while my wife was scuba diving. It is small and not an exciting park, but it was stress-free historical education. My rating of \"average\" is actually due to the fact that necessary construction",
          "I enjoy parks like this. While it's true that there's not a lot to *do* here, it is a place that will allow you to contemplate what our ancestors might have endured as they attempted to forge a life in this new land. The park is just the land where the lost Roanoke Colony is",
          "We were SO excited to be right where the famous Virginia Dare was born. We had all ready the story in our history books and were so looking forward to visiting what were sure would be a fascinating histoirc site. Unbelievably, there is literally N-O-T-H-I-N-G there to see!!",
          "I was looking forward to visiting this site because of interest in the history of the Roanoke Colony and early colonial history in general. The temporary visitor center was a bit disappointing (the main center is being renovated this summer). The other reviewers are right to",
          "When arriving here, be aware that the main Visitor Center is undergoing rehabilitation and will be opening again in the near future. In the meantime, there is a temporary Visitor Center open where families can pick up a nice (and FREE) Junior Ranger booklet. This was the",
          "After going to Jamestowne, VA prior what a disappointment this was. There is nothing there but a Nature Walk.",
          "For something free to do it isn't much to complain about. Very fun for history buffs but can be seen in less than an hour, bring some off in the summer due to the bugs will eat you alive.. Worth a trip if you are spending quality time in OBX if only a day or two then come back",
          "We did not tour the site at all. We went in the evening, at dusk, with the sole purpose of seeing the Lost Colony show. Our group consisted of 5 adults and 4 kids, ages 5-8. All had a good time. The show is very well done, with elaborate sets and costumes. The story is told",
          "Nannerp's review pretty much covers it. View the movie in the visitor's center for the info. The earthworks and site were a bit underwhelming. This is a place that all right thinking Americans must visit because it is an important part of our history. But from what I gathered",
          "If you don't love history, you may not get a great deal out of this stop, but I still recommend it anyway. The story behind the Lost Colony is so interesting, so intriguing, and merits a looking into. Before visiting the earthworks, definitely watch the orientation film shown",
          "Fort Raleigh- This is the original site of the settlement of John White and the birthplace of Virginia Dare, first baby born in U.S. A little creepy for my wife, but we enjoyed snooping around the set of the Lost Colony outdoor drama. Beautiful location directly on the Sound."

        "wiki": "Wake County is a county in the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of July 1, 2019, the population was 1,111,761, making it North Carolina's most populous county as well as the most populous county in the Carolinas. From July 2005 to July 2006, Wake County was the 9th fastest-growing county in the United States, with the town of Cary and the city of Raleigh being the 8th and 15th fastest-growing cities, respectively.Its county seat is Raleigh, which is also the state capital.  Eleven other municipalities are in Wake County, the largest of which is Cary, the third largest city of the Research Triangle region and the seventh largest municipality in North Carolina.\nIt is governed by the Wake County Board of Commissioners, coterminous with the Wake County Public School System school district, with law enforcement provided by the Wake County Sheriff's Department.  It is also part of the wider Triangle J Council of Governments which governs regional planning.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nPrior to English colonization, present-day Wake County was part of the Tuscarora nation.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nWake County was formed in 1770 from parts of Cumberland County, Johnston County, and Orange County. The first courthouse was built at a village originally called Wake Courthouse, now known as Bloomsbury. In 1771, the first elections and court were held, and the first militia units were organized.\nWake County lost some of its territory through the formation of other counties. Parts were included in Franklin County in 1787, and in Durham County in both 1881 and 1911.\nDuring the colonial period of North Carolina, the state capital was New Bern. For several years during and after the Revolutionary War there was no capital, and the General Assembly met in various locations. Fayetteville was the state capital in 1786, 1789, 1790, and 1793, when Raleigh became the permanent state capital in 1794. In 1792, a commission was appointed to select a site to build a permanent state capital. The commission members favored land owned by Colonel John Hinton across the Neuse River, but the night before the final vote the committee adjourned to the home of Joel Lane for an evening of food and spirits. The next day, the vote went in Lane's favor.\n\nLane named Wake County in honor of Margaret Wake, wife of colonial Governor William Tryon. Raleigh was named after Sir Walter Raleigh, and established in 1792 on 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) purchased from Lane. Raleigh had never set foot in North Carolina, but he had sponsored the establishment of the first English colony in North America on North Carolina's Roanoke Island in 1585. The city of Raleigh became both the state capital and the new seat of Wake County.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Battle at Morrisville Station was fought April 13\u201315, 1865 in Morrisville, North Carolina during the Carolinas Campaign of the American Civil War. It was the last official battle of the Civil War between the armies of Major General William T. Sherman and General Joseph E. Johnston. General Judson Kilpatrick, commanding officer of the Union cavalry advance, compelled Confederate forces under the command of Generals Wade Hampton III and Joseph Wheeler to withdraw in haste. They had been frantically trying to transport their remaining supplies and wounded by rail westward toward the final Confederate encampment in Greensboro, NC. Kilpatrick used artillery on the heights overlooking Morrisville Station and cavalry charges to push the Confederates out of the small village leaving many needed supplies behind. However, the trains were able to withdraw with wounded from the Battle of Bentonville and the Battle of Averasboro. Later, General Johnston sent a courier to the Federal encampments at Morrisville with a message for Major General Sherman requesting a conference to discuss an armistice. Several days later the two generals met at Bennett Place near Durham on April 17, 1865, to begin discussing the terms of what would become the largest surrender of the war.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the 20th century, the average per capita income for the county was of $54,988, and the median income for a family was of $67,149. In the same period, the per capita income decreased from $44,472 to $31,579, especially for women. About 7.80% of the population was below the federal poverty line. In August 2014, the population hit 1,000,000 people.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn November 2017, commissioners of Wake and Harnett counties discussed the possibility of redrawing the line between the counties using the latest technology. This could affect 27 homeowners who would end up in a different county or have their property divided between the two.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\nThe county is governed by the Wake County Board of Commissioners, a seven-member board of County Commissioners, elected at large to serve four-year terms. Terms are staggered so that, every two years, three or four Commissioners are up for election. The commissioners enact policies such as the establishment of the property tax rate, regulation of land use and zoning outside municipal jurisdictions, and adoption of the annual budget. Commissioners meet on the first and third Mondays of each month.Current members of the Wake County Board of Commissioners are Jessica Holmes (Chair), Greg Ford (Vice-Chair), Vickie Adamson, Matt Calabria, Susan Evans, Sig Hutchinson, and James West.David Ellis is the County Manager.Wake County is a member of the regional Triangle J Council of Governments.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nWhile North Carolina is historically a conservative state, Wake County is typically a swing voting area.\nFrom 1828 to 1964, the county was won by Democratic presidential candidates in all but six elections (John C. Breckinridge in 1860, Ulysses S. Grant in 1868 and 1872, Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, James A. Garfield in 1880, and Benjamin Harrison in 1888). From 1968 to 2004, Republicans won the county in every election but one, when Bill Clinton carried it in 1992.  However, the races have almost always been close, such as in 1980, when Ronald Reagan won by a landslide nationwide, but by a mere one percent in Wake County. Recently, Republican George W. Bush won the county in 2000 with 53 percent of the vote and defeated John Kerry in 2004 by a slim 51 to 49 percent. In 2008 Democrat Barack Obama defeated John McCain 56 to 43 percent, becoming the first Democrat since Lyndon Johnson to win a majority of the county's vote. In 2012, Obama won Wake County again over Mitt Romney with 54 percent of the vote to Romney's 44 percent \u2013 the first time in almost half a century that a Democrat carried the county in consecutive elections. Obama's performance in Wake mirrored his strong showing along the I-85 Corridor. In 2016, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won the county 57 percent to Donald Trump's 37 percent, reflecting the nationwide shift towards Democrats in urban and suburban areas.\n\nDemocrats fared well here in the 2008 election. In the 1998 Senate race, John Edwards won in Wake County, which helped him defeat incumbent Republican Lauch Faircloth. In 2000 Mike Easley won the governor's race here with 55% of the vote. In 2004, Easley won again, winning with 59 percent to 40 percent for opponent Patrick Ballantine. Democrat Beverly Perdue won Wake County in the 2008 Governor's election by a 51 to 45 percent margin. Democratic candidate for US Senate Erskine Bowles won the county with 52 percent, despite losing statewide to Richard Burr by the same margin. In 2002, however, Republican Elizabeth Dole defeated Bowles with 55% of the vote here, and won by a large margin statewide. In 2008 Kay Hagan defeated Dole 56 to 40 percent.\nDemocratic strength is concentrated primarily in Raleigh. Republican strength is concentrated in the rural and exurban areas in the northern and western parts of the county. The outskirts of Raleigh, and the cities of Cary and Apex are mostly home to swing voters.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 857 square miles (2,220 km2), of which 835 square miles (2,160 km2) is land and 22 square miles (57 km2) (2.6%) is water.Wake County is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the North American Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet. This area is known as the \"fall line\" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Wake County features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain. Its central Piedmont location situates the county about three hours west of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, by car and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains.\nBodies of water that are located in Wake County include Lake Crabtree, Crabtree Creek, Lake Johnson, the Neuse River, and portions of Falls Lake and Jordan Lake.\n\n\n=== Adjacent counties ===\nGranville County \u2013 north\nFranklin County \u2013 northeast\nNash County \u2013 east\nJohnston County \u2013 southeast\nHarnett County \u2013 southwest\nChatham County \u2013 west\nDurham County \u2013 northwest\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWake County enjoys a moderate subtropical climate, with moderate temperatures in the spring, fall, and winter. Summers are typically hot with high humidity. Winter highs generally range in the low 50s\u00b0F (10 to 13 \u00b0C) with lows in the low-to-mid 30s\u00b0F (\u22122 to 2 \u00b0C), although an occasional 60 \u00b0F (15 \u00b0C) or warmer winter day is not uncommon. Spring and fall days usually reach the low-to-mid 70s\u00b0F (low 20s\u00b0C), with lows at night in the lower 50s\u00b0F (10 to 14 \u00b0C). Summer daytime highs often reach the upper 80s to low 90s\u00b0F (29 to 35 \u00b0C). The rainiest months are July and August.\nThe county, at the National Weather Service in Raleigh, receives on average 7 inches (180 mm) of snow in the winter. Freezing rain and sleet occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging ice storm.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2018, there were 1,092,776 people, 421,265 households, and 276,363 families residing in the county.

It offers direct access to RDU International Airport, Morrisville, Cary, Raleigh and Garner. It has two auxiliary routes in Wake County:\n I-440 is the northern, western and eastern portion of the \"Beltline\" that encircles most of central Raleigh. The southern portion of the Beltline is I-40.\n I-540 / NC 540 is a 66-mile (106 km) partially-completed loop that currently connects the satellite towns of Knightdale, Cary, Morrisville, Apex and Holly Springs. The completed portion in northern Wake County is called the Northern Wake Expressway (I-540). It continues as a non-Interstate route, NC 540, in western Wake County, almost all of which is a toll road. The remaining segments to be constructed will also be designated as NC 540 and will be tolled.\n I-87 will eventually connect I-40 to Norfolk, Virginia. Its Wake County section is concurrent with U.S. 64. The highway is currently signed as I-87 only where it already meets Interstate standards: along the Raleigh Beltline (where its southern terminus is at I-440's Exit 16 and I-40's Exit 301) and along the Knightdale Bypass, which runs from I-440 to the Business 64 exit between Knightdale and Wendell.  East of this point, the road is a controlled-access freeway but does not meet interstate standards, so it is marked with \"Future\" I-87 signs.  The \"future\" designation will be removed as the road is eventually upgraded by improving the road's shoulders, which are currently too narrow to qualify for an Interstate Highway designation.  There is no timetable for these improvements. Interstate 87 will run along the same routing, and will eventually will be extended along US 64, US 17 and other roads (some yet to be built) to Norfolk.\n\n\n==== U.S. Routes ====\nMajor U.S. highways that run through Wake County include US 1 US 64 US 264 US 70 US 401\n\n\n==== State Routes ====\nMajor state highways include\n NC 39\n NC 42\n NC 50\n NC 54\n NC 55\n NC 96\n NC 97\n NC 98\n NC 147\n NC 231\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\nThe \"mountains-to-the-sea\" North Carolina Bicycle Route 2 travels through Wake County, as does the Maine-to-Florida U.S. Bicycle Route 1. North Carolina Bicycle Route 5, the \"Cape Fear run\", connects Apex to the coastal city of Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\n\n\n=== State parks ===\nWake County is home to three state parks: Falls Lake State Recreation Area, William B. Umstead State Park, and the Jordan Lake State Recreation Area. Falls Lake Park is located in northern Wake County and contains the 12,000-acre (49 km2) Falls Lake and 26,000 acres (110 km2) of woodlands.

          "I took a group of 5 to do the Heist room a couple of weeks ago and we had a blast! The staff was really awesome to work with, and they were really encouraging.  We had a group of pretty experienced players, but we still found the room \u2026",
          "Went here for a work/team building outing and we all had a blast! Andrew, our host, did a great job running both the Sherlock and Dark rooms we did. The atmosphere of the stories behind the rooms were engaging and the my group was able to \u2026",
          "Great escape experience. The room had a fun layout! Me and my friends felt super smart the whole time. Their employee Nicole was a great moderator and kept our experience flowing smoothly with the occasional hint when we needed it. Great \u2026",
          "The staff is incredibly nice and helpful. They are very helpful when it comes to hints. They explain at the end anything that you did not understand. I will be back again!",
          "Had a great time here! Andrew is really friendly and is a great host. The place is located downtown (good location and parking) and is literally in a house. The rooms were well designed and both our groups were able to complete the puzzles! \u2026",
          "What a great experience! Our group of six did the Heist room and had a wonderful time. The puzzles were challenging, but not impossible, so we never felt like we were at an impasse. It took the ideas and contributions of all of us to solve \u2026",
          "We did the Sherlock themed room. It was fun and had some cool features, but it wasn't overly high-tech or unique. The hostess also came over the intercom and gave us a couple clues that we did not ask for, which was a bummer. However we only had 3 minutes to spare when we escaped, so maybe it was better that she did that.",
          "This was our first for escape rooms & we really  enjoyed.  However the room became uncomfortably warm & the smaller room was hot.  I was sweating slightly & my friend's mom had sweat all over her face.  Thankfully she pulled out a large folding hand fan to cool herself down.",
          "So. Much. Fun.  We did \"The Heist\" and managed to solve it just in time. There are three more rooms here, so we'll be back!  The puzzles are clever and rewarding, and teamwork is a must. Great place to bring your friends, family, or work \u2026",
          "Second room I have done, and both have been awesome!! I love the employee that worked with us!! Great fun for the whole family!!",
          "I loved this place! My dad and I did The Dark Room and actually made it out of the room. The staff is very friendly and will gently nudge you in the right direction if they see that you're stuck. There was an I testing story behind the room and the clues made you think. Such a fun time here.",
          "Challenging, fun, and had a creepy vibe!!! My friends and I had a great time trying to escape from the Dark Room. The puzzles were a bit tricky but with the help of my friends and teamwork, we made it out successfully with a good amount of \u2026",
          "The house was renovated just for the escape room! They offer few different rooms and I did the dark room one with my friend. To be honest, as the room was kinda small, I wasn't excepting that much. Pleasant surprise, it turned out to be the best escape room that I've ever been to. Whoever made this escape room gotta be pure genius!",
          "Challenging and fun! We had a great time trying to escape the Heist. Although we didn\u2019t solve the puzzles in 60 minutes, Andrew let us finish our escape. We managed to get it figured out with the extra few minutes given to us which was much appreciated. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for hints! I will be back! Highly recommend",
          "Had a great experience. There were no major leaps of logic and the guide was able to give just the right amount of direction to help when stuck. The room was very well designed and everything in the room was a part of the puzzle. Will be back to try to other rooms!",
          "Excellent!  They have four different themed rooms so you can return over and over for a fresh experience :)",
          "We stopped here on our way out of town because we love escape rooms and wanted to try one in Raleigh. We preferred to try another business but this one fit into our schedule. There is free 2 hour parking behind the building. It is in a \u2026",

          "Room 5280 did not disappoint! I love puzzles, and I was really excited to drag my friend to a Sherlock themed escape room.\n\nThe Sherlock room was challenging but not impossible. (We probably should have had more than just the two of us.) \u2026",
          "Great experience!! This place is really cool and has great rooms (we did The Experiment). The room looked minimalistic when we walked in, but there was no shortage of clues and things to stump us (we were pleasantly surprised)!! Great staff as well!! I definitely recommend!!!",
          "Our team visited for a team building event and we had an awesome time! We split into two groups and competed against each other to see who could escape first. We agreed that each team was allowed three clues. Our host, Andrew, was great. I highly recommend visiting and I hope to go again and try a different room.",
          "GREAT TEAM EVENT!!! We had 16 with us and were accommodated in every way we could have been. From allowing us to park at the site and go eat lunch before the event, to letting us start earlier than expected originally, they rolled with the \u2026",
          "Went to Room 5280 with my family and had a great time!  The clues were tricky but eventually we made it out successfully.  Really engaging for all ages and an experience unlike any other.  The owners did a great job with the place. You can tell they put a lot of thought and effort in the details.",
          "I visited few escape rooms and this place has to be the best escape joint that I've ever been to. The owner and staff are extremely friendly, engaging, and passionate. My friend and I did a \"Dark Room,\" which was beyond amazing! Make sure you think outside the box! Highly recommend.",
          "It was a super fun experience I absolutely loved it!! Probably the best escape room I\u2019ve been to. Also the workers are extremely nice and friendly:)",
          "My office took 15 of our employees to do three escape rooms here and all three groups raved about how much fun they had. We did the dark room, the experiment, and Sherlock. A group of five of us also previously did the heist and everyone \u2026",
          "Staff was super helpful and did a great job explaining everything (before and after). The room was challenging (we did The Experiment), but all the clues/setup of the room made sense and it wasn't impossible to do! We escaped and had a BLAST! Thanks for a wonderful experience :)",
          "The place was easy to find.. staff was amazing, and made us feel very comfortable with the task. We did the heist...we made it \"just barely\"   I will definitely do again.. it was fun for everyone.  We had to give the gold bars back though \ud83d\ude02. Lots of good paintings every where...   I enjoyed the 10 min we waited to start.",
          "Had a great time here with my colleagues from work. For many of them, it was their first escape room and they all expressed how it was much more fun than they had imagined. The story was and puzzles were very creative and being able to solve them was super rewarding. Highly recommend.",
          "Went yesterday with 4 of us adults and 3 teenagers. Did the Sherlock room and enjoyed it. We solved the room wn5 mins to spare. There were a couple of hard puzzles and the room was enjoyable. Staff was nice and helpful.  We would go back.",
          "Was really alot of fun and would Def go back again!",
          "This made for a great team-building activity with work colleagues. We were able to get out with 5 minutes to spare! One of the participants had been to several other escape rooms but the rest of us had never been. It was a ton of fun!",
          "I did the dark room and it was great. Challenging riddles, puzzles and stuff inside of the rooms. The customer service was great.",
          "Room 5280 was so much fun! It was my first escape room experience and I can't wait to go back!",
          "This was my second time back and this time I organized it as a team building activity for our 8-people group. We chose the Sherlock room and had such a great time doing it - the puzzles were really good and clever. Great experience  and the staff was super helpful. Thanks and we will be back again!",
          "My group did the Sherlock escape room and had a great time! The staff is pleasant and the set up is well done. The only reason I have to take away a star is because the parking is pretty tight. Multiple group members had to constantly circle the building trying to find parking because the lots were full.",
          "This escape room was great. It was not my first one but it was the best one I\u2019ve done yet. Very interactive and challenging enough that It wasn\u2019t easy but still fun. Will definitely go back for the other rooms.",
          "Never did this before...definitely going back!  Was worried there would be zombies or something jumping out at us...but these escape rooms (there are 4) are not designed for those cheap thrills.  Instead, think mystery, intrigue and discovery! It was a blast!!",
          "Wow. Just wow. \n\nI've done two rooms here (Dark Room and The Experiment) on two separate occasions. Andrew helped me book the Dark Room PRIVATELY for my sister's birthday, no questions asked, even though it was only three of us. The room \u2026",
          "This was my 1st escape room and it was so much fun!! We made it out with 12 minutes to spare! We'll definitely be back for more!!!",
          "Easy to set up with a large business event. Andrew was nice and formal. Great guy! Rooms were fun and challenging. Only suggestion I have, is fix the microphone or buy a new one for each room as they are incredible hard to hear the host speak when we ask him for clues.",

        "wiki": "African Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans) are an ethnic group of Americans with total or partial ancestry from any of the black racial groups of Africa. The term African American generally denotes descendants of enslaved black people who are from the United States.African Americans constitute the third largest ethnic group and the second largest racial group in the US, after White Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans. Most African Americans are descendants of enslaved peoples within the boundaries of the present United States. On average, African Americans are of West/Central African and European descent, and some also have Native American ancestry. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, African immigrants generally do not self-identify as African American. The overwhelming majority of African immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities (\u224895%). Immigrants from some Caribbean, Central American, and South American nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term.African-American history starts in the 16th century, with peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as slaves to Latin America, and in the 17th century with West African slaves taken to English colonies in North America. After the founding of the United States, black people continued to be enslaved, and the last four million black slaves were only liberated after the Civil War in 1865. Due to notions of white supremacy, they were treated as second-class citizens. The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited U.S. citizenship to whites only, and only white men who owned property could vote. These circumstances were changed by Reconstruction, development of the black community, participation in the great military conflicts of the United States, the elimination of racial segregation, and the civil rights movement which sought political and social freedom.  In 2008, Barack Obama became the first African American to be elected President of the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Colonial era ===\n\nThe first African slaves arrived via Santo Domingo to the San Miguel de Gualdape colony (most likely located in the Winyah Bay area of present-day South Carolina), founded by Spanish explorer Lucas V\u00e1zquez de Ayll\u00f3n in 1526. The ill-fated colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership, during which the slaves revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local Native Americans. De Ayll\u00f3n and many of the colonists died shortly afterwards of an epidemic and the colony was abandoned. The settlers and the slaves who had not escaped returned to Haiti, whence they had come.The marriage between Luisa de Abrego, a free black domestic servant from Seville and Miguel Rodr\u00edguez, a white Segovian conquistador in 1565 in St. Augustine (Spanish Florida), is the first known and recorded Christian marriage anywhere in what is now the continental United States.The first recorded Africans in British North America (including most of the future United States) were \"20 and odd negroes\" who came to Jamestown, Virginia via Cape Comfort in August 1619 as indentured servants. As English settlers died from harsh conditions, more and more Africans were brought to work as laborers.\n\nAn indentured servant (who could be white or black) would work for several years (usually four to seven) without wages. The status of indentured servants in early Virginia and Maryland was similar to slavery. Servants could be bought, sold, or leased and they could be physically beaten for disobedience or running away. Unlike slaves, they were freed after their term of service expired or was bought out, their children did not inherit their status, and on their release from contract they received \"a year's provision of corn, double apparel, tools necessary\", and a small cash payment called \"freedom dues\".Africans could legally raise crops and cattle to purchase their freedom. They raised families, married other Africans and sometimes intermarried with Native Americans or English settlers.\n\nBy the 1640s and 1650s, several African families owned farms around Jamestown and some became wealthy by colonial standards and purchased indentured servants of their own. In 1640, the Virginia General Court recorded the earliest documentation of lifetime slavery when they sentenced John Punch, a Negro, to lifetime servitude under his master Hugh Gwyn for running away.In the Spanish Florida some Spanish married or had unions with Pensacola, Creek or African women, both slave and free, and their descendants created a mixed-race population of mestizos and mulattos. The Spanish encouraged slaves from the southern British colonies to come to Florida as a refuge, promising freedom in exchange for conversion to Catholicism. King Charles II of Spain issued a royal proclamation freeing all slaves who fled to Spanish Florida and accepted conversion and baptism. Most went to the area around St. Augustine, but escaped slaves also reached Pensacola. St. Augustine had mustered an all-black militia unit defending Spain as early as 1683.One of the Dutch African arrivals, Anthony Johnson, would later own one of the first black \"slaves\", John Casor, resulting from the court ruling of a civil case.The popular conception of a race-based slave system did not fully develop until the 18th century. The Dutch West India Company introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves into New Amsterdam (present-day New York City). All the colony's slaves, however, were freed upon its surrender to the British.\n\nMassachusetts was the first British colony to legally recognize slavery in 1641. In 1662, Virginia passed a law that children of enslaved women (who were of African descent and thus foreigners) took the status of the mother, rather than that of the father, as under English common law. This principle was called partus sequitur ventrum.By an act of 1699, the colony ordered all free blacks deported, virtually defining as slaves all people of African descent who remained in the colony. In 1670, the colonial assembly passed a law prohibiting free and baptized negroes (and Indians) from purchasing Christians (in this act meaning English or European whites) but allowing them to buy people \"of their owne nation\".In the Spanish Louisiana although there was no movement toward abolition of the African slave trade, Spanish rule introduced a new law called coartaci\u00f3n, which allowed slaves to buy their freedom, and that of others. Although some did not have the money to buy their freedom that government measures on slavery allowed a high number of free blacks. That brought problems to the Spaniards with the French Creoles who also populated Spanish Louisiana, French creoles cited that measure as one of the system's worst elements. In spite of that, there was a greater number of slaves as the years passed, as also the entire Spanish Louisiana population increased.\nThe earliest African-American congregations and churches were organized before 1800 in both northern and southern cities following the Great Awakening. By 1775, Africans made up 20% of the population in the American colonies, which made them the second largest ethnic group after the English.\n\n\n=== From the American Revolution to the Civil War ===\n\nDuring the 1770s, Africans, both enslaved and free, helped rebellious English colonists secure American independence by defeating the British in the American Revolution. Africans and Englishmen fought side by side and were fully integrated. Blacks played a role in both sides in the American Revolution. Activists in the Patriot cause included James Armistead, Prince Whipple and Oliver Cromwell.In the Spanish Louisiana, Governor Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez organized Spanish free blackmen into two militia companies to defend New Orleans during the American Revolution. They fought in the 1779 battle in which Spain took Baton Rouge from the British. G\u00e1lvez also commanded them in campaigns against the British outposts in Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, he recruited slaves for the militia by pledging to free anyone who was seriously wounded and promised to secure a low price for coartaci\u00f3n (buy their freedom and that of others) for those who received lesser wounds. During the 1790s, Governor Francisco Luis H\u00e9ctor, baron of Carondelet reinforced local fortifications and recruit even more free blackmen for the militia. Carondelet doubled the number of free blackmen who served, creating two more militia companies\u2014one made up of black members and the other of pardo (mixed race). Serving in the militia brought free blackmen one step closer to equality with whites, allowing them, for example, the right to carry arms and boosting their earning power. However actually these privileges distanced free blackmen from enslaved blacks and encouraged them to identify with whites.Slavery had been tacitly enshrined in the U.S. Constitution through provisions such as Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, commonly known as the 3/5 compromise. Slavery, which by then meant almost exclusively African Americans, was the most important political issue in the antebellum United States, leading to one crisis after another. Among these were the Missouri Compromise, the Compromise of 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act, and the Dred Scott decision.\n\nPrior to the Civil War, eight serving presidents owned slaves, a practice protected by the U.S. Constitution. By 1860, there were 3.5 to 4.4 million enslaved blacks in the U.S. due to the Atlantic slave trade, and another 488,000\u2013500,000 African Americans lived free (with legislated limits) across the country. With legislated limits imposed upon them in addition to \"unconquerable prejudice\" from whites according to Henry Clay, some blacks who weren't enslaved left the U.S. for Liberia in Africa. Liberia began as a settlement of the American Colonization Society (ACS) in 1821, with the abolitionist members of the ACS believing blacks would face better chances for freedom and equality in Africa.The slaves not only constituted a large investment, they produced America's most valuable product and export: cotton. They not only helped build the U.S. Capitol, they built the White House and other District of Columbia buildings. (Washington was a slave trading center.) Similar building projects existed in slaveholding states.\nIn 1863, during the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. The proclamation declared that all slaves in Confederate-held territory were free. Advancing Union troops enforced the proclamation with Texas being the last state to be emancipated, in 1865.\n\nSlavery in Union-held Confederate territory continued, at least on paper, until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865. Prior to the Civil War, only white men of property could vote, and the Naturalization Act of 1790 limited U.S. citizenship to whites only. The 14th Amendment (1868) gave African-Americans citizenship, and the 15th Amendment (1870) gave African-American males the right to vote (only males could vote in the U.S. at the time).\n\n\n=== Reconstruction Era and Jim Crow ===\n\nAfrican Americans quickly set up congregations for themselves, as well as schools and community/civic associations, to have space away from white control or oversight. While the post-war Reconstruction era was initially a time of progress for African Americans, that period ended in 1876. By the late 1890s, Southern states enacted Jim Crow laws to enforce racial segregation and disenfranchisement. Segregation, which began with slavery, continued with Jim Crow laws, with signs used to show blacks where they could legally walk, talk, drink, rest, or eat. For those places that were racially mixed, non-whites had to wait until all white customers were dealt with. Most African Americans obeyed the Jim Crow laws, to avoid racially motivated violence. To maintain self-esteem and dignity, African Americans such as Anthony Overton and Mary McLeod Bethune continued to build their own schools, churches, banks, social clubs, and other businesses.In the last decade of the 19th century, racially discriminatory laws and racial violence aimed at African Americans began to mushroom in the United States, a period often referred to as the \"nadir of American race relations\".  These discriminatory acts included racial segregation\u2014upheld by the United States Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896\u2014which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the local level of government, voter suppression or disenfranchisement in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities.\n\n\n=== Great migration and civil rights movement ===\n\nThe desperate conditions of African Americans in the South sparked the Great Migration during the first half of the 20th century which led to a growing African-American community in Northern and Western United States. The rapid influx of blacks disturbed the racial balance within Northern and Western cities, exacerbating hostility between both blacks and whites in the two regions. The Red Summer of 1919 was marked by hundreds of deaths and higher casualties across the U.S. as a result of race riots that occurred in more than three dozen cities, such as the Chicago race riot of 1919 and the Omaha race riot of 1919. Overall, blacks in Northern and Western cities experienced systemic discrimination in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility. Within the housing market, stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx, resulting in a mix of \"targeted violence, restrictive covenants, redlining and racial steering\". While many whites defended their space with violence, intimidation, or legal tactics toward African Americans, many other whites migrated to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions, a process known as white flight.\n\nDespite discrimination, drawing cards for leaving the hopelessness in the South were the growth of African American institutions and communities in Northern cities.  Institutions included black oriented organizations (e.g., Urban League, NAACP), churches, businesses, and newspapers, as well as successes in the development in African American intellectual culture, music, and popular culture (e.g., Harlem Renaissance, Chicago Black Renaissance). The Cotton Club in Harlem was a whites-only establishment, with blacks (such as Duke Ellington) allowed to perform, but to a white audience. Black Americans also found a new ground for political power in Northern cities, without the enforced disabilities of Jim Crow.By the 1950s, the civil rights movement was gaining momentum. A 1955 lynching that sparked public outrage about injustice was that of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old boy from Chicago. Spending the summer with relatives in Money, Mississippi, Till was killed for allegedly having wolf-whistled at a white woman. Till had been badly beaten, one of his eyes was gouged out, and he was shot in the head. The visceral response to his mother's decision to have an open-casket funeral mobilized the black community throughout the U.S. Vann R. Newkirk| wrote \"the trial of his killers became a pageant illuminating the tyranny of white supremacy\". The state of Mississippi tried two defendants, but they were speedily acquitted by an all-white jury. One hundred days after Emmett Till's murder, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on the bus in Alabama\u2014indeed, Parks told Emmett's mother Mamie Till that \"the photograph of Emmett's disfigured face in the casket was set in her mind when she refused to give up her seat on the Montgomery bus.\"\n\nThe March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the conditions which brought it into being are credited with putting pressure on presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson put his support behind passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which expanded federal authority over states to ensure black political participation through protection of voter registration and elections. By 1966, the emergence of the Black Power movement, which lasted from 1966 to 1975, expanded upon the aims of the civil rights movement to include economic and political self-sufficiency, and freedom from white authority.During the postwar period, many African Americans continued to be economically disadvantaged relative to other Americans. Average black income stood at 54 percent of that of white workers in 1947, and 55 percent in 1962. In 1959, median family income for whites was $5,600, compared with $2,900 for nonwhite families. In 1965, 43 percent of all black families fell into the poverty bracket, earning under $3,000 a year. The Sixties saw improvements in the social and economic conditions of many black Americans.From 1965 to 1969, black family income rose from 54 to 60 percent of white family income. In 1968, 23 percent of black families earned under $3,000 a year, compared with 41 percent in 1960. In 1965, 19 percent of black Americans had incomes equal to the national median, a proportion that rose to 27 percent by 1967. In 1960, the median level of education for blacks had been 10.8 years, and by the late Sixties the figure rose to 12.2 years, half a year behind the median for whites.\n\n\n=== Post\u2013civil rights era ===\n\nPolitically and economically, African Americans have made substantial strides during the post\u2013civil rights era. In 1989, Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected governor in U.S. history. Clarence Thomas became the second African-American Supreme Court Justice. In 1992, Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois became the first African-American woman elected to the U.S. Senate. There were 8,936 black officeholders in the United States in 2000, showing a net increase of 7,467 since 1970. In 2001, there were 484 black mayors.In 2005, the number of Africans immigrating to the United States, in a single year, surpassed the peak number who were involuntarily brought to the United States during the Atlantic Slave Trade. On November 4, 2008, Democratic Senator Barack Obama defeated Republican Senator John McCain to become the first African American to be elected president. At least 95 percent of African-American voters voted for Obama. He also received overwhelming support from young and educated whites, a majority of Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans picking up a number of new states in the Democratic electoral column. Obama lost the overall white vote, although he won a larger proportion of white votes than any previous nonincumbent Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter. Obama was reelected for a second and final term, by a similar margin on November 6, 2012.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn 1790, when the first U.S. Census was taken, Africans (including slaves and free people) numbered about 760,000\u2014about 19.3% of the population. In 1860, at the start of the Civil War, the African-American population had increased to 4.4 million, but the percentage rate dropped to 14% of the overall population of the country. The vast majority were slaves, with only 488,000 counted as \"freemen\". By 1900, the black population had doubled and reached 8.8 million.In 1910, about 90% of African Americans lived in the South. Large numbers began migrating north looking for better job opportunities and living conditions, and to escape Jim Crow laws and racial violence. The Great Migration, as it was called, spanned the 1890s to the 1970s. From 1916 through the 1960s, more than 6 million black people moved north. But in the 1970s and 1980s, that trend reversed, with more African Americans moving south to the Sun Belt than leaving it.The following table of the African-American population in the United States over time shows that the African-American population, as a percentage of the total population, declined until 1930 and has been rising since then.\n\nBy 1990, the African-American population reached about 30 million and represented 12% of the U.S. population, roughly the same proportion as in 1900.At the time of the 2000 Census, 54.8% of African Americans lived in the South. In that year, 17.6% of African Americans lived in the Northeast and 18.7% in the Midwest, while only 8.9% lived in the western states. The west does have a sizable black population in certain areas, however. California, the nation's most populous state, has the fifth largest African-American population, only behind New York, Texas, Georgia, and Florida. According to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.05% of African Americans identified as Hispanic or Latino in origin, many of whom may be of Brazilian, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Cuban, Haitian, or other Latin American descent. The only self-reported ancestral groups larger than African Americans are the Irish and Germans.According to the 2010 U.S. Census, nearly 3% of people who self-identified as black had recent ancestors who immigrated from another country. Self-reported non-Hispanic black immigrants from the Caribbean, mostly from Jamaica and Haiti, represented 0.9% of the U.S. population, at 2.6 million. Self-reported black immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa also represented 0.9%, at about 2.8 million. Additionally, self-identified Black Hispanics represented 0.4% of the United States population, at about 1.2 million people, largely found within the Puerto Rican and Dominican communities. Self-reported black immigrants hailing from other countries in the Americas, such as Brazil and Canada, as well as several European countries, represented less than 0.1% of the population. Mixed-Race Hispanic and non-Hispanic Americans who identified as being part black, represented 0.9% of the population. Of the 12.6% of United States residents who identified as black, around 10.3% were \"native black American\" or ethnic African Americans, who are direct descendants of West/Central Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves. These individuals make up well over 80% of all blacks in the country. When including people of mixed-race origin, about 13.5% of the U.S. population self-identified as black or \"mixed with black\". However, according to the U.S. census bureau, evidence from the 2000 Census indicates that many African and Caribbean immigrant ethnic groups do not identify as \"Black, African Am., or Negro\". Instead, they wrote in their own respective ethnic groups in the \"Some Other Race\" write-in entry. As a result, the census bureau devised a new, separate \"African American\" ethnic group category in 2010 for ethnic African Americans.\n\n\n=== U.S. cities ===\n\nAfter 100 years of African-Americans leaving the south in large numbers seeking better opportunities and treatment in the west and north, a movement known as the Great Migration, there is now a reverse trend, called the New Great Migration. As with the earlier Great Migration, the New Great Migration is primarily directed toward cities and large urban areas, such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Dallas, Raleigh, Tampa, San Antonio, Memphis, Nashville, Jacksonville, and so forth. A growing percentage of African-Americans from the west and north are migrating to the southern region of the U.S. for economic and cultural reasons.  New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles have the highest decline in African Americans, while Atlanta, Dallas, and Houston have the highest increase respectively.Among cities of 100,000 or more, Detroit, Michigan had the highest percentage of black residents of any U.S. city in 2010, with 82%. Other large cities with African-American majorities include Jackson, Mississippi (79.4%), Miami Gardens, Florida (76.3%), Baltimore, Maryland (63%), Birmingham, Alabama (62.5%), Memphis, Tennessee (61%), New Orleans, Louisiana (60%), Montgomery, Alabama (56.6%), Flint, Michigan (56.6%), Savannah, Georgia (55.0%), Augusta, Georgia (54.7%), Atlanta, Georgia (54%, see African Americans in Atlanta), Cleveland, Ohio (53.3%), Newark, New Jersey (52.35%), Washington, D.C. (50.7%), Richmond, Virginia (50.6%), Mobile, Alabama (50.6%), Baton Rouge, Louisiana (50.4%), and Shreveport, Louisiana (50.4%).\nThe nation's most affluent community with an African-American majority resides in View Park\u2013Windsor Hills, California with an annual median income of $159,618. Other largely affluent predominantly African-American communities include Prince George's County in Maryland (namely Mitchellville, Woodmore, and Upper Marlboro), Dekalb County and South Fulton in Georgia, Charles City County in Virginia, Baldwin Hills in California, Hillcrest and Uniondale in New York, and Cedar Hill, DeSoto, and Missouri City in Texas. Queens County, New York is the only county with a population of 65,000 or more where African Americans have a higher median household income than White Americans.Seatack, Virginia is currently the oldest African-American community in the United States. It survives today with a vibrant and active civic community.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nBy 2012, African Americans had advanced greatly in education attainment. They still lagged overall compared to white or Asian Americans but surpassed other ethnic minorities, with 19 percent earning bachelor's degrees and 6 percent earning advanced degrees. Between 1995 and 2009, freshmen college enrollment for African Americans increased by 73 percent and only 15 percent for whites. Black women are enrolled in college more than any other race and gender group, leading all with 9.7% enrolled according to the 2011 U.S. Census Bureau. Predominantly black schools for kindergarten through twelfth grade students were common throughout the U.S. before the 1970s. By 1972, however, desegregation efforts meant that only 25% of Black students were in schools with more than 90% non-white students. However, since then, a trend towards re-segregation affected communities across the country: by 2011, 2.9 million African-American students were in such overwhelmingly minority schools, including 53% of Black students in school districts that were formerly under desegregation orders.Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), which were originally set up when segregated colleges did not admit African Americans, continue to thrive and educate students of all races today. The majority of HBCUs were established in the southeastern United States, Alabama has the most HBCUs of any state.As late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. By 1969, illiteracy as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among younger African Americans.U.S. Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans aged 25 to 29 had completed a high-school education, less than whites or Asians, but more than Hispanics. On many college entrance, standardized tests and grades, African Americans have historically lagged behind whites, but some studies suggest that the achievement gap has been closing. Many policy makers have proposed that this gap can and will be eliminated through policies such as affirmative action, desegregation, and multiculturalism.The average high school graduation rate of blacks in the United States has steadily increased to 71% in 2013. Separating this statistic into component parts shows it varies greatly depending upon the state and the school district examined. 38% of black males graduated in the state of New York but in Maine 97% graduated and exceeded the white male graduation rate by 11 percentage points. In much of the southeastern United States and some parts of the southwestern United States the graduation rate of white males was in fact below 70% such as in Florida where 62% of white males graduated from high school. Examining specific school districts paints an even more complex picture. In the Detroit school district the graduation rate of black males was 20% but 7% for white males. In the New York City school district 28% of black males graduate from high school compared to 57% of white males. In Newark County 76% of black males graduated compared to 67% for white males. Further academic improvement has occurred in 2015. Roughly 23% of all blacks have bachelor's degrees. In 1988, 21% of whites had obtained a bachelor's degree versus 11% of blacks. In 2015, 23% of blacks had obtained a bachelor's degree versus 36% of whites. Foreign born blacks, 9% of the black population, made even greater strides. They exceed native born blacks by 10 percentage points.\n\n\n=== Economic status ===\n\nEconomically, African Americans have benefited from the advances made during the civil rights era, particularly among the educated, but not without the lingering effects of historical marginalisation when considered as a whole. The racial disparity in poverty rates has narrowed. The black middle class has grown substantially. In 2010, 45% of African Americans owned their homes, compared to 67% of all Americans. The poverty rate among African Americans has decreased from 26.5% in 1998 to 24.7% in 2004, compared to 12.7% for all Americans.\n\nAfrican Americans have a combined buying power of over $892 billion currently and likely over $1.1 trillion by 2012. In 2002, African American-owned businesses accounted for 1.2 million of the US's 23 million businesses. As of 2011 African American-owned businesses account for approximately 2 million US businesses. Black-owned businesses experienced the largest growth in number of businesses among minorities from 2002 to 2011.In 2004, African-American men had the third-highest earnings of American minority groups after Asian Americans and non-Hispanic whites.Twenty-five percent of blacks had white-collar occupations (management, professional, and related fields) in 2000, compared with 33.6% of Americans overall. In 2001, over half of African-American households of married couples earned $50,000 or more. Although in the same year African Americans were over-represented among the nation's poor, this was directly related to the disproportionate percentage of African-American families headed by single women; such families are collectively poorer, regardless of ethnicity.In 2006, the median earnings of African-American men was more than black and non-black American women overall, and in all educational levels. At the same time, among American men, income disparities were significant; the median income of African-American men was approximately 76 cents for every dollar of their European American counterparts, although the gap narrowed somewhat with a rise in educational level.Overall, the median earnings of African-American men were 72 cents for every dollar earned of their Asian American counterparts, and $1.17 for every dollar earned by Hispanic men. On the other hand, by 2006, among American women with post-secondary education, African-American women have made significant advances; the median income of African-American women was more than those of their Asian-, European- and Hispanic American counterparts with at least some college education.The U.S. public sector is the single most important source of employment for African Americans. During 2008\u20132010, 21.2% of all Black workers were public employees, compared with 16.3% of non-Black workers. Both before and after the onset of the Great Recession, African Americans were 30% more likely than other workers to be employed in the public sector.The public sector is also a critical source of decent-paying jobs for Black Americans. For both men and women, the median wage earned by Black employees is significantly higher in the public sector than in other industries.In 1999, the median income of African-American families was $33,255 compared to $53,356 of European Americans. In times of economic hardship for the nation, African Americans suffer disproportionately from job loss and underemployment, with the black underclass being hardest hit. The phrase \"last hired and first fired\" is reflected in the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment figures. Nationwide, the October 2008 unemployment rate for African Americans was 11.1%, while the nationwide rate was 6.5%.The income gap between black and white families is also significant. In 2005, employed blacks earned 65% of the wages of whites, down from 82% in 1975. The New York Times reported in 2006 that in Queens, New York, the median income among African-American families exceeded that of white families, which the newspaper attributed to the growth in the number of two-parent black families. It noted that Queens was the only county with more than 65,000 residents where that was true.In 2011, it was reported that 72% of black babies were born to unwed mothers. The poverty rate among single-parent black families was 39.5% in 2005, according to Williams, while it was 9.9% among married-couple black families. Among white families, the respective rates were 26.4% and 6% in poverty.\nCollectively, African Americans are more involved in the American political process than other minority groups in the United States, indicated by the highest level of voter registration and participation in elections among these groups in 2004. African Americans collectively attain higher levels of education than immigrants to the United States. African Americans also have the highest level of Congressional representation of any minority group in the U.S.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\n\nA large majority of African Americans support the Democratic Party. In the 2004 Presidential Election, Democrat John Kerry received 88% of the African-American vote compared to 11% for Republican George W. Bush. Although there is an African-American lobby in foreign policy, it has not had the impact that African-American organizations have had in domestic policy.Many African Americans were excluded from electoral politics in the decades following the end of Reconstruction. For those that could participate, until the New Deal, African Americans were supporters of the Republican Party because it was Republican President Abraham Lincoln who helped in granting freedom to American slaves; at the time, the Republicans and Democrats represented the sectional interests of the North and South, respectively, rather than any specific ideology, and both conservative and liberal were represented equally in both parties.\nThe African-American trend of voting for Democrats can be traced back to the 1930s during the Great Depression, when Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program provided economic relief to African Americans. Roosevelt's New Deal coalition turned the Democratic Party into an organization of the working class and their liberal allies, regardless of region. The African-American vote became even more solidly Democratic when Democratic presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson pushed for civil rights legislation during the 1960s. In 1960, nearly a third of African Americans voted for Republican Richard Nixon.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nThe life expectancy for Black men in 2008 was 70.8 years. Life expectancy for Black women was 77.5 years in 2008. In 1900, when information on Black life expectancy started being collated, a Black man could expect to live to 32.5 years and a Black woman 33.5 years. In 1900, White men lived an average of 46.3 years and White women lived an average of 48.3 years. African-American life expectancy at birth is persistently five to seven years lower than European Americans.Black people have higher rates of obesity, diabetes and hypertension than the U.S. average. For adult Black men, the rate of obesity was 31.6% in 2010. For adult Black women, the rate of obesity was 41.2% in 2010. African Americans have higher rates of mortality than does any other racial or ethnic group for 8 of the top 10 causes of death. In 2013, among men, black men had the highest rate of getting cancer, followed by white, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI), and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) men. Among women, white women had the highest rate of getting cancer, followed by black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native women.\nViolence has an impact upon African-American life expectancy. A report from the U.S. Department of Justice states \"In 2005, homicide victimization rates for blacks were 6 times higher than the rates for whites\". The report also found that \"94% of black victims were killed by blacks.\"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, African-Americans also have higher rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) compared to whites, with 5 times the rates of syphilis and chlamydia, and 7.5 times the rate of gonorrhea.AIDS is one of the top three causes of death for African-American men aged 25\u201354 and for African-American women aged 35\u201344 years. In the United States, African Americans make up about 48% of the total HIV-positive population and make up more than half of new HIV cases. The main route of transmission for women is through unprotected heterosexual sex. African-American women are 19 times more likely to contract HIV than other women.Washington, D.C. has the nation's highest rate of HIV/AIDS infection, at 3%. This rate is comparable to what is seen in West Africa, and is considered a severe epidemic. Dr. Ray Martins, Chief Medical Officer at the Whitman-Walker Clinic, the largest provider of HIV care in Washington D.C., estimated that the actual underlying percent with HIV/AIDS in the city is \"closer to five percent\".Although in the last decade black youth have had lower rates of cannabis (marijuana) consumption than whites of the same age, they have disproportionately higher arrest rates than whites: in 2010, for example, blacks were 3.73 times as likely to get arrested for using cannabis than whites, despite not significantly more frequently being users.\n\n\n=== Sexuality ===\n\nAccording to a Gallup survey, 4.6% of Black or African-Americans self-identified as LGBT in 2016, while the total portion of American adults in all ethnic groups identifying as LGBT was 4.1% in 2016. The disproportionately high incidence of HIV/AIDS among African-Americans has been attributed to homophobic influences and lack of access to proper healthcare.\n\n\n== Genetics ==\n\n\n=== Genome-wide studies ===\n\nRecent surveys of African Americans using a genetic testing service have found varied ancestries which show different tendencies by region and sex of ancestors. These studies found that on average, African Americans have 73.2\u201382.1% West African, 16.7%\u201324% European, and 0.8\u20131.2% Native American genetic ancestry, with large variation between individuals. Genetics websites themselves have reported similar ranges, with some finding 1 or 2 percent Native American ancestry and Ancestry.com reporting an outlying percentage of European ancestry among African Americans, 29%.According to a genome-wide study by Bryc et al. (2009), the mixed ancestry of African Americans in varying ratios came about as the result of sexual contact between West/Central Africans (more frequently females) and Europeans (more frequently males). Consequently, the 365 African Americans in their sample have a genome-wide average of 78.1% West African ancestry and 18.5% European ancestry, with large variation among individuals (ranging from 99% to 1% West African ancestry). The West African ancestral component in African Americans is most similar to that in present-day speakers from the non-Bantu branches of the Niger-Congo (Niger-Kordofanian) family.Correspondingly, Montinaro et al. (2014) observed that around 50% of the overall ancestry of African Americans traces back to the Niger-Congo-speaking Yoruba of southwestern Nigeria and southern Benin, reflecting the centrality of this West African region in the Atlantic Slave Trade. The next most frequent ancestral component found among African Americans was derived from Great Britain, in keeping with historical records. It constitutes a little over 10% of their overall ancestry, and is most similar to the Northwest European ancestral component also carried by Barbadians. Zakharaia et al. (2009) found a similar proportion of Yoruba associated ancestry in their African-American samples, with a minority also drawn from Mandenka and Bantu populations. Additionally, the researchers observed an average European ancestry of 21.9%, again with significant variation between individuals. Bryc et al. (2009) note that populations from other parts of the continent may also constitute adequate proxies for the ancestors of some African-American individuals; namely, ancestral populations from Guinea Bissau, Senegal and Sierra Leone in West Africa and Angola in Southern Africa.Altogether, genetic studies suggest that African Americans are a multiracial people. According to DNA analysis led in 2006 by Penn State geneticist Mark D. Shriver, around 58 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5% European ancestry (equivalent to one European great-grandparent and his/her forebears), 19.6 percent of African Americans have at least 25% European ancestry (equivalent to one European grandparent and his/her forebears), and 1 percent of African Americans have at least 50% European ancestry (equivalent to one European parent and his/her forebears). According to Shriver, around 5 percent of African Americans also have at least 12.5% Native American ancestry (equivalent to one Native American great-grandparent and his/her forebears). Research suggests that Native American ancestry among people who identify as African American is a result of relationships that occurred soon after slave ships arrived in the American colonies, and European ancestry is of more recent origin, often from the decades before the Civil War.\n\n\n=== Y-DNA ===\nAfricans bearing the E-V38 (E1b1a) likely traversed across the Sahara, from east to west, approximately 19,000 years ago. E-M2 (E1b1a1) likely originated in West Africa or Central Africa. According to a Y-DNA study by Sims et al. (2007), the majority (\u224860%) of African Americans belong to various subclades of the E-M2 (E1b1a1, formerly E3a) paternal haplogroup. This is the most common genetic paternal lineage found today among West/Central African males, and is also a signature of the historical Bantu migrations. The next most frequent Y-DNA haplogroup observed among African Americans is the R1b clade, which around 15% of African Americans carry. This lineage is most common today among Northwestern European males. The remaining African Americans mainly belong to the paternal haplogroup I (\u22487%), which is also frequent in Northwestern Europe.\n\n\n=== mtDNA ===\nAccording to an mtDNA study by Salas et al. (2005), the maternal lineages of African Americans are most similar to haplogroups that are today especially common in West Africa (>55%), followed closely by West-Central Africa and Southwestern Africa (<41%). The characteristic West African haplogroups L1b, L2b,c,d, and L3b,d and West-Central African haplogroups L1c and L3e in particular occur at high frequencies among African Americans. As with the paternal DNA of African Americans, contributions from other parts of the continent to their maternal gene pool are insignificant.\n\n\n== Social status ==\n\nAfrican Americans have improved their social and economic standing significantly since the civil rights movement and recent decades have witnessed the expansion of a robust, African-American middle class across the United States. Unprecedented access to higher education and employment in addition to representation in the highest levels of American government has been gained by African Americans in the post\u2013civil rights era.\n\n\n=== Economic issues ===\n\nOne of the most serious and long-standing issues within African-American communities is poverty. Poverty is associated with higher rates of marital stress and dissolution, physical and mental health problems, disability, cognitive deficits, low educational attainment, and crime. In 2004, almost 25% of African-American families lived below the poverty level. In 2007, the average income for African Americans was approximately $34,000, compared to $55,000 for whites. Forty percent of prison inmates are African-American. African Americans experience a higher rate of unemployment than the general population. African American males are more likely to be killed by police when compared to other races killed by police. This is one of the factors that led to the creation of the Black Lives Matter movement.African Americans have a long and diverse history of business ownership. Although the first African-American business is unknown, slaves captured from West Africa are believed to have established commercial enterprises as peddlers and skilled craftspeople as far back as the 17th century. Around 1900, Booker T. Washington became the most famous proponent of African-American businesses. His critic and rival W. E. B. DuBois also commended business as a vehicle for African-American advancement.\n\n\n=== Social issues ===\n\nAfter over 50 years, marriage rates for all Americans began to decline while divorce rates and out-of-wedlock births have climbed. These changes have been greatest among African Americans. After more than 70 years of racial parity black marriage rates began to fall behind whites. Single-parent households have become common, and according to U.S. census figures released in January 2010, only 38 percent of black children live with both their parents.In 2008, Democrats overwhelmingly voted 70% against California Proposition 8, African Americans voted 58% in favor of it while 42% voted against Proposition 8. On May 9, 2012, Barack Obama, the first black president, became the first U.S. president to support same-sex marriage. Since Obama's endorsement there has been a rapid growth in support for same-sex marriage among African Americans. As of 2012, 59% of African Americans support same-sex marriage, which is higher than support among the national average (53%) and white Americans (50%).Polls in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Maryland, Ohio, Florida, and Nevada have also shown an increase in support for same sex marriage among African Americans. On November 6, 2012, Maryland, Maine, and Washington all voted for approve of same-sex marriage, along with Minnesota rejecting a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Exit polls in Maryland show about 50% of African Americans voted for same-sex marriage, showing a vast evolution among African Americans on the issue and was crucial in helping pass same-sex marriage in Maryland.Black Americans hold far more conservative opinions on abortion, extramarital sex, and raising children out of wedlock than Democrats as a whole. On financial issues, however, African Americans are in line with Democrats, generally supporting a more progressive tax structure to provide more government spending on social services.\n\n\n=== Political legacy ===\n\nAfrican Americans have fought in every war in the history of the United States.The gains made by African Americans in the civil rights movement and in the Black Power movement not only obtained certain rights for African Americans, but changed American society in far-reaching and fundamentally important ways. Prior to the 1950s, Black Americans in the South were subject to de jure discrimination, or Jim Crow laws. They were often the victims of extreme cruelty and violence, sometimes resulting in deaths: by the post World War II era, African Americans became increasingly discontented with their long-standing inequality. In the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., African Americans and their supporters challenged the nation to \"rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed that all men are created equal ...\"The civil rights movement marked an enormous change in American social, political, economic and civic life. It brought with it boycotts, sit-ins, nonviolent demonstrations and marches, court battles, bombings and other violence; prompted worldwide media coverage and intense public debate; forged enduring civic, economic and religious alliances; and disrupted and realigned the nation's two major political parties.\nOver time, it has changed in fundamental ways the manner in which blacks and whites interact with and relate to one another. The movement resulted in the removal of codified, de jure racial segregation and discrimination from American life and law, and heavily influenced other groups and movements in struggles for civil rights and social equality within American society, including the Free Speech Movement, the disabled, the women's movement, Native Americans, and migrant workers.\n\n\n== Media and coverage ==\n\nSome activists and academics contend that American news media coverage of African-American news, concerns, or dilemmas is inadequate, or that the news media present distorted images of African Americans.To combat this, Robert L. Johnson founded Black Entertainment Television, a network that targets young African Americans and urban audiences in the United States. Over the years, the network has aired such programming as rap and R&B music videos, urban-oriented movies and television series, and some public affairs programs. On Sunday mornings, BET would broadcast Christian programming; the network would also broadcast non-affiliated Christian programs during the early morning hours daily. BET is now a global network that reaches households in the United States, Caribbean, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The network has gone on to spawn several spin-off channels, including BET Her (originally launched as BET on Jazz), which originally showcased jazz music-related programming, and later expanded to include general-interest urban programs as well as some R&B, soul, and world music.Another network targeting African-Americans is TV One. TV One's original programming was formally focused on lifestyle and entertainment-oriented shows, movies, fashion, and music programming. The network also reruns classic series from as far back as the 1970s to current series such as Empire and Sister Circle. TV One is owned by Urban One, founded and controlled by Catherine Hughes. Urban One is one of the nation's largest radio broadcasting companies and the largest African-American-owned radio broadcasting company in the United States.African-American networks that were scheduled to launch in 2009 include the Black Television News Channel founded by former Congressman J. C. Watts and Better Black Television founded by Percy Miller. In June 2009, NBC News launched a new website named The Grio in partnership with the production team that created the black documentary film Meeting David Wilson. It is the first African-American video news site that focuses on underrepresented stories in existing national news. The Grio consists of a broad spectrum of original video packages, news articles, and contributor blogs on topics including breaking news, politics, health, business, entertainment and Black History.Other Black-owned and oriented media outlets include:\n\nThe Africa Channel \u2013 Dedicated to programming representing the best in African culture.\naspireTV \u2013 a digital cable and satellite channel owned by businessman and former basketball player Magic Johnson.\nATTV \u2013 an independent public affairs and educational channel.\nBounce TV \u2013 a digital multicast network owned by E. W. Scripps Company.\nCleo TV \u2013 a sister network to TV One targeting African-American women.\nFox Soul \u2013 a digital streaming channel primarily airing original talk shows and syndicated programming\nOprah Winfrey Network \u2013 a cable and satellite network founded by Oprah Winfrey and jointly owned by Discovery, Inc. and Harpo Studios. While not exclusively targeting African Americans, much of its original programming is geared towards a similar demographic.\nRevolt \u2013 a music channel owned by Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs.\nSoul of the South Network \u2013 a regional broadcast network.\nVH1 \u2013 A female-oriented general entertainment channel owned by Viacom. Originally focused on light genres of music, the network's programming became slanted towards African American culture in recent years.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nFrom their earliest presence in North America, African Americans have significantly contributed literature, art, agricultural skills, cuisine, clothing styles, music, language, and social and technological innovation to American culture. The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the United States, such as yams, peanuts, rice, okra, sorghum, grits, watermelon, indigo dyes, and cotton, can be traced to West African and African-American influences. Notable examples include George Washington Carver, who created 300 products from peanuts, 118 products from sweet potatoes, and 75 products from pecans; and George Crum, a local legend associates him with the creation of the potato chip in 1853. Soul food is a variety of cuisine popular among African Americans. It is closely related to the cuisine of the Southern United States. The descriptive terminology may have originated in the mid-1960s, when soul was a common definer used to describe African-American culture (for example, soul music). African Americans were the first peoples in the United States to make fried chicken, along with Scottish immigrants to the South. Although the Scottish had been frying chicken before they emigrated, they lacked the spices and flavor that African Americans had used when preparing the meal. The Scottish American settlers therefore adopted the African-American method of seasoning chicken. However, fried chicken was generally a rare meal in the African-American community, and was usually reserved for special events or celebrations.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nAfrican-American English is a variety (dialect, ethnolect, and sociolect) of American English, commonly spoken by urban working-class and largely bi-dialectal middle-class African Americans.African-American English evolved during the antebellum period through interaction between speakers of 16th- and 17th-century English of Great Britain and Ireland and various West African languages. As a result, the variety shares parts of its grammar and phonology with the Southern American English dialect. Where African-American English differs from Standard American English (SAE) is in certain pronunciation characteristics, tense usage and grammatical structures that were derived from West African languages, particularly those belonging to the Niger-Congo family.Virtually all habitual speakers of African-American English can understand and communicate in Standard American English. As with all linguistic forms, AAVE's usage is influenced by various factors, including geographical, educational and socioeconomic background, as well as formality of setting. Additionally, there are many literary uses of this variety of English, particularly in African-American literature.\n\n\n==== Traditional names ====\n\nAfrican-American names are part of the cultural traditions of African Americans. Prior to the 1950s, and 1960s, most African-American names closely resembled those used within European American culture. Babies of that era were generally given a few common names, with children using nicknames to distinguish the various people with the same name. With the rise of 1960s civil rights movement, there was a dramatic increase in names of various origins.By the 1970s, and 1980s, it had become common among African Americans to invent new names for themselves, although many of these invented names took elements from popular existing names. Prefixes such as La/Le, Da/De, Ra/Re and Ja/Je, and suffixes like -ique/iqua, -isha and -aun/-awn are common, as are inventive spellings for common names. The book Baby Names Now: From Classic to Cool\u2014The Very Last Word on First Names places the origins of \"La\" names in African-American culture in New Orleans.Even with the rise of inventive names, it is still common for African Americans to use biblical, historical, or traditional European names. Daniel, Christopher, Michael, David, James, Joseph, and Matthew were thus among the most frequent names for African-American boys in 2013.The name LaKeisha is typically considered American in origin, but has elements that were drawn from both French and West/Central African roots. Names such as LaTanisha, JaMarcus, DeAndre, and Shaniqua were created in the same way. Punctuation marks are seen more often within African-American names than other American names, such as the names Mo'nique and D'Andre.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe majority of African Americans are Protestant, many of whom follow the historically black churches. The term Black church refers to churches which minister to predominantly African-American congregations. Black congregations were first established by freed slaves at the end of the 17th century, and later when slavery was abolished more African Americans were allowed to create a unique form of Christianity that was culturally influenced by African spiritual traditions.According to a 2007 survey, more than half of the African-American population are part of the historically black churches. The largest Protestant denomination among African Americans are the Baptists, distributed mainly in four denominations, the largest being the National Baptist Convention, USA and the National Baptist Convention of America. The second largest are the Methodists, the largest denominations are the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church.Pentecostals are distributed among several different religious bodies, with the Church of God in Christ as the largest among them by far. About 16% of African-American Christians are members of white Protestant communions, these denominations (which include the United Church of Christ) mostly have a 2 to 3% African-American membership. There are also large numbers of Catholics, constituting 5% of the African-American population. Of the total number of Jehovah's Witnesses, 22% are black.Some African Americans follow Islam. Historically, between 15 and 30% of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas were Muslims, but most of these Africans were converted to Christianity during the era of American slavery. During the twentieth century, some African Americans converted to Islam, mainly through the influence of black nationalist groups that preached with distinctive Islamic practices; including the Moorish Science Temple of America, and the largest organization, the Nation of Islam, founded in the 1930s, which attracted at least 20,000 people by 1963, prominent members included activist Malcolm X and boxer Muhammad Ali.Malcolm X is considered the first person to start the movement among African Americans towards mainstream Islam, after he left the Nation and made the pilgrimage to Mecca. In 1975, Warith Deen Mohammed, the son of Elijah Muhammad took control of the Nation after his father's death and guided the majority of its members to orthodox Islam.African-American Muslims constitute 20% of the total U.S. Muslim population, the majority are Sunni or orthodox Muslims, some of these identify under the community of W. Deen Mohammed. The Nation of Islam led by Louis Farrakhan has a membership ranging from 20,000\u201350,000 members.There are relatively few African-American Jews; estimates of their number range from 20,000 to 200,000. Most of these Jews are part of mainstream groups such as the Reform, Conservative, or Orthodox branches of Judaism; although there are significant numbers of people who are part of non-mainstream Jewish groups, largely the Black Hebrew Israelites, whose beliefs include the claim that African Americans are descended from the Biblical Israelites.Confirmed atheists are less than one half of one-percent, similar to numbers for Hispanics.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nAfrican-American music is one of the most pervasive African-American cultural influences in the United States today and is among the most dominant in mainstream popular music. Hip hop, R&B, funk, rock and roll, soul, blues, and other contemporary American musical forms originated in black communities and evolved from other black forms of music, including blues, doo-wop, barbershop, ragtime, bluegrass, jazz, and gospel music.\nAfrican-American-derived musical forms have also influenced and been incorporated into virtually every other popular music genre in the world, including country and techno. African-American genres are the most important ethnic vernacular tradition in America, as they have developed independent of African traditions from which they arise more so than any other immigrant groups, including Europeans; make up the broadest and longest lasting range of styles in America; and have, historically, been more influential, interculturally, geographically, and economically, than other American vernacular traditions.\n\n\n=== Dance ===\nAfrican Americans have also had an important role in American dance. Bill T. Jones, a prominent modern choreographer and dancer, has included historical African-American themes in his work, particularly in the piece \"Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land\". Likewise, Alvin Ailey's artistic work, including his \"Revelations\" based on his experience growing up as an African American in the South during the 1930s, has had a significant influence on modern dance. Another form of dance, Stepping, is an African-American tradition whose performance and competition has been formalized through the traditionally black fraternities and sororities at universities.\n\n\n=== Literature and academics ===\nMany African-American authors have written stories, poems, and essays influenced by their experiences as African Americans. African-American literature is a major genre in American literature. Famous examples include Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison, and Maya Angelou.\nAfrican-American inventors have created many widely used devices in the world and have contributed to international innovation. Norbert Rillieux created the technique for converting sugar cane juice into white sugar crystals. Moreover, Rillieux left Louisiana in 1854 and went to France, where he spent ten years working with the Champollions deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics from the Rosetta Stone. Most slave inventors were nameless, such as the slave owned by the Confederate President Jefferson Davis who designed the ship propeller used by the Confederate navy.By 1913, over 1,000 inventions were patented by black Americans. Among the most notable inventors were Jan Matzeliger, who developed the first machine to mass-produce shoes, and Elijah McCoy, who invented automatic lubrication devices for steam engines. Granville Woods had 35 patents to improve electric railway systems, including the first system to allow moving trains to communicate. Garrett A. Morgan developed the first automatic traffic signal and gas mask.Lewis Howard Latimer invented an improvement for the incandescent light bulb. More recent inventors include Frederick McKinley Jones, who invented the movable refrigeration unit for food transport in trucks and trains. Lloyd Quarterman worked with six other black scientists on the creation of the atomic bomb (code named the Manhattan Project.) Quarterman also helped develop the first nuclear reactor, which was used in the atomically powered submarine called the Nautilus.A few other notable examples include the first successful open heart surgery, performed by Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, and the air conditioner, patented by Frederick McKinley Jones. Dr. Mark Dean holds three of the original nine patents on the computer on which all PCs are based. More current contributors include Otis Boykin, whose inventions included several novel methods for manufacturing electrical components that found use in applications such as guided missile systems and computers, and Colonel Frederick Gregory, who was not only the first black astronaut pilot but the person who redesigned the cockpits for the last three space shuttles. Gregory was also on the team that pioneered the microwave instrumentation landing system.\n\n\n== Mental health ==\nThe relationship between African Americans and mental health has many barriers. Counseling has been frowned upon and distant in utility and proximity to many people in the African American community. In 2004, a qualitative research study explored the disconnect with African Americans and mental health. The study was conducted as a semistructured discussion which allowed the focus group to express their opinions and life experiences. The results revealed a couple key variables that create barriers for many African American communities to seek mental health services such as the stigma, lack of four important necessities; trust, affordability, cultural understanding and impersonal services.Historically, many African American communities did not seek counseling because religion was a part of the family values. African American who have a faith background are more likely to seek prayer as a coping mechanism for mental issues rather than seeking professional mental health services. In 2015 a study concluded, African Americans with high value in religion are less likely to utilize mental health services compared to those who have low value in religion.Most counseling approaches are westernized and do not fit within the African American culture. African American families tend to resolve concerns within the family, and it is viewed by the family as a strength. On the other hand, when African Americans seek counseling, they face a social backlash and are criticized. They may be labeled \"crazy,\" viewed as weak, and their pride is diminished. Because of this, many African Americans instead seek mentorship within communities they trust.\nTerminology is another barrier in relation to African Americans and mental health. There is more stigma on the term psychotherapy versus counseling. In one study, psychotherapy is associated with mental illness whereas counseling approaches problem-solving, guidance and help. More African Americans seek assistance when it is called counseling and not psychotherapy because it is more welcoming within the cultural and community.Counselors are encouraged to be aware of such barriers for the well-being of African American clients. Without cultural competency training in health care, many African Americans go unheard and misunderstood.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\n\n\n=== General ===\n\nThe term African American carries important political overtones. Earlier terms used to describe Americans of African ancestry referred more to skin color than to ancestry, and were conferred upon the group by colonists and Americans of European ancestry; people with dark skins were considered inferior in fact and in law. Other terms (such as colored, person of color, or negro) were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which some thought were being used as tools of white supremacy and oppression.\n\nA 16-page pamphlet entitled \"A Sermon on the Capture of Lord Cornwallis\" is notable for the attribution of its authorship to \"An African American\". Published in 1782, the book's use of this phrase predates any other yet identified by more than 50 years.In the 1980s, the term African American was advanced on the model of, for example, German American or Irish American, to give descendants of American slaves, and other American blacks who lived through the slavery era, a heritage and a cultural base. The term was popularized in black communities around the country via word of mouth and ultimately received mainstream use after Jesse Jackson publicly used the term in front of a national audience in 1988. Subsequently, major media outlets adopted its use.Surveys show that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for African American versus Black American, although they have a slight preference for the latter in personal settings and the former in more formal settings. Many African Americans have expressed a preference for the term African American because it was formed in the same way as the terms for the many other ethnic groups currently living in the United States. Some argued further that, because of the historical circumstances surrounding the capture, enslavement, and systematic attempts to de-Africanize blacks in the United States under chattel slavery, most African Americans are unable to trace their ancestry to any specific African nation; hence, the entire continent serves as a geographic marker.The term African American embraces pan-Africanism as earlier enunciated by prominent African thinkers such as Marcus Garvey, W. E. B. Du Bois, and George Padmore. The term Afro-Usonian, and variations of such, are more rarely used.\n\n\n=== Official identity ===\n\nSince 1977, in an attempt to keep up with changing social opinion, the United States government has officially classified black people (revised to black or African American in 1997) as \"having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.\" Other federal offices, such as the U.S. Census Bureau, adhere to the Office of Management and Budget standards on race in its data collection and tabulations efforts. In preparation for the 2010 U.S. Census, a marketing and outreach plan, called 2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan (ICC) recognized and defined African Americans as black people born in the United States. From the ICC perspective, African Americans are one of three groups of black people in the United States.The ICC plan was to reach the three groups by acknowledging that each group has its own sense of community that is based on geography and ethnicity. The best way to market the census process toward any of the three groups is to reach them through their own unique communication channels and not treat the entire black population of the U.S. as though they are all African Americans with a single ethnic and geographical background. The Federal Bureau of Investigation of the U.S. Department of Justice categorizes black or African-American people as \"[a] person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa\" through racial categories used in the UCR Program adopted from the Statistical Policy Handbook (1978) and published by the Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce, derived from the 1977 Office of Management and Budget classification.\n\n\n=== Admixture ===\n\nHistorically, \"race mixing\" between black and white people was taboo in the United States. So-called anti-miscegenation laws, barring blacks and whites from marrying or having sex, were established in colonial America as early as 1691, and endured in many Southern states until the Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional in Loving v. Virginia (1967). The taboo among American whites surrounding white-black relations is a historical consequence of the oppression and racial segregation of African Americans. Historian David Brion Davis notes the racial mixing that occurred during slavery was frequently attributed by the planter class to the \"lower-class white males\" but Davis concludes that \"there is abundant evidence that many slaveowners, sons of slaveowners, and overseers took black mistresses or in effect raped the wives and daughters of slave families.\" A famous example was Thomas Jefferson's mistress, Sally Hemings.Harvard University historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. wrote in 2009 that \"African Americans\u2026are a racially mixed or mulatto people\u2014deeply and overwhelmingly so\" (see genetics). After the Emancipation Proclamation, Chinese-American men married African-American women in high proportions to their total marriage numbers due to few Chinese American women being in the United States. African slaves and their descendants have also had a history of cultural exchange and intermarriage with Native Americans, although they did not necessarily retain social, cultural or linguistic ties to Native peoples. There are also increasing intermarriages and offspring between non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics of any race, especially between Puerto Ricans and African Americans (American-born blacks). According to author M.M. Drymon, many African Americans identify as having Scots-Irish ancestry.Racially mixed marriages have become increasingly accepted in the United States since the civil rights movement and up to the present day. Approval in national opinion polls have risen from 36% in 1978, to 48% in 1991, 65% in 2002, 77% in 2007. A Gallup poll conducted in 2013 found that 84% of whites and 96% of blacks approved of interracial marriage, and 87% overall.At the end of World War II, African-American men married Japanese women in Japan and immigrated to the United States.\n\n\n=== Terminology dispute ===\nIn her book The End of Blackness, as well as in an essay on the liberal website Salon, author Debra Dickerson has argued that the term black should refer strictly to the descendants of Africans who were brought to America as slaves, and not to the sons and daughters of black immigrants who lack that ancestry. Thus, under her definition, President Barack Obama, who is the son of a Kenyan immigrant, is not black. She makes the argument that grouping all people of African descent together regardless of their unique ancestral circumstances would inevitably deny the lingering effects of slavery within the American community of slave descendants, in addition to denying black immigrants recognition of their own unique ancestral backgrounds. \"Lumping us all together,\" Dickerson wrote, \"erases the significance of slavery and continuing racism while giving the appearance of progress.\"Similar viewpoints have been expressed by Stanley Crouch in a New York Daily News piece, Charles Steele, Jr. of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and African-American columnist David Ehrenstein of the Los Angeles Times, who accused white liberals of flocking to blacks who were Magic Negros, a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white (as cultural protagonists/drivers) agenda. Ehrenstein went on to say \"He's there to assuage white 'guilt' they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in American history.\"Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice (who was famously mistaken for a \"recent American immigrant\" by French President Nicolas Sarkozy), said \"descendants of slaves did not get much of a head start, and I think you continue to see some of the effects of that.\" She has also rejected an immigrant designation for African Americans and instead prefers the term black or white to denote the African and European U.S. founding populations.\n\n\n=== Terms no longer in common use ===\nBefore the independence of the Thirteen Colonies until the abolition of slavery in 1865, an African-American slave was commonly known as a negro. Free negro was the legal status in the territory of an African-American person who was not a slave. The term colored later also began to be used until the second quarter of the 20th century, when it was considered outmoded and generally gave way again to the exclusive use of negro. By the 1940s, the term was commonly capitalized (Negro); but by the mid-1960s, it was considered disparaging. By the end of the 20th century, negro had come to be considered inappropriate and was rarely used and perceived as a pejorative. The term is rarely used by younger black people, but remained in use by many older African Americans who had grown up with the term, particularly in the southern U.S. The term remains in use in some contexts, such as the United Negro College Fund, an American philanthropic organization that funds scholarships for black students and general scholarship funds for 39 private historically black colleges and universities.\nThere are many other deliberately insulting terms, many of which were in common use (e.g., nigger), but had become unacceptable in normal discourse before the end of the 20th century. One exception is the use, among the black community, of the slur nigger rendered as nigga, representing the pronunciation of the word in African-American English. This usage has been popularized by American rap and hip-hop music cultures and is used as part of an in-group lexicon and speech. It is not necessarily derogatory and, when used among black people, the word is often used to mean \"homie\" or \"friend.\"Acceptance of intra-group usage of the word nigga is still debated, although it has established a foothold among younger generations. The NAACP denounces the use of both nigga and nigger. Mixed-race usage of nigga is still considered taboo, particularly if the speaker is white. However, trends indicate that usage of the term in intragroup settings is increasing even among white youth due to the popularity of rap and hip hop culture.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nRichard Thompson Ford Name Games, Slate, September 16, 2004.

        "wiki": "Raleigh (; RAH-lee) is the capital of the state of North Carolina and the seat of Wake County in the United States. Raleigh is the second-largest city in the state, after Charlotte. Raleigh is known as the \"City of Oaks\" for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city. The city covers a land area of 142.8 square miles (370 km2). The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population as 474,069 as of July 1, 2019. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The city of Raleigh is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the lost Roanoke Colony in present-day Dare County.\nRaleigh is home to North Carolina State University (NCSU) and is part of Research Triangle Park (RTP), together with Durham (home of Duke University and North Carolina Central University) and Chapel Hill (home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The \"Triangle\" nickname originated after the 1959 creation of the Research Triangle Park, located in Durham and Wake counties, among the three cities and their universities. The  Research Triangle region  encompasses the U.S. Census Bureau's Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which had an estimated population of 2,037,430 in 2013. The Raleigh metropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 1,214,516 in 2013.\nMost of Raleigh is located within Wake County, with a very small portion extending into Durham County. The towns of Cary, Morrisville, Garner, Clayton, Wake Forest, Apex, Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina, Knightdale, Wendell, Zebulon, and Rolesville are some of Raleigh's primary nearby suburbs and satellite towns.\nRaleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city. Following the American Revolutionary War when the US gained independence, this was chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol in Union Square at the center. During the American Civil War, the city was spared from any significant battle. It fell to the Union in the closing days of the war, and struggled with the economic hardships in the postwar period related to the reconstitution of labor markets, over-reliance on agriculture, and the social unrest of the Reconstruction Era. Following the establishment of the Research Triangle Park (RTP) in 1959, several tens of thousands of jobs were created in the fields of science and technology, and it became one of the fastest-growing communities in the United States by the early 21st century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Earlier capitals ===\nBath, the oldest town in North Carolina, was the first nominal capital of the colony from 1705 until 1722, when Edenton took over the role. The colony had no permanent institutions of government until the new capital, New Bern, was established in 1743.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nIn December 1770, Joel Lane successfully petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to create a new county. On January 5, 1771, the bill creating Wake County was passed in the General Assembly. The county was formed from portions of Cumberland, Orange, and Johnston counties. The county was named for Margaret Wake Tryon, the wife of Governor William Tryon. The first county seat was Bloomsbury.\nNew Bern, a port town on the Neuse River 35 miles (56 km) from the Atlantic Ocean, was the largest city and the capital of North Carolina during the American Revolution. When the British Army laid siege to the city, that site could no longer be used as capital. From 1789 to 1794, when Raleigh was being built, the state capital was Fayetteville.\nRaleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital in 1788, as its central location protected it from attacks from the coast. It was officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital (incorporated on December 31, 1792 \u2013 charter granted January 21, 1795). The city was named for Sir Walter Raleigh, sponsor of Roanoke, the \"lost colony\" on Roanoke Island.The city's location was chosen, in part, for being within 11 mi (18 km) from Isaac Hunter's Tavern, a popular tavern frequented by the state legislators. No known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site. Raleigh is one of the few cities in the United States that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital. Its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of North, East, West and South. The plan, a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner, was based on Thomas Holme's 1682 plan for Philadelphia.The North Carolina General Assembly first met in Raleigh in December 1794, and granted the city a charter, with a board of seven appointed commissioners and an \"Intendant of Police\" (which developed as the office of Mayor) to govern it. (After 1803 city commissioners were elected.) In 1799, the N.C. Minerva and Raleigh Advertiser was the first newspaper published in Raleigh. John Haywood was the first Intendant of Police.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn 1808, Andrew Johnson, the nation's future 17th President, was born at Casso's Inn in Raleigh. The city's first water supply network was completed in 1818, although due to system failures, the project was abandoned. In 1819 Raleigh's first volunteer fire company was founded, followed in 1821 by a full-time fire company.\nIn 1817, the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina was established and headquartered in Raleigh.\nIn 1831, a fire destroyed the North Carolina State House. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried gneiss being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completions of the new State Capitol and new Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company in 1840.\nIn 1853, the first State Fair was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, Peace College, was established in 1857. Raleigh's Historic Oakwood contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition.\nNorth Carolina seceded from the Union. After the Civil War began, Governor Zebulon Baird Vance ordered the construction of breastworks around the city as protection from Union troops. During General Sherman's Carolinas Campaign, Raleigh was captured by Union cavalry under the command of General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick on April 13, 1865. As the Confederate cavalry retreated west, the Union soldiers followed, leading to the nearby Battle of Morrisville. The city was spared significant destruction during the War.\nDue to the economic and social problems of the post-war period and Reconstruction, with a state economy still overly based on agriculture, it grew little over the next several decades.\n\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, African Americans were emancipated. The Reconstruction era legislature established public education for blacks and whites. Freedmen were often led by free blacks who had become educated before the war. With the help of the Freedmen's Bureau, many freedmen migrated from rural areas to Raleigh. It had an established free black community, more work opportunities, and many freedmen wanted to get out from under white supervision in the rural areas.\nShaw University, the South's first African American college, began classes in 1865 and was chartered in 1875. Its Estey Hall was the first building constructed for the higher education of black women, and Leonard Medical Center was the first four-year medical school in the country for African Americans.\nIn 1867, Episcopal clergy founded St. Augustine's College for the education of freedmen. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the nation's first school for blind and deaf blacks, to be located in Raleigh. In 1874, the federal government constructed the Federal Building in Raleigh, the first federal government project in the South following the Civil War.\nIn 1880, the newspapers News and Observer combined to form The News & Observer. It continues to be Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, was founded as a land-grant college in 1887. The city's Rex Hospital opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as Meredith College, opened in 1891, and in 1898, The Academy of Music, a private music conservatory, was established.\nIn the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and allies were unsuccessful. Based on a white supremacy campaign that returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote also disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office\u2014local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive in the state.\nIt was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. By that time many African Americans had left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for more opportunities. No African American was elected to Congress from North Carolina until 1992.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1912, Bloomsbury Park opened, featuring a popular carousel ride. Relocated to Pullen Park, the Pullen Park Carousel is still operating.\nFrom 1914 to 1917, an influenza epidemic killed 288 Raleighites.In 1922, WLAC signed on as the city's first radio station, but lasted only two years. WFBQ signed on in 1924 and became WPTF in 1927. It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster.\nFollowing immigration by Catholics, on December 12, 1924, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh was officially established by Pope Pius XI. The Sacred Heart Cathedral became the official seat of the diocese with William Joseph Hafey as its bishop.\nThe city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field, opened in 1929. That same year, the stock market crash resulted in six Raleigh banks closing.During the difficult 1930s of the Great Depression, government at all levels was integral to creating jobs. The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, Raleigh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated. The North Carolina Symphony, founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park. In 1939, the State General Assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority to build a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham, with the first flight occurring in 1943.\nIn 1947, Raleigh citizens adopted a council\u2013manager form of government, the current form. Council members are elected from single-member districts. They hire a city manager.\nThe Dorton Arena, a 7,610-seat multi-purpose arena designed by Matthew Nowicki, was opened in 1952 on the grounds of the North Carolina State Fair. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\nRaleigh experienced significant damage from Hurricane Hazel in 1954.\nIn 1953, WNAO-TV, channel 28, became the city's first television station, though it folded in 1957.\nWith the opening of the Research Triangle Park in 1959, Raleigh began to experience a population increase, resulting in a total city population of 100,000 by 1960. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Raleigh's population as 76.4% white and 23.4% black.Following the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the main achievements of the Civil Rights Movement and the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency, political participation and voting by African Americans in Raleigh increased rapidly.\nFrom the early-to-mid 20th century East Hargett Street was known as Raleigh's \"black main street\" and hosted numerous black-owned businesses. The area declined after the city desegregated its establishments.By the early 1970s people in Raleigh were growing increasingly concerned about growth and urban sprawl. Community organizations felt that municipal offices were being too heavily influenced by business interests when the city's population was rapidly growing and various development projects were being proposed. At their behest, the municipal elections were altered so that the mayor was to be directly elected, instead of being selected by the city council. Most city council seats were then made responsible to districts, instead of being held at-large. The 1973 elections were the first contests affected by the reforms. City Councilman Clarence Lightner defeated Raleigh Merchants bureau Executive Director G. Wesley Williams to become Raleigh's first black mayor, and thus the first black mayor in a major white-majority city in the South.In 1976, the Raleigh City and Wake County schools merged to become the Wake County Public School System, now the largest school system in the state and 19th largest in the country.During the 1970s and 1980s, the I-440 beltline was constructed, easing traffic congestion and providing access to most major city roads.\nThe first Raleigh Convention Center (replaced in 2008) and Fayetteville Street Mall were both opened in 1977. Fayetteville Street was turned into a pedestrian-only street in an effort to help the then-ailing downtown area, but the plan was flawed and business declined for years to come. Fayetteville Street was reopened in 2007 as the main thoroughfare of Raleigh's downtown.The 1988 Raleigh tornado outbreak of November 28, 1988, was the most destructive of the seven tornadoes reported in Northeastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia between 1:00 AM and 5:45 AM. The Raleigh tornado produced over $77 million in damage, along with four fatalities (two in the city of Raleigh, and two in Nash County) and 154 injuries. The damage path from the storm was measured at 84 miles (135 km) long, and .5 miles (0.8 km) wide at times. The tornado was rated F4.In 1991, two large skyscrapers in Raleigh were completed, First Union Capitol Center and Two Hannover Square, along with the popular Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek in Southeast Raleigh.\nIn 1996, the Olympic Flame passed through Raleigh while on its way to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Also in 1996, Hurricane Fran struck the area, causing massive flooding and extensive structural damage. In addition, WRAL-TV became the first High-Definition broadcast station in the world.\nIn 1997, the National Hockey League's Hartford Whalers announced their intention to move to Raleigh as the Carolina Hurricanes, becoming the city's first major league professional sports franchise.\nIn 1999, the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (later renamed the RBC Center and now called PNC Arena), opened to provide a home for the Hurricanes and the NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team, as well as an up-to-date major concert venue.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Raleigh was featured prominently in a number of \"Top 10 Lists\", including those by Forbes, MSNBC and Money magazine, due to its quality of life and favorable business climate.In 2001, the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium complex was expanded with the addition of the Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts, Meymandi Concert Hall, Fletcher Opera Theater, Kennedy Theatre, Betty Ray McCain Gallery and Lichtin Plaza.Fayetteville Street reopened to vehicular traffic in 2006.

The tornado tracked northeast through parts of Downtown, East Central Raleigh and Northeast Raleigh and produced $115 million in damages in Wake County. There were 4 fatalities in the city.In September 2015 Holy Trinity Anglican Church was opened; the first church to be built in downtown Raleigh since 1958.On July 26, 2017 the Catholic Diocese of Raleigh dedicated its new cathedral, Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral, the fifth-largest in the United States.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Raleigh occupies a total area of 144.0 square miles (373.0 km2), of which 142 square miles (369 km2) is land and 0.97 square miles (2.5 km2), or 0.76%, is covered by water. The Neuse River flows through the northeast end of the city.\nRaleigh is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet. This area is known as the \"fall line\" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain. Its central Piedmont location situates Raleigh about two hours west of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, by car and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains. The city is 170 miles (270 km) south of Richmond, Virginia, 278 miles (447 km) south of Washington, D.C., and 166 miles (267 km) northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina. A small portion of the city is located in Durham County.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nRaleigh is divided into several major geographic areas, each of which use a Raleigh address and a ZIP code that begins with the digits 276. PNC Plaza, formerly known as RBC Plaza, is the largest and tallest skyscraper in the city of Raleigh. The tower rises to a height of 538 feet (164 m), with a floor count of 34.\n\n\n==== Downtown and inside-the-beltline neighborhoods ====\n\nThe downtown area is home to historic buildings such as the Sir Walter Raleigh Hotel built in the early 20th century, the restored City Market, the Fayetteville Street downtown business district, which includes the PNC Plaza and Wells Fargo Capitol Center buildings, as well as the North Carolina Museum of History, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, North Carolina State Capitol, William Peace University, the City of Raleigh Museum, Raleigh Convention Center, Shaw University, Campbell University School of Law, and St. Augustine's College. In the 2000s, an effort by the Downtown Raleigh Alliance was made to separate this area of the city into five smaller districts: Fayetteville Street, Moore Square, Glenwood South, Warehouse (Raleigh), and Capital District (Raleigh). Some of the names have become common place among locals such as the Warehouse, Fayetteville Street, and Glenwood South Districts.\nThe Inside the Beltline neighborhoods include Cameron Park, Boylan Heights, Country Club Hills, Coley Forest, Five Points, Budleigh, Glenwood-Brooklyn, Hayes Barton Historic District, Moore Square, Mordecai (home to the historic Mordecai House), Rochester Heights, South Park, Rosengarten Park, Belvidere Park, Woodcrest, Oberlin Village, and Historic Oakwood.

It is roughly framed by Glenwood/Creedmoor Road to the West, Wake Forest Road to the East, and Millbrook Road to the North. It includes shopping centers such as North Hills and Crabtree Valley Mall. It also includes North Hills Park and part of the Raleigh Greenway System. The term was coined by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, developer John Kane and planning director Mitchell Silver. The News & Observer newspaper started using the term for marketing purposes only. The Midtown Raleigh Alliance was founded on July 25, 2011 as a way for community leaders to promote the area.\n\n\n==== East Raleigh ====\nEast Raleigh is situated roughly from Capital Boulevard near the I-440 beltline to New Hope Road. Most of East Raleigh's development is along primary corridors such as U.S. 1 (Capital Boulevard), New Bern Avenue, Poole Road, Buffaloe Road, and New Hope Road.

The area is bordered to the west by suburban Cary. It is home to North Carolina State University, Meredith College, Pullen Park, Pullen Memorial Baptist Church, the Islamic Association of Raleigh, Cameron Village, Lake Johnson, the North Carolina Museum of Art and historic Saint Mary's School. Primary thoroughfares serving West Raleigh, in addition to Hillsborough Street, are Avent Ferry Road, Blue Ridge Road, and Western Boulevard. The PNC Arena is also located here adjacent to the North Carolina State Fairgrounds. These are located approximately 2 miles from Rex Hospital.\n\n\n==== North Raleigh ====\nNorth Raleigh is an expansive, diverse, and fast-growing suburban area of the city that is home to established neighborhoods to the south along with many newly built subdivisions and along its northern fringes. The area generally falls North of Millbrook Road. It is primarily suburban with large shopping areas.

This area is the least developed and least dense area of Raleigh (much of the area lies within the Swift Creek watershed district, where development regulations limit housing densities and construction). The area is bordered to the west by Cary, to the east by Garner, to the southwest by Holly Springs and the southeast by Fuquay-Varina. Neighborhoods in South Raleigh include Eagle Creek, Renaissance Park, Lake Wheeler, Swift Creek, Carolina Pines, Rhamkatte, Riverbrooke, and Enchanted Oaks.\n\n\n==== Southeast Raleigh ====\nSoutheast Raleigh is bounded by downtown on the west, Garner on the southwest, and rural Wake County to the southeast. The area includes areas along Rock Quarry Road, Poole Road, and New Bern Avenue. Primary neighborhoods include Chastain, Chavis Heights, Raleigh Country Club, Southgate, Kingwood Forest, Rochester Heights, Emerald Village and Biltmore Hills. Coastal Credit Union Music Park (formerly Time Warner Cable Music Pavilion, Alltel Pavilion and Walnut Creek Amphitheatre) is one of the region's major outdoor concert venues and is located on Rock Quarry Road.

Winters are short and generally cool, with a normal January daily mean temperature of 41.0 \u00b0F (5.0 \u00b0C). On average, there are 69 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 2.7 days that fail to rise above freezing. Raleigh receives an average annual rainfall of 43.34 inches (110.1 cm). Annual and monthly (temperature and) precipitation data are in chart below. April is the driest month, with an average of 2.92 inches (74.2 mm) of precipitation. Precipitation is well distributed around the year, with a slight maximum between July and September; on average, July is the wettest month, owing to generally frequent, sometimes heavy, showers and thunderstorms. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of 80.0 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C). There are 48 days per year with highs at or above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C). Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall, but greater potential for extremely heavy rainfall in a one/two day period, owing to occasional threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) packing torrential rainfall. In September 1999, Raleigh recorded its wettest month ever, with over 21 inches of rain, due to torrential rainfall from tropical weather systems, most notably Hurricane Floyd on September 15\u201316. Extremes in temperature have ranged from \u22129 \u00b0F (\u221223 \u00b0C) on January 21, 1985 up to 105 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C), most recently on June 29\u201330 and July 8, 2012. Raleigh falls in USDA hardiness zones 7b (5 \u00b0F to 10 \u00b0F) and 8a (10 \u00b0F to 15 \u00b0F).Raleigh receives an average of 6.0 inches (15.2 cm) of snow in winter. Freezing rain and sleet also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging ice storm. On January 24\u201325, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm \u2013 20.3 inches (52 cm) \u2013 the Winter Storm of January 2000. Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of cold air damming that affects the city due to its proximity to the Appalachian Mountains.  Winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well.\nThe region also experiences occasional periods of drought, during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience hurricanes. In 1996, Hurricane Fran caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees. Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in September 1999 were primary contributors to that month's extreme rainfall of over 21 inches. The most recent hurricane to have a considerable effect on the area was Hurricane Florence in 2018. Tornadoes also have on occasion affected the city of Raleigh, most notably the November 28, 1988 tornado which occurred in the early morning hours and rated an F4 on the Fujita Tornado Scale and affected northwestern portions of the city. There also was the April 16, 2011 EF3 tornado, which affected portions of downtown and northeast Raleigh and the suburb of Holly Springs.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, the racial composition of the city was: 57.5% White (53.3% non-Hispanic white), 29.3% Black or African American, 4.3% Asian American (1.2% Indian, 0.8% Chinese, 0.7% Vietnamese, 0.5% Korean, 0.4% Filipino, 0.1% Japanese), 2.6% two or more races, 1.4% some other race, 0.5% Native American, and <0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific IslanderIn addition, 11.4% of city residents were Hispanic or Latino Americans, of any race (5.9% Mexican, 1.1% Puerto Rican, 0.9% Salvadoran, 0.6% Dominican, 0.6% Honduran, 0.3% Colombian, 0.3% Cuban, 0.2% Guatemalan, 0.2% Spanish, 0.2% Peruvian, 0.1% Venezuelan, 0.1% Ecuadorian, 0.1% Argentine, 0.1% Panamanian).\nAs of the 2000 United States census, there were 276,093 persons (July 2008 estimate was 380,173) and 61,371 families residing in Raleigh.

The airport offers service to more than 35 domestic and international destinations and serves approximately 10 million passengers a year. The airport also offers facilities for cargo and general aviation. The airport authority tripled the size of its Terminal 2 (formerly Terminal C) in January 2011.\nPrivate Airport.Private general aviation airports in Raleigh include Triple W Airport (ICAO: K5W5, FAA LID: 5W5).\n\n\n==== Freeways and primary designated routes ====\n\n\n===== Interstate Highways =====\nI-40 traverses the southern part of the city, connecting Raleigh to Durham and Chapel Hill toward the west, and coastal Wilmington, North Carolina to the southeast.\nI-440, Also known locally as the Raleigh Beltline, it makes a loop around the central part of the city. The I-440 route labeling formerly encompassed the entire loop around the city, co-numbered though South Raleigh with I-40. In 2002, the NCDOT removed the I-440 designation from the co-numbered I-40 (southern and southwestern) sections of the loop, and the directional signage on the remaining I-440 portion was changed from Inner/Outer to East/West. The route designation changes were made to avoid driver confusion over the Inner/Outer designations, especially with Raleigh's new \"Outer Beltline\", as I-540 has become known.\nI-540/NC 540 is currently under development.\nI-87, designated September 5, 2017, follows the former route of Interstate 495. It begins at the I-40/I-440 interchange southeast of Raleigh and runs east, meeting I-540 and terminating at Rolesville Road. It is entirely concurrent with US 64. When the route is completed it will link Raleigh to the Norfolk, Virginia area.\n\n\n====== Future ======\nInterstate 42 will begin at I-40 south of Raleigh and will follow US 70 to Morehead City.\n\n\n===== United States Highways =====\nU.S. Route 1 enters the city from the north along Capital Boulevard, joins I-440 around the west side of Raleigh, and leaves the city to the southwest as the US 1/US 64 expressway in Cary.\nU.S. Route 64 is the main east-west route through Raleigh; all segments share routes with another highway. East of the city, US-64/US-264 is known as the Knightdale Bypass. US 64 follows I-440 (as a wrong way concurrency) and I-40 along southern Raleigh, and US 1 to the southwest.  A former alignment, designated as Business US-64, follows New Bern Avenue from the I-440 Beltline to the eastern boundary of the city, where it continues into Knightdale.\nU.S. Route 70 runs roughly northwest-southeast through Raleigh. North of downtown, the route follows Glenwood Avenue into Durham. South of Raleigh, the route (along with US 401 and NC 50) follows South Saunders and South Wilmington Streets into Garner. Through downtown, US 70 uses small segments of several streets, including Wade Avenue, Capital Boulevard, Dawson, and McDowell Streets.\nU.S. Route 264 cosigned with US 64 through East Raleigh.\nU.S. Route 401 north of downtown Raleigh it follows Capital Boulevard and Louisburg Road. South of downtown it is cosigned with US 70 from Wade Avenue southward.\n\n\n===== North Carolina Highways =====\nN.C. Route 54 follows Chapel Hill Road and Hillsborough Street in West Raleigh. The route ends at its interchange with I-440.\nN.C. Route 50 is a north-south route through Raleigh. North of Raleigh it follows Creedmoor Road. NC 50 joins US 70 and later US 401 in downtown Raleigh. The three routes remain together through south Raleigh.\nN.C. Route 98, known as Durham Road in North Raleigh, traverses the extreme northern parts of the city.\n\n\n==== Intercity rail ====\n\nRaleigh's train station is one of Amtrak's busiest stops in the Southern U.S. The station is served by five passenger trains daily: the Silver Star, thrice-daily Piedmont service, and the Carolinian. Daily service is offered between Raleigh and:\n\nCharlotte, with intermediate stops including Cary, Durham, Burlington and Greensboro, North Carolina.\nNew York City, with intermediate stops including Richmond, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; and Philadelphia.\nMiami, with intermediate stops including Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia; as well as Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa, Florida.\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\nPublic transportation in and around Raleigh is provided by GoRaleigh, which operates 33 fixed bus routes, including the R-Line and the Wake-Forest Loop. Although there are 33 routes, some routes are designed to cover multiple other routes at times when they are not served. Depending on the time of the day, and the day of the week, the number of routes operating is between 5 and 29.\nRaleigh is also served by GoTriangle (known formerly as the Triangle Transit Authority, and Triangle Transit). GoTriangle offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Research Triangle Park and several of the region's larger suburban communities. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nNorth Carolina State University also maintains its own transit system, the Wolfline, that provides zero-fare bus service to the general public along multiple routes serving the university's campuses in southwest Raleigh.\nGovernment agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.\nFrom 1995 the cornerstone of Triangle Transit's long-term plan was a 28-mile rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections.\nThe region's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.Greyhound Lines provides an inter-city bus service to Durham, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and other cities.\n\n\n==== Bicycle and pedestrian ====\nThe Maine-to-Florida U.S. Bicycle Route#1 routes through suburban Raleigh, along with N.C. Bicycle Route #2, the \"Mountains To Sea\" route. As of September 2010, maps and signage for both US Bike Route #1 and NC Bike Route #2 are out-of-date for the Raleigh area. N.C. Bicycle Route #5 is routed nearby, connecting Apex to Wilmington and closely paralleling the NCBC Randonneurs 600 kilometer brevet route.\nMost public buses are equipped with bicycle racks, and some roads have dedicated bicycle-only lanes. Bicyclists and pedestrians also may use Raleigh's extensive greenway system, with paths and trails located throughout the city.\nIn May 2011, Raleigh was designated a Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists at the Bronze level.\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Raleigh 36th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.\nIn 2002, the \"Walk [Your City]\" initiative was started in the city which provides a tool kit for neighborhood organizations to post signs giving a distance by bike or foot, with directions in scannable QR code. The movement has spread to more than 400 communities in 55 countries.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\nThe Raleigh Fire Department provides fire protection throughout the city. The North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women, the state's primary correctional facility housing female inmates is based in Raleigh.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nRaleigh has several sister cities:\n Xiangyang, Hubei, China\n Compi\u00e8gne, Oise, Hauts-de-France, France\n Kingston upon Hull, England, United Kingdom\n Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany\n Nairobi, Kenya\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of capitals in the United States\nList of municipalities in North Carolina\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Wake County, North Carolina\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nAmis, Moses N.

        "wiki": "Raleigh (; RAH-lee) is the capital of the state of North Carolina and the seat of Wake County in the United States. Raleigh is the second-largest city in the state, after Charlotte. Raleigh is known as the \"City of Oaks\" for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city. The city covers a land area of 142.8 square miles (370 km2). The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population as 474,069 as of July 1, 2019. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The city of Raleigh is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the lost Roanoke Colony in present-day Dare County.\nRaleigh is home to North Carolina State University (NCSU) and is part of Research Triangle Park (RTP), together with Durham (home of Duke University and North Carolina Central University) and Chapel Hill (home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The \"Triangle\" nickname originated after the 1959 creation of the Research Triangle Park, located in Durham and Wake counties, among the three cities and their universities. The  Research Triangle region  encompasses the U.S. Census Bureau's Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which had an estimated population of 2,037,430 in 2013. The Raleigh metropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 1,214,516 in 2013.\nMost of Raleigh is located within Wake County, with a very small portion extending into Durham County. The towns of Cary, Morrisville, Garner, Clayton, Wake Forest, Apex, Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina, Knightdale, Wendell, Zebulon, and Rolesville are some of Raleigh's primary nearby suburbs and satellite towns.\nRaleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city. Following the American Revolutionary War when the US gained independence, this was chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol in Union Square at the center. During the American Civil War, the city was spared from any significant battle. It fell to the Union in the closing days of the war, and struggled with the economic hardships in the postwar period related to the reconstitution of labor markets, over-reliance on agriculture, and the social unrest of the Reconstruction Era. Following the establishment of the Research Triangle Park (RTP) in 1959, several tens of thousands of jobs were created in the fields of science and technology, and it became one of the fastest-growing communities in the United States by the early 21st century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Earlier capitals ===\nBath, the oldest town in North Carolina, was the first nominal capital of the colony from 1705 until 1722, when Edenton took over the role. The colony had no permanent institutions of government until the new capital, New Bern, was established in 1743.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nIn December 1770, Joel Lane successfully petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to create a new county. On January 5, 1771, the bill creating Wake County was passed in the General Assembly. The county was formed from portions of Cumberland, Orange, and Johnston counties. The county was named for Margaret Wake Tryon, the wife of Governor William Tryon. The first county seat was Bloomsbury.\nNew Bern, a port town on the Neuse River 35 miles (56 km) from the Atlantic Ocean, was the largest city and the capital of North Carolina during the American Revolution. When the British Army laid siege to the city, that site could no longer be used as capital. From 1789 to 1794, when Raleigh was being built, the state capital was Fayetteville.\nRaleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital in 1788, as its central location protected it from attacks from the coast. It was officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital (incorporated on December 31, 1792 \u2013 charter granted January 21, 1795). The city was named for Sir Walter Raleigh, sponsor of Roanoke, the \"lost colony\" on Roanoke Island.The city's location was chosen, in part, for being within 11 mi (18 km) from Isaac Hunter's Tavern, a popular tavern frequented by the state legislators. No known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site. Raleigh is one of the few cities in the United States that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital. Its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of North, East, West and South. The plan, a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner, was based on Thomas Holme's 1682 plan for Philadelphia.The North Carolina General Assembly first met in Raleigh in December 1794, and granted the city a charter, with a board of seven appointed commissioners and an \"Intendant of Police\" (which developed as the office of Mayor) to govern it. (After 1803 city commissioners were elected.) In 1799, the N.C. Minerva and Raleigh Advertiser was the first newspaper published in Raleigh. John Haywood was the first Intendant of Police.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn 1808, Andrew Johnson, the nation's future 17th President, was born at Casso's Inn in Raleigh. The city's first water supply network was completed in 1818, although due to system failures, the project was abandoned. In 1819 Raleigh's first volunteer fire company was founded, followed in 1821 by a full-time fire company.\nIn 1817, the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina was established and headquartered in Raleigh.\nIn 1831, a fire destroyed the North Carolina State House. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried gneiss being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completions of the new State Capitol and new Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company in 1840.\nIn 1853, the first State Fair was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, Peace College, was established in 1857. Raleigh's Historic Oakwood contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition.\nNorth Carolina seceded from the Union. After the Civil War began, Governor Zebulon Baird Vance ordered the construction of breastworks around the city as protection from Union troops. During General Sherman's Carolinas Campaign, Raleigh was captured by Union cavalry under the command of General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick on April 13, 1865. As the Confederate cavalry retreated west, the Union soldiers followed, leading to the nearby Battle of Morrisville. The city was spared significant destruction during the War.\nDue to the economic and social problems of the post-war period and Reconstruction, with a state economy still overly based on agriculture, it grew little over the next several decades.\n\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, African Americans were emancipated. The Reconstruction era legislature established public education for blacks and whites. Freedmen were often led by free blacks who had become educated before the war. With the help of the Freedmen's Bureau, many freedmen migrated from rural areas to Raleigh. It had an established free black community, more work opportunities, and many freedmen wanted to get out from under white supervision in the rural areas.\nShaw University, the South's first African American college, began classes in 1865 and was chartered in 1875. Its Estey Hall was the first building constructed for the higher education of black women, and Leonard Medical Center was the first four-year medical school in the country for African Americans.\nIn 1867, Episcopal clergy founded St. Augustine's College for the education of freedmen. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the nation's first school for blind and deaf blacks, to be located in Raleigh. In 1874, the federal government constructed the Federal Building in Raleigh, the first federal government project in the South following the Civil War.\nIn 1880, the newspapers News and Observer combined to form The News & Observer. It continues to be Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, was founded as a land-grant college in 1887. The city's Rex Hospital opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as Meredith College, opened in 1891, and in 1898, The Academy of Music, a private music conservatory, was established.\nIn the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and allies were unsuccessful. Based on a white supremacy campaign that returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote also disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office\u2014local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive in the state.\nIt was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. By that time many African Americans had left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for more opportunities. No African American was elected to Congress from North Carolina until 1992.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1912, Bloomsbury Park opened, featuring a popular carousel ride. Relocated to Pullen Park, the Pullen Park Carousel is still operating.\nFrom 1914 to 1917, an influenza epidemic killed 288 Raleighites.In 1922, WLAC signed on as the city's first radio station, but lasted only two years. WFBQ signed on in 1924 and became WPTF in 1927. It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster.\nFollowing immigration by Catholics, on December 12, 1924, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh was officially established by Pope Pius XI. The Sacred Heart Cathedral became the official seat of the diocese with William Joseph Hafey as its bishop.\nThe city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field, opened in 1929. That same year, the stock market crash resulted in six Raleigh banks closing.During the difficult 1930s of the Great Depression, government at all levels was integral to creating jobs. The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, Raleigh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated. The North Carolina Symphony, founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park. In 1939, the State General Assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority to build a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham, with the first flight occurring in 1943.\nIn 1947, Raleigh citizens adopted a council\u2013manager form of government, the current form. Council members are elected from single-member districts. They hire a city manager.\nThe Dorton Arena, a 7,610-seat multi-purpose arena designed by Matthew Nowicki, was opened in 1952 on the grounds of the North Carolina State Fair. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\nRaleigh experienced significant damage from Hurricane Hazel in 1954.\nIn 1953, WNAO-TV, channel 28, became the city's first television station, though it folded in 1957.\nWith the opening of the Research Triangle Park in 1959, Raleigh began to experience a population increase, resulting in a total city population of 100,000 by 1960. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Raleigh's population as 76.4% white and 23.4% black.Following the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the main achievements of the Civil Rights Movement and the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency, political participation and voting by African Americans in Raleigh increased rapidly.\nFrom the early-to-mid 20th century East Hargett Street was known as Raleigh's \"black main street\" and hosted numerous black-owned businesses. The area declined after the city desegregated its establishments.By the early 1970s people in Raleigh were growing increasingly concerned about growth and urban sprawl. Community organizations felt that municipal offices were being too heavily influenced by business interests when the city's population was rapidly growing and various development projects were being proposed. At their behest, the municipal elections were altered so that the mayor was to be directly elected, instead of being selected by the city council. Most city council seats were then made responsible to districts, instead of being held at-large. The 1973 elections were the first contests affected by the reforms. City Councilman Clarence Lightner defeated Raleigh Merchants bureau Executive Director G. Wesley Williams to become Raleigh's first black mayor, and thus the first black mayor in a major white-majority city in the South.In 1976, the Raleigh City and Wake County schools merged to become the Wake County Public School System, now the largest school system in the state and 19th largest in the country.During the 1970s and 1980s, the I-440 beltline was constructed, easing traffic congestion and providing access to most major city roads.\nThe first Raleigh Convention Center (replaced in 2008) and Fayetteville Street Mall were both opened in 1977. Fayetteville Street was turned into a pedestrian-only street in an effort to help the then-ailing downtown area, but the plan was flawed and business declined for years to come. Fayetteville Street was reopened in 2007 as the main thoroughfare of Raleigh's downtown.The 1988 Raleigh tornado outbreak of November 28, 1988, was the most destructive of the seven tornadoes reported in Northeastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia between 1:00 AM and 5:45 AM. The Raleigh tornado produced over $77 million in damage, along with four fatalities (two in the city of Raleigh, and two in Nash County) and 154 injuries. The damage path from the storm was measured at 84 miles (135 km) long, and .5 miles (0.8 km) wide at times. The tornado was rated F4.In 1991, two large skyscrapers in Raleigh were completed, First Union Capitol Center and Two Hannover Square, along with the popular Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek in Southeast Raleigh.\nIn 1996, the Olympic Flame passed through Raleigh while on its way to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Also in 1996, Hurricane Fran struck the area, causing massive flooding and extensive structural damage. In addition, WRAL-TV became the first High-Definition broadcast station in the world.\nIn 1997, the National Hockey League's Hartford Whalers announced their intention to move to Raleigh as the Carolina Hurricanes, becoming the city's first major league professional sports franchise.\nIn 1999, the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (later renamed the RBC Center and now called PNC Arena), opened to provide a home for the Hurricanes and the NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team, as well as an up-to-date major concert venue.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Raleigh was featured prominently in a number of \"Top 10 Lists\", including those by Forbes, MSNBC and Money magazine, due to its quality of life and favorable business climate.In 2001, the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium complex was expanded with the addition of the Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts, Meymandi Concert Hall, Fletcher Opera Theater, Kennedy Theatre, Betty Ray McCain Gallery and Lichtin Plaza.Fayetteville Street reopened to vehicular traffic in 2006. A variety of downtown building projects began around this time including the 34-story RBC Bank Tower, multiple condominium projects and several new restaurants. Additional skyscrapers are in the proposal/planning phase.\nIn 2006, the city's NHL franchise, the Carolina Hurricanes, won the Stanley Cup, North Carolina's first and only professional sports championship.\nWith the opening of parts of I-540 from 2005 to 2007, a new 70-mile (110 km) loop around Wake County, traffic congestion eased somewhat in the North Raleigh area. Completion of the entire loop is expected to take another 15 years.\nIn 2008, the city's Fayetteville Street Historic District joined the National Register of Historic Places.\nIn September 2010, Raleigh hosted the inaugural Hopscotch Music Festival.\nIn January 2011, Raleigh hosted the National Hockey League All-Star Game.\nIn April 2011, a devastating EF-3 tornado hit Raleigh, and many other tornadoes touched down in the state (ultimately the largest, but not the strongest outbreak to ever hit the state), killing 24 people. The tornado tracked northeast through parts of Downtown, East Central Raleigh and Northeast Raleigh and produced $115 million in damages in Wake County. There were 4 fatalities in the city.In September 2015 Holy Trinity Anglican Church was opened; the first church to be built in downtown Raleigh since 1958.On July 26, 2017 the Catholic Diocese of Raleigh dedicated its new cathedral, Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral, the fifth-largest in the United States.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Raleigh occupies a total area of 144.0 square miles (373.0 km2), of which 142 square miles (369 km2) is land and 0.97 square miles (2.5 km2), or 0.76%, is covered by water. The Neuse River flows through the northeast end of the city.\nRaleigh is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet. This area is known as the \"fall line\" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain. Its central Piedmont location situates Raleigh about two hours west of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, by car and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains. The city is 170 miles (270 km) south of Richmond, Virginia, 278 miles (447 km) south of Washington, D.C., and 166 miles (267 km) northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina. A small portion of the city is located in Durham County.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nRaleigh is divided into several major geographic areas, each of which use a Raleigh address and a ZIP code that begins with the digits 276. PNC Plaza, formerly known as RBC Plaza, is the largest and tallest skyscraper in the city of Raleigh. The tower rises to a height of 538 feet (164 m), with a floor count of 34.\n\n\n==== Downtown and inside-the-beltline neighborhoods ====\n\nThe downtown area is home to historic buildings such as the Sir Walter Raleigh Hotel built in the early 20th century, the restored City Market, the Fayetteville Street downtown business district, which includes the PNC Plaza and Wells Fargo Capitol Center buildings, as well as the North Carolina Museum of History, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, North Carolina State Capitol, William Peace University, the City of Raleigh Museum, Raleigh Convention Center, Shaw University, Campbell University School of Law, and St. Augustine's College. In the 2000s, an effort by the Downtown Raleigh Alliance was made to separate this area of the city into five smaller districts: Fayetteville Street, Moore Square, Glenwood South, Warehouse (Raleigh), and Capital District (Raleigh). Some of the names have become common place among locals such as the Warehouse, Fayetteville Street, and Glenwood South Districts.\nThe Inside the Beltline neighborhoods include Cameron Park, Boylan Heights, Country Club Hills, Coley Forest, Five Points, Budleigh, Glenwood-Brooklyn, Hayes Barton Historic District, Moore Square, Mordecai (home to the historic Mordecai House), Rochester Heights, South Park, Rosengarten Park, Belvidere Park, Woodcrest, Oberlin Village, and Historic Oakwood. Inside the Beltline refers to I-440 which used to be called the Beltline before being re-branded to ease driver navigation. These neighborhoods were typically built before World War II.\n\n\n==== Midtown Raleigh ====\n\nMidtown Raleigh is a residential and commercial area just North of the I-440 Beltline and is part of North Raleigh. It is roughly framed by Glenwood/Creedmoor Road to the West, Wake Forest Road to the East, and Millbrook Road to the North. It includes shopping centers such as North Hills and Crabtree Valley Mall. It also includes North Hills Park and part of the Raleigh Greenway System. The term was coined by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, developer John Kane and planning director Mitchell Silver. The News & Observer newspaper started using the term for marketing purposes only. The Midtown Raleigh Alliance was founded on July 25, 2011 as a way for community leaders to promote the area.\n\n\n==== East Raleigh ====\nEast Raleigh is situated roughly from Capital Boulevard near the I-440 beltline to New Hope Road. Most of East Raleigh's development is along primary corridors such as U.S. 1 (Capital Boulevard), New Bern Avenue, Poole Road, Buffaloe Road, and New Hope Road. Neighborhoods in East Raleigh include Hedingham, Longview, Lockwood, Madonna Acres, New Hope, Thompson-Hunter and Wilder's Grove. The area is bordered to the east by the town of Knightdale.\n\n\n==== West Raleigh ====\n\nWest Raleigh lies along Hillsborough Street and Western Boulevard. The area is bordered to the west by suburban Cary. It is home to North Carolina State University, Meredith College, Pullen Park, Pullen Memorial Baptist Church, the Islamic Association of Raleigh, Cameron Village, Lake Johnson, the North Carolina Museum of Art and historic Saint Mary's School. Primary thoroughfares serving West Raleigh, in addition to Hillsborough Street, are Avent Ferry Road, Blue Ridge Road, and Western Boulevard. The PNC Arena is also located here adjacent to the North Carolina State Fairgrounds. These are located approximately 2 miles from Rex Hospital.\n\n\n==== North Raleigh ====\nNorth Raleigh is an expansive, diverse, and fast-growing suburban area of the city that is home to established neighborhoods to the south along with many newly built subdivisions and along its northern fringes. The area generally falls North of Millbrook Road. It is primarily suburban with large shopping areas. Primary neighborhoods and subdivisions in North Raleigh include Bartons Creek Bluffs, Bedford, Bent Tree, Black Horse Run, Brier Creek, Brookhaven, Coachman's Trail, Crossgate, Crosswinds, Dominion Park, Durant Trails, Ethan's Glenn, Falls River, Greystone Village, Harrington Grove, Hidden Valley, Lake Park, Long Lake, North Haven, North Ridge, Oakcroft, Shannon Woods, Six Forks Station, Springdale Estates, Stonebridge, Stone Creek, Stonehenge, Summerfield, Valley Estates, Wakefield, Weathersfield, Windsor Forest, and Wood Valley. The area is served by a number of primary transportation corridors including Glenwood Avenue U.S. Route 70, Interstate 540, Wake Forest Road, Millbrook Road, Lynn Road, Six Forks Road, Spring Forest Road, Creedmoor Road, Leesville Road, Norwood Road, Strickland Road, and North Hills Drive.\n\n\n==== South Raleigh ====\nSouth Raleigh is located along U.S. 401 south toward Fuquay-Varina and along US 70 into suburban Garner. This area is the least developed and least dense area of Raleigh (much of the area lies within the Swift Creek watershed district, where development regulations limit housing densities and construction). The area is bordered to the west by Cary, to the east by Garner, to the southwest by Holly Springs and the southeast by Fuquay-Varina. Neighborhoods in South Raleigh include Eagle Creek, Renaissance Park, Lake Wheeler, Swift Creek, Carolina Pines, Rhamkatte, Riverbrooke, and Enchanted Oaks.\n\n\n==== Southeast Raleigh ====\nSoutheast Raleigh is bounded by downtown on the west, Garner on the southwest, and rural Wake County to the southeast. The area includes areas along Rock Quarry Road, Poole Road, and New Bern Avenue. Primary neighborhoods include Chastain, Chavis Heights, Raleigh Country Club, Southgate, Kingwood Forest, Rochester Heights, Emerald Village and Biltmore Hills. Coastal Credit Union Music Park (formerly Time Warner Cable Music Pavilion, Alltel Pavilion and Walnut Creek Amphitheatre) is one of the region's major outdoor concert venues and is located on Rock Quarry Road. Shaw University is located in this part of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike much of the southeastern United States, Raleigh has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa). Winters are short and generally cool, with a normal January daily mean temperature of 41.0 \u00b0F (5.0 \u00b0C). On average, there are 69 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 2.7 days that fail to rise above freezing. Raleigh receives an average annual rainfall of 43.34 inches (110.1 cm). Annual and monthly (temperature and) precipitation data are in chart below. April is the driest month, with an average of 2.92 inches (74.2 mm) of precipitation. Precipitation is well distributed around the year, with a slight maximum between July and September; on average, July is the wettest month, owing to generally frequent, sometimes heavy, showers and thunderstorms. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of 80.0 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C). There are 48 days per year with highs at or above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C). Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall, but greater potential for extremely heavy rainfall in a one/two day period, owing to occasional threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) packing torrential rainfall. In September 1999, Raleigh recorded its wettest month ever, with over 21 inches of rain, due to torrential rainfall from tropical weather systems, most notably Hurricane Floyd on September 15\u201316. Extremes in temperature have ranged from \u22129 \u00b0F (\u221223 \u00b0C) on January 21, 1985 up to 105 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C), most recently on June 29\u201330 and July 8, 2012. Raleigh falls in USDA hardiness zones 7b (5 \u00b0F to 10 \u00b0F) and 8a (10 \u00b0F to 15 \u00b0F).Raleigh receives an average of 6.0 inches (15.2 cm) of snow in winter. Freezing rain and sleet also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging ice storm. On January 24\u201325, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm \u2013 20.3 inches (52 cm) \u2013 the Winter Storm of January 2000. Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of cold air damming that affects the city due to its proximity to the Appalachian Mountains.  Winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well.\nThe region also experiences occasional periods of drought, during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience hurricanes. In 1996, Hurricane Fran caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees. Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in September 1999 were primary contributors to that month's extreme rainfall of over 21 inches. The most recent hurricane to have a considerable effect on the area was Hurricane Florence in 2018. Tornadoes also have on occasion affected the city of Raleigh, most notably the November 28, 1988 tornado which occurred in the early morning hours and rated an F4 on the Fujita Tornado Scale and affected northwestern portions of the city. There also was the April 16, 2011 EF3 tornado, which affected portions of downtown and northeast Raleigh and the suburb of Holly Springs.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, the racial composition of the city was: 57.5% White (53.3% non-Hispanic white), 29.3% Black or African American, 4.3% Asian American (1.2% Indian, 0.8% Chinese, 0.7% Vietnamese, 0.5% Korean, 0.4% Filipino, 0.1% Japanese), 2.6% two or more races, 1.4% some other race, 0.5% Native American, and <0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific IslanderIn addition, 11.4% of city residents were Hispanic or Latino Americans, of any race (5.9% Mexican, 1.1% Puerto Rican, 0.9% Salvadoran, 0.6% Dominican, 0.6% Honduran, 0.3% Colombian, 0.3% Cuban, 0.2% Guatemalan, 0.2% Spanish, 0.2% Peruvian, 0.1% Venezuelan, 0.1% Ecuadorian, 0.1% Argentine, 0.1% Panamanian).\nAs of the 2000 United States census, there were 276,093 persons (July 2008 estimate was 380,173) and 61,371 families residing in Raleigh.

The I-440 route labeling formerly encompassed the entire loop around the city, co-numbered though South Raleigh with I-40. In 2002, the NCDOT removed the I-440 designation from the co-numbered I-40 (southern and southwestern) sections of the loop, and the directional signage on the remaining I-440 portion was changed from Inner/Outer to East/West. The route designation changes were made to avoid driver confusion over the Inner/Outer designations, especially with Raleigh's new \"Outer Beltline\", as I-540 has become known.\nI-540/NC 540 is currently under development.\nI-87, designated September 5, 2017, follows the former route of Interstate 495. It begins at the I-40/I-440 interchange southeast of Raleigh and runs east, meeting I-540 and terminating at Rolesville Road. It is entirely concurrent with US 64. When the route is completed it will link Raleigh to the Norfolk, Virginia area.\n\n\n====== Future ======\nInterstate 42 will begin at I-40 south of Raleigh and will follow US 70 to Morehead City.\n\n\n===== United States Highways =====\nU.S. Route 1 enters the city from the north along Capital Boulevard, joins I-440 around the west side of Raleigh, and leaves the city to the southwest as the US 1/US 64 expressway in Cary.\nU.S. Route 64 is the main east-west route through Raleigh; all segments share routes with another highway. East of the city, US-64/US-264 is known as the Knightdale Bypass. US 64 follows I-440 (as a wrong way concurrency) and I-40 along southern Raleigh, and US 1 to the southwest.  A former alignment, designated as Business US-64, follows New Bern Avenue from the I-440 Beltline to the eastern boundary of the city, where it continues into Knightdale.\nU.S. Route 70 runs roughly northwest-southeast through Raleigh. North of downtown, the route follows Glenwood Avenue into Durham. South of Raleigh, the route (along with US 401 and NC 50) follows South Saunders and South Wilmington Streets into Garner. Through downtown, US 70 uses small segments of several streets, including Wade Avenue, Capital Boulevard, Dawson, and McDowell Streets.\nU.S. Route 264 cosigned with US 64 through East Raleigh.\nU.S. Route 401 north of downtown Raleigh it follows Capital Boulevard and Louisburg Road. South of downtown it is cosigned with US 70 from Wade Avenue southward.\n\n\n===== North Carolina Highways =====\nN.C. Route 54 follows Chapel Hill Road and Hillsborough Street in West Raleigh. The route ends at its interchange with I-440.\nN.C. Route 50 is a north-south route through Raleigh. North of Raleigh it follows Creedmoor Road. NC 50 joins US 70 and later US 401 in downtown Raleigh. The three routes remain together through south Raleigh.\nN.C. Route 98, known as Durham Road in North Raleigh, traverses the extreme northern parts of the city.\n\n\n==== Intercity rail ====\n\nRaleigh's train station is one of Amtrak's busiest stops in the Southern U.S. The station is served by five passenger trains daily: the Silver Star, thrice-daily Piedmont service, and the Carolinian. Daily service is offered between Raleigh and:\n\nCharlotte, with intermediate stops including Cary, Durham, Burlington and Greensboro, North Carolina.\nNew York City, with intermediate stops including Richmond, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; and Philadelphia.\nMiami, with intermediate stops including Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia; as well as Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa, Florida.\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\nPublic transportation in and around Raleigh is provided by GoRaleigh, which operates 33 fixed bus routes, including the R-Line and the Wake-Forest Loop. Although there are 33 routes, some routes are designed to cover multiple other routes at times when they are not served. Depending on the time of the day, and the day of the week, the number of routes operating is between 5 and 29.\nRaleigh is also served by GoTriangle (known formerly as the Triangle Transit Authority, and Triangle Transit). GoTriangle offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Research Triangle Park and several of the region's larger suburban communities. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nNorth Carolina State University also maintains its own transit system, the Wolfline, that provides zero-fare bus service to the general public along multiple routes serving the university's campuses in southwest Raleigh.\nGovernment agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.\nFrom 1995 the cornerstone of Triangle Transit's long-term plan was a 28-mile rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections.\nThe region's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.Greyhound Lines provides an inter-city bus service to Durham, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and other cities.\n\n\n==== Bicycle and pedestrian ====\nThe Maine-to-Florida U.S. Bicycle Route#1 routes through suburban Raleigh, along with N.C. Bicycle Route #2, the \"Mountains To Sea\" route. As of September 2010, maps and signage for both US Bike Route #1 and NC Bike Route #2 are out-of-date for the Raleigh area. N.C. Bicycle Route #5 is routed nearby, connecting Apex to Wilmington and closely paralleling the NCBC Randonneurs 600 kilometer brevet route.\nMost public buses are equipped with bicycle racks, and some roads have dedicated bicycle-only lanes. Bicyclists and pedestrians also may use Raleigh's extensive greenway system, with paths and trails located throughout the city.\nIn May 2011, Raleigh was designated a Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists at the Bronze level.\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Raleigh 36th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.\nIn 2002, the \"Walk [Your City]\" initiative was started in the city which provides a tool kit for neighborhood organizations to post signs giving a distance by bike or foot, with directions in scannable QR code. The movement has spread to more than 400 communities in 55 countries.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\nThe Raleigh Fire Department provides fire protection throughout the city. The North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women, the state's primary correctional facility housing female inmates is based in Raleigh.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nRaleigh has several sister cities:\n Xiangyang, Hubei, China\n Compi\u00e8gne, Oise, Hauts-de-France, France\n Kingston upon Hull, England, United Kingdom\n Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany\n Nairobi, Kenya\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of capitals in the United States\nList of municipalities in North Carolina\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Wake County, North Carolina\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nAmis, Moses N.

The tour is $5 per person and well worth the money. After the tour, you're free to roam the grounds. I lucked out and found the",

          "I had the opportunity to do the holiday tour here. It was $5 so I wasn't expecting much but it was so much more than I expected. There was music from the 1800s being played; many in clothing from the time period. The tour started in the chapel, then we went building to building.",

          "Only redeeming case is that they have Pres. Andrew Johnson's birth home. That is the only building that is marked. All the buildings were locked when we stopped by on a week day at 10:30 AM. The visitor's center was locked even though there were employees inside. There was a",

          "We had a tour guide through both the Mordecai House and grounds. She was very knowledgeable and shared information about the family. Our group of 14 may have been just a bit large for the house tour, would be better with a group of 6-8, but still enjoyable. I walked away",
          "The area where this is located is so beautiful. The museum house is well maintained and there is a lot to see on the sight. We took the Trolley tour so got to see even more of the area we stayed in. Raleigh is the Oak City so many oak trees there.",

          "Mordecai is the sight of one of the largest plantations in Wake County and the Mordecai house is the oldest in Raleigh that is still in its original location. If you don't get a guided tour you won't get into the house or any of the other buildings on the lot so I highly",
          "Decided to walk here after a visit to the capitol. It was twenty minutes down a nice street filled with houses from the post civil war era. The Park is a nice little collection of buildings moved here to surround the oldest Raleigh Home still on its foundation. It includes",
          "During my last trip to Raleigh I decided to check out the Mordecai house. I took a guided tour through the many buildings in the park. My tour guide, Katie Vanhoy was very informative and personable, answering my many many questions! I was pleasantly surprised with how much I",
          "Visited here on a Christmas Open House and the admission was free. Toured the main house which had Christmas decorations from different times and told about this history of Christmas in the United States. Main house was nicely decorated with several Christmas trees decorated",

          "We went to the Haunted Lantern Tour for Halloween and it was fantastic! We had to get tickets ahead of time, because last year we couldn't get in because it was sold out! Excited I got to go this year, I was prepared! So, I wasn't entirely sure about what to expect, then I heard",
          "Wish I'd had time for the house tour. The grounds are lovely, and I did get to see several of the outbuildings. I recommend a visit because it's so pretty! Definitely worth the drive just a bit outside downtown.",
          "I had a couple of hours to kill before I caught my plane from Raleigh on Monday. The \"travel magazine\" in the hotel listed this as an inexpensive option. I plugged the address into the GPS and off I went. The first sign the place was closed was there were no cars in the",
          "We had time to kill before heading out to Farm Aid 2014. My wife found this gem in a things to do publication and on a whim we hurried downtown on Saturday morning to see the park. For $5 we got an extensive hour-long tour through the historic Mordecai house, the (separate)",

          "Andrew Johnson, 17th President of the US, was born in the little kitchen house where is mother worked behind a hotel in Raleigh. The house contains a coat that he made by hand as a young man who had learned the tailor trade. Other facts about his humble beginnings are displayed",
          "We did not tour the house, but did take the trolley tour. It was a nice 1-hour overview of downtown Raleigh and its history, especially for our out of town guests. Good way to determine which spots you might like to visit. Was great way for my senior citizen parents and",
          "My family and I signed up for the Mordecai House tour along with the Raleigh Trolley tour, and it is cheaper if you sign up for both at the same time. Our tour guide was a former history teacher and was excellent at relating the history of the house and grounds. Pictures are",
          "This tour is educational, fun and simple. There's not a lot of fancy displays or interactive devices which actually makes it more charming. The tour guide was very informative and down-to-earth. The main house, which is over 200 years old, is the primary attraction though",
          "Two short tours of the main house, and of a few of the houses in the grounds, all close together. About 1 hour in total. Very interesting and very well worth the $5 ticket! Definitely one of the best history attractions I've visited.",
          "Enjoyed Sat morning tour of house and grounds. Lots of interesting details for this non-resident. I joined a tour made up of folks who all knew each other and was made to feel welcomed and part of the group. Definitely suggest getting the combo ticket to include the trolley",
          "Want a quick overview of the area? This hour long tour will give you just that. It leaves from the Mordecai house and is worth the time. - Great for families because it is not so long that you lose interest.",
          "I work right by Mordecai and sometimes bring my lunch to the park. The homes in the neighborhood are super charming, it's nice to just walk around, but there seems to always be some sketchy guy or guys milling around, no matter what day of the week. I've stopped going by",
          "They have done a nice job maintaining the Mordecai Park considering they have a low budget. It does provide an interesting history of a part of early Raleigh.",
          "We have taken our grandchildren to this beautiful home for years. Back to when we had the Freedom Train coming through and the 1776 -1976 Celebrations. One of my favorite places to spend the afternoon....just before lunch at Logans.",

          "We love historic sites and places with presidential connections. We found both at Mordecai Historic Park. The park provides flexibility to fit individual taste and time constraints; visitors may tour the outside buildings, tour the inside of the Mordecai house, or tour",
          "These buildings are beautiful and really well preserved. The park takes you back to old Raleigh antebellum style! The only bad thing I can say is the tour guides are a little disorganized and although well versed in the history of the home, not as well knowledgable in the",
          "The historic park itself is somewhat interesting, with its old time buildings and such, but the real winner here is the Raliegh Trolley Tour. I couldn't find a seperate way to review it, so I'll just use this site, because we bought the trolley tickets from inside this Mordecai",
          "well kept up, docents are informed, can answer questions.",
          "I went with my children to see what it was all about. It's basically a bunch of buildings and a garden. That's it. It is cool to see a historical home. Preserved very well as we should keep some things around from our past. I support the idea and it is a quiet little stroll.",
          "House tour and trolly ride makes for a fun, entertaining day.",
          "I went with my daughters' classes for a field trip. I didn't even know this historic site existed until then. Our tour guide did a great job telling the history and keeping the kids focused. There is a large area for kids to run around after touring the buildings. Not a huge",

          "Neat little area in downtown Raleigh. Has Andrew Johnson's (17th President) birthplace, and a few other small buildings that were all local in the 19th century. Very informative place and a knowledgable staff. Mordecai house itself is an interesting tour. Several local",

          "This is one of the best historical house tours I have ever taken. The tour shows/tells you the entire history of the house from its beginning 4 room structure to its evolution into a mansion. I found it very interesting how they told the story from the houses origins in 1785",
          "I went to Moredcai Historic Park in Raleigh recently. I must say that I was slightly disappointed. I am hugely into history, so I figured this would be right up my alley. The park is fairly small, but it contains some of the oldest (including THE oldest) house in Raleigh. These",
          "I love history, so I really enjoyed my tour of Mordecai Historic Park. Not having checked my information before I left the hotel, I arrived half an hour before they opened. A very nice young woman named Erin told me I could stroll around the grounds while I was waiting. After"

        "wiki": "Raleigh (; RAH-lee) is the capital of the state of North Carolina and the seat of Wake County in the United States. Raleigh is the second-largest city in the state, after Charlotte. Raleigh is known as the \"City of Oaks\" for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city. The city covers a land area of 142.8 square miles (370 km2). The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the city's population as 474,069 as of July 1, 2019. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. The city of Raleigh is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the lost Roanoke Colony in present-day Dare County.\nRaleigh is home to North Carolina State University (NCSU) and is part of Research Triangle Park (RTP), together with Durham (home of Duke University and North Carolina Central University) and Chapel Hill (home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The \"Triangle\" nickname originated after the 1959 creation of the Research Triangle Park, located in Durham and Wake counties, among the three cities and their universities. The  Research Triangle region  encompasses the U.S. Census Bureau's Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which had an estimated population of 2,037,430 in 2013. The Raleigh metropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 1,214,516 in 2013.\nMost of Raleigh is located within Wake County, with a very small portion extending into Durham County. The towns of Cary, Morrisville, Garner, Clayton, Wake Forest, Apex, Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina, Knightdale, Wendell, Zebulon, and Rolesville are some of Raleigh's primary nearby suburbs and satellite towns.\nRaleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city. Following the American Revolutionary War when the US gained independence, this was chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol in Union Square at the center. During the American Civil War, the city was spared from any significant battle. It fell to the Union in the closing days of the war, and struggled with the economic hardships in the postwar period related to the reconstitution of labor markets, over-reliance on agriculture, and the social unrest of the Reconstruction Era. Following the establishment of the Research Triangle Park (RTP) in 1959, several tens of thousands of jobs were created in the fields of science and technology, and it became one of the fastest-growing communities in the United States by the early 21st century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Earlier capitals ===\nBath, the oldest town in North Carolina, was the first nominal capital of the colony from 1705 until 1722, when Edenton took over the role. The colony had no permanent institutions of government until the new capital, New Bern, was established in 1743.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nIn December 1770, Joel Lane successfully petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to create a new county. On January 5, 1771, the bill creating Wake County was passed in the General Assembly. The county was formed from portions of Cumberland, Orange, and Johnston counties. The county was named for Margaret Wake Tryon, the wife of Governor William Tryon. The first county seat was Bloomsbury.\nNew Bern, a port town on the Neuse River 35 miles (56 km) from the Atlantic Ocean, was the largest city and the capital of North Carolina during the American Revolution. When the British Army laid siege to the city, that site could no longer be used as capital. From 1789 to 1794, when Raleigh was being built, the state capital was Fayetteville.\nRaleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital in 1788, as its central location protected it from attacks from the coast. It was officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital (incorporated on December 31, 1792 \u2013 charter granted January 21, 1795). The city was named for Sir Walter Raleigh, sponsor of Roanoke, the \"lost colony\" on Roanoke Island.The city's location was chosen, in part, for being within 11 mi (18 km) from Isaac Hunter's Tavern, a popular tavern frequented by the state legislators. No known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site. Raleigh is one of the few cities in the United States that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital. Its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of North, East, West and South. The plan, a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner, was based on Thomas Holme's 1682 plan for Philadelphia.The North Carolina General Assembly first met in Raleigh in December 1794, and granted the city a charter, with a board of seven appointed commissioners and an \"Intendant of Police\" (which developed as the office of Mayor) to govern it. (After 1803 city commissioners were elected.) In 1799, the N.C. Minerva and Raleigh Advertiser was the first newspaper published in Raleigh. John Haywood was the first Intendant of Police.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn 1808, Andrew Johnson, the nation's future 17th President, was born at Casso's Inn in Raleigh. The city's first water supply network was completed in 1818, although due to system failures, the project was abandoned. In 1819 Raleigh's first volunteer fire company was founded, followed in 1821 by a full-time fire company.\nIn 1817, the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina was established and headquartered in Raleigh.\nIn 1831, a fire destroyed the North Carolina State House. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried gneiss being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completions of the new State Capitol and new Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company in 1840.\nIn 1853, the first State Fair was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, Peace College, was established in 1857. Raleigh's Historic Oakwood contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition.\nNorth Carolina seceded from the Union. After the Civil War began, Governor Zebulon Baird Vance ordered the construction of breastworks around the city as protection from Union troops. During General Sherman's Carolinas Campaign, Raleigh was captured by Union cavalry under the command of General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick on April 13, 1865. As the Confederate cavalry retreated west, the Union soldiers followed, leading to the nearby Battle of Morrisville. The city was spared significant destruction during the War.\nDue to the economic and social problems of the post-war period and Reconstruction, with a state economy still overly based on agriculture, it grew little over the next several decades.\n\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, African Americans were emancipated. The Reconstruction era legislature established public education for blacks and whites. Freedmen were often led by free blacks who had become educated before the war. With the help of the Freedmen's Bureau, many freedmen migrated from rural areas to Raleigh. It had an established free black community, more work opportunities, and many freedmen wanted to get out from under white supervision in the rural areas.\nShaw University, the South's first African American college, began classes in 1865 and was chartered in 1875. Its Estey Hall was the first building constructed for the higher education of black women, and Leonard Medical Center was the first four-year medical school in the country for African Americans.\nIn 1867, Episcopal clergy founded St. Augustine's College for the education of freedmen. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the nation's first school for blind and deaf blacks, to be located in Raleigh. In 1874, the federal government constructed the Federal Building in Raleigh, the first federal government project in the South following the Civil War.\nIn 1880, the newspapers News and Observer combined to form The News & Observer. It continues to be Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, was founded as a land-grant college in 1887. The city's Rex Hospital opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as Meredith College, opened in 1891, and in 1898, The Academy of Music, a private music conservatory, was established.\nIn the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and allies were unsuccessful. Based on a white supremacy campaign that returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote also disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office\u2014local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive in the state.\nIt was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. By that time many African Americans had left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for more opportunities. No African American was elected to Congress from North Carolina until 1992.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1912, Bloomsbury Park opened, featuring a popular carousel ride. Relocated to Pullen Park, the Pullen Park Carousel is still operating.\nFrom 1914 to 1917, an influenza epidemic killed 288 Raleighites.In 1922, WLAC signed on as the city's first radio station, but lasted only two years. WFBQ signed on in 1924 and became WPTF in 1927. It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster.\nFollowing immigration by Catholics, on December 12, 1924, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh was officially established by Pope Pius XI. The Sacred Heart Cathedral became the official seat of the diocese with William Joseph Hafey as its bishop.\nThe city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field, opened in 1929. That same year, the stock market crash resulted in six Raleigh banks closing.During the difficult 1930s of the Great Depression, government at all levels was integral to creating jobs. The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, Raleigh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated. The North Carolina Symphony, founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park. In 1939, the State General Assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority to build a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham, with the first flight occurring in 1943.\nIn 1947, Raleigh citizens adopted a council\u2013manager form of government, the current form. Council members are elected from single-member districts. They hire a city manager.\nThe Dorton Arena, a 7,610-seat multi-purpose arena designed by Matthew Nowicki, was opened in 1952 on the grounds of the North Carolina State Fair. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\nRaleigh experienced significant damage from Hurricane Hazel in 1954.\nIn 1953, WNAO-TV, channel 28, became the city's first television station, though it folded in 1957.\nWith the opening of the Research Triangle Park in 1959, Raleigh began to experience a population increase, resulting in a total city population of 100,000 by 1960. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Raleigh's population as 76.4% white and 23.4% black.Following the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the main achievements of the Civil Rights Movement and the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency, political participation and voting by African Americans in Raleigh increased rapidly.\nFrom the early-to-mid 20th century East Hargett Street was known as Raleigh's \"black main street\" and hosted numerous black-owned businesses. The area declined after the city desegregated its establishments.By the early 1970s people in Raleigh were growing increasingly concerned about growth and urban sprawl. Community organizations felt that municipal offices were being too heavily influenced by business interests when the city's population was rapidly growing and various development projects were being proposed. At their behest, the municipal elections were altered so that the mayor was to be directly elected, instead of being selected by the city council. Most city council seats were then made responsible to districts, instead of being held at-large. The 1973 elections were the first contests affected by the reforms. City Councilman Clarence Lightner defeated Raleigh Merchants bureau Executive Director G. Wesley Williams to become Raleigh's first black mayor, and thus the first black mayor in a major white-majority city in the South.In 1976, the Raleigh City and Wake County schools merged to become the Wake County Public School System, now the largest school system in the state and 19th largest in the country.During the 1970s and 1980s, the I-440 beltline was constructed, easing traffic congestion and providing access to most major city roads.\nThe first Raleigh Convention Center (replaced in 2008) and Fayetteville Street Mall were both opened in 1977. Fayetteville Street was turned into a pedestrian-only street in an effort to help the then-ailing downtown area, but the plan was flawed and business declined for years to come. Fayetteville Street was reopened in 2007 as the main thoroughfare of Raleigh's downtown.The 1988 Raleigh tornado outbreak of November 28, 1988, was the most destructive of the seven tornadoes reported in Northeastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia between 1:00 AM and 5:45 AM. The Raleigh tornado produced over $77 million in damage, along with four fatalities (two in the city of Raleigh, and two in Nash County) and 154 injuries. The damage path from the storm was measured at 84 miles (135 km) long, and .5 miles (0.8 km) wide at times. The tornado was rated F4.In 1991, two large skyscrapers in Raleigh were completed, First Union Capitol Center and Two Hannover Square, along with the popular Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek in Southeast Raleigh.\nIn 1996, the Olympic Flame passed through Raleigh while on its way to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Also in 1996, Hurricane Fran struck the area, causing massive flooding and extensive structural damage. In addition, WRAL-TV became the first High-Definition broadcast station in the world.\nIn 1997, the National Hockey League's Hartford Whalers announced their intention to move to Raleigh as the Carolina Hurricanes, becoming the city's first major league professional sports franchise.\nIn 1999, the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (later renamed the RBC Center and now called PNC Arena), opened to provide a home for the Hurricanes and the NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team, as well as an up-to-date major concert venue.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Raleigh was featured prominently in a number of \"Top 10 Lists\", including those by Forbes, MSNBC and Money magazine, due to its quality of life and favorable business climate.In 2001, the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium complex was expanded with the addition of the Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts, Meymandi Concert Hall, Fletcher Opera Theater, Kennedy Theatre, Betty Ray McCain Gallery and Lichtin Plaza.Fayetteville Street reopened to vehicular traffic in 2006. A variety of downtown building projects began around this time including the 34-story RBC Bank Tower, multiple condominium projects and several new restaurants. Additional skyscrapers are in the proposal/planning phase.\nIn 2006, the city's NHL franchise, the Carolina Hurricanes, won the Stanley Cup, North Carolina's first and only professional sports championship.\nWith the opening of parts of I-540 from 2005 to 2007, a new 70-mile (110 km) loop around Wake County, traffic congestion eased somewhat in the North Raleigh area. Completion of the entire loop is expected to take another 15 years.\nIn 2008, the city's Fayetteville Street Historic District joined the National Register of Historic Places.\nIn September 2010, Raleigh hosted the inaugural Hopscotch Music Festival.\nIn January 2011, Raleigh hosted the National Hockey League All-Star Game.\nIn April 2011, a devastating EF-3 tornado hit Raleigh, and many other tornadoes touched down in the state (ultimately the largest, but not the strongest outbreak to ever hit the state), killing 24 people. The tornado tracked northeast through parts of Downtown, East Central Raleigh and Northeast Raleigh and produced $115 million in damages in Wake County. There were 4 fatalities in the city.In September 2015 Holy Trinity Anglican Church was opened; the first church to be built in downtown Raleigh since 1958.On July 26, 2017 the Catholic Diocese of Raleigh dedicated its new cathedral, Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral, the fifth-largest in the United States.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Raleigh occupies a total area of 144.0 square miles (373.0 km2), of which 142 square miles (369 km2) is land and 0.97 square miles (2.5 km2), or 0.76%, is covered by water. The Neuse River flows through the northeast end of the city.\nRaleigh is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet. This area is known as the \"fall line\" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain. Its central Piedmont location situates Raleigh about two hours west of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, by car and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains. The city is 170 miles (270 km) south of Richmond, Virginia, 278 miles (447 km) south of Washington, D.C., and 166 miles (267 km) northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina. A small portion of the city is located in Durham County.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nRaleigh is divided into several major geographic areas, each of which use a Raleigh address and a ZIP code that begins with the digits 276. PNC Plaza, formerly known as RBC Plaza, is the largest and tallest skyscraper in the city of Raleigh. The tower rises to a height of 538 feet (164 m), with a floor count of 34.\n\n\n==== Downtown and inside-the-beltline neighborhoods ====\n\nThe downtown area is home to historic buildings such as the Sir Walter Raleigh Hotel built in the early 20th century, the restored City Market, the Fayetteville Street downtown business district, which includes the PNC Plaza and Wells Fargo Capitol Center buildings, as well as the North Carolina Museum of History, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, North Carolina State Capitol, William Peace University, the City of Raleigh Museum, Raleigh Convention Center, Shaw University, Campbell University School of Law, and St. Augustine's College. In the 2000s, an effort by the Downtown Raleigh Alliance was made to separate this area of the city into five smaller districts: Fayetteville Street, Moore Square, Glenwood South, Warehouse (Raleigh), and Capital District (Raleigh). Some of the names have become common place among locals such as the Warehouse, Fayetteville Street, and Glenwood South Districts.\nThe Inside the Beltline neighborhoods include Cameron Park, Boylan Heights, Country Club Hills, Coley Forest, Five Points, Budleigh, Glenwood-Brooklyn, Hayes Barton Historic District, Moore Square, Mordecai (home to the historic Mordecai House), Rochester Heights, South Park, Rosengarten Park, Belvidere Park, Woodcrest, Oberlin Village, and Historic Oakwood. Inside the Beltline refers to I-440 which used to be called the Beltline before being re-branded to ease driver navigation. These neighborhoods were typically built before World War II.\n\n\n==== Midtown Raleigh ====\n\nMidtown Raleigh is a residential and commercial area just North of the I-440 Beltline and is part of North Raleigh. It is roughly framed by Glenwood/Creedmoor Road to the West, Wake Forest Road to the East, and Millbrook Road to the North. It includes shopping centers such as North Hills and Crabtree Valley Mall. It also includes North Hills Park and part of the Raleigh Greenway System. The term was coined by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, developer John Kane and planning director Mitchell Silver. The News & Observer newspaper started using the term for marketing purposes only. The Midtown Raleigh Alliance was founded on July 25, 2011 as a way for community leaders to promote the area.\n\n\n==== East Raleigh ====\nEast Raleigh is situated roughly from Capital Boulevard near the I-440 beltline to New Hope Road. Most of East Raleigh's development is along primary corridors such as U.S. 1 (Capital Boulevard), New Bern Avenue, Poole Road, Buffaloe Road, and New Hope Road. Neighborhoods in East Raleigh include Hedingham, Longview, Lockwood, Madonna Acres, New Hope, Thompson-Hunter and Wilder's Grove. The area is bordered to the east by the town of Knightdale.\n\n\n==== West Raleigh ====\n\nWest Raleigh lies along Hillsborough Street and Western Boulevard. The area is bordered to the west by suburban Cary. It is home to North Carolina State University, Meredith College, Pullen Park, Pullen Memorial Baptist Church, the Islamic Association of Raleigh, Cameron Village, Lake Johnson, the North Carolina Museum of Art and historic Saint Mary's School. Primary thoroughfares serving West Raleigh, in addition to Hillsborough Street, are Avent Ferry Road, Blue Ridge Road, and Western Boulevard. The PNC Arena is also located here adjacent to the North Carolina State Fairgrounds. These are located approximately 2 miles from Rex Hospital.\n\n\n==== North Raleigh ====\nNorth Raleigh is an expansive, diverse, and fast-growing suburban area of the city that is home to established neighborhoods to the south along with many newly built subdivisions and along its northern fringes. The area generally falls North of Millbrook Road. It is primarily suburban with large shopping areas. Primary neighborhoods and subdivisions in North Raleigh include Bartons Creek Bluffs, Bedford, Bent Tree, Black Horse Run, Brier Creek, Brookhaven, Coachman's Trail, Crossgate, Crosswinds, Dominion Park, Durant Trails, Ethan's Glenn, Falls River, Greystone Village, Harrington Grove, Hidden Valley, Lake Park, Long Lake, North Haven, North Ridge, Oakcroft, Shannon Woods, Six Forks Station, Springdale Estates, Stonebridge, Stone Creek, Stonehenge, Summerfield, Valley Estates, Wakefield, Weathersfield, Windsor Forest, and Wood Valley. The area is served by a number of primary transportation corridors including Glenwood Avenue U.S. Route 70, Interstate 540, Wake Forest Road, Millbrook Road, Lynn Road, Six Forks Road, Spring Forest Road, Creedmoor Road, Leesville Road, Norwood Road, Strickland Road, and North Hills Drive.\n\n\n==== South Raleigh ====\nSouth Raleigh is located along U.S. 401 south toward Fuquay-Varina and along US 70 into suburban Garner. This area is the least developed and least dense area of Raleigh (much of the area lies within the Swift Creek watershed district, where development regulations limit housing densities and construction). The area is bordered to the west by Cary, to the east by Garner, to the southwest by Holly Springs and the southeast by Fuquay-Varina. Neighborhoods in South Raleigh include Eagle Creek, Renaissance Park, Lake Wheeler, Swift Creek, Carolina Pines, Rhamkatte, Riverbrooke, and Enchanted Oaks.\n\n\n==== Southeast Raleigh ====\nSoutheast Raleigh is bounded by downtown on the west, Garner on the southwest, and rural Wake County to the southeast.

Winters are short and generally cool, with a normal January daily mean temperature of 41.0 \u00b0F (5.0 \u00b0C). On average, there are 69 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 2.7 days that fail to rise above freezing. Raleigh receives an average annual rainfall of 43.34 inches (110.1 cm). Annual and monthly (temperature and) precipitation data are in chart below. April is the driest month, with an average of 2.92 inches (74.2 mm) of precipitation. Precipitation is well distributed around the year, with a slight maximum between July and September; on average, July is the wettest month, owing to generally frequent, sometimes heavy, showers and thunderstorms. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of 80.0 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C). There are 48 days per year with highs at or above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C). Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall, but greater potential for extremely heavy rainfall in a one/two day period, owing to occasional threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) packing torrential rainfall. In September 1999, Raleigh recorded its wettest month ever, with over 21 inches of rain, due to torrential rainfall from tropical weather systems, most notably Hurricane Floyd on September 15\u201316. Extremes in temperature have ranged from \u22129 \u00b0F (\u221223 \u00b0C) on January 21, 1985 up to 105 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C), most recently on June 29\u201330 and July 8, 2012. Raleigh falls in USDA hardiness zones 7b (5 \u00b0F to 10 \u00b0F) and 8a (10 \u00b0F to 15 \u00b0F).Raleigh receives an average of 6.0 inches (15.2 cm) of snow in winter. Freezing rain and sleet also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging ice storm. On January 24\u201325, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm \u2013 20.3 inches (52 cm) \u2013 the Winter Storm of January 2000. Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of cold air damming that affects the city due to its proximity to the Appalachian Mountains.  Winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well.\nThe region also experiences occasional periods of drought, during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience hurricanes. In 1996, Hurricane Fran caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees. Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in September 1999 were primary contributors to that month's extreme rainfall of over 21 inches. The most recent hurricane to have a considerable effect on the area was Hurricane Florence in 2018. Tornadoes also have on occasion affected the city of Raleigh, most notably the November 28, 1988 tornado which occurred in the early morning hours and rated an F4 on the Fujita Tornado Scale and affected northwestern portions of the city.

The I-440 route labeling formerly encompassed the entire loop around the city, co-numbered though South Raleigh with I-40. In 2002, the NCDOT removed the I-440 designation from the co-numbered I-40 (southern and southwestern) sections of the loop, and the directional signage on the remaining I-440 portion was changed from Inner/Outer to East/West. The route designation changes were made to avoid driver confusion over the Inner/Outer designations, especially with Raleigh's new \"Outer Beltline\", as I-540 has become known.\nI-540/NC 540 is currently under development.\nI-87, designated September 5, 2017, follows the former route of Interstate 495. It begins at the I-40/I-440 interchange southeast of Raleigh and runs east, meeting I-540 and terminating at Rolesville Road. It is entirely concurrent with US 64. When the route is completed it will link Raleigh to the Norfolk, Virginia area.\n\n\n====== Future ======\nInterstate 42 will begin at I-40 south of Raleigh and will follow US 70 to Morehead City.\n\n\n===== United States Highways =====\nU.S. Route 1 enters the city from the north along Capital Boulevard, joins I-440 around the west side of Raleigh, and leaves the city to the southwest as the US 1/US 64 expressway in Cary.\nU.S. Route 64 is the main east-west route through Raleigh; all segments share routes with another highway. East of the city, US-64/US-264 is known as the Knightdale Bypass. US 64 follows I-440 (as a wrong way concurrency) and I-40 along southern Raleigh, and US 1 to the southwest.  A former alignment, designated as Business US-64, follows New Bern Avenue from the I-440 Beltline to the eastern boundary of the city, where it continues into Knightdale.\nU.S. Route 70 runs roughly northwest-southeast through Raleigh. North of downtown, the route follows Glenwood Avenue into Durham. South of Raleigh, the route (along with US 401 and NC 50) follows South Saunders and South Wilmington Streets into Garner.

The route ends at its interchange with I-440.\nN.C. Route 50 is a north-south route through Raleigh. North of Raleigh it follows Creedmoor Road. NC 50 joins US 70 and later US 401 in downtown Raleigh. The three routes remain together through south Raleigh.\nN.C. Route 98, known as Durham Road in North Raleigh, traverses the extreme northern parts of the city.\n\n\n==== Intercity rail ====\n\nRaleigh's train station is one of Amtrak's busiest stops in the Southern U.S. The station is served by five passenger trains daily: the Silver Star, thrice-daily Piedmont service, and the Carolinian.

Although there are 33 routes, some routes are designed to cover multiple other routes at times when they are not served. Depending on the time of the day, and the day of the week, the number of routes operating is between 5 and 29.\nRaleigh is also served by GoTriangle (known formerly as the Triangle Transit Authority, and Triangle Transit). GoTriangle offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Research Triangle Park and several of the region's larger suburban communities. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nNorth Carolina State University also maintains its own transit system, the Wolfline, that provides zero-fare bus service to the general public along multiple routes serving the university's campuses in southwest Raleigh.\nGovernment agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.\nFrom 1995 the cornerstone of Triangle Transit's long-term plan was a 28-mile rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections.\nThe region's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.Greyhound Lines provides an inter-city bus service to Durham, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and other cities.\n\n\n==== Bicycle and pedestrian ====\nThe Maine-to-Florida U.S. Bicycle Route#1 routes through suburban Raleigh, along with N.C. Bicycle Route #2, the \"Mountains To Sea\" route. As of September 2010, maps and signage for both US Bike Route #1 and NC Bike Route #2 are out-of-date for the Raleigh area. N.C. Bicycle Route #5 is routed nearby, connecting Apex to Wilmington and closely paralleling the NCBC Randonneurs 600 kilometer brevet route.\nMost public buses are equipped with bicycle racks, and some roads have dedicated bicycle-only lanes. Bicyclists and pedestrians also may use Raleigh's extensive greenway system, with paths and trails located throughout the city.\nIn May 2011, Raleigh was designated a Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists at the Bronze level.\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Raleigh 36th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.\nIn 2002, the \"Walk [Your City]\" initiative was started in the city which provides a tool kit for neighborhood organizations to post signs giving a distance by bike or foot, with directions in scannable QR code. The movement has spread to more than 400 communities in 55 countries.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\nThe Raleigh Fire Department provides fire protection throughout the city. The North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women, the state's primary correctional facility housing female inmates is based in Raleigh.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nRaleigh has several sister cities:\n Xiangyang, Hubei, China\n Compi\u00e8gne, Oise, Hauts-de-France, France\n Kingston upon Hull, England, United Kingdom\n Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany\n Nairobi, Kenya\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of capitals in the United States\nList of municipalities in North Carolina\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Wake County, North Carolina\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nAmis, Moses N.

          "This park has acres of water, the old Yates mill, and a fine interpretive center and mini-museum. The interior exhibit of a mill directs your view to the outside, and then you look, there is the historic mill in full view across the millpond. close-up photo ops are not possible,",
          "This is a small very well maintained park with a bit of local history thrown in. The park is built around an historic mill.",

          "This is a beautiful place to go in the fall. The colors in the trees are so vivid. There were a few photographers taking family pictures out there. There are 3 trails, each only a mile or less. There is a lovely dock that people were fishing off. Signs say you can\u2019t fish",

          "We went to check out the Historic Yates Mill County Park and ended up staying for the whole morning. The place is tranquil as well as historic. The hiking trails were beautiful to walk, and we enjoyed learning about the human history. There are information boards throughout",
          "Nice, quaint place to visit when you have extra leisure time...Interesting place to visit...However, I stay away from the snake area....My husband and two adult sons however did not....Did not like that part of the park....Probably will not go back but I am glad that I did go at",
          "Very nice mill in a wooded setting that was just a joy to walk up to. It was quiet and peaceful the morning we were there. Many things for the kids to look at inside the main center.",
          "We went with the sole purpose of seeing the Mill, unfortunately it is only in operation on the 3rd weekend of the month. It was still worth the drive out there. The Finley Center had some interesting facts about the mill, plus some hands on items for kids to play and try out.",
          "My husband and I visited the Mill during our short trip to Raleigh and loved this spot! It was very scenic and fun to just see. There were people in uniform, who interacted with families, which was fun! Tours are offered for $5 that will take you in the Mill, however we just",
          "It was a beautiful. State park with a lotvtonoffelot to offer. Tour guide a little too over zealous with the art of corn making. All tours should have more of a historical and corn mining instructive balance. Surroundings beautiful, but tour guide was too gregarious and",

          "This was a pleasant surprise. Only 2 of us went the first time. We enjoyed it so much, that the others decided they wanted to visit too. So I went twice. Would love totreturn when the flowers are in full bloom.",
          "My husband and I were driving home, and decided to take a stop here - this place is great for families or people interested in the outdoors. Definitely great way to break up the drive, but not a place you can spend more than 2-3 hours.",
          "We didn't do the paid tour but had previously had read about the history so at least we did have a background, but I would imagine the tour would make it 10x's better with regards to more history. Regardless, there are beautiful pictures to take and there's a trail to walk",
          "Great waterfall, operational mill, and museum, plan your visit for a day the mill is operational and it's more exciting. Take a nice walk around the small lake. Nice picnic area. Free museum, the mill tour requires a small fee.",

          "We biked up to the cider mill and enjoyed the fun. Cider - doughnuts - sweets - and families laughing together. It does get crowded as everyone comes for the fun!",
          "I wanted to spend some time outside while my husband was at a work function and this was a beautiful place to do so! They offered tours while I was there but I just wanted to walk around the water and check it out on my own. Walk was quick and fun - enjoyed the guide signs",
          "We were on the last morning of our weekend visit to Raleigh when we saw information about the Historic Yates Mill County Park. We decided to check it out and It turned out to be a great decision. The 174-acre park is open seven days a week from 8:00 am to sunset. The A.E.",
          "Had a lovely day walking around the park. Wish the milll was open to see inside it. Went inside to ask questions at the office and they were more than accomodating for information about that park and even more!!!!",

          "This 575-acre park in southern Wake County, N.C., has a restored 1756 gristmill as its centerpiece. It's an interesting building to behold and sits alongside a dam and waterfall, also worth enjoying and appreciating. The park has several trails, and on the afternoon I was there,",
          "The lake next to the mill is large and picturesque. The mill is a short walk from the entrance. Although you can not enter the mill you can walk around it in three sides. There are some great spots to take shots of the mill. Inside the centre there is a lot to see and read. Kids",

          "We enjoyed the walk and the area, it's beautiful spot. The information in the musuem was well done and so much hands on learning. We didn't stay for the tour but hope to come back and do that one day.",
          "Be sure to visit the web site so you will know when they have the grinding demonstrations and the mill tour (they don't occur on the same days). If you want to tour the mill be prepared to give up your name, date of birth, and address for each person in your group. No getting",
          "We came here looking for a beauty spot for a walk, and this was it! A lot of wildlife to see: turtles, skinks, lizards, and a variety of bird life. The first time we came, a fall festival was on. While we didn't expect it, the booths of craftspeople and nature experts (one on",

          "This is a gorgeous place and is a trip back through history. The Old Mill is still working, and the presentations are terrific. The guides and workers there demonstrate the process of working the Old Mill. They even grind corn in the old fashioned way. Ground corn can be bought",
          "This is a very nice local park for birding. It has a variety of habitats and gets quite a variety of birds. It is also nest to Mid Pines road which seems to get many relatively rare birds. The park staff is friendly and the mill is an interesting visit. It has a nice trail",
          "Visited with the intent of taking a few photos. I ended up spent 2 hours here. Its a short, easy walk 20 minute walk round the pond. Beautiful restored mill at one end of the walk near the car park. Informative visitors centre too.",
          "This was a great place to walk around the lake, there is fishing available also. The four year old was\"bored\" with our walk but the visitor center had her attention for over an hour. We had to pull her away from all the fun to go to lunch.",

          "I stopped by this park with my mom and my mother-in-law last weekend when we were in the Raleigh area. Unfortunately we arrived right before the visitor center closed, but from the minute we spent in there it seemed like they had a lot of interesting information and displays",

          "I am trying out all the walking parks and I can find and today tried this historic preservation. I am a city girl at heart so not very adventurous. What I saw of the park was beautiful scenery but was confused as to if there was actual trails. If there was, there were not",
          "We took the tour which is very reasonably priced and makes it more interesting. The tour guide was good, the mill is interesting and in a beautiful spot. The small park office has some really nice areas for children to learn and adults. The walk to the mill is not that hard even",
          "Interesting History and volunteered tour. Grounds were well kept and the trail were easy to navigate.",

          "I love hiking trails and nostalgic places. Went there on a Monday. I asked about placing small painted rocks on the trails and explained what they were for. Was told no as they are a 'natural' sanctuary and nothing brought in from the outside was allowed. Fair enough. Started",

          "We loved this park, and the mill in particular. It wasn't running when we visited, but the views in and around are great. Park is well manicured, and the exhibit at the front is also great. The only thing we wish they had was some kind of vending machine inside the exhibit",
          "This is one of those 'off the beaten path' type places that is sure to please. In addition to the exhibits and locale...did I mention that there is a mill? Yeah, that. They have regular programs for the kids, and it is a great opportunity to escape the standard 'city' events",
          "I've gone a few times now and am never disappointed ! There is usually wildlife of some sort to see during your hike. We saw deer this last time and many different kinds of birds. The forests are magical and the trails are not too hard to walk.",
          "I lived here 10 years before venturing to the mill and can't believe I waited so long. Great exhibits indoors about the mill's history. Nice walking trail to the mill and around the mill pound. The actual mill is only open on certain weekends, but this is still a nice place to",

          "The visitor center has informative displays explaining the milling process and history of the Yates Mill. However, the real attraction is the mill itself. If you are able to go on a day that the mill is open for tours and in operation, that is is a definite plus. Tours cost a",

        "wiki": "Crabtree Creek is a major body of water in Wake County, North Carolina, United States. The creek is a tributary of the Neuse River.  It begins in the town of Cary and flows through Morrisville, William B. Umstead State Park, and the northern sections of Raleigh (roughly along I-440) before emptying into the Neuse at Anderson Point Park, a large city park located in East Raleigh.  \nThe creek lies within a flood plain that is historically prone to frequent flooding throughout its length, even after moderate rainfall. Construction of lakes on the creek and its tributaries to control floods have only partially alleviated this problem because rapid development of Wake County has greatly increased storm runoff. Crabtree Valley Mall derives its name from the creek; when the mall was constructed, the creek was redirected into an artificial channel behind the mall. At the time of construction there were predictions that the mall would flood. In fact, the new channel of the creek at the mall has proved to be inadequate for peak flows.\nThe highest recorded level of Crabtree Creek, measured at Glenwood Avenue near the mall, was 27.69 feet (8.44 m) in June 1973 shortly after the mall's completion. Tropical Storm Alberto (2006) caused the second highest elevation on record, 23.77 feet (7.25 m); and Hurricane Fran in September 1996 caused the third highest elevation, 23.00 feet (7.01 m). All three events flooded the lower level of the mall, inundated the mall's parking lots, and obstructed traffic in the vicinity. Even moderate storms wreak minor havoc around the mall; for instance, a storm in June 2006 caused an evacuation of the mall and significant property damage.\nIn the Cary/Morrisville area, the creek was dammed to create Lake Crabtree, a 520-acre (2.1 km2) flood control lake. Lake Crabtree County Park, Raleigh's Crabtree Boulevard and Raleigh's Crabtree Park are all either named after the creek or the adjoining lake.  The Crabtree Creek Trail, a branch of the Capital Area Greenway, follows the course of the creek from a location just west of Crabtree Valley Mall to the confluence with the Neuse River at Anderson Point Park.\n\n\n== Lassiter Mill ==\n\nAccording to the City of Raleigh plaque at the site, one of Wake County's first mills was located on Crabtree Creek at a site known as \"the Great Falls of Crabtree.\" The first mill was constructed before 1764, and the current foundations are remnants of a grist mill constructed by Cornelius Jesse Lassiter in 1908. The mill was destroyed by fire in 1958. Today, the Lassiter Mill site is a Raleigh City park, part of the greenway system, and is open to the public.\n\n\n== Crabtree Creek Greenway ==\nThe Crabtree Creek greenway is a 14.6 miles (23.5 km) paved trail that follows Crabtree Creek northwest from the Neuse River Trail beginning at Anderson Point Park to Lindsay Dr. The final 4.1 miles (6.6 km) \"east extension\" section was completed in 2015 connecting the existing trail at Milburnie Road to the Neuse River Trail at Anderson Point Park. The city is planning a \"west extension\" (which will extend the 14.6 miles) to Umstead State Park.  That project's planning will take approximately 12 months to complete with construction anticipated to begin Spring 2017. The completed Crabtree Creek Trail will extend across the city, connecting numerous important areas and facilities: Umstead State Park, Crabtree Valley Mall, North Raleigh, Shelley Lake, Sertoma Park, Lassiter Mill, Kiwanis Park, and Anderson Point Park.\n\n\n== Watershed ==\n\n\n=== Tributaries ===\nTributaries of Crabtree Creek (Neuse River tributary)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTrails.com - Crabtree\nTriangleMTB - Lake Crabtree\nWake Gov - Lake Crabtree\nVisit Raleigh - Lake Crabtree County Park Visitor Guide\nRealtime level at Crabtree Mall",

        "wiki": "The Dorothea Dix Hospital was the first North Carolina psychiatric hospital located on Dix Hill in Raleigh, North Carolina and named after mental health advocate Dorothea Dix from New England.  It was founded in 1856 and closed in 2012.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1848, Dorothea Dix visited North Carolina and called for reform in the care of mentally ill patients. In 1849, when the North Carolina State Medical Society was formed, the construction of an institution in the capital, Raleigh, for the care of mentally ill patients was authorized. The hospital opened in 1856 as Dix Hill in honor of her grandfather and was almost 100 years later named in honor of Dorothea Lynde Dix.The hospital grounds at one time included 2,354 acres (953 ha), which were used for the hospital's farms, orchards, livestock, maintenance buildings, employee housing, and park grounds. In 1984, the Hunt administration transferred 385 acres to North Carolina State University's \"Centennial Campus,\" and in 1985, the Martin administration transferred an additional 450 acres. Other pieces of the property now include the State Farmer's Market.\nAs of 2000, a consultant said the hospital needed to close. This move was made despite the fact that the hospital was operating well and that its closure meant that mental health patients would have no local, public facility to use for care. The hospital land was purchased by the state to house the hospital.\nThe Dorothea Dix Hospital was at one time slated to be closed by the state by 2008, and the fate of the remaining 306 acres (124 ha) was a matter of much discussion and debate in state and local circles. As of October 6, 2008, according to the News & Observer, state officials were calling the facility \"Central Regional Hospital - Raleigh Campus.\"  But in 2009, the state announced that Dorothea Dix Hospital would not be closing and would not be a \"satellite\" of CRH. It was announced in August 2010 that a lack of funding meant the facility would \"shut its doors by the end of the year.\" A thorough history of the hospital was published in 2010 by the Office of Archives and History of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources.In August 2012, Dorothea Dix Hospital moved its last patients to Central Regional Hospital in Butner, North Carolina, which critics said did not provide enough beds for even the most serious cases. To help alleviate the situation, in May 2012, UNC agreed to spend $40 million on mental health services.The hospital is the setting for \"Dix Hill,\" David Sedaris' reminiscence of working there as a volunteer in his youth, published in his collection, Naked.\nOn May 5, 2015, the Council of State members voted unanimously to approve selling the 308 acres to the city. The property is now slated to become a destination city park. Proceeds of the sale will go to \"fund facilities and services for the mentally ill.\"  Located on the property is Spring Hill, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n\n\n== References ==",

The lake has an area of 55.7 acres (22.5 ha) and lies entirely within the city of Raleigh's 75-acre (30 ha) Lake Lynn Park. The park includes a 2.8 mi (4.5 km) paved trail around the lake (part of the Capital Area Greenway system), as well as a community center, playground, and tennis courts.\nLake Lynn Dam (also named Crabtree Watershed Dam #22b), is a 42 foot (13 m) high, 620 foot (190 m) long earth dam.\n\n\n== Wildlife ==\nLake Lynn has an aquatic wildlife that includes common varieties of lake fish found in North Carolina. Turtles are also commonly seen in the shallower parts of the lake and it is not uncommon to see the turtles come out of the lake on a sunny day. Snakes and birds are also commonly seen around this mini ecosystem.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCrabtree Creek (Neuse River)\nWilliam B.

          "We live very close to the lake and so even for a few minutes to a couple of hours is always a special treat to go there! We have been there in the heavy rain too and there were a few places and a gazebo to hide from the storm! Over the years we have taken many pictures of the",
          "It is 2.25 miles to walk around Lake Lynn. Very relaxing, especially weekdays. Warm weekends can be more crowded, but not a major negative at all. My wife & I walk this lake a few times a year, and have for nearly 20.",
          "The trail around Lake Lynn is paved and comfortable as it circles the lake. There are always people walking out there because it's a place you can feel as if you're in the country, even though you are in Northwest Raleigh! Many people bring their dogs. There is lots of",
          "I walk Lake Lynn probably at least once a week. It is a great 2 mile trail. It is quiet and beautiful. My dog loves it. It tends to be busy on the weekends & after work, never overly busy though. Parking is almost never a problem except maybe on the first nice day in spring.",
          "Lake Lynn has a 2.5 mile walking trail that is paved all the way around. The main feature of this park is there is a lot of waterfowl especially ducks and geese on the trail and there are a lot of turtles as well. Most of the trail is shaded. All along the trail is surrounded",
          "Went to Lake Lynn this weekend to walk around the lake. There is a 2 mile paved walking path next to the lake. There is plenty of wild life in and around the lake. We like to watch the ducks and turtles and geese frolic in the water. There are a couple of swans out there",

        "wiki": "Wake County is a county in the U.S. state of North Carolina. As of July 1, 2019, the population was 1,111,761, making it North Carolina's most populous county as well as the most populous county in the Carolinas. From July 2005 to July 2006, Wake County was the 9th fastest-growing county in the United States, with the town of Cary and the city of Raleigh being the 8th and 15th fastest-growing cities, respectively.Its county seat is Raleigh, which is also the state capital.  Eleven other municipalities are in Wake County, the largest of which is Cary, the third largest city of the Research Triangle region and the seventh largest municipality in North Carolina.\nIt is governed by the Wake County Board of Commissioners, coterminous with the Wake County Public School System school district, with law enforcement provided by the Wake County Sheriff's Department.  It is also part of the wider Triangle J Council of Governments which governs regional planning.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nPrior to English colonization, present-day Wake County was part of the Tuscarora nation.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nWake County was formed in 1770 from parts of Cumberland County, Johnston County, and Orange County. The first courthouse was built at a village originally called Wake Courthouse, now known as Bloomsbury. In 1771, the first elections and court were held, and the first militia units were organized.\nWake County lost some of its territory through the formation of other counties. Parts were included in Franklin County in 1787, and in Durham County in both 1881 and 1911.\nDuring the colonial period of North Carolina, the state capital was New Bern. For several years during and after the Revolutionary War there was no capital, and the General Assembly met in various locations. Fayetteville was the state capital in 1786, 1789, 1790, and 1793, when Raleigh became the permanent state capital in 1794. In 1792, a commission was appointed to select a site to build a permanent state capital. The commission members favored land owned by Colonel John Hinton across the Neuse River, but the night before the final vote the committee adjourned to the home of Joel Lane for an evening of food and spirits. The next day, the vote went in Lane's favor.\n\nLane named Wake County in honor of Margaret Wake, wife of colonial Governor William Tryon. Raleigh was named after Sir Walter Raleigh, and established in 1792 on 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) purchased from Lane. Raleigh had never set foot in North Carolina, but he had sponsored the establishment of the first English colony in North America on North Carolina's Roanoke Island in 1585. The city of Raleigh became both the state capital and the new seat of Wake County.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nThe Battle at Morrisville Station was fought April 13\u201315, 1865 in Morrisville, North Carolina during the Carolinas Campaign of the American Civil War. It was the last official battle of the Civil War between the armies of Major General William T. Sherman and General Joseph E. Johnston. General Judson Kilpatrick, commanding officer of the Union cavalry advance, compelled Confederate forces under the command of Generals Wade Hampton III and Joseph Wheeler to withdraw in haste. They had been frantically trying to transport their remaining supplies and wounded by rail westward toward the final Confederate encampment in Greensboro, NC. Kilpatrick used artillery on the heights overlooking Morrisville Station and cavalry charges to push the Confederates out of the small village leaving many needed supplies behind. However, the trains were able to withdraw with wounded from the Battle of Bentonville and the Battle of Averasboro. Later, General Johnston sent a courier to the Federal encampments at Morrisville with a message for Major General Sherman requesting a conference to discuss an armistice. Several days later the two generals met at Bennett Place near Durham on April 17, 1865, to begin discussing the terms of what would become the largest surrender of the war.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the 20th century, the average per capita income for the county was of $54,988, and the median income for a family was of $67,149. In the same period, the per capita income decreased from $44,472 to $31,579, especially for women. About 7.80% of the population was below the federal poverty line. In August 2014, the population hit 1,000,000 people.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn November 2017, commissioners of Wake and Harnett counties discussed the possibility of redrawing the line between the counties using the latest technology. This could affect 27 homeowners who would end up in a different county or have their property divided between the two.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\nThe county is governed by the Wake County Board of Commissioners, a seven-member board of County Commissioners, elected at large to serve four-year terms. Terms are staggered so that, every two years, three or four Commissioners are up for election. The commissioners enact policies such as the establishment of the property tax rate, regulation of land use and zoning outside municipal jurisdictions, and adoption of the annual budget. Commissioners meet on the first and third Mondays of each month.Current members of the Wake County Board of Commissioners are Jessica Holmes (Chair), Greg Ford (Vice-Chair), Vickie Adamson, Matt Calabria, Susan Evans, Sig Hutchinson, and James West.David Ellis is the County Manager.Wake County is a member of the regional Triangle J Council of Governments.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nWhile North Carolina is historically a conservative state, Wake County is typically a swing voting area.\nFrom 1828 to 1964, the county was won by Democratic presidential candidates in all but six elections (John C. Breckinridge in 1860, Ulysses S. Grant in 1868 and 1872, Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, James A. Garfield in 1880, and Benjamin Harrison in 1888). From 1968 to 2004, Republicans won the county in every election but one, when Bill Clinton carried it in 1992.  However, the races have almost always been close, such as in 1980, when Ronald Reagan won by a landslide nationwide, but by a mere one percent in Wake County. Recently, Republican George W. Bush won the county in 2000 with 53 percent of the vote and defeated John Kerry in 2004 by a slim 51 to 49 percent. In 2008 Democrat Barack Obama defeated John McCain 56 to 43 percent, becoming the first Democrat since Lyndon Johnson to win a majority of the county's vote. In 2012, Obama won Wake County again over Mitt Romney with 54 percent of the vote to Romney's 44 percent \u2013 the first time in almost half a century that a Democrat carried the county in consecutive elections. Obama's performance in Wake mirrored his strong showing along the I-85 Corridor. In 2016, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won the county 57 percent to Donald Trump's 37 percent, reflecting the nationwide shift towards Democrats in urban and suburban areas.\n\nDemocrats fared well here in the 2008 election. In the 1998 Senate race, John Edwards won in Wake County, which helped him defeat incumbent Republican Lauch Faircloth. In 2000 Mike Easley won the governor's race here with 55% of the vote. In 2004, Easley won again, winning with 59 percent to 40 percent for opponent Patrick Ballantine. Democrat Beverly Perdue won Wake County in the 2008 Governor's election by a 51 to 45 percent margin. Democratic candidate for US Senate Erskine Bowles won the county with 52 percent, despite losing statewide to Richard Burr by the same margin. In 2002, however, Republican Elizabeth Dole defeated Bowles with 55% of the vote here, and won by a large margin statewide. In 2008 Kay Hagan defeated Dole 56 to 40 percent.\nDemocratic strength is concentrated primarily in Raleigh. Republican strength is concentrated in the rural and exurban areas in the northern and western parts of the county. The outskirts of Raleigh, and the cities of Cary and Apex are mostly home to swing voters.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 857 square miles (2,220 km2), of which 835 square miles (2,160 km2) is land and 22 square miles (57 km2) (2.6%) is water.Wake County is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the North American Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet. This area is known as the \"fall line\" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Wake County features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain. Its central Piedmont location situates the county about three hours west of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, by car and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains.\nBodies of water that are located in Wake County include Lake Crabtree, Crabtree Creek, Lake Johnson, the Neuse River, and portions of Falls Lake and Jordan Lake.\n\n\n=== Adjacent counties ===\nGranville County \u2013 north\nFranklin County \u2013 northeast\nNash County \u2013 east\nJohnston County \u2013 southeast\nHarnett County \u2013 southwest\nChatham County \u2013 west\nDurham County \u2013 northwest\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nWake County enjoys a moderate subtropical climate, with moderate temperatures in the spring, fall, and winter.

It offers direct access to RDU International Airport, Morrisville, Cary, Raleigh and Garner. It has two auxiliary routes in Wake County:\n I-440 is the northern, western and eastern portion of the \"Beltline\" that encircles most of central Raleigh. The southern portion of the Beltline is I-40.\n I-540 / NC 540 is a 66-mile (106 km) partially-completed loop that currently connects the satellite towns of Knightdale, Cary, Morrisville, Apex and Holly Springs. The completed portion in northern Wake County is called the Northern Wake Expressway (I-540). It continues as a non-Interstate route, NC 540, in western Wake County, almost all of which is a toll road. The remaining segments to be constructed will also be designated as NC 540 and will be tolled.\n I-87 will eventually connect I-40 to Norfolk, Virginia. Its Wake County section is concurrent with U.S. 64. The highway is currently signed as I-87 only where it already meets Interstate standards: along the Raleigh Beltline (where its southern terminus is at I-440's Exit 16 and I-40's Exit 301) and along the Knightdale Bypass, which runs from I-440 to the Business 64 exit between Knightdale and Wendell.  East of this point, the road is a controlled-access freeway but does not meet interstate standards, so it is marked with \"Future\" I-87 signs.  The \"future\" designation will be removed as the road is eventually upgraded by improving the road's shoulders, which are currently too narrow to qualify for an Interstate Highway designation.  There is no timetable for these improvements. Interstate 87 will run along the same routing, and will eventually will be extended along US 64, US 17 and other roads (some yet to be built) to Norfolk.\n\n\n==== U.S. Routes ====\nMajor U.S. highways that run through Wake County include US 1 US 64 US 264 US 70 US 401\n\n\n==== State Routes ====\nMajor state highways include\n NC 39\n NC 42\n NC 50\n NC 54\n NC 55\n NC 96\n NC 97\n NC 98\n NC 147\n NC 231\n\n\n=== Bicycles ===\nThe \"mountains-to-the-sea\" North Carolina Bicycle Route 2 travels through Wake County, as does the Maine-to-Florida U.S. Bicycle Route 1.

Umstead State Park, and the Jordan Lake State Recreation Area. Falls Lake Park is located in northern Wake County and contains the 12,000-acre (49 km2) Falls Lake and 26,000 acres (110 km2) of woodlands. Umstead Park is situated between Raleigh and Cary near RDU. Located right off I-40, it is divided into two sections, Crabtree Creek and Reedy Creek, and contains 5,579 acres (22.58 km2) of woodlands.

The city of Raleigh is named after Sir Walter Raleigh, who established the lost Roanoke Colony in present-day Dare County.\nRaleigh is home to North Carolina State University (NCSU) and is part of Research Triangle Park (RTP), together with Durham (home of Duke University and North Carolina Central University) and Chapel Hill (home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The \"Triangle\" nickname originated after the 1959 creation of the Research Triangle Park, located in Durham and Wake counties, among the three cities and their universities. The  Research Triangle region  encompasses the U.S. Census Bureau's Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area (CSA), which had an estimated population of 2,037,430 in 2013. The Raleigh metropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 1,214,516 in 2013.\nMost of Raleigh is located within Wake County, with a very small portion extending into Durham County. The towns of Cary, Morrisville, Garner, Clayton, Wake Forest, Apex, Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina, Knightdale, Wendell, Zebulon, and Rolesville are some of Raleigh's primary nearby suburbs and satellite towns.\nRaleigh is an early example in the United States of a planned city. Following the American Revolutionary War when the US gained independence, this was chosen as the site of the state capital in 1788 and incorporated in 1792 as such. The city was originally laid out in a grid pattern with the North Carolina State Capitol in Union Square at the center. During the American Civil War, the city was spared from any significant battle. It fell to the Union in the closing days of the war, and struggled with the economic hardships in the postwar period related to the reconstitution of labor markets, over-reliance on agriculture, and the social unrest of the Reconstruction Era. Following the establishment of the Research Triangle Park (RTP) in 1959, several tens of thousands of jobs were created in the fields of science and technology, and it became one of the fastest-growing communities in the United States by the early 21st century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Earlier capitals ===\nBath, the oldest town in North Carolina, was the first nominal capital of the colony from 1705 until 1722, when Edenton took over the role. The colony had no permanent institutions of government until the new capital, New Bern, was established in 1743.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nIn December 1770, Joel Lane successfully petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to create a new county. On January 5, 1771, the bill creating Wake County was passed in the General Assembly. The county was formed from portions of Cumberland, Orange, and Johnston counties. The county was named for Margaret Wake Tryon, the wife of Governor William Tryon. The first county seat was Bloomsbury.\nNew Bern, a port town on the Neuse River 35 miles (56 km) from the Atlantic Ocean, was the largest city and the capital of North Carolina during the American Revolution. When the British Army laid siege to the city, that site could no longer be used as capital. From 1789 to 1794, when Raleigh was being built, the state capital was Fayetteville.\nRaleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital in 1788, as its central location protected it from attacks from the coast. It was officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital (incorporated on December 31, 1792 \u2013 charter granted January 21, 1795). The city was named for Sir Walter Raleigh, sponsor of Roanoke, the \"lost colony\" on Roanoke Island.The city's location was chosen, in part, for being within 11 mi (18 km) from Isaac Hunter's Tavern, a popular tavern frequented by the state legislators. No known city or town existed previously on the chosen city site. Raleigh is one of the few cities in the United States that was planned and built specifically to serve as a state capital. Its original boundaries were formed by the downtown streets of North, East, West and South. The plan, a grid with two main axes meeting at a central square and an additional square in each corner, was based on Thomas Holme's 1682 plan for Philadelphia.The North Carolina General Assembly first met in Raleigh in December 1794, and granted the city a charter, with a board of seven appointed commissioners and an \"Intendant of Police\" (which developed as the office of Mayor) to govern it. (After 1803 city commissioners were elected.) In 1799, the N.C. Minerva and Raleigh Advertiser was the first newspaper published in Raleigh. John Haywood was the first Intendant of Police.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn 1808, Andrew Johnson, the nation's future 17th President, was born at Casso's Inn in Raleigh. The city's first water supply network was completed in 1818, although due to system failures, the project was abandoned. In 1819 Raleigh's first volunteer fire company was founded, followed in 1821 by a full-time fire company.\nIn 1817, the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina was established and headquartered in Raleigh.\nIn 1831, a fire destroyed the North Carolina State House. Two years later, reconstruction began with quarried gneiss being delivered by the first railroad in the state. Raleigh celebrated the completions of the new State Capitol and new Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company in 1840.\nIn 1853, the first State Fair was held near Raleigh. The first institution of higher learning in Raleigh, Peace College, was established in 1857. Raleigh's Historic Oakwood contains many houses from the 19th century that are still in good condition.\nNorth Carolina seceded from the Union. After the Civil War began, Governor Zebulon Baird Vance ordered the construction of breastworks around the city as protection from Union troops. During General Sherman's Carolinas Campaign, Raleigh was captured by Union cavalry under the command of General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick on April 13, 1865. As the Confederate cavalry retreated west, the Union soldiers followed, leading to the nearby Battle of Morrisville. The city was spared significant destruction during the War.\nDue to the economic and social problems of the post-war period and Reconstruction, with a state economy still overly based on agriculture, it grew little over the next several decades.\n\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, African Americans were emancipated. The Reconstruction era legislature established public education for blacks and whites. Freedmen were often led by free blacks who had become educated before the war. With the help of the Freedmen's Bureau, many freedmen migrated from rural areas to Raleigh. It had an established free black community, more work opportunities, and many freedmen wanted to get out from under white supervision in the rural areas.\nShaw University, the South's first African American college, began classes in 1865 and was chartered in 1875. Its Estey Hall was the first building constructed for the higher education of black women, and Leonard Medical Center was the first four-year medical school in the country for African Americans.\nIn 1867, Episcopal clergy founded St. Augustine's College for the education of freedmen. The biracial Reconstruction legislature created new welfare institutions: in 1869, it approved the nation's first school for blind and deaf blacks, to be located in Raleigh. In 1874, the federal government constructed the Federal Building in Raleigh, the first federal government project in the South following the Civil War.\nIn 1880, the newspapers News and Observer combined to form The News & Observer. It continues to be Raleigh's primary daily newspaper. The North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, was founded as a land-grant college in 1887. The city's Rex Hospital opened in 1889 and included the state's first nursing school. The Baptist Women's College, now known as Meredith College, opened in 1891, and in 1898, The Academy of Music, a private music conservatory, was established.\nIn the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. He and allies were unsuccessful. Based on a white supremacy campaign that returned Democrats to dominance, in 1900 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with a suffrage amendment that raised barriers to voter registration, resulting in the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote also disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office\u2014local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive in the state.\nIt was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. By that time many African Americans had left the state in the Great Migration to northern industrial cities for more opportunities. No African American was elected to Congress from North Carolina until 1992.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1912, Bloomsbury Park opened, featuring a popular carousel ride. Relocated to Pullen Park, the Pullen Park Carousel is still operating.\nFrom 1914 to 1917, an influenza epidemic killed 288 Raleighites.In 1922, WLAC signed on as the city's first radio station, but lasted only two years. WFBQ signed on in 1924 and became WPTF in 1927. It is now Raleigh's oldest continuous radio broadcaster.\nFollowing immigration by Catholics, on December 12, 1924, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh was officially established by Pope Pius XI. The Sacred Heart Cathedral became the official seat of the diocese with William Joseph Hafey as its bishop.\nThe city's first airport, Curtiss-Wright Flying Field, opened in 1929. That same year, the stock market crash resulted in six Raleigh banks closing.During the difficult 1930s of the Great Depression, government at all levels was integral to creating jobs. The city provided recreational and educational programs, and hired people for public works projects. In 1932, Raleigh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated. The North Carolina Symphony, founded the same year, performed in its new home. From 1934 to 1937, the federal Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park. In 1939, the State General Assembly chartered the Raleigh-Durham Aeronautical Authority to build a larger airport between Raleigh and Durham, with the first flight occurring in 1943.\nIn 1947, Raleigh citizens adopted a council\u2013manager form of government, the current form. Council members are elected from single-member districts. They hire a city manager.\nThe Dorton Arena, a 7,610-seat multi-purpose arena designed by Matthew Nowicki, was opened in 1952 on the grounds of the North Carolina State Fair. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\nRaleigh experienced significant damage from Hurricane Hazel in 1954.\nIn 1953, WNAO-TV, channel 28, became the city's first television station, though it folded in 1957.\nWith the opening of the Research Triangle Park in 1959, Raleigh began to experience a population increase, resulting in a total city population of 100,000 by 1960. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Raleigh's population as 76.4% white and 23.4% black.Following the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the main achievements of the Civil Rights Movement and the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency, political participation and voting by African Americans in Raleigh increased rapidly.\nFrom the early-to-mid 20th century East Hargett Street was known as Raleigh's \"black main street\" and hosted numerous black-owned businesses. The area declined after the city desegregated its establishments.By the early 1970s people in Raleigh were growing increasingly concerned about growth and urban sprawl. Community organizations felt that municipal offices were being too heavily influenced by business interests when the city's population was rapidly growing and various development projects were being proposed. At their behest, the municipal elections were altered so that the mayor was to be directly elected, instead of being selected by the city council. Most city council seats were then made responsible to districts, instead of being held at-large. The 1973 elections were the first contests affected by the reforms. City Councilman Clarence Lightner defeated Raleigh Merchants bureau Executive Director G. Wesley Williams to become Raleigh's first black mayor, and thus the first black mayor in a major white-majority city in the South.In 1976, the Raleigh City and Wake County schools merged to become the Wake County Public School System, now the largest school system in the state and 19th largest in the country.During the 1970s and 1980s, the I-440 beltline was constructed, easing traffic congestion and providing access to most major city roads.\nThe first Raleigh Convention Center (replaced in 2008) and Fayetteville Street Mall were both opened in 1977. Fayetteville Street was turned into a pedestrian-only street in an effort to help the then-ailing downtown area, but the plan was flawed and business declined for years to come. Fayetteville Street was reopened in 2007 as the main thoroughfare of Raleigh's downtown.The 1988 Raleigh tornado outbreak of November 28, 1988, was the most destructive of the seven tornadoes reported in Northeastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia between 1:00 AM and 5:45 AM. The Raleigh tornado produced over $77 million in damage, along with four fatalities (two in the city of Raleigh, and two in Nash County) and 154 injuries. The damage path from the storm was measured at 84 miles (135 km) long, and .5 miles (0.8 km) wide at times. The tornado was rated F4.In 1991, two large skyscrapers in Raleigh were completed, First Union Capitol Center and Two Hannover Square, along with the popular Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek in Southeast Raleigh.\nIn 1996, the Olympic Flame passed through Raleigh while on its way to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Also in 1996, Hurricane Fran struck the area, causing massive flooding and extensive structural damage. In addition, WRAL-TV became the first High-Definition broadcast station in the world.\nIn 1997, the National Hockey League's Hartford Whalers announced their intention to move to Raleigh as the Carolina Hurricanes, becoming the city's first major league professional sports franchise.\nIn 1999, the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (later renamed the RBC Center and now called PNC Arena), opened to provide a home for the Hurricanes and the NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team, as well as an up-to-date major concert venue.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Raleigh was featured prominently in a number of \"Top 10 Lists\", including those by Forbes, MSNBC and Money magazine, due to its quality of life and favorable business climate.In 2001, the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium complex was expanded with the addition of the Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts, Meymandi Concert Hall, Fletcher Opera Theater, Kennedy Theatre, Betty Ray McCain Gallery and Lichtin Plaza.Fayetteville Street reopened to vehicular traffic in 2006. A variety of downtown building projects began around this time including the 34-story RBC Bank Tower, multiple condominium projects and several new restaurants. Additional skyscrapers are in the proposal/planning phase.\nIn 2006, the city's NHL franchise, the Carolina Hurricanes, won the Stanley Cup, North Carolina's first and only professional sports championship.\nWith the opening of parts of I-540 from 2005 to 2007, a new 70-mile (110 km) loop around Wake County, traffic congestion eased somewhat in the North Raleigh area. Completion of the entire loop is expected to take another 15 years.\nIn 2008, the city's Fayetteville Street Historic District joined the National Register of Historic Places.\nIn September 2010, Raleigh hosted the inaugural Hopscotch Music Festival.\nIn January 2011, Raleigh hosted the National Hockey League All-Star Game.\nIn April 2011, a devastating EF-3 tornado hit Raleigh, and many other tornadoes touched down in the state (ultimately the largest, but not the strongest outbreak to ever hit the state), killing 24 people. The tornado tracked northeast through parts of Downtown, East Central Raleigh and Northeast Raleigh and produced $115 million in damages in Wake County. There were 4 fatalities in the city.In September 2015 Holy Trinity Anglican Church was opened; the first church to be built in downtown Raleigh since 1958.On July 26, 2017 the Catholic Diocese of Raleigh dedicated its new cathedral, Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral, the fifth-largest in the United States.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Raleigh occupies a total area of 144.0 square miles (373.0 km2), of which 142 square miles (369 km2) is land and 0.97 square miles (2.5 km2), or 0.76%, is covered by water. The Neuse River flows through the northeast end of the city.\nRaleigh is located in the northeast central region of North Carolina, where the Piedmont and Atlantic Coastal Plain regions meet. This area is known as the \"fall line\" because it marks the elevation inland at which waterfalls begin to appear in creeks and rivers. As a result, most of Raleigh features gently rolling hills that slope eastward toward the state's flat coastal plain. Its central Piedmont location situates Raleigh about two hours west of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, by car and four hours east of the Great Smoky Mountains. The city is 170 miles (270 km) south of Richmond, Virginia, 278 miles (447 km) south of Washington, D.C., and 166 miles (267 km) northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina. A small portion of the city is located in Durham County.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nRaleigh is divided into several major geographic areas, each of which use a Raleigh address and a ZIP code that begins with the digits 276. PNC Plaza, formerly known as RBC Plaza, is the largest and tallest skyscraper in the city of Raleigh. The tower rises to a height of 538 feet (164 m), with a floor count of 34.\n\n\n==== Downtown and inside-the-beltline neighborhoods ====\n\nThe downtown area is home to historic buildings such as the Sir Walter Raleigh Hotel built in the early 20th century, the restored City Market, the Fayetteville Street downtown business district, which includes the PNC Plaza and Wells Fargo Capitol Center buildings, as well as the North Carolina Museum of History, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, North Carolina State Capitol, William Peace University, the City of Raleigh Museum, Raleigh Convention Center, Shaw University, Campbell University School of Law, and St. Augustine's College. In the 2000s, an effort by the Downtown Raleigh Alliance was made to separate this area of the city into five smaller districts: Fayetteville Street, Moore Square, Glenwood South, Warehouse (Raleigh), and Capital District (Raleigh). Some of the names have become common place among locals such as the Warehouse, Fayetteville Street, and Glenwood South Districts.\nThe Inside the Beltline neighborhoods include Cameron Park, Boylan Heights, Country Club Hills, Coley Forest, Five Points, Budleigh, Glenwood-Brooklyn, Hayes Barton Historic District, Moore Square, Mordecai (home to the historic Mordecai House), Rochester Heights, South Park, Rosengarten Park, Belvidere Park, Woodcrest, Oberlin Village, and Historic Oakwood. Inside the Beltline refers to I-440 which used to be called the Beltline before being re-branded to ease driver navigation. These neighborhoods were typically built before World War II.\n\n\n==== Midtown Raleigh ====\n\nMidtown Raleigh is a residential and commercial area just North of the I-440 Beltline and is part of North Raleigh. It is roughly framed by Glenwood/Creedmoor Road to the West, Wake Forest Road to the East, and Millbrook Road to the North. It includes shopping centers such as North Hills and Crabtree Valley Mall. It also includes North Hills Park and part of the Raleigh Greenway System. The term was coined by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, developer John Kane and planning director Mitchell Silver. The News & Observer newspaper started using the term for marketing purposes only. The Midtown Raleigh Alliance was founded on July 25, 2011 as a way for community leaders to promote the area.\n\n\n==== East Raleigh ====\nEast Raleigh is situated roughly from Capital Boulevard near the I-440 beltline to New Hope Road. Most of East Raleigh's development is along primary corridors such as U.S. 1 (Capital Boulevard), New Bern Avenue, Poole Road, Buffaloe Road, and New Hope Road. Neighborhoods in East Raleigh include Hedingham, Longview, Lockwood, Madonna Acres, New Hope, Thompson-Hunter and Wilder's Grove. The area is bordered to the east by the town of Knightdale.\n\n\n==== West Raleigh ====\n\nWest Raleigh lies along Hillsborough Street and Western Boulevard. The area is bordered to the west by suburban Cary. It is home to North Carolina State University, Meredith College, Pullen Park, Pullen Memorial Baptist Church, the Islamic Association of Raleigh, Cameron Village, Lake Johnson, the North Carolina Museum of Art and historic Saint Mary's School. Primary thoroughfares serving West Raleigh, in addition to Hillsborough Street, are Avent Ferry Road, Blue Ridge Road, and Western Boulevard. The PNC Arena is also located here adjacent to the North Carolina State Fairgrounds. These are located approximately 2 miles from Rex Hospital.\n\n\n==== North Raleigh ====\nNorth Raleigh is an expansive, diverse, and fast-growing suburban area of the city that is home to established neighborhoods to the south along with many newly built subdivisions and along its northern fringes. The area generally falls North of Millbrook Road. It is primarily suburban with large shopping areas. Primary neighborhoods and subdivisions in North Raleigh include Bartons Creek Bluffs, Bedford, Bent Tree, Black Horse Run, Brier Creek, Brookhaven, Coachman's Trail, Crossgate, Crosswinds, Dominion Park, Durant Trails, Ethan's Glenn, Falls River, Greystone Village, Harrington Grove, Hidden Valley, Lake Park, Long Lake, North Haven, North Ridge, Oakcroft, Shannon Woods, Six Forks Station, Springdale Estates, Stonebridge, Stone Creek, Stonehenge, Summerfield, Valley Estates, Wakefield, Weathersfield, Windsor Forest, and Wood Valley. The area is served by a number of primary transportation corridors including Glenwood Avenue U.S. Route 70, Interstate 540, Wake Forest Road, Millbrook Road, Lynn Road, Six Forks Road, Spring Forest Road, Creedmoor Road, Leesville Road, Norwood Road, Strickland Road, and North Hills Drive.\n\n\n==== South Raleigh ====\nSouth Raleigh is located along U.S. 401 south toward Fuquay-Varina and along US 70 into suburban Garner. This area is the least developed and least dense area of Raleigh (much of the area lies within the Swift Creek watershed district, where development regulations limit housing densities and construction). The area is bordered to the west by Cary, to the east by Garner, to the southwest by Holly Springs and the southeast by Fuquay-Varina. Neighborhoods in South Raleigh include Eagle Creek, Renaissance Park, Lake Wheeler, Swift Creek, Carolina Pines, Rhamkatte, Riverbrooke, and Enchanted Oaks.\n\n\n==== Southeast Raleigh ====\nSoutheast Raleigh is bounded by downtown on the west, Garner on the southwest, and rural Wake County to the southeast. The area includes areas along Rock Quarry Road, Poole Road, and New Bern Avenue. Primary neighborhoods include Chastain, Chavis Heights, Raleigh Country Club, Southgate, Kingwood Forest, Rochester Heights, Emerald Village and Biltmore Hills. Coastal Credit Union Music Park (formerly Time Warner Cable Music Pavilion, Alltel Pavilion and Walnut Creek Amphitheatre) is one of the region's major outdoor concert venues and is located on Rock Quarry Road. Shaw University is located in this part of the city.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike much of the southeastern United States, Raleigh has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa). Winters are short and generally cool, with a normal January daily mean temperature of 41.0 \u00b0F (5.0 \u00b0C). On average, there are 69 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 2.7 days that fail to rise above freezing. Raleigh receives an average annual rainfall of 43.34 inches (110.1 cm). Annual and monthly (temperature and) precipitation data are in chart below. April is the driest month, with an average of 2.92 inches (74.2 mm) of precipitation. Precipitation is well distributed around the year, with a slight maximum between July and September; on average, July is the wettest month, owing to generally frequent, sometimes heavy, showers and thunderstorms. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of 80.0 \u00b0F (26.7 \u00b0C). There are 48 days per year with highs at or above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C). Autumn is similar to spring overall but has fewer days of rainfall, but greater potential for extremely heavy rainfall in a one/two day period, owing to occasional threat from tropical weather systems (hurricanes and tropical storms) packing torrential rainfall. In September 1999, Raleigh recorded its wettest month ever, with over 21 inches of rain, due to torrential rainfall from tropical weather systems, most notably Hurricane Floyd on September 15\u201316. Extremes in temperature have ranged from \u22129 \u00b0F (\u221223 \u00b0C) on January 21, 1985 up to 105 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C), most recently on June 29\u201330 and July 8, 2012. Raleigh falls in USDA hardiness zones 7b (5 \u00b0F to 10 \u00b0F) and 8a (10 \u00b0F to 15 \u00b0F).Raleigh receives an average of 6.0 inches (15.2 cm) of snow in winter. Freezing rain and sleet also occur most winters, and occasionally the area experiences a major damaging ice storm. On January 24\u201325, 2000, Raleigh received its greatest snowfall from a single storm \u2013 20.3 inches (52 cm) \u2013 the Winter Storm of January 2000. Storms of this magnitude are generally the result of cold air damming that affects the city due to its proximity to the Appalachian Mountains.  Winter storms have caused traffic problems in the past as well.\nThe region also experiences occasional periods of drought, during which the city sometimes has restricted water use by residents. During the late summer and early fall, Raleigh can experience hurricanes. In 1996, Hurricane Fran caused severe damage in the Raleigh area, mostly from falling trees. Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd in September 1999 were primary contributors to that month's extreme rainfall of over 21 inches. The most recent hurricane to have a considerable effect on the area was Hurricane Florence in 2018. Tornadoes also have on occasion affected the city of Raleigh, most notably the November 28, 1988 tornado which occurred in the early morning hours and rated an F4 on the Fujita Tornado Scale and affected northwestern portions of the city. There also was the April 16, 2011 EF3 tornado, which affected portions of downtown and northeast Raleigh and the suburb of Holly Springs.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the 2010 Census, the racial composition of the city was: 57.5% White (53.3% non-Hispanic white), 29.3% Black or African American, 4.3% Asian American (1.2% Indian, 0.8% Chinese, 0.7% Vietnamese, 0.5% Korean, 0.4% Filipino, 0.1% Japanese), 2.6% two or more races, 1.4% some other race, 0.5% Native American, and <0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific IslanderIn addition, 11.4% of city residents were Hispanic or Latino Americans, of any race (5.9% Mexican, 1.1% Puerto Rican, 0.9% Salvadoran, 0.6% Dominican, 0.6% Honduran, 0.3% Colombian, 0.3% Cuban, 0.2% Guatemalan, 0.2% Spanish, 0.2% Peruvian, 0.1% Venezuelan, 0.1% Ecuadorian, 0.1% Argentine, 0.1% Panamanian).\nAs of the 2000 United States census, there were 276,093 persons (July 2008 estimate was 380,173) and 61,371 families residing in Raleigh.

The airport offers service to more than 35 domestic and international destinations and serves approximately 10 million passengers a year. The airport also offers facilities for cargo and general aviation. The airport authority tripled the size of its Terminal 2 (formerly Terminal C) in January 2011.\nPrivate Airport.Private general aviation airports in Raleigh include Triple W Airport (ICAO: K5W5, FAA LID: 5W5).\n\n\n==== Freeways and primary designated routes ====\n\n\n===== Interstate Highways =====\nI-40 traverses the southern part of the city, connecting Raleigh to Durham and Chapel Hill toward the west, and coastal Wilmington, North Carolina to the southeast.\nI-440, Also known locally as the Raleigh Beltline, it makes a loop around the central part of the city. The I-440 route labeling formerly encompassed the entire loop around the city, co-numbered though South Raleigh with I-40. In 2002, the NCDOT removed the I-440 designation from the co-numbered I-40 (southern and southwestern) sections of the loop, and the directional signage on the remaining I-440 portion was changed from Inner/Outer to East/West. The route designation changes were made to avoid driver confusion over the Inner/Outer designations, especially with Raleigh's new \"Outer Beltline\", as I-540 has become known.\nI-540/NC 540 is currently under development.\nI-87, designated September 5, 2017, follows the former route of Interstate 495. It begins at the I-40/I-440 interchange southeast of Raleigh and runs east, meeting I-540 and terminating at Rolesville Road. It is entirely concurrent with US 64. When the route is completed it will link Raleigh to the Norfolk, Virginia area.\n\n\n====== Future ======\nInterstate 42 will begin at I-40 south of Raleigh and will follow US 70 to Morehead City.\n\n\n===== United States Highways =====\nU.S. Route 1 enters the city from the north along Capital Boulevard, joins I-440 around the west side of Raleigh, and leaves the city to the southwest as the US 1/US 64 expressway in Cary.\nU.S. Route 64 is the main east-west route through Raleigh; all segments share routes with another highway. East of the city, US-64/US-264 is known as the Knightdale Bypass. US 64 follows I-440 (as a wrong way concurrency) and I-40 along southern Raleigh, and US 1 to the southwest.  A former alignment, designated as Business US-64, follows New Bern Avenue from the I-440 Beltline to the eastern boundary of the city, where it continues into Knightdale.\nU.S. Route 70 runs roughly northwest-southeast through Raleigh. North of downtown, the route follows Glenwood Avenue into Durham. South of Raleigh, the route (along with US 401 and NC 50) follows South Saunders and South Wilmington Streets into Garner. Through downtown, US 70 uses small segments of several streets, including Wade Avenue, Capital Boulevard, Dawson, and McDowell Streets.\nU.S. Route 264 cosigned with US 64 through East Raleigh.\nU.S. Route 401 north of downtown Raleigh it follows Capital Boulevard and Louisburg Road. South of downtown it is cosigned with US 70 from Wade Avenue southward.\n\n\n===== North Carolina Highways =====\nN.C. Route 54 follows Chapel Hill Road and Hillsborough Street in West Raleigh. The route ends at its interchange with I-440.\nN.C. Route 50 is a north-south route through Raleigh. North of Raleigh it follows Creedmoor Road. NC 50 joins US 70 and later US 401 in downtown Raleigh. The three routes remain together through south Raleigh.\nN.C. Route 98, known as Durham Road in North Raleigh, traverses the extreme northern parts of the city.\n\n\n==== Intercity rail ====\n\nRaleigh's train station is one of Amtrak's busiest stops in the Southern U.S. The station is served by five passenger trains daily: the Silver Star, thrice-daily Piedmont service, and the Carolinian. Daily service is offered between Raleigh and:\n\nCharlotte, with intermediate stops including Cary, Durham, Burlington and Greensboro, North Carolina.\nNew York City, with intermediate stops including Richmond, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; and Philadelphia.\nMiami, with intermediate stops including Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia; as well as Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa, Florida.\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\nPublic transportation in and around Raleigh is provided by GoRaleigh, which operates 33 fixed bus routes, including the R-Line and the Wake-Forest Loop. Although there are 33 routes, some routes are designed to cover multiple other routes at times when they are not served. Depending on the time of the day, and the day of the week, the number of routes operating is between 5 and 29.\nRaleigh is also served by GoTriangle (known formerly as the Triangle Transit Authority, and Triangle Transit). GoTriangle offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, Cary and Chapel Hill, as well as to and from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Research Triangle Park and several of the region's larger suburban communities. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.\nNorth Carolina State University also maintains its own transit system, the Wolfline, that provides zero-fare bus service to the general public along multiple routes serving the university's campuses in southwest Raleigh.\nGovernment agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.\nFrom 1995 the cornerstone of Triangle Transit's long-term plan was a 28-mile rail corridor from northeast Raleigh, through downtown Raleigh, Cary, and Research Triangle Park, to Durham using DMU technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor 7 miles to Chapel Hill with light rail technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the Federal Transit Administration declined to fund the program due to low ridership projections.\nThe region's two metropolitan planning organizations appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.Greyhound Lines provides an inter-city bus service to Durham, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and other cities.\n\n\n==== Bicycle and pedestrian ====\nThe Maine-to-Florida U.S. Bicycle Route#1 routes through suburban Raleigh, along with N.C. Bicycle Route #2, the \"Mountains To Sea\" route. As of September 2010, maps and signage for both US Bike Route #1 and NC Bike Route #2 are out-of-date for the Raleigh area. N.C. Bicycle Route #5 is routed nearby, connecting Apex to Wilmington and closely paralleling the NCBC Randonneurs 600 kilometer brevet route.\nMost public buses are equipped with bicycle racks, and some roads have dedicated bicycle-only lanes. Bicyclists and pedestrians also may use Raleigh's extensive greenway system, with paths and trails located throughout the city.\nIn May 2011, Raleigh was designated a Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists at the Bronze level.\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Raleigh 36th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.\nIn 2002, the \"Walk [Your City]\" initiative was started in the city which provides a tool kit for neighborhood organizations to post signs giving a distance by bike or foot, with directions in scannable QR code. The movement has spread to more than 400 communities in 55 countries.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\nThe Raleigh Fire Department provides fire protection throughout the city. The North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women, the state's primary correctional facility housing female inmates is based in Raleigh.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nRaleigh has several sister cities:\n Xiangyang, Hubei, China\n Compi\u00e8gne, Oise, Hauts-de-France, France\n Kingston upon Hull, England, United Kingdom\n Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany\n Nairobi, Kenya\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of capitals in the United States\nList of municipalities in North Carolina\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Wake County, North Carolina\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nAmis, Moses N.

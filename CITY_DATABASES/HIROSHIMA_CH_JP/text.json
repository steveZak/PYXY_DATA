        "wiki": "The Hiroshima Peace Memorial (\u5e83\u5cf6\u5e73\u548c\u8a18\u5ff5\u7891, Hiroshima Heiwa Kinenhi), originally the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, and now commonly called the Genbaku Dome, Atomic Bomb Dome or A-Bomb Dome (\u539f\u7206\u30c9\u30fc\u30e0, Genbaku D\u014dmu), is part of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, Japan and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The ruin of the hall serves as a memorial to the over 140,000 people who were killed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Product Exhibition Hall building was originally designed by the Czech architect Jan Letzel. The design included a distinctive dome at the highest part of the building.  It was completed in April 1915 and was named the Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition (HMI). It was formally opened to the public in August that year. In 1921, the name was changed to the Hiroshima Prefectural Products Exhibition Hall, and again, in 1933, to the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall. The building was located in the large business district next to the Aioi Bridge and was primarily used for arts and educational exhibitions.\n\n\n== Atomic bombing ==\nAt 8:15 a.m. on 6 August 1945, the first atomic bomb to be used in war was dropped by the United States Army Air Forces from the Enola Gay, a B-29 bomber. The force of the atomic bomb effectively obliterated the city of Hiroshima, Japan.Earlier, on 25 July, General Carl Spaatz, commander of the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, received orders to deliver a \"special bomb\" attack on selected cities in Japan. The first target city chosen was Hiroshima, which had an important port on southern Honshu and was headquarters of the Japanese Second General Army with 40,000 military personnel in the city. The bomb was assembled in secret and loaded on the Enola Gay. It consisted of a uranium isotope 235 core shielded by hundreds of kilograms of lead. The bomb, code named \"Little Boy\", possessed a force equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT. The plane dropped Little Boy over the city at 8:15:17 a.m. local time on 6 August 1945. Within 43 seconds of being dropped, it detonated over the city, missing its target by 240 m (790 ft). Intended for the Aioi Bridge, the bomb instead exploded directly over the Shima Hospital, which was very near to the Genbaku Dome. Because the explosion was almost directly overhead, the building was able to retain its shape. The building's vertical columns were able to resist the nearly vertical downward force of the blast, and parts of the concrete and brick outer walls remained intact. The center of the blast occurred 150 m (490 ft) horizontally and 600 m (2,000 ft) vertically from the Dome.  Everyone inside the building was killed instantly.\n\n\n== Preservation ==\nThe building was the only structure left standing near the bomb\u2019s hypocenter. Soon commonly called the Genbaku (\"A-Bomb\") Dome, due to the exposed metal dome framework at its apex, the structure was scheduled to be demolished with the rest of the ruins, but the majority of the building was intact, delaying the demolition plans. The Dome became a subject of controversy, with some locals wanting it torn down, while others wanted to preserve it as a memorial of the bombing and a symbol of peace. Ultimately, when the reconstruction of Hiroshima began, the skeletal remains of the building were preserved.From 1950 through 1964, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was established around the Dome. The Hiroshima City Council adopted a resolution in 1966 on the permanent preservation of the Genbaku Dome, officially named the Hiroshima Peace Memorial (Genbaku Dome). The Dome continues to be the park\u2019s primary landmark.\n\nWeathering and deterioration of the Genbaku Dome continued in the post-war period. The Hiroshima City Council declared in 1966 that it intended to indefinitely preserve the structure, now termed \"Genbaku Dome\". The first popularly elected mayor of Hiroshima, Shinzo Hamai (1905\u20131968) sought funds for the preservation effort domestically and internationally. During one trip to Tokyo, Hamai resorted to collecting funds directly on the streets of the capital. Preservation work on the Genbaku Dome was completed in 1967. The Genbaku Dome has undergone two minor preservation projects to stabilize the ruin, notably between October 1989 and March 1990.The Genbaku Dome stands almost exactly as it did after the bombing on 6 August 1945.  Changes to the ruins, meant to ensure the stability of the structure, have been minimal.\n\n\n== UNESCO World Heritage Site ==\nIn December 1996, the Genbaku Dome was registered on the UNESCO World Heritage List based on the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. Its inclusion into the UNESCO list was based on its survival from a destructive force (atomic bomb), the first use of nuclear weapons on a human population, and its representation as a symbol of peace.Delegates to the World Heritage Committee from China and the United States had reservations regarding the confirmation of the memorial as a World Heritage Site. China cited the possibility that the monument could be used to downplay the fact that the victim countries of Japan's aggression suffered the greatest losses of life during the war, and the United States stated that having a memorial to a war site would omit the necessary historical context. The United States dissociated itself from the decision.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nHiroshima Witness\nKaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church\nTourism in Japan\nList of World Heritage Sites in Japan\nMullivaikal Memorial\nSrebrenica Genocide Memorial\nThe Ribbon International\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial page\nHiroshima Atomic Bomb Dome\nEntry on UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) website\nTrade Promotion Hall\nOfficial UNESCO page\nU.S. Attending 2010 Hiroshima Memorial   \u2013 video report by Democracy Now!\nHiroshima Peace Memorial webcam showing Atomic Bomb Dome.",

          "Any one who has been here and spent the time to walk the park and see the memorial and museum will tell you how powerful the experience is. I was nearly in tears watching the testimonies of those who survived. the strength of the Japanese character is fully on display. I",

          "Not knowing what to expect when we first arrived its hard to imagine how devastating it must have been for the 140.000 Japanese people who died when the atomic bomb was dropped on the 6th August 1945 in Hiroshima, unbelievable to think that this building would be still standing",

          "We have all seen the photos of the A Bomb done in Hiroshima but it is much more impactful to see this in person. The building is very near to the episode center of where the bomb was dropped and exploded.",
          "The reason this dome survived the bomb is because the bomb landed directly on the building. There was a debate for years whether it should remain or be demolished. Great decision to keep it. A stark reminder of who and what can get destroyed during wars .",
          "It is amazing to see this structure which is still standing & is in the condition it was in when the bomb hit. A permanent reminder of the awful events at that time. Well worth a visit.",
          "What a miracle this building is still standing, particularly since nearly everything around it was flattened by the bomb on 6 August 1945. The outside walls and the metal framing of the dome survived the blast that happened nearly directly above the site. If you are able to",

          "The Japanese debated whether to demolish this building or keep it as a reminder of the horror they witnessed. They seem to have looked to the future in all other respects, but I think that they made the right for our sakes to keep this reminder present. Two tips - 1. There",
          "The whole area surrounding the Atomic Bomb Dome really must be visited on a trip to Hiroshima. There's a reason it's top of everyone's 'visit' list and it really speaks for itself. Nothing I write here would do it justice.",
          "This is the symbol of hypocentre of the first A-bomb in Hiroshima and the milestone of our memory in order to learn from our history.",
          "The Dome really leaves a lasting impression. To think that it was one of the very few structures to remain partially standing in Hiroshima is astonishing. It is really hard to comprehend how terrible the devastation was and how the people suffered. But I was inspired by the fact",
          "Catch the tour bus around the area, great way to see everything in Hiroshima and it is free with the JR pass",
          "After visiting the memorial peace museum walking past this reminds you that the events truly happened right here where you are standing.",

          "You can completly understand the need to forget and remember. The existence of this memorial is not something I feel entitled to comment on, I know for some it's a painful reminder of the horrors for some, and for others a reminder of what humanity must never repeat. It was",
          "A very humbling experience, especially if you know your history. Do not approach this area without first a very good understanding of the mindsets and feelings of the peoples of the time, not looking at it with today's blinded vision of history.",
          "It is frightening to be at a point where so many people unnecessarily have died through one single bomb",
          "When we were in Hiroshima we did look at the memorial from the other side of the river. And were taking deep thoughts there. Honestly I was very emotional when I was around this area. We did not have the urge to get closer, at least at this time it was not too crowded around",
          "An absolute must see after visiting the museum and the grounds of the park. Many different memorials to see. The A-dome is just unbelievable and really quite chilling.",

          "This was our first stop in this city. The sight is quite different in person. It takes your breath away to know that this survived the atomic bomb blast. It's very serene and yet very disturbing part of history. It helps us appreciate peace.",

          "well preserved site. The grounds and surrounding area have much historical value and worth visiting.",
          "Get up close and don't just see it from a distance or from the memorial park. Standing next to the structure and looking upabove the buildings, reminding myself that this is where the atomic bomb exploded, awaked some strong feelings.",
          "Main priority to visit when in Hiroshima, all the tourist there treated this place with respect, calm and quietly. The hypocenter just a few hundred meters from the dome. The museum also in the same area and need to walk for few hundred meters. It's easy to reach by tram with",

          "Atomic Bomb Dome which was completed in 1915, to be one of the buildings that survived from atomic bomb attack. This building was originally a Commercial Exhibition Hall and changed to the Industrial Promotion Hall in 1944. When the bomb was dropped all the people inside were",

          "This is a sobering reminder of the effects of the atomic bomb. It\u2019s amazing to think this building still remains. Best viewed from across the river in the peace park. The afternoon sun shines on it from this side for good photos in the afternoon.",
          "This is a must-go UNESCO site. Easily accessible with the city tour bus. Suggest take photos there during day and night separately ... different feelings. A great location for taking selfie is from across the river.",
          "A powerful reminder of the ugliness of war and hopefully a reminder to never let history repeat itself.",
          "The building is a very telling tragedy of what a Nuke can do 600m above the ground to burn and incineration that is caused to human and even buildings. I loved the way the people of Hiroshima take this as their duty to educate people on the consequences of this.",
          "Words cannot describe this historical artifact. You cannot leave this place without a touch of sadness. The Japanese government did the right thing by preserving this building.",
          "The Atomic Bomb Dome, nearby Peace Memorial and Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Museum are a must see while in Japan. While each country may have its own interpretation of WWII events and responsibilities, the world was forever changed by the atomic age. The devastation, lives, lost and",

          "This had been a famous office building in the city, and was devastated but not completely destroyed by the atomic bomb blast in 1945. It has been strengthened to maintain its current state as the ultimate reminder. From photographs, I'd always thought the dome was circular, but",
          "Its an iconic building and probably high on many travellers ''to do lists'' Glad I have been, but not really for the building itself. All around you will find peace emblems. People salute you with the peace sign which began with The Beatles. The Japanese are so apologetic for",
          "This is a must see when you're in Hiroshima or in Japan. The preservation is phenomenal and the story even more so.",
          "I am so glad they\u2019ve kept this shell of a building- it really adds so much to the story of Hiroshima.",
          "A \"must see\", but very humbling. World Heritage site preserved to commemorate the dropping of the bomb. The dome is iconic, but the most striking element is the rubble that's been left in situ. Thankfully the crowds are respectful.",
          "Go at night to see this iconic structure. The place is lit up with floodlights and gives off a different vibe at night. Take a good camera and you'll get some excellent photos. Also see if you can spot the cats that now make this their home darting about in the shadows.",
          "An absolute miracle that this building survived the Atom Bomb blast on August 6th 1945. It was the former Industrial Promotion Hall built in 1915 and every single person in it on the fateful morning when the bomb was dropped was killed instantly. It has been preserved to this",
          "So odd, selfie was not in my mind when visiting here. Respect in silence. A must see in Hiroshima, worth traveling from Osaka.",

          "To preserve the remnants of this Government Building, was the best way to illustrate the power and horror of nuclear warfare. It is a chastening thought that this devastation was caused by an early atomic bomb and that current devices are many times more powerful. The huge",
          "This is a sobering reminder of just how much power mankind unleashed when we learned to split the atom.",
          "This building is probably the most famous building in Hiroshima. This building was standing almost in the middle of the bomb and they left what is still standing after the attack. A place to remember and hoping that something like that will not happen anymore!!",
          "I did a day trip to Hiroshima from Osaka. It only takes an hour to travel the 200-300km between this two distant cities. There atomic bomb dome is an easy tram (streetcar) ride from Hiroshima station. You will know you have reached the station when tourists alight and you can",

          "We arrived to be greeted by a local who with a group of others were providing free tours which they do occasionally. The tour was extremely informative. This is a must location to visit.",
          "An experience not to be missed This structure has been tastefully presented for all the world to see, destruction we should never have to experience again. Our few hours here spent amongst hundreds of Japanese school children who are so well behaved and enjoyed communicating",

          "A reminder of the attack, this building left in tact after the bombing close to the bridge which was the original target. A poignant reminder",

          "Unless you have lived through a bombing you cannot imagine the destruction. Here you see the result of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. It was a monument to the ravages of war that I found very moving.",
          "Very interesting and amazing it\u2019s still standing. Visited after the museum and peace park and the whole thing was well worth the crowds of tourists and school children.",
          "You see the A-Dome as you get off the tram and cross the street. While the building is not large it has an immediate humbling and somber effect and you could see many people tearing up at the site. There are plaques in English explaining the building\u2019s significance but nothing",
          "This iconic building is in itself nothing much but it\u2019s instantly recognisable and gives you some idea of the destruction wrought on the city. It\u2019s been preserved as it was immediately after the bombing, including the rubble, and will remain that way as the most obvious reminder",
          "I was able to visit the dome area a few times over my 3 days nearby. A walk around the dome area at dawn was a very peaceful, meaningful experience. Also, the of the end of the day is a good time to visit too. During the day, the place buzzes with school groups.",
          "The human race is stupid. War and hatred thrive. This is a stark reminder that most people just want to live in a peaceful environment. This scene and scenes from the Nazi death camps shows what devastation war brings. This is a somber reminder of lives lost, especially",
          "We were dropped off at the Atomic Bomb Dome from the jump on jump off bus. When walking up you immediately feel sad, this is literally the last standing structure from the atomic bomb. It was quite heart wrenching as their were Japanese people sobbing as they were standing",
          "This is a highly visible and, dramatic example of the destructive force of the first atomic bomb used (against civilians) in world history. Certainly a must see after visiting the museum. One of the few structures / city features remaining after the destructive power of \"Little",
          "The remainder of a big hall shows how everything has been destroyed on 6th of August 1945. It marks the place where the a-bomb was dropped. 140.000 people were killed immediately. Seceral other monuments are present in the neighbourhood. Worth a visit",

          "What waste of life\u2019s young and old when the atomic explosion went off the park is awesome place to see the monument to children who died is with paper cranes made by the local school children and the museum is a must see to see the photos",
          "The memorial is free to view with informative information boards in multiple languages available. It is easily accessible from the Hiroshima streetcar network and can be viewed from a relatively short distance from all sides. Some of the efforts made to stabilise to structure",
          "This is just a stop on your way, but take a few minutes to contemplate. Its a terrific symbol of the potential horrors that await us if certain irresponsible people are allowed to get their way. View this image from several angles as you walk. It will stay with you.",
          "Amazing that the almost destroyed building has been secured for reminding visitors of the brutality of a war.",
          "It is a famous image, located next to the river and just across from the memorial park. At risk of collapse, you can just take photos.",

          "This building was a tiny insight in to what happened on the 6th August 1945 at 08:15. The shell is still intact and the rubble that fell is still where it fell. I felt incredibly overwhelmed at the thought of all the buildings and people that were destroyed. There is a lovely",

          "Visited Hiroshima on a day trip by bullet train from Kyoto and wasn't really sure what to expect. What I found was an unbelievably vibrant city that tells a story about the dropping of the atom bomb without any self pity or anger towards those responsible. The Atom Bomb Dome",
          "This building anchors one end of the Peace Park, and is a bit lost in the background of modern Hiroshima. We found the Peace Memorial Park and Museum to be more significant and memorable, but one must see the atomic bomb dome when in Hiroshima.",
          "Heartwrenching to see the building in it's aftermath. This building was directly in the path of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima",

          "This, along with the neighboring Peace Park, is a must-see for visitors to Hiroshima. It's an eerie monument to a horrific event. There are pictures and descriptions of what it was like before the bomb hit, and it is worth taking some time to contemplate.",
          "We traveled here with our ten year old son to see the dome, park and museum. I think this building had the biggest impact because of the man who came to speak to us who was a survivor. He has written books that are laid out on the curb by the Dome explanation board in several",

          "This remember anchor as a result of the A bom dropping on Hirosima is one of the most impressive existing icons of that event. Sitting on the othe site of the Motuyasakawa river, sitting on a bench with eyesite directly on that Dome building, one might contemplate on that event,",

          "The site of one of the most significant events in human history. There is not a lot to do here except soak in the somber and emotional feelings this place invokes. A must see. I loved it and it is worth watching a number of documentaries available on you tube about the dropping",
          "I guess it\u2019s more about what it symbolises rather than the structure that remains but I found it very moving and the view along from the peace gardens very cleverly thought through. If you visit Hiroshima you would visit.",

          "It's just unreal that this was still standing after the atomic bomb and still is standing today. Even in this condition it's a beautiful building surrounded by beautiful grounds in a growing and vibrant city. There's a plaque telling about the building in both Japanese and",

          "We were travelling around Japan and one of our friends had recommended that we visit this historic site, and we were so pleased he had recommended the trip. We travelled from Kyoto to Hiroshima on the superb Bullet Train - it was a beautiful day and it was such a poignant visit",
          "There are various plaques around this building which tell you the story of it and how the bomb affected the people working in it. The tourist bus stops right by this place and from here you can walk across the bridge to have a better view of the whole area. You are not allowed",

          "A good thing that this building, which was precisely under the center of the blast has been preserved in it's original state. It should remind future generations of the folly of war and what it does to people. Not that I am optimistic that it will prevent future wars....",

          "The Dome stands out next to the river, and in the background towering office buildings stand in contrast to what remains of the Dome. I walked around the entire structure to photograph the symbol of atomic power and the meaning of what took place on that day long ago. A sobering",

          "Such a famous sight, it's humbling to see up close. You think you know the general details about what happened in Hiroshima, but I found that visiting the museum first and finding out exactly what happened, before walking down to the Dome was a really good idea, as it meant the",
          "It was very moving to finally see something that I grew up reading and hearing about. Very much worth coming to see and to stop and think about it all. A piece of history and a lesson that we should all take note of and visit to get the full impact.",

          "Bizzare to even rate the experience, yet it is a site that any human being should visit if in Japan. It is a shakening experience.. but it teaches you something about humanity.. i think. We felt deeply touched by the solemn, respectful awareness shown by the citizens of",

          "We found our visit to the Atomic Bomb Dome both sobering and inspiring. Inspiring for the reason that the monument really is a stark reminder of the need for world peace. It was great to see so many school children visiting the site to learn of its history. A must see in",
          "This along with the museum which is located next door to each other are absolute musts for Hiroshima. A very symbolic structure that needs to be there and they have respected it very well",
          "We stepped off our coach in front of this monument and were frozen in time, for many years the Japanese were divided as to whether they should destroy the remains, the world is so grateful that they chose to keep it",
          "Of course this is a must see when you visit Hiroshima. It has been preserved to look exactly as it did on that terrible day in 1945. Incredibly moving to see in the middle of the newly built city.",
          "Well worth a visit. It evokes a real sense of awe. Just stand there and imagine what it would have been like.",
          "Visited the peace park where this ruin has been left after the Atomic Bomb. Very moving when you think that ordinary people died for the glory of the Emperor.",
          "When going to Japan you should definitely visit the \"Peace Park\" and the \"Atomic Bomb Dome\". Seeing the massive destruction and suffering makes you think about humanity again. A stounch reminder of the necessity of world peace and the universal human rights.",
          "Not here to judge whether it's right to use atomic weapon on Japan or not, it's a fact that it's being used and this is a piece to prove the pain and suffer brought to this city. It's iconic.",
          "Walking around the Hiroshima Peace Park was very sobering and standing by the Atomic Bomb Dome was very confronting. It is hard to imagine what the people of Hiroshima went through 75 years ago - what they wondered what had just happened to their city and to themselves. We must",
          "The Atomic Dome used to be an exhibition hall in the past. The atomic bomb dropped at very close proximity to the building and everyone inside was instantly killed. What remains now is the shell structure of the building which you could view by walking around it. It reminds us",
          "This building is what remains in Hiroshima from before the bomb. It is located inside the peace park and at few meters from the museum and the other monuments bomb related. Impossible to not look at it if you came at the park.",
          "This is the only structure still standing from before the A Bomb. As the bomb also exploded above this site it has been preserved and is unchanged since that terrible day. I would recommend seeing this tragic and important part of Japanese history",
          "Seeing the dome in the middle of this beautiful park and modern city really stands as a reminder to what the atomic bomb fall out must have been like.",
          "The carnage of mankind and the resilience as well, is what this monument exemplifies for me. You cannot truly appreciate it until you are there",
          "Visiting the atomic bomb dome is an experience I will never forget, it\u2019s good to see it preserved for future generations to see the horrors of the war. If you want to have an unforgettable experience I recommend visiting late at night when there are no crowds around and you",
          "This famous structure, which was originally built as the Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition Hall, is now a universal symbol of peace. Appropriately designated a World Heritage Site, it\u2019s still a wonder that this building was not totally obliterated on 6 August 1945",
          "Without much to read at the site, this building ruin stands as a silent reminder of the first atomic bombing. I am one of those war buffs that believes that the bombing was justified and necessary, but dragged my family here to witness the destruction of (atomic) war. Hiroshima",
          "Only remaining building from the infamous nuclear bomb and located just outside the peace memorial park, this is a sight to reflect. No particular hoopla (rightfully) around the site. Just a walking path to let you view what should not have been.",
          "It prevails an atmosphere of sadness and respect. The whole parc is well.preserved, with several spots dedicated to this tragic event and a museum. The memorial is the main building, but a better understanding of the past and the present and the path that led to the A-bomb",
          "it\u2019s supprising it survived the bomb and is thought provoking to stand and look at it. We were told they have restored it to make sure it does not deteriorate which is a good thing. It stands in a peaceful park and is a must visit.",
          "The only building, approximately 200 meters from the hypocenter, still standing after the explosion. It's in the middle of the town and it stands as a perfect remembering of the horror that happened there. You can walk around and look but you cannot go near or inside. The",

          "Located immediately adjacent to the Memorial Peace Park in Hiroshima this preserved ruin is the only building left from the aftermath of the Atomic bombing of 1945 . It stands as symbol of terrible tragedy and it is a moving experience simply to stand in front of it on your way",
          "Very peaceful. Not too many people. Very good experience. Walked along the river, and viewed the sadako monument. We sat along the river, to have lunch and vusuter Orizuru Tower for the best view, lots of venders near the park and slways a performance of some sort to be seen.",
          "Standing in front of the Dome, in silence, made me remember that atomic bomb can be so devastating, yet people forget it sometimes. Very peaceful, every visitors understand they're not suppose to make noises. The site was very well preserved with some plaques that explains the",
          "Very tranquil place which others have described quite well, can see the dome, peace memorial, bomb site, museum and other bombing associated sites in one visit. Can easily access the area by street car, several travel straight past the dome and is well sign posted. To see all",
          "Its difficult to describe what its like there buts something that you should make an effort to see. Hopfully there wont be another site like it",
          "This is a very sobering sight and one which I think our world leaders should visit. The Dome is in a park setting and easily reached by local tram.. A short walk away is the Museum and Children's Memorial.",
          "What a beautiful site that represents peace, everyone on our tour just took in the site with memories of what it would of been like back in 1945 when the A bomb was dropped. They have done a wonderful of job of maintaining this symbol of peace in a magnificent garden location.",
          "Its impossible to describe how we felt visiting this place because the atmosphere was very different. Everyone was quietly observing the war remains. This building is one of the few buildings that \"survived\" and still standing after the atomic bomb was dropped just nearby the",
          "This is an important memorial in Hiroshima. I am a History and had been here during high school but it was very important to come back as we were in Hiroshima. One of the few building a left standing after the bomb exploded since it was almost 600ft above this building that the",
          "A solemn site to visit, but at sunset, with some breeze, the park seems now at peace. You can look and take pictures and you will be awed and humbled. Everybody who visits will have their own thoughts.",
          "One of the main reasons we went to Hiroshima. The Dome is easy to find and the area easy to walk around. It is for free and a must-see when in Hiroshima.",
          "I went there in a hot and sunny day. But I couldn\u2019t hide up my sorrow. I told my little Daugther why the roof top being destroyed and told her the cruelty of war. A good lesson to her, a good lesson to human beings. \u2026",
          "I visited the museum just before closing time, 6:30pm and afterwards made my way to the Bomb Dome walking through the Peace Park. The sunset was out and simply breathtaking with the hues of the sky in orange, purple, pink and red. Simply fitting for such a memorable and awe",
          "Very , very sad to see that and the extensive damage of the city of hiroshima when the US used the first nuclear bomb in 19456",
          "There is something about the imaginary green softness of the curvature of the domed roof set against the now gaping windows and exposed walls that drives home the brutal reality of what happened here on August 6th 1945. You stare at it from near, from afar, from across the river",
          "This dome and the museum near it have so much to tell about the horrific past. It has the capacity to move you and even bring tears to your eyes.",
          "What a monument to the travesty and pain and suffering of a nation and its people. Saving this building at the core of the City as a reminder was brilliant.",
          "This is the haunting icon that people know in Hiroshima. It is a place to reflect and ponder. You wonder how and why this building survived. It is impressive and the light at various times of day gives a different aspect.",
          "a structure remained standing just a hundred meters from its hypocenter: the Genbaku Dome, also known as the Atomic Bomb Dome. A building, made in the purest European style, which is 25 meters high. Although it seems a miracle, the fact is that the mysterious building that",
          "I was amazed at how many children could die innocent. Sad because the human race has done so! . Hope.....",
          "To be preserved forever as a reminder of the power an atomic blast has and to never see this happen again",
          "This is of course a historical monument, just a little spoiling with big new buildings so close in. It was best to visit this in the evening when it is lighted up. It is a must see if you go to Hiroshima.",
          "It is remarkable to see how devastating the initial blast was. We read the literature on the bombing and how much damage was caused, but seeing the aftermath in pictures and in real physical form are far different. A worthy reminder of the terrible consequences of war.",
          "The area is beautiful. Not to lessen the area but it is like going to the Alamo. You see the aftermath in pictures and when you get there there is a big city that is built up all around it. The Japanese people are very gracious to share this with the world.",
          "Its important we constantly remember what harm a terrific incident can cause to humanity. Hence must visit place for all of us.",
          "If you\u2019re in Hiroshima you simply must visit the remains of the atomic bomb dome. To see what has been left is thought provoking and harrowing at the same time. You can walk along the river towards the peace park and museum from here - it\u2019s a lovely walk and will give you time",
          "Nothing much to say, just come visit to see, feel. Less than 30 mins reach from hiroshima station by tram. Calm place alongside ota river. The dome is well deserved. Peace.",
          "The Hiroshima peace dome is what was left standing after the atomic bomb detonated about 600 m above the building which was the Hiroshima exhibition building. The locals decided to keep it as a reminder of man\u2019s folly and the futility of war. It is a must see when in Hiroshima",
          "Definitely worth visiting, if nothing but to think about what happening to Hiroshima many years ago. Quiet, reflective, and a beautiful river juxtaposed the horror that happened at this very point.",
          "There is no activity, just silence. You stare and think about what happened. There is a plaque telling you who was in there. It's a beautiful building standing for future peace. I've visited it twice now just to stare and think.",
          "Such destruction of such a bomb just takes your breath away. It's great that they keep the building in exact the state as directly after the explosion. I can recommend the museum nearby as well!",
          "You\u2019re in a place where at least 130 000 people lost their lives 73 years ago. Especially on Peace day it was a very powerful place to stand and ponder the what-ifs of the world. Can\u2019t come here without visiting",
          "Seeing the Atomic Bomb Dome stops you in your tracks. The ruins remind you of humanity's capacity for evil. It just breaks your heart. A must-see for the nuclear powers of the world, particularly North Korea - no more nuclear weapons!",
          "I think it is one of the most important for us to visit in Hiroshima and we shouldn't miss it when we go to Hiroshima. We should never forget the history of it. It is very easy to go by the street tram.",
          "It's hard to miss the one building that remains as it was after the A-bomb was dropped over Hiroshima if you are in the locality of the pace garden and museum. It's also hard to score something so emotionally evocative as 'excellent' as if it was a tawdry tourist attraction when",
          "Being on this historic place is very overwhelming and sad, but everyone should go at least once in a lifetime.",
          "Many people come to see it, some out of curiosity, some to pay respects. It is very moving, and the most known structure in Hiroshima.",
          "This dome is a quick stop on the way to the museum. It\u2019s free, you can walk 360 degrees around the dome. While we were there we had a lovely elderly Japanese gentleman tell us a few interesting facts about the dome. You can read those same facts at the Peace Museum. It\u2019s",
          "This is a \"MUST visit\" to anyone visiting Japan. It is really a truly moving experience. The place is quiet, with a large park and has a very graphic information centre.",
          "There is not much to it, a ruined building standing in a green lawn, behind a fence. It doesn't take long to look at it, but it does to long to comprehend what it stands for. Built when Japan was open to the World, destroyed when Japan was fighting the World in an act of",
          "A truly important place to visit if you're in Hiroshima. It's a genuine way to experience the heart of the city's history. It's a thoughtful dose of reality while travelling a surreal & beautiful country. A free thing to do in the city, but a priceless experience!",
          "When I got to Hiroshima i was not really emotionally ready for the sights I saw. This structure is the only remaining structure of the devastation of the bomb. It is about 2 blocks away from the epicenter and yet it was totally blown open. The wind carried the effects of the",
          "When we first set eyes on the dome it was very clear the devistation that took place in August 1945 I feel for the people of Hiroshima. On a happy note a good site to visit for young and old easy access we traveled by street car from Hiroshima station to the site some 20 minutes",
          "We planned a day visit to Hiroshima and as soon as we reached, could sense the emotions in every single word written all over that place. As soon as you start reading the plaques, it just fills up ones heart and eyes. Shows the level of pain, fear, and cruelty human species can",
          "I always wanted to visit Hiroshima as I knew what happened during WWII. Nothing can really prepare you though for what you see, the damage that Atomic bomb caused was simply catastrophic. It\u2019s an eerie reminder that something like this should never happen again.",
          "Being in Hiroshima is very poignant, no place more than the Atomic Bomb Dome. And while one can\u2019t say you \u2018enjoyed\u2019 seeing it, I am glad we came here and I am glad we visited the dome.",
          "We have all seen the picture of the Genbaku-domu, as it is called in Japanese, standing among the rubble of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. The building is left as it was on that day; even the loose bricks are still there. I have been here several times, and there is usually a",
          "This is a historic event area and preserve to remembrance. Very eerie looks and you can studies their histories around the dome.",
          "There are no words to describe the Atomic Bomb Dome. Just looking at the remains of the structure says it all.",
          "Very haunting and somber area with the bomb detonating 600m ( I believe) above this building. It still stands and is a testament to the ills and proudness of humanity. Tons of flowers everywhere which gives a beautiful contrast to the ills of the war.",

          "Atomic Bomb Done has to be on your list of place to visit while in Hiroshima. Its a place which has historical importance for what a nuclear bomb can do to destroy civilization. We been reading about this since childhood and to see it first hand was an experience which cannot be",
          "One of the reasons for visiting Hiroshima was to see this part of history. It is amazing that this building is still standing bearing it mind its location at \"ground zero\" and that everything else around it was flattened. It really brings home to you the futility of war and we",
          "The dome and ground-zero are a \u201cmust do\u201d if you are in Hiroshima. You can see photos of the dome a million times in books and TV but when you see it in person, up close, the loss of life and tragedy of that day begins to sink in. We stopped at the museum first which was helpful",
          "Stark but critically important. Start your visit here and wander around the periphery of the building. The shuttle bus 'Meripura-pu' stops here. Nice 15 min visit - views of he river here and of the local feeding birds. Some nice photo opportunities. Near to near (2 min walk)",

          "The Atomic Bomb dome is visible from all directions as you enter the Peace Park. You need to walk around the building and imagine what it was like that fateful day. Structural supports have been added to part of the building to keep it from imploding but much of the original",
          "The dome is the only building that survived (or almost did!) the atomic explosion towards the end of WWII. The skeleton of the previous building, it is a reminder of the devastating effect of an atomic bomb. The serenity of the surrounding park offers a stark contrast with this",
          "Good for education for yourself and children. Each landmark has their own information to get more understanding",

          "Went there in the evening since I read that it is open at night. Standing in the midst of a park, this Atomic Bomb Dome is adequately lit at night. The views beside the \"lake\" is somber, considering what went on here. Yes, checking out this place at night is possible although",
          "It's such a relevant piece of our history and I'm thankful to have visited this site and city. I also value the theme in Hiroshima of encouraging world peace. It's truly a powerful and emotional place to visit.",
          "It's truly remarkable that this structure withstood the A-bomb. To think you are standing on the spot the bomb was dropped.",
          "Yes, this is the one building that remained (somewhat) standing so it's an important symbol but if you want to learn about that day and about atomic bombs in general, go to the nearby Peace Museum. The dome is basically like visiting a gravesite--it's symbolically important but",
          "You really need to see this. There is a strange aura around this building, the air was very heavy for me. It's a very strange experience looking upon and standing beside such a sight. It's situated next to the beautiful peace park and a serene river.",
          "Its hard to express the deep sadness that the bomb dome inspires in person. The fact that you can get right up close means you can see the individual scars on the building in a way that makes it hard to ignore the sad history of Hiroshima, despite the renewal that surrounds the",

          "It isn't until you see it with your own eyes that you realize the impact of an atomic bomb. The bomb exploded hundreds of meters above ground, yet, the impact was enormous. Seeing the Atomic Bomb Dome had a much bigger impact on my view on WWII than anything I have seen on TV."

          "A great amount of effort has been put in this war monument. The park itself is also very peaceful to walk in.",

It is a short walk from the Peace Park and there are a number of places to stop for a break, food and drinks. There are also a number of volunteers around to ask questions.",
          "A piece of history but they did not really depict what caused this sad event to happen. Innocent lives including their own and worldwide were lost due to greed.",
          "Powerful symbol of the atomic explosion of 1945. Busy but with space to move around and   take in all the information provided. Very close to the Peace Park amd museum.",

          "A definite visit in Hiroshima. Recommend to read up on this or visit the museum to gain a true harsh understanding of the history and what this building still standing today represents - like a time capsule of the horrific events of that day in Hiroshima. A beautiful park surrounds it,  it is very very serene.",
          "Hiroshima, is quiet and respectful you will learn a lot about the dreadful happenings here. Sad and thought provoking",
          "A must see on your visit, perhaps the only area that is. Man's violence is on show here. It is very tranquil now. We as a group had our 2 minutes silence here today, a very moving experience.",

          "Don't read about it, just go and discover the horrors of war... It is one of the most shocking experience I have ever had. I do recommend you go first to the Peace Museum and see the Dome for the first time in one of the museum's \u2026",

          "A reminder that war is not the solution . Makes you think",

          "Very important historical place we all need to visit this place.",
          "This dome survived the A bomb in terms of atmospheric value because the copper roof melted and fell through so the pressure was equalised. It was not torn down to make way for new buildings because enough people thought it was important for \u2026",
          "Very sombre place. Makes you see how mean we can be to each other.",
          "Impressive, emotional, meaningful. It's pretty daunting and hypnotizing. Try to find the old man who sits around there who is a survivor of the bomb.

It\u2018s a building where a lot of memories are stores.\nIt\u2018s also place to get cute selfies and hang out with friend apparently.\nWe should honor the dead, for whazever reasons they died and no matter who is at fault.

          "As you are walking down the street, and are sitting next to the river, this relaxing and peaceful picture could be misleading for the horrors that have happened here - the Dome was almost right under the A-bomb when it exploded, which saved \u2026",

          "A great reminder of the time when the bomb was dropped. This building has been preserved to it's destructed appearance as a grim reminder of Aug 6, 1945.

        "wiki": "Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park (\u5e83\u5cf6\u5e73\u548c\u8a18\u5ff5\u516c\u5712, Hiroshima Heiwa Kinen K\u014den) is a memorial park in the center of Hiroshima, Japan. It is dedicated to the legacy of Hiroshima as the first city in the world to suffer a nuclear attack, and to the memories of the bomb's direct and indirect victims (of whom there may have been as many as 140,000). The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park is visited by more than one million people each year. The park is there in memory of the victims of the nuclear attack on August 6, 1945. On August 6, 1945 the US dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima Japan. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was planned and designed by the Japanese Architect Kenz\u014d Tange at Tange Lab.\nThe location of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was once the city\u2019s busiest downtown commercial and residential district. The park was built on an open field that was created by the explosion. Today there are a number of memorials and monuments, museums, and lecture halls, which draw over a million visitors annually. The annual 6 August Peace Memorial Ceremony, which is sponsored by the city of Hiroshima, is also held in the park. The purpose of the Peace Memorial Park is to not only memorialize the victims, but also to establish the memory of nuclear horrors and advocate world peace.\n\n\n== Notable symbols ==\n\n\n=== A-Bomb Dome ===\n\nThe A-Bomb Dome is the skeletal ruins of the former Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall. It is the building closest to the hypocenter of the nuclear bomb that remained at least partially standing. It was left how it was after the bombing in memory of the casualties. The A-Bomb Dome, to which a sense of sacredness and transcendence has been attributed, is situated in a distant ceremonial view that is visible from the Peace Memorial Park\u2019s central cenotaph. It is an officially designated site of memory for the nation\u2019s and humanity\u2019s collectively shared heritage of catastrophe. The A-Bomb Dome was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List on December 7, 1996. Many A-Bomb survivors and Hiroshima citizens were pushing for the A-Bomb Dome to be registered as a World Heritage Site as it was \"a symbol of horror and nuclear weapons and humankind's pledge for peace.\"\n This collective petition from many citizens groups was finally given influence when the Japanese government officially recommended the dome to the World Heritage Site committee in December 1995. A marker was placed on the A-Bomb Dome on April 25, 1997 by Hiroshima City. It reads:\n\nAs a historical witness that conveys the tragedy of suffering the first atomic bomb in human history and as a symbol that vows to faithfully seek the abolition of nuclear weapons and everlasting world peace, Genbaku Dome was added to the World Heritage List in accordance with the \"Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage (World Heritage Convention).\"\nDecember 7, 1996, Hiroshima City\n\n\n=== Children's Peace Monument ===\n\nThe Children's Peace Monument is a statue dedicated to the memory of the children who died as a result of the bombing. The statue is of a girl with outstretched arms with a folded paper crane rising above her. The statue is based on the true story of Sadako Sasaki (\u4f50\u3005\u6728\u798e\u5b50, Sasaki Sadako), a young girl who died from radiation from the bomb. She is known for folding over 1,000 paper cranes in response to a Japanese legend. To this day, people (mostly children) from around the world fold cranes and send them to Hiroshima where they are placed near the statue. The statue has a continuously replenished collection of folded cranes nearby.\n\n\n=== Rest House ===\nThe Rest House of Hiroshima Peace Park is another atomic bombed building in the park. The building was built as the Taishoya Kimono Shop in March 1929. It was used as a fuel distribution station when the shortage of fuel began in June 1944. On August 6, 1945, when the bomb exploded, the roof was crushed, the interior destroyed, and everything consumable burned except in the basement. Eventually, 36 people in the building died of the bombing; 47-year-old Eizo Nomura survived in the basement, which had a concrete roof through which radiation had a more difficult time penetrating. He survived into his 80s.The former Nakajima District, which today is Peace Memorial Park, was a prominent business quarter of the city during the early years of the Showa period (1926\u201389) and had been the site of many wooden two-story structures. However, in 1929, the three-story Taishoya Kimono Shop was constructed, surrounded by shops and movie theaters. It was said that if you went up to the roof, a panoramic view of the city awaited. In 1943 the Kimono Shop was closed and in June 1944, as World War II intensified and economic controls became increasingly stringent, the building was purchased by the Prefectural Fuel Rationing Union\nAt 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, the explosion of the atomic bomb about 600 meters above the hypocenter destroyed the building\u2019s concrete roof. The interior was also badly damaged and gutted by ensuing fires, and everyone inside was killed except Nomura, who miraculously survived. The building was restored soon after the war and used as the Fuel Hall. In 1957, the Hiroshima East Reconstruction Office, which became the core of the city\u2019s reconstruction program, was established there.\n\nAt the time of the bombing, 37 people were working there. All of them perished, with the exception of Eizo Nomura, who had gone down to the basement at that moment and survived the bombing. Nomura, who was then 47,  was a worker for the Hiroshima Prefectural Fuel Rationing Union. Nomura managed to escape through rising fire and vigorous smoke. However, after his survival, he struggled with high fever, diarrhea, bleeding gums, and other symptoms caused by the radiation.Although the building was heavily damaged, it stood still and was renovated soon after the war, including a new wooden roof. After the war, the Hiroshima municipal government purchased the building and established a postwar recovery office in it. Today it is used as the Rest House in Peace Memorial Park.\nThe Rest House has been in debates many times over whether or not it should be preserved. In 1995, the city decided to demolish the building, but the plan was put aside. One of the reasons was because of the announcement of the A-Bomb Dome as a World Heritage site.Right now, the first floor of the Rest House is used as a tourist information office and a souvenir shop, the second/third floors as offices, and the basement is preserved nearly as it was at the time of the bombing.\n\n\n== Ceremonies ==\n\n\n=== Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony ===\n\nEvery year on 6 August, \"A-Bomb Day,\" the City of Hiroshima holds the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony to console the victims of the atomic bombs and to pray for the realization of lasting world peace. The ceremony is held in the morning from 8:00, in front of the Memorial Cenotaph with many citizens including the families of the deceased. During the ceremony, a one-minute silence to honor the victims is observed at 8:15, the time of the atomic bomb's explosion.\n\n\n=== Lantern Ceremony ===\n\nIn the evening of the same day, Lantern ceremony is held to send off the spirits of the victims on lanterns with peace messages floating on the waters of the Motoyasu River.\n\n\n== Museums ==\n\n\n=== Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum ===\n\nThe Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum is the primary museum in the park dedicated to educating visitors about the bomb.\nThe Museum has exhibits and information covering the buildup to war, the role of Hiroshima in the war up to the bombing, and extensive information on the bombing and its effects, along with substantial memorabilia and pictures from the bombing.\nThe building also has views of the Memorial Cenotaph, Peace Flame, and A-Bomb Dome.\n\n\n=== International Conference Center Hiroshima ===\nInternational Conference Center Hiroshima is in the Peace Park, west side of the main building of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.\n\n\n=== Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall ===\n\nThe Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims is an effort by the Japanese national government to remember and mourn the sacred sacrifice of the atomic bomb victims. It is also an expression of Japan's desire for genuine and lasting peace. The Hall contains a number of displays. On the roof, near the entrance (the museum is underground) is a clock frozen at 8:15, the time the bomb went off. The museum contains a seminar room, library, temporary exhibition area, and victims' information area. The Hall of Remembrance, contains a 360 degree panorama of the destroyed Hiroshima recreated using 140,000 tiles \u2014 the number of people estimated to have died from the bomb by the end of 1945.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\n\n\n=== Memorial Cenotaph ===\nNear the center of the park is a concrete, saddle-shaped monument that covers a cenotaph holding the names of all of the people killed by the bomb. The monument is aligned to frame the Peace Flame and the A-Bomb Dome.\nThe Memorial Cenotaph was one of the first memorial monuments built on open field on August 6, 1952. \nThe arch shape represents a shelter for the souls of the victims.The cenotaph carries the epitaph \u5b89\u3089\u304b\u306b\u7720\u3063\u3066\u4e0b\u3055\u3044 \u904e\u3061\u306f \u7e70\u8fd4\u3057\u307e\u305b\u306c\u304b\u3089, which means \"please rest in peace, for [we/they] shall not repeat the error.\" In Japanese, the sentence's subject is omitted, thus it could be interpreted as either \"[we] shall not repeat the error\" or as \"[they] shall not repeat the error\". This was intended to memorialize the victims of Hiroshima without politicizing the issue, taking advantage of the fact that polite Japanese speech typically demands lexical ambiguity in the first place. The epitaph was written by Tadayoshi Saika, Professor of English Literature at Hiroshima University. He also provided the English translation, \"Let all the souls here rest in peace for we shall not repeat the evil.\" On November 3, 1983, an explanation plaque in English was added in order to convey Professor Saika's intent that \"we\" refers to \"all humanity\", not specifically the Japanese or Americans, and that the \"error\" is the \"evil of war\":\n\nThe inscription on the front panel offers a prayer for the peaceful repose of the victims and a pledge on behalf of all humanity never to repeat the evil of war. It expresses the spirit of Hiroshima \u2014 enduring grief, transcending hatred, pursuing harmony and prosperity for all, and yearning for genuine, lasting world peace.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the ambiguity of the phrase has the potential to offend; some right-wing circles in Japan have interpreted the words as an admission of guilt\u2014implicitly reading it as \"we (the Japanese people) shall not repeat the error\"\u2014and they criticize the epitaph as a self-accusation by the Japanese empire. In July 2005, the cenotaph was vandalized by a Japanese man affiliated with the Japanese right.\n\n\n=== Peace Flame ===\nThe Peace Flame is another monument to the victims of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, but it has an additional symbolic purpose.\nThe flame has burned continuously since it was lit in 1964, and will remain lit until all nuclear bombs on the planet are destroyed and the planet is free from the threat of nuclear annihilation.\n\n\n=== Peace Bells ===\nThere are three Peace Bells in the Peace Park. The smaller one is used only for the Peace Memorial Ceremony. Except that day, it is displayed in the east building of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. The more well-known Peace Bell stands near the Children's Peace Monument and consists of a large Japanese bell hanging inside a small open-sided structure. Visitors are encouraged to ring the bell for world peace and the loud and melodious tolling of this bell rings out regularly throughout the Peace Park. The Peace Bell was built out in the open on September 20, 1964. The surface of the bell is a map of the world, and the \"sweet spot\" is an atomic symbol, designed by Masahiko Katori [1899\u20131988], cast by Oigo Bell Works, in Takaoka, Toyama. The inscriptions on the bell are in Greek (\u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd), Japanese, and Sanskrit. It is translated as \"Know yourself.\" The Greek embassy donated the bell to the Peace Park and picked out the most appropriate ancient Greek philosophical quote of Socrates. The Sanskrit text is a quotation from Longer Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra which was attested by the Indian ambassador.  The Japanese text was provided by a university lecturer.\n\n\n=== Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound ===\nThe Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound is a large, grass-covered knoll that contains the cremated ashes of 70,000 unidentified victims of the bomb.\n\n\n=== Cenotaph for Korean Victims ===\nAmong the 400,000 people who were killed or exposed to lethal post-explosion radiation, at least 45,000 were Korean, but the number is uncertain, because the population has been neglected as the minority. Additionally, 300,000 survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki returned to Korea after liberation from Japanese colonialism. The monument, decorated with Korean national symbols, is intended to honour Korean victims and survivors of the atomic bomb and Japanese colonialism. The monument's inscription reads \"The Monument in Memory of the Korean Victims of the A[tomic]-Bomb. In memory of the souls of His Highness Prince Yi Wu and over 20000 other souls\", while the side-inscription reads \"Souls of the dead ride to heaven on the backs of turtles.\"\n\n\n=== Gates of Peace ===\nAdded in 2005, this monument contains ten gates covered with the word \"peace\" in 49 languages from around the world. The gates represent the nine circles of Hell plus one: \"the living hell of Hiroshima caused by the atomic bombing.\" Each gate is 9 meters high and 2.6 meters wide.\n\n\n=== Memorial Tower to the Mobilized Students ===\nThe Association for the Mobilized Student Victims of Hiroshima Prefecture built this tower in May 1967 in order to console the souls of over 10,000 students, including those who were Atomic Bomb victims, who died in bombings during the Pacific War. In Hiroshima, there were 8,387 students who were mobilized; 6,907 of which were killed in the Atomic Bombing. The memorial is twelve meters tall, five stories, and is decorated with the Goddess of Peace as well as eight doves which are placed around the tower. To the sides of the tower are plaques which depict the work that the students did, such as factory work, female students sewing, or showing students working to increase food production. There is a plaque in front of the tower which has two buttons that narrate the background information in either Japanese or English.\n\n\n=== Other monuments ===\nPond of Peace \u2013 encircling the Cenotaph\nPeace Clock Tower\nA-bombed Gravestone \u2013 gravestone of Jisenji temple \u2013 the temple used to be there\nPeace Fountain\nMonument to the Old Aioi Bridge\nPhoenix Trees Exposed to the A-bomb \u2013 also known as Chinese Parasols, these trees have deep scars from the blast.

          "Worth visiting. Every single exhibit tells you how precious your ordinary life is, and makes you think seriously about \"peace\". They say the Pope Francis is scheduled to visit there on Nov. 24 and due to that the opening hours of the museum will be changed. Please check out the",

          "After looking at the highly rated reviews on Tripadvisor I expected much more from this museum. For a start it was very crowded and difficult to read articles relating to the exhibits (there is an awful lot of reading in this museum) and secondly, to me, there was no mention of",
          "As a former teacher of young children, I had a very difficult time in the museum because a group of young children were being taken on a tour. These children were seven or eight years old. I am not quite sure why a group this young should be exposed to this. And they seemed",
          "Absolute must. The human impact of the nuclear bomb should be understood by everyone. I was moved to tears at several points. It can be very crowded so may be best to try a very early visit to avoid the crush. The history is fascinating and seemed balanced and thoughtful (but",
          "Busy but as with everything in japan it works. Very moving individual stories of destruction and survival. One perspective only of why it happened and no mention of 1935 onwards in China, Manchuria or elsewhere. Needs to be seen",
          "This was a very moving and emotional visit. Important to see, I believe, to help us all understand. The presentation of the city of Hiroshima before and after the bombing is in the first room and it really makes an impact. The museum displays all kinds of artifacts and",
          "We visited the memorial and must say it was very moving and I was surprised by how much it hit me. I think the Japanese have presented a very good account of what happened in a way that asks the world to remember these horrific events, but in a way that we learn rather than",
          "This is an amazing museum devoted to the bombing of Hiroshima The displays and photos are graphic Perhaps I am a cynic but there seems to be poor us and we are now trying for world peace They forget they started it and they were warned",
          "Although the museum itself is great and very educational, the amount of people let in at the same time completely ruined the experience for us. In addition to at least 5 or 6 different school groups, there were so many people in there it created a jam and we actually got stuck",
          "Worth the time to visit, easy to find, with the exhibits well documented and researched. Allow 1-2 hours, easy stroll around peace park. Plenty of areas to rest and eat nearby. Can also catch ferry to Miyajima Island.",
          "Very important and beautifully made Museum. Pictures, stories, horrors of war. Not an easy place and not recommended for young kids. Personally, I think they should have started the story telling from WW2 but anyway this is the most important stop on Hiroshima.",
          "This museum is a harrowing experience. It is about the effectof the A bomb. It is seen through the personal impact on people's lives, their families and the longer term impact on individuals and their families. Seen from this perspective the museum is excellent in achieving what",
          "Very interesting place to visit which obviously goes into great detail regarding the dropping of the bomb in 1945. I must say I learned a few things that I wasn\u2019t aware of about the catastrophic incident. Very graphic pictures and details and so not for the faint hearted but",
          "This museum is excellent. I love how they focused on the lost and the survivors instead of the political propaganda and science. It was very touching and impactful. Just note that the stories, pictures and photos are confronting. It was also very crowded when I was there. So",
          "We had been warned that this could be quite harrowing, with depictions of everything that happened before, during and after the bomb. Many others have put into words the feelings we had on viewing displays of injured, dead and surviving Japanese, Koreans and American prisoners.",
          "It's rare to visit a place that produces deep emotion and tears and for anyone with a soul you will experience this. This museum represents catastrophe on a scale that cannot be imagined or agreed with. Yes there are so many of those around the world but here we have shocking",
          "Lots of exhibits of personal belongings and story telling. After awhile I couldn't read any more stories or look at any more pictures, my heart was heavy... Glad I went...",
          "A visit to the museum and surrounding peace park is a must for any traveller to Japan. The museum does include very graphic images of the aftermath of the atomic bomb explosion so discretion should be used. The museum also doubles as a centre for peace and explores options and",
          "This is where you will see and remember those years that changed the landscape of the world. This museum made me feel how bad war is bar none. The deaths of the Japanese caused by the atomic bomb lobbed in Hiroshima is unimaginable. The museum has really captured it.",
          "You'll need a couple of hours here to fully appreciate all the information they are providing. The guards start to kick you out 10 minutes before closing so it can feel a little rushed, however we got a good view around the place and learnt so much about before, during and after",
          "The museum is excellent, no blame, no criticism, just story telling of an horrendous event that obliterated lives in an instant and led to suffering on an untold scale for years to come. Very moving, but the experience was not one of quiet contemplation given the place was",
          "If in Hiroshima take the time to visit this Museum. Some parts of the exhibit are interactive, some are mainly texts and pictures and some donated objects are shown aswell. Its touching and heartbreaking at times but worth a visit for educational reasons. An eye opening",
          "As we all know this is where the atomic bomb was dropped and ended the second world war.nuclear era began with this massive destruction, we should never forget all the innocent people that died august. 1945",
          "As you'd expect - harrowing, tear-jerking and thought-provoking. They've done well to highlight the human stories after the atomic bomb and link it to modern politics. I'd challenge all politicians to do a tour here before taking office. However, it was absolutely rammed. I",
          "My title says it all: sober, informative, evocative, important. Everyone should have the chance to visit here, and gain an insight into how crushingly indiscriminate and frighteningly devastating an atomic explosion is. This place pulls no punches, as you would expect. It is",
          "It goes without saying, but be prepared to leave with a heavy heart. This museum provides not only an emotional perspective of the aftermath, but also an educational experience on the history and adverse effects of nuclear war.",
          "Definitely worth the 200yen entry price.... definitely worth the visit. However very hard hitting and emotional. Gives a complete understanding of how terrible wars and nuclear can be. Also very busy but can deal with that",
          "Well worth the visit to truly understand the impact of the nuclear bomb. Was very busy which meant it could be a bit slow to move through but the exhibition was very well done. It was good value too.",
          "Very sobering to see the devastation caused when the U.S.A. dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima during the second world war. Photos, artifacts and some of the surviving people all make this a reminder to the rest of the world that hopefully nothing like this ever happens again.",
          "Every Politician in the world needs to see this. Listened in on English language head set and while crowded with tourists and school trips a truly emotional and important site to see. Museum was very well organized and extremely well done. Not morbid, but definitely sobering.",
          "Visited recently on a trip with teens from Australia studying Japanese. This museum was so well put together. Its very hard to look at everything and not be effected. We spoke with a local later who advised the museum was not done for tourists but rather for the Japanese as a",
          "The museum has recently been renovated and extended and the exhibits are now well laid out. It was extremely busy and you can\u2019t really read all the information because of that but what you will see is very thought provoking. I was particularly moved by the children\u2019s exhibits. I",
          "A walk through this museum give you a an idea of what it was like after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. There are stories of individual survival and suffering after the bomb drop. Some followed the story of the individual until death. There are artifacts to show the",
          "Very sad but historically accurate. Shows the suffering of the local community. Very reasonable 200 yen entry and 400 for an audio guide. Would recommend but can have gruesome and difficult imagery so be prepared.",
          "If stopping by Hiroshima, this is a must see museum. It is even worth doing a day trip here from Osaka or Kyoto. There are a lot of stories to hear from survivors. All pretty horrifying to read but it is important that everyone understands their suffering. Plenty of artefacts",
          "We paid $2 admission and walked inside. The museum was very very crowded, there were groups of all ages from all over the world. We heard tour guides speaking many different languages, leading somber groups from exhibit to exhibit. We began by walking through vibrant",
          "As per my last review of the childrens park - this is a must visit aswell Very moving and you will be thinking about yourself and mankind a lot - for a few days after thats for sure Do go though lots of interesting exhibts",
          "This is a must see in Japan. It is important to honestly face the reality of decisions made by our country, even though it was the right decision, the horrifying consequences must be faced without hiding from the reality of that decision. I pray it will never happen again, that",
          "This museum is so fantastically designed and set-up to take your through the history of the A-Bomb, Hiroshima and the after effects (both negative and positive) of the bombing. I would highly recommend it and take your time, regardless of how busy it might be to take a look at",
          "Well set out but visit was frustrating as there is no limit to number of visitors. Very slow and too many visitors to see the photographs and exhibits Properly - too crowded which spoilt the visit. You definitely should take the audio guide. Very sobering and thought",
          "We visited for the morning with friends. This museum gives a portrayal of the effects of the nuclear bomb from a local perspective. Many pictures and facts are represented in this large museum. A message of peace is the central theme",
          "Extremely interesting, very thought provoking, a must on anyones Japanese adventures. It is very well laid out and gives clear information.",
          "This museum is excellent, it leaves nothing to the imagination. In places it is quite graphic, and will probably darken your mood. It is impartial, but leaves no stone unturned. There are some quite horrific pictures and you can see people quite tearful. A definite must visit",
          "It's amazing how the residents of Hiroshima (where the first nuclear bomb was dropped on humankind) have taken it on board to use the events of August 6th 1945 to strive for peace in the world. This is a really moving experience, telling personal stories as well as the historic",
          "For the Japanese to exhibit this part of their history and phrase it as \u2018 Japan was on the war of path and initiated the conflict\u2019 was reflective of how far they have come since this bombing. Parts of the museum can be confronting with photos of the injuries inflicted. There was",
          "Not sure that there is a good time to go to the museum, probably after you have seen the beauty of the gardens. It\u2019s one of those places you have to go if only to ensure nothing like this ever happens again. As you go through the museum, everyone is silent, there is a chilling",
          "The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museums is newly renovated and a credit to the people that designed and set up this Memorial Museum. You are able to wonder through at your own pace and take in the exhibits that will bring tears to your eyes. Its sad, devastating and certainly makes",
          "Well curated, extremely impressive museum about the atomic bomb and it's aftermath. Many personal stories and artifacts of the people living there when it happened",
          "This was one of the most anticipated places during our trip to Japan and it did not disappoint. If you are aware of the picture story called Sadako by Eleanor Coerr, and/or another picture story called My Hiroshima by Junko Morimoto, then this place is a must to visit. Easy to",
          "The museum is a good and covers the impact of the bomb and rebuilding. Unlike German memorials there is little reflection on why the situation happened. Truly devastating and impactful take time after to reflect.",
          "Extremely informative and sobering place Spend the extra 400 yen for the headset Can get quite busy and hot so suggest you take a bottle of water ! How the A bomb impacted the children was heart wrenching , showing burnt clothes etc",
          "A beautifully presented museum that explores the events leading up to, during, and since the Hiroshima bombing. Would recommend the audio guide, too as was very cheap and very informative. A little bit busy when we went so struggled to read everything but if you really",
          "Don\u2019t spend any time reading these reviews, just go inside. They have a well planned and considerate experience awaiting anyone that wants to know about the traumatic devastation from an Atomic bomb.",
          "Strange to say visit was excellent being at the sight of such a terrible event. Very Sobering. But also can feel the message of peace.",
          "Go and see. Yes it's a dark place but it happened. The A-bomb drawings by survivors were so moving. There were no cameras at the time, so survivors were asked to draw what they remembered. Very powerful and heart wrenching. The museum is dedicated to not repeating history.",
          "It is a reminder on the extreme pain and suffering of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Vivid photos. Emotional stories. Worth a visit to remind ourselves not to repeat history.",
          "What a museum. There were so many feelings at once when visiting. The horrors of the a-bomb and the distructions of hundreds of thousand lives are so vivid inside the museum and in the paintings that survivals have painted, in the stories and in the remaining clothes, letters",
          "This place is an amazing tri ute to the past that Hiroshima had to endure. The exhibits, the detail and the information left me both emotional and breathless during my visit. It was also a wake up call to us all that we can never have this happen again. Hiroshima is a must visit",
          "As part of a tour including the A Bomb Dome and the Peace Park concluded your visit with the Museum. It is extremely well done and presents a completed picture of the the destructive force of the A bomb and it effects on the people. Very moving experience.",
          "Everybody needs to come here and meditate on important things in life. Walking through the Museum made me think how easy the \"civilized\" people could commit an act of violence taking away hundreds of thousands of human lives in a few seconds. Today Americans are discussing the",
          "Very spacious & well laid out museum. Easy to get around as the route is well sign posted. It was not expensive to get in. Some of the pictures in the exhibition are quite graphic although they are a true reflection of events, they could be upsetting to some people especially",
          "Absolutely worth a visit. The saddest and most confronting exhibition that I have ever seen. Be prepared for graphic images and heart rendering stories of the victims of the bomb. The design of the exhibition is cleverly done as you walk through very dimly lit areas whilst",
          "As you walk through the exhibits which can be confronting for some you can hear nothing but silence apart from people crying from the sheer emotion of what they are seeing. Extremely powerful and for some overwhelming experience but one you must do.",
          "It was a very powerful, somber & memorable visits to The Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima. I always wanted to see this & SO GLAD I did it. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to you. It will be a very stirring & moving experience!",
          "Hiroshima, Japan. Monday 6th August 1945. It is 8.15am. The residents of Hiroshima are preparing for a new day. 31,000 feet above them Colonel Paul Tibbets of the U.S. army is flying a Boeing bomber aircraft. It is called the Enola Gay and is named after his mother. A moment",
          "The museum is very good, it gives a comprehensive and very personal overview of the tragedy that happened here. The feeling is so intense that you feel unwell a whole while after.",
          "Definitely a must see when in Hiroshima. The exhibitions are very interesting and the intention is to share manu stories of the victims. The museum is made in a very personal way and is really touching and gets to you. Lots of tourists that makes it a bit difficult to see/read",
          "While touring, you will see the devastation wrought by man's evil inventions. Many may feel it was a necessary evil, I'll not argue that. However, when you're standing quietly side-by-side with Japanese tourists (and yes, it's very quiet and respectful), it's hard not to",
          "The museum does a wonderful job of showing the impact that the atomic bomb had, not only for those directly impacted by the bomb, but also by the hundreds and thousands of people who tried to help those in need after the bombing. Between the museum and the nearby monuments",
          "Given the history of Hiroshima this museum is always going to be sobering but it was informative and unbiased. I would definitely recommend visiting but lots would be difficult for young children to see as there are many upsetting images.",
          "Happy that we finally made it to Hiroshima, it was so detailed everyone has learnt in history about the World War and the bombing of japan..here you are actually seeing what happened in 1946 ..the bombing of Hiroshima. The graphics of the explosion is so well done , the photos ,",
          "A fascinating museum that tells the stories of the people of Hiroshima during the atomic blast. Very cheap and all the displays include an English translation beside them. The first half of the museum is sombre and includes lots of items (including the belongings of children)",
          "Interesting and moving place A bit crowded Personalised narrative of the victims family A sense of the gravity and sadness that this was required to end a war",
          "This is perhaps one of the most moving experiences we had during our Japanese holiday. The Atomic Dome, Peace Park and Museum are all captivating, with many deeply personal stories and reflections. There is an audiovisual display that gives a depiction of the bomb dropping which",
          "This was a place we just had to visit since we saw the film, Rhapsody in August, some two decades ago. The Atomic Dome, the Peace Park and the Museum were deeply moving to see and to reflect upon. The exhibits in the museum made the story very tangible. The stories of the",
          "This is a must place in Hiroshima. Prepare to be touched by the horrific personal stories of victims and relatives of the first atomic bombing.",
          "If you are in Hiroshima you must come to this museum. If you are in Japan you should come to this museum.",
          "Good museum with lots of details and facts. But not very organised with too many tourists. Long queue for ticket.",
          "Wow. What a truly memorable experience. An incredible museum capturing so much emotion and truth. I learnt a lot. The memorials all around the park are also amazing. Highly recommend. One of the best museums I\u2019ve ever been to.",
          "Very well laid out. Brought me to tears on more than one occasion. I think every would leader should visit this place before they are allowed to govern a country. Putin, trump, kim jong un take note! No more Hiroshimas! \u975e\u5e38\u306b\u3088\u304f\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u4f55\u5ea6\u304b\u6d99\u3092\u6d41\u3057\u305f\u3002",
          "No doubt this is a good museum but avoid it at peak times. We could literally hardly move in some displays due to the massive crowds and it was hot. I could barely see the displays. I think it is dangerous to crowd so many people in. This museum would be good if it was properly",
          "We were not sure what to expect, but this made us cry. You see the history, people, artifacts, and notebooks. It tells the story of what happened after and how people lived and survived. It talked about radiation and it's effects. There were a lot of field trips / Japanese",
          "This museum was very well done. It was just so hard to go through it. We cried a lot. It was good for our teenage children to understand what had happened but I don't think I would have taken them if they were younger. It is definitely a place you should visit and respect",
          "This museum is a must for historical purposes. It really gives you the perspective of what occurred in Hiroshima when the A-bomb was dropped during WW2. The story it told of the people it affected really makes you feel for them. I have been to this museum once before in October",
          "This is a place you must visit. So many people had died and hope will not happen again anywhere in the world.",
          "This is a very busy place. Much to see and very depressing. There are many pictures and diaramas to see.",
          "The museum is a strong reminder of the horrors of nuclear weapons. The main exhibit focuses on the bombing of August 6th, 1945 and the effect on the people of Hiroshima. Which was horrible. Be aware that the exhibit can evoke strong emotions with photos and portrayals of the",
          "The whole peace memorial park is a great place to visit and it promotes contemplation and respect. It\u2019s right in the heart of the city and easy to find. The shrine and memorial are both close to the Promotion building (the remnants of the building closest to the blast centre).",
          "The world of today needs museums like this, as we need to understand our past to do our best for the future. There are other horrifying things we need to remember, like Holocaust, Pearl Harbor etc, which also have important memorials. The horrors of the atomic bomb are",
          "I spent 3 nights in Hiroshima as I wanted to take my time when I was visiting the Hiroshima Peace Memorial sites. I worked in the Nuclear Power industry when I was working and I realize that a lot of the knowledge that we have on radiation exposure came from the data on the",
          "We spent a couple of hours visiting today. The photos and stories of the people that lost their lives were quite haunting. It gives a better perspective of what the people endured. Great tribute",
          "Walked here from the Dome. Paid the Y200 --no JR pass here. The artifacts they have gathered are incredible. There is so much to see and read here. This is worth so much more than the entrance fee they charge. Outside this museum, you can catch the loop bus going back to",
          "This museum contains an amazing collection of articles, artifacts, photos, narratives, computer simulations, and actual objects recovered from the atomic blast back in 1945 and these provide visitors with a thorough chronological account of all the events that took place just",
          "It's amazing how after so long this place still has such a strong feeling of pain and remembrance. The way the museum is arranged and the detail of everything, you would be hard done not to bring a tear to your eye. Great to experience something like this to give you hope and",
          "This well set out museum is dedicated to documenting the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in World War II. It is a harrowing story and not suitable for young children. I found the information and photographs quite disturbing but I think every person and particularly our world leaders",
          "Keen that we should visit Hiroshima it\u2019s hard to avoid the past and the horrors of war. Not just the war but the aftermath and the lack of support given to the Japanese here. There were many stories of death and survival. The shock was how many passed away in the period",
          "What a fantastic museum. There is so much information laid out in a really interesting and informative way with lots of good little videos, lots of pictures etc. It's really well done. Hard to believe the devastation that was cause here.we spent about 3 hours here and could have",
          "Despite the crowds, there\u2019s virtually no noise. People are locked in their own thoughts. The feeling is similar to that of the Holocaust museum. The focus is very much on the ordinary people of Hiroshima - and the suffering they endured, not the politics of the time. Looking",
          "This museum is a critical part of Hiroshima and not to be missed. Even our teenage boys who are unimpressed with everything put down their cell phones long enough to immerse themselves in the exhibits. Personally, I am so touched and impressed by the resiliency of this city",
          "Visiting the museum was a powerful experience. Definitely a place I would recommend to anyone visiting Japan.",
          "Great place to remember a horrible day in Hiroshima\u2019s history. Definitely must see. A lot of memories of people who suffered",
          "Currently going through seismic upgrades. It does what museums are supposed to do. Inform and provoke discussion. We took friends from China with us, who has heard of an atomic bomb but never understood the scope of damage and the horror inflicted. The children, five and",
          "This museum give a human face to the tragedy of the atomic bomb. Reading first hand accounts of this event was very impactful.",
          "When tragedy happens, the easy thing to do is the shy away from it. The people of Hiroshima have done the hard work for you and preserved the experiences of their relatives and loved-ones and placed them in a safe place to be seen and better understood. Yes, it is heavy and sad,",
          "This museum accomplishes it\u2019s goal to remind us of the people whose lives were affected. With many photos, quotes, pictures, and personal items, the horror of this event was brought to life. Near the end of the one way walk through the museum was an interesting display",
          "This museum focuses primarily on the innocent victims of the Atomic Bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Roughly 90% of the victims were nonmilitary. They don't spend too much time talking about the US and Japanese governments or how we got to the events of August 6, 1945. The primary",
          "Very informative and good value. Most transcripts in English as well as Japanese. Some harrowing stories of the effects of the atomic bomb.",
          "This was one intens museum to visit, it's super heavy, but shows why world peace is needed. Anyone who comes to Hiroshima should go here, be amazed and be humble. You'll need at least 2 hours to see it all, but I personally rushed through it a bit on the end.. it's quite a lot",
          "This place is a telling depiction of the tragedy of A-Bomb. A fascinating way of showing the devastation and educational to a point that you will loathe all the nuclear warfare activities. Simply outstanding and you will Tear up",
          "Mention museum to me and I fail to get excited. However, as this building dominates the Peace Park you may as well take a look. My advice. Don't miss it. Full of remnants of the atomic bomb blast, clothes, toys etc. You will never forget it and you will be anti-nuclear forever",
          "The Peace Memorial Museum is definitely a must-see in Japan, and much can be learnt from the displays. It's a humbling place which captures the horror of nuclear warfare and also details the sequence of events leading to deployment from the Allies. That said, if I had to go",
          "...which is really the point the museum is trying to make. It presents the dropping of the bomb and its aftermath, and their effect on the population. Virtually everything on display has descriptions in English as well as Japanese, and headsets can be rented in other languages",
          "There is so much more to this site than the Peace Dome, which is very moving in its own right. Make sure to take time to walk the grounds and to see the Peace Mound, where all the unidentifiable cremated bodies were buried, the Peace Bell, and the Children's Memorial. The",
          "Truly moving experience explaining, in a high-tech, innovative way, what happened during the bombing and the aftermath. While it does talk about how the Americans planned the bombing, it very obviously avoids any explanation or information as to why Japan was bomb (so for the",
          "We have visited many museums in our travels over the years but I have to say that this is the best, and most moving place I have ever visited. I was born just after the events of Hiroshima and it is so hard to believe that this could happen. The attitude and belief of the people",
          "I have wanted to visit JAPAN for many years and I now have made it twice now with more planned visits. Hiroshima has been in my thoughts for many years and I new I would visit when I got here and I am so very glad I did. Its amazing city",
          "This is an incredibly moving experience. It's not often a Museum will shock you or move you as much as this one. Its fascinating too as it documents Hiroshima before, during and after the Atomic Bomb detonation. Some very arresting displays of photos of victims and their burns,",
          "The museum was absolutely beautiful and very well designed- I wish we had similar ones in Australia. However, the story was told from the Japanese perspective and this can be difficult to understand if you had family or friends who fought. Would highly recommend, but suggest",
          "This is the major attraction in Hiroshima and probably why you are here or going so it goes without saying it's a must see. Very thought provoking but be aware also very confronting which is the point. The focus on the local children will leave an impression. I think no matter",
          "The horror and heartbreaking real life stories of victims and survivors of the A-bomb are sensitivity told through exhibits and artefacts. However, most importantly, the museum carries an important message about the vital need for nuclear disarmament to avoid a similar tragedy",
          "The Peace Memorial and Museum is extremely evocative with an array of well presented artefacts, testimonies and photographs supported with interactive screens which allows each user to explore those aspects of the memorial and event to their own level. The building itself is",
          "If you are traveling w/ children 10 years old or younger, you should prepare them for the exhibits. There were a lot of school children ~ ages 10-12 on field trip. We saw a few students crying and their teacher had to escort them out of the exhibit. A worthwhile education",
          "We really enjoyed our visit the this museum. It was well laid out and we learnt heaps about the atomic bomb of hiroshima. Very sad but a very informative museum.",

          "Some of the exhibits can be quite upsetting including clothing & personal effects worn by the victims. We had a private talk with a Hiroshima survivor who told us her sad story. She was 8 years old & was only 3km from the hypocentre & she very open discussing that day & her",

          "Exhibits were well presented and moving. The first part of the museum tells the stories of people who experienced the atom bomb. The latter part explained the historical context and a little of the science. Well worth visiting.",
          "This Museum gives you an insight into what occurred to the Japanese civilians during the last stages of WWII when the A-bomb was dropped. The photos are chilling and very emotive, but when you read the stories it really hits you. Some people were actually sobbing. It's a slow",
          "The purpose of the museum was to raise awareness of the devastation caused by the atomic bomb dropped on the city. It was very impactful and you left feeling sad for the victims and fearful that this can occur in the future. It hopes that such awareness will hopefully make",
          "Absolutely worth seeing once in your life if you ever visit Hiroshima. The peace parc and museum are both very informative and you can also even touch some of the original pieces of houses that are from that time. Be prepared to get emotional though as it is nothing for weak",
          "The museum handles a difficult subject exceptionally well. The content is perfectly balanced: a range of fact and emotion, covering all aspects. It's hard to see how a museum could cover this in a better way. Highly recommended for all ages and everyone should learn something.",
          "If you want to understand the impact of atomic bombs this is the place to learn. You are guaranteed to leave a little different to when you arrived. Outline graphically the consequences.",
          "My husband and I visited this place with G Adventure as a guided tour. The guide took us on the bus. So easy and quick to get in. So easy to get around and literally see and read everything to fully understand what went on. There are posts to read, pictures to see, illustrative",
          "I\u2019m going to echo the sentiments precisely of the previous review on TA. The exhibition itself is superb; thought provoking, moving, educational. But the museum needs to address its entrance policy. Literally over a thousand school kids were let in at the same time. It was, at",
          "A very well laid out museum, only recently opened when we visited. Very clearly laid out and tells the story so well. Unfortunately when we visited it was also the time for thousands of school children to also to visit and it was so crowded we were unable to walk around and it",

          "The museum has graphic photo's and stories from survivors of the atomic bomb blast. You can become quite emotional looking at the photo's, and reading some of the stories from the survivors, but they are a must to read. If you go to Hiroshima you have to come here to see the",

          "The museum was reopened at the end of April and we had the opportunity to visit. The museum is a hard visit as are all things related to war. It is sobering and redeeming.",
          "Museum was extremely busy, tourists and schoolchildren packing it out. The pictures and items they have on show are quite graphic but absolutely relevant and shows the reality. As someone else already wrote, there are two sides to the story and there is a very brief mention to",
          "Wow very confronting, I wasn\u2019t born in 1945 and only heard about it from television docos. We listened to a brilliant talk from an A bomb survivor, it was her perspective of what happened and she was able to draw what she actually saw. I shall never forget her passion for peace",
          "We were near the end of an 8-day bus tour of Japan. An optional tour on the bullet train to Hiroshima was available. To see the miraculous recovery of a destroyed city and landscape, was well worth it, but the Peace Memorial Museum is something I think everyone on earth should",
          "I think it's one of these places everyone should visit at least once in their life. We all learn about Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the horror of the atomic bombings at school, but here, with all of these photographs, stories and survivors artwork* it takes that knowledge to a",
          "I usually don\u2019t post reviews on sightseeing only hotels but on this occasion I will. This Museum is everything you would imagine and then more. So tastefully done with photographs of survivors mixed with paintings drifting the scenes from the survivors point of view. I was",
          "The museum was very well made and the fee was very reasonable. We liked the exhibitions, especially the first one explaining about the US atomic bomb programs and testing prior to the bombing of Hiroshima. They also have exhibits about people\u2019s injuries and the effects from",
          "History was right before my eyes as I walked through this Museum looking at all photographs and exhibits. My heart went to the innocent folks who perished especially the many innocent school children. Any kind of War should never have happened, revenge & retaliation belong to",
          "A detailed explanation of what happened when and after the bomb was dropped. It\u2019s at times harrowing but if you\u2019re in Hiroshima this is a must-see. The animation showing before and after is particularly shocking. If you take kids be aware that they may find some images scaring.",
          "The museum does a very good job sharing what happened on the day of the bombing and the time afterward. As one can expect, there was very little about the Japanese aggression that ultimately led to the bombing. I was somewhat troubled by the storyline that the bombing occurred",
          "This museum is very moving, what man can do to man, awful. My visit was overwhelming sad , the museum is well set out and informative. The surrounding Peace. park full of memorials also moving.. every visit to Hiroshima should include going around this area.",
          "This museum really brings to life the magnitude of the atomic bomb's impact on Hiroshima. You are not only presented with the statistics, which are mind-blowing, but real examples, wome of which can be touched. The before and after of a roof tile and blasted bottle made an",

          "I found Hiroshima to be a beautiful city! But as we entered the peace park to head to the memorial, as beautiful as it is, it feels heavy.. the whole area still has a sadness about it that is palpable. On entering the museum you are immersed straight away by walking into a",
          "We specifically came to Hiroshima to visit the peace park and museum, it was very easy to get here on the Sightseeing loop bus, stops pretty much out the front. The day we went was relatively busy but manageable, definitely recommend getting the guide as it was hard to read",
          "I was deeply touched by my visit . Crowds representing many nations walked around in almost total silence as they viewed the display and read the accounts of suffering and loss . I had a wonderful visit to Japan and it would not have been right to return home without visiting",
          "Impressive exhibit showing Hiroshima before the bomb and then again after the bomb. The photographs and exhibits are poignant. The museum tells the stories of the victims and their families in graphic detail. Some of the exhibits and photos may not be the best for small",
          "We visited the museum and it was reasonably busy. I have never experienced such a silence with so many people. Everybody must have been with their thought when walking through the museum. Facts are displayed, stories are told. It must have been hell on earth. Please visit as",

          "After you\u2019ve done the peace park you must not miss the museum. The peace park gives you a flavour of what happened here in 1945. The museum gives you a fuller, more frank and sobering experience. Be warned it is upsetting. However what\u2019s the point in shielding yourself from",
          "I did not actually attend - and if you can pre book to skip lines I would. They were soooo long possibly as I was visiting during Golden Week so many locals. I was disappointed I didn't go - but plenty to keep you educated.",

          "The museum is well done, though heart breaking. Bring tissue! The museum goes over the daily life, the aftermath and info about nuclear weapons and the history.",
          "The Peace Museum is a highlight of the town- emotional and heartbreaking. The artefacts that are scattered throughout take you back to a time that was harsh and crewel and have you leave hoping that the prayer for Peace truly does come true.",

          "If you come to Hiroshima and do not visit this museum; shame on you. Do yourself a favour and invest in the headphones, they are well worth the money. It is incomprehensible what the Japanese must have gone through on that fateful day and for generations afterwards. My children",
          "This museum is one of the best I\u2019ve been to, low entry fee yet great displays, a must do on a visit to Hiroshima. It was still under renovation when we visited but you would never have known. I loved the little section about Sadako & The Thousand Paper Cranes, a story that has",
          "This is a fairly large space for what there is in it, but given the number of people visiting, it needs to be. It means that you can back out of the crowds and get your breath back, which is a good thing. I found the chronology/ build up information about the Manhattan project",
          "It was a heavy experience reading the eye witness accounts from children and family members of having to bury parents and siblings, having to deal with their own sickness and injuries, then having to find a place to live. The USA sent personnel to study the effects, but not to",
          "A very nice museum which is presented very well. Obviously it\u2019s a shocking thing to read and see about and they portray the victims journeys very well. Worth a visit if you\u2019re in Hiroshima.",
          "This museum has it all. Artifacts, photographs, paintings and documents on display, everything with excellent description in English. There are also film clips and interactive multimedia displays. The rental audio guide is well worth the extra 400 yen, as it gives more in depth",
          "When visiting Hiroshima this museum is a must. The stories told are powerful and moving. There are many personal items on view which add to the overal experience. Don\u2019t miss it!!!",
          "When you are in Hiroshima you also get know the sad story of this city. In this museum they show you the horror of this brutal attack. The story and the pictures make you sad and i did not spend to much time here, it\u2019s for sure not something you wanna hear during your vacation.",
          "I can\u2019t really explain anything further than what you would expect from this museum. It is a very thought provoking experience which leaves you with a sad feeling inside but also one of hope too. It\u2019s a must see for all visitors to the city.",
          "Very sad to see everything in here.I rent the audio which is worth it.Not much to say.Go check it out.The entry fee very cheap compare to what u get",
          "Although only the smaller building is currently open, the exhibits capture the enormity of that day, and was well worth the time spent wandering through the three story exhibit space. It is also just a short walk to the overlook for the dome building.",
          "The main museum is currently being renovated I think so the museum we saw was rather small and gives a very biased version of WWll and the reasons for the bombing. However, the video of the survivors of the nuclear bomb - the hibakusha - was really informative and frankly was",
          "Exhibits and information was incredible. It was humbling to be an American there. Make sure you take the time to sit and listen to the live accounts of the events from survivors. Absolutely heartbreaking",
          "You will remember this visit forever. When you see the human and physical impacts of the nuclear bomb it makes you wonder why we persist in developing and deploying more of them. Some of our world leaders should visit here. The visit was made even more impactful by a talk by an",
          "This museum is very powerful, but for those who are sensitive it might be graphically overwhelming. It is very much like the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, but smaller.",
          "This museum is well thought out but extremely emotional. Make sure you have somthing fun planned for afterwards.",
          "A very nice museum with many very graphic images of the aftermath of the bombing. Not for the faint of heart but very necessary to see.",
          "Let\u2019s pray this will never happen again. A powerful demonstration of how it can all go so wrong. The suffering that the people of Hiroshima have endured is unfathomable. I am a rather stoic individual, I could not hold back the tears during this visit.",
          "A very well thought out and organised museum. the highlight of our visit was an hour presentation from a lady who survived the bomb. We were all moved by her story. The exhibits, and more particularly the pictures and stories about the hundreds or even thousands of children who",
          "Words cannot describe the images and accounts from people who survived the atomic bomb. The exhibition is beautifully constructed and gives a very balanced view. There is also a very good section on the state of nuclear arms today and the risk to humanity as a whole.",

          "It's a very well put together museum that sets out the terrible bombing and the aftermath. Great graphics and first hand accounts. There are videos from survivors and items that have been saved. Really moving and worth the visit.",
          "My wife and I were here on a Gate1 tour, Optional Excursion to Hiroshima and Miyajima. We had never been to either place and Hiroshima was on my bucket list. It is very moving, seeing the terrible tragedy of what can happen when countries use nuclear weapons. Museum is very",

          "We queued for about an hour (during golden week) and it was busy but attended a presentation in English which was excellent and very informative. I had no idea how bad the a-bomb was and what far reaching devastation it caused - quite frightening- WE NEED TO RID THE WORLD OF",

          "Mrs M and I brought our two sons here (5 and 9 at the time of travel) last month. I won\u2019t elaborate on what the museum is about. It\u2019s a sobering experience not dissimilar to the 911 Memorial in NYC. We explained to the children what it was about and they found it informative",
          "This is a must no matter how confronting some of the images and artifacts are. We had a great guide and the most beautiful spring day. Lots of people due to Golden Week, but worth the visit",
          "Refreshingly done museum showing the horror of the a bomb and aftermath. Many great exhibits and haunting photos. Large line to get in, inexcess of 1hr but worth it. 200yen admission was amazingly cheap. Fantastic. Absolutely worth it.",

          "What should have been a sobering and informative experience was completely ruined by the number of people they try and cram into the museum.

          "If you vaguely remember the horrors of Hiroshima, or were too young to have it resonate, a tour of this Museum (spend at least 2 hours or more), will be emotional and life-influencing. Deeply moving. Very well curated and presented. We visited twice.",
          "You shouldn\u2019t visit Hiroshima without seeing this museum. Recently fully reopened after undergoing seismic upgrades, this museum offers a compelling view of the horrors experienced in Hiroshima after the A-bomb in 1945. Visitors follow a single path through the main exhibits,",

          "We came here with one of the two remaining guides that was in a cave playing with friends when the bomb exploded. That made the visit more of an impact. He was 86 years old. The exhibits are well documented and there was plenty of room to move around the rooms.",

          "My 11-year-old was overwhelmed by the videos, the artifacts that were there and esp pictures that were very graphic of injuries. However, the power is important, and even with half the museum closed we learned a lot. It is great that it is in the lovely large park for some brain",

          "The main part of the building was closed during our visit. It was being made earthquake proof. Even so, there was still plenty to see. One of the highlights was a presentation made by a lady telling the story of one survivor in the words of the survivor. The story of the bombing",

          "This museum has built for the peace and because we shoud not forget the atomic bombing or total destruction it caused. The museum has a message: No more hiroshimas. The museo itself is not very big and it is easy to follow the route and it took me about sn hour to walk all room",
          "A fitting tribute to an unparalleled tragedy. Solemn memorial that captures the essence of the suffering, and the rebuilding. Must visit when in Japan - should make into everyone's Japan itinerary.",

          "Only a portion of the museum was open, but the displays were still quite large and very nice. They are very thorough. There is a nice gift shop where you can purchase books, or other souvenirs and the cost to get in was only 2 yen per person. Definitely worth your time",

If you are in Japan, it is worth making the trip down to visit - the museum was really full but after a few minutes the crowds had fallen almost silent, simply taking in the exhibit.

        "wiki": "The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom, as required by the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.\nIn the final year of World War II, the Allies prepared for a very costly invasion of the Japanese mainland. This undertaking was preceded by a conventional and firebombing campaign which devastated 67 Japanese cities. The war in Europe had concluded when Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8, 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific theater. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945, the alternative being \"prompt and utter destruction\". Japan ignored the ultimatum and the war continued.\nBy August 1945, the Allies' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bombs, and the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) was equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands. The Allies issued orders for atomic bombs to be used on four Japanese cities on July 25. On August 6, one of the modified B-29s dropped a uranium gun-type bomb (\"Little Boy\") on Hiroshima. Another B-29 dropped a plutonium implosion bomb (\"Fat Man\") on Nagasaki three days later. The bombs immediately devastated their targets. Over the next two to four months, the acute effects of the atomic bombings killed between 90,000 and 146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000 and 80,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. Large numbers of people continued to die for months afterward from the effects of burns, radiation sickness, and other injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.\nJapan surrendered to the Allies on August 15, six days after the Soviet Union's declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September 2 in Tokyo Bay, which effectively ended World War II. Scholars have extensively studied the effects of the bombings on the social and political character of subsequent world history and popular culture, and there is still much debate concerning the ethical and legal justification for the bombings.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Pacific War ===\n\nIn 1945, the Pacific War between the Empire of Japan and the Allies entered its fourth year. Most Japanese military units fought fiercely, ensuring that the Allied victory would come at an enormous cost. The 1.25 million battle casualties incurred in total by the United States in World War II included both military personnel killed in action and wounded in action. Nearly one million of the casualties occurred during the last year of the war, from June 1944 to June 1945. In December 1944, American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 as a result of the German Ardennes Offensive. America's reserves of manpower were running out. Deferments for groups such as agricultural workers were tightened, and there was consideration of drafting women. At the same time, the public was becoming war-weary, and demanding that long-serving servicemen be sent home.In the Pacific, the Allies returned to the Philippines, recaptured Burma, and invaded Borneo. Offensives were undertaken to reduce the Japanese forces remaining in Bougainville, New Guinea and the Philippines. In April 1945, American forces landed on Okinawa, where heavy fighting continued until June. Along the way, the ratio of Japanese to American casualties dropped from 5:1 in the Philippines to 2:1 on Okinawa. Although some Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner, most fought until they were killed or committed suicide. Nearly 99% of the 21,000 defenders of Iwo Jima were killed. Of the 117,000 Okinawan and Japanese troops defending Okinawa in April\u2013June 1945, 94% were killed; 7,401 Japanese soldiers surrendered, an unprecedentedly large number.As the Allies advanced towards Japan, conditions became steadily worse for the Japanese people. Japan's merchant fleet declined from 5,250,000 gross tons in 1941 to 1,560,000 tons in March 1945, and 557,000 tons in August 1945. Lack of raw materials forced the Japanese war economy into a steep decline after the middle of 1944. The civilian economy, which had slowly deteriorated throughout the war, reached disastrous levels by the middle of 1945. The loss of shipping also affected the fishing fleet, and the 1945 catch was only 22% of that in 1941. The 1945 rice harvest was the worst since 1909, and hunger and malnutrition became widespread. U.S. industrial production was overwhelmingly superior to Japan's. By 1943, the U.S. produced almost 100,000 aircraft a year, compared to Japan's production of 70,000 for the entire war. By the middle of 1944, the U.S. had almost a hundred aircraft carriers in the Pacific, far more than Japan's twenty-five for the entire war. In February 1945, Prince Fumimaro Konoe advised Emperor Hirohito that defeat was inevitable, and urged him to abdicate.\n\n\n=== Preparations to invade Japan ===\n\nEven before the surrender of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, Operation Downfall, the Allied invasion of Japan. The operation had two parts: Operation Olympic and Operation Coronet. Set to begin in October 1945, Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S. Sixth Army intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Operation Olympic was to be followed in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the Kant\u014d Plain, near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of Honsh\u016b by the U.S. First, Eighth and Tenth Armies, as well as a Commonwealth Corps made up of Australian, British and Canadian divisions. The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete its objectives, for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the Japanese winter to pass.\n\nJapan's geography made this invasion plan obvious to the Japanese; they were able to predict the Allied invasion plans accurately and thus adjust their defensive plan, Operation Ketsug\u014d, accordingly. The Japanese planned an all-out defense of Ky\u016bsh\u016b, with little left in reserve for any subsequent defense operations. Four veteran divisions were withdrawn from the Kwantung Army in Manchuria in March 1945 to strengthen the forces in Japan, and 45 new divisions were activated between February and May 1945. Most were immobile formations for coastal defense, but 16 were high quality mobile divisions. In all, there were 2.3 million Japanese Army troops prepared to defend the home islands, backed by a civilian militia of 28 million men and women. Casualty predictions varied widely, but were extremely high. The Vice Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, Vice Admiral Takijir\u014d \u014cnishi, predicted up to 20 million Japanese deaths.On June 15, 1945, a study by the Joint War Plans Committee, who provided planning information to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that Olympic would result in 130,000 to 220,000 U.S. casualties, with U.S. dead in the range from 25,000 to 46,000. Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses due to the very effective sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign. The Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army George Marshall, and the Army Commander in Chief in the Pacific, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, signed documents agreeing with the Joint War Plans Committee estimate.The Americans were alarmed by the Japanese buildup, which was accurately tracked through Ultra intelligence. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson was sufficiently concerned about high American estimates of probable casualties to commission his own study by Quincy Wright and William Shockley. Wright and Shockley spoke with Colonels James McCormack and Dean Rusk, and examined casualty forecasts by Michael E. DeBakey and Gilbert Beebe. Wright and Shockley estimated the invading Allies would suffer between 1.7 and 4 million casualties in such a scenario, of whom between 400,000 and 800,000 would be dead, while Japanese fatalities would have been around 5 to 10 million.Marshall began contemplating the use of a weapon that was \"readily available and which assuredly can decrease the cost in American lives\": poison gas. Quantities of phosgene, mustard gas, tear gas and cyanogen chloride were moved to Luzon from stockpiles in Australia and New Guinea in preparation for Operation Olympic, and MacArthur ensured that Chemical Warfare Service units were trained in their use. Consideration was also given to using biological weapons against Japan.\n\n\n=== Air raids on Japan ===\n\nWhile the United States had developed plans for an air campaign against Japan prior to the Pacific War, the capture of Allied bases in the western Pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944 when the long-ranged Boeing B-29 Superfortress became ready for use in combat. Operation Matterhorn involved India-based B-29s staging through bases around Chengdu in China to make a series of raids on strategic targets in Japan. This effort failed to achieve the strategic objectives that its planners had intended, largely because of logistical problems, the bomber's mechanical difficulties, the vulnerability of Chinese staging bases, and the extreme range required to reach key Japanese cities.Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell determined that Guam, Tinian, and Saipan in the Mariana Islands would better serve as B-29 bases, but they were in Japanese hands. Strategies were shifted to accommodate the air war, and the islands were captured between June and August 1944. Air bases were developed, and B-29 operations commenced from the Marianas in October 1944. These bases were easily resupplied by cargo ships. The XXI Bomber Command began missions against Japan on November 18, 1944. The early attempts to bomb Japan from the Marianas proved just as ineffective as the China-based B-29s had been. Hansell continued the practice of conducting so-called high-altitude precision bombing, aimed at key industries and transportation networks, even after these tactics had not produced acceptable results. These efforts proved unsuccessful due to logistical difficulties with the remote location, technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft, unfavorable weather conditions, and enemy action.\n\nHansell's successor, Major General Curtis LeMay, assumed command in January 1945 and initially continued to use the same precision bombing tactics, with equally unsatisfactory results. The attacks initially targeted key industrial facilities but much of the Japanese manufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private homes. Under pressure from United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) headquarters in Washington, LeMay changed tactics and decided that low-level incendiary raids against Japanese cities were the only way to destroy their production capabilities, shifting from precision bombing to area bombardment with incendiaries. Like most strategic bombing during World War II, the aim of the air offensive against Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale.Over the next six months, the XXI Bomber Command under LeMay firebombed 67 Japanese cities. The firebombing of Tokyo, codenamed Operation Meetinghouse, on March 9\u201310 killed an estimated 100,000 people and destroyed 16 square miles (41 km2) of the city and 267,000 buildings in a single night. It was the deadliest bombing raid of the war, at a cost of 20 B-29s shot down by flak and fighters. By May, 75% of bombs dropped were incendiaries designed to burn down Japan's \"paper cities\". By mid-June, Japan's six largest cities had been devastated. The end of the fighting on Okinawa that month provided airfields even closer to the Japanese mainland, allowing the bombing campaign to be further escalated. Aircraft flying from Allied aircraft carriers and the Ryukyu Islands also regularly struck targets in Japan during 1945 in preparation for Operation Downfall. Firebombing switched to smaller cities, with populations ranging from 60,000 to 350,000. According to Yuki Tanaka, the U.S. fire-bombed over a hundred Japanese towns and cities. These raids were devastating.The Japanese military was unable to stop the Allied attacks and the country's civil defense preparations proved inadequate. Japanese fighters and anti-aircraft guns had difficulty engaging bombers flying at high altitude. From April 1945, the Japanese interceptors also had to face American fighter escorts based on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. That month, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service stopped attempting to intercept the air raids to preserve fighter aircraft to counter the expected invasion. By mid-1945 the Japanese only occasionally scrambled aircraft to intercept individual B-29s conducting reconnaissance sorties over the country, to conserve supplies of fuel. In July 1945, the Japanese had 1,156,000 US barrels (137,800,000 l) of avgas stockpiled for the invasion of Japan. About 604,000 US barrels (72,000,000 l) had been consumed in the home islands area in April, May and June 1945. While the Japanese military decided to resume attacks on Allied bombers from late June, by this time there were too few operational fighters available for this change of tactics to hinder the Allied air raids.\n\n\n=== Atomic bomb development ===\n\nThe discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, made the development of an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility. Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939. Progress was slow until the arrival of the British MAUD Committee report in late 1941, which indicated that only 5 to 10 kilograms of isotopically enriched uranium-235 were needed for a bomb instead of tons of natural uranium and a neutron moderator like heavy water.The 1943 Quebec Agreement merged the nuclear weapons projects of the United Kingdom and Canada, Tube Alloys and the Montreal Laboratory, with the Manhattan Project, under the direction of Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Groves appointed J. Robert Oppenheimer to organize and head the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where bomb design work was carried out. Two types of bombs were eventually developed, both named by Robert Serber. Little Boy was a gun-type fission weapon that used uranium-235, a rare isotope of uranium separated at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The other, known as a Fat Man device, was a more powerful and efficient, but more complicated, implosion-type nuclear weapon that used plutonium created in nuclear reactors at Hanford, Washington.There was a Japanese nuclear weapon program, but it lacked the human, mineral and financial resources of the Manhattan Project, and never made much progress towards developing an atomic bomb.\n\n\n== Preparations ==\n\n\n=== Organization and training ===\n\nThe 509th Composite Group was constituted on December 9, 1944, and activated on December 17, 1944, at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, commanded by Colonel Paul Tibbets. Tibbets was assigned to organize and command a combat group to develop the means of delivering an atomic weapon against targets in Germany and Japan. Because the flying squadrons of the group consisted of both bomber and transport aircraft, the group was designated as a \"composite\" rather than a \"bombardment\" unit. Working with the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, Tibbets selected Wendover for his training base over Great Bend, Kansas, and Mountain Home, Idaho, because of its remoteness. Each bombardier completed at least 50 practice drops of inert or conventional explosive pumpkin bombs and Tibbets declared his group combat-ready. On April 5, 1945, the code name Operation Centerboard was assigned. The officer responsible for its allocation in the War Department's Operations Division was not cleared to know any details of it. The first bombing was later codenamed Operation Centerboard I, and the second, Operation Centerboard II.\n\nThe 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom eventually deployed to Tinian. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian 51 civilian and military personnel from Project Alberta, known as the 1st Technical Detachment. The 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron was equipped with 15 Silverplate B-29s. These aircraft were specially adapted to carry nuclear weapons, and were equipped with fuel-injected engines, Curtiss Electric reversible-pitch propellers, pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors and other improvements.The ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group moved by rail on April 26, 1945, to its port of embarkation at Seattle, Washington. On May 6 the support elements sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner. The Cape Victory made brief port calls at Honolulu and Eniwetok but the passengers were not permitted to leave the dock area. An advance party of the air echelon, consisting of 29 officers and 61 enlisted men flew by C-54 to North Field on Tinian, between May 15 and May 22. There were also two representatives from Washington, D.C., Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, the deputy commander of the Manhattan Project, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell of the Military Policy Committee, who were on hand to decide higher policy matters on the spot. Along with Captain William S. Parsons, the commander of Project Alberta, they became known as the \"Tinian Joint Chiefs\".\n\n\n=== Choice of targets ===\n\nIn April 1945, Marshall asked Groves to nominate specific targets for bombing for final approval by himself and Stimson. Groves formed a Target Committee, chaired by himself, that included Farrell, Major John A. Derry, Colonel William P. Fisher, Joyce C. Stearns and David M. Dennison from the USAAF; and scientists John von Neumann, Robert R. Wilson and William Penney from the Manhattan Project. The Target Committee met in Washington on April 27; at Los Alamos on May 10, where it was able to talk to the scientists and technicians there; and finally in Washington on May 28, where it was briefed by Tibbets and Commander Frederick Ashworth from Project Alberta, and the Manhattan Project's scientific advisor, Richard C. Tolman.The Target Committee nominated five targets: Kokura (now Kitakyushu), the site of one of Japan's largest munitions plants; Hiroshima, an embarkation port and industrial center that was the site of a major military headquarters; Yokohama, an urban center for aircraft manufacture, machine tools, docks, electrical equipment and oil refineries; Niigata, a port with industrial facilities including steel and aluminum plants and an oil refinery; and Kyoto, a major industrial center. The target selection was subject to the following criteria:\n\nThe target was larger than 3 mi (4.8 km) in diameter and was an important target in a large city.\nThe blast would create effective damage.\nThe target was unlikely to be attacked by August 1945.These cities were largely untouched during the nightly bombing raids, and the Army Air Forces agreed to leave them off the target list so accurate assessment of the damage caused by the atomic bombs could be made. Hiroshima was described as \"an important army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged. There are adjacent hills which are likely to produce a focusing effect which would considerably increase the blast damage. Due to rivers it is not a good incendiary target.\"The Target Committee stated that \"It was agreed that psychological factors in the target selection were of great importance. Two aspects of this are (1) obtaining the greatest psychological effect against Japan and (2) making the initial use sufficiently spectacular for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized when publicity on it is released. ... Kyoto has the advantage of the people being more highly intelligent and hence better able to appreciate the significance of the weapon. Hiroshima has the advantage of being such a size and with possible focussing from nearby mountains that a large fraction of the city may be destroyed. The Emperor's palace in Tokyo has a greater fame than any other target but is of least strategic value.\"Edwin O. Reischauer, a Japan expert for the U.S. Army Intelligence Service, was incorrectly said to have prevented the bombing of Kyoto. In his autobiography, Reischauer specifically refuted this claim:\n\n... the only person deserving credit for saving Kyoto from destruction is Henry L. Stimson, the Secretary of War at the time, who had known and admired Kyoto ever since his honeymoon there several decades earlier. \nOn May 30, Stimson asked Groves to remove Kyoto from the target list due to its historical, religious and cultural significance, but Groves pointed to its military and industrial significance. Stimson then approached President Harry S. Truman about the matter. Truman agreed with Stimson, and Kyoto was temporarily removed from the target list. Groves attempted to restore Kyoto to the target list in July, but Stimson remained adamant. On July 25, Nagasaki was put on the target list in place of Kyoto. It was a major military port, one of Japan's largest shipbuilding and repair centers, and an important producer of naval ordnance.\n\n\n=== Proposed demonstration ===\nIn early May 1945, the Interim Committee was created by Stimson at the urging of leaders of the Manhattan Project and with the approval of Truman to advise on matters pertaining to nuclear energy. During the meetings on May 31 and June 1, scientist Ernest Lawrence had suggested giving the Japanese a non-combat demonstration. Arthur Compton later recalled that:It was evident that everyone would suspect trickery. If a bomb were exploded in Japan with previous notice, the Japanese air power was still adequate to give serious interference. An atomic bomb was an intricate device, still in the developmental stage. Its operation would be far from routine. If during the final adjustments of the bomb the Japanese defenders should attack, a faulty move might easily result in some kind of failure. Such an end to an advertised demonstration of power would be much worse than if the attempt had not been made. It was now evident that when the time came for the bombs to be used we should have only one of them available, followed afterwards by others at all-too-long intervals. We could not afford the chance that one of them might be a dud. If the test were made on some neutral territory, it was hard to believe that Japan's determined and fanatical military men would be impressed. If such an open test were made first and failed to bring surrender, the chance would be gone to give the shock of surprise that proved so effective. On the contrary, it would make the Japanese ready to interfere with an atomic attack if they could. Though the possibility of a demonstration that would not destroy human lives was attractive, no one could suggest a way in which it could be made so convincing that it would be likely to stop the war. \nThe possibility of a demonstration was raised again in the Franck Report issued by physicist James Franck on June 11 and the Scientific Advisory Panel rejected his report on June 16, saying that \"we can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war; we see no acceptable alternative to direct military use.\" Franck then took the report to Washington, D.C., where the Interim Committee met on June 21 to re-examine its earlier conclusions; but it reaffirmed that there was no alternative to the use of the bomb on a military target.Like Compton, many U.S. officials and scientists argued that a demonstration would sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack, and the Japanese could deny the atomic bomb was lethal, making the mission less likely to produce surrender. Allied prisoners of war might be moved to the demonstration site and be killed by the bomb. They also worried that the bomb might be a dud since the Trinity test was of a stationary device, not an air-dropped bomb. In addition, although more bombs were in production, only two would be available at the start of August, and they cost billions of dollars, so using one for a demonstration would be expensive.\n\n\n=== Leaflets ===\n\nFor several months, the U.S. had warned civilians of potential air raids by dropping more than 63 million leaflets across Japan. Many Japanese cities suffered terrible damage from aerial bombings; some were as much as 97% destroyed. LeMay thought that leaflets would increase the psychological impact of bombing, and reduce the international stigma of area-bombing cities. Even with the warnings, Japanese opposition to the war remained ineffective. In general, the Japanese regarded the leaflet messages as truthful, with many Japanese choosing to leave major cities. The leaflets caused such concern that the government ordered the arrest of anyone caught in possession of a leaflet. Leaflet texts were prepared by recent Japanese prisoners of war because they were thought to be the best choice \"to appeal to their compatriots\".In preparation for dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the Oppenheimer-led Scientific Panel of the Interim Committee decided against a demonstration bomb and against a special leaflet warning. Those decisions were implemented because of the uncertainty of a successful detonation and also because of the wish to maximize shock in the leadership. No warning was given to Hiroshima that a new and much more destructive bomb was going to be dropped. Various sources gave conflicting information about when the last leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima prior to the atomic bomb. Robert Jay Lifton wrote that it was July 27, and Theodore H. McNelly wrote that it was July 30. The USAAF history noted that eleven cities were targeted with leaflets on July 27, but Hiroshima was not one of them, and there were no leaflet sorties on July 30. Leaflet sorties were undertaken on August 1 and August 4. Hiroshima may have been leafleted in late July or early August, as survivor accounts talk about a delivery of leaflets a few days before the atomic bomb was dropped. Three versions were printed of a leaflet listing 11 or 12 cities targeted for firebombing; a total of 33 cities listed. With the text of this leaflet reading in Japanese \"...we cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked...\" Hiroshima was not listed.\n\n\n=== Consultation with Britain and Canada ===\n\nIn 1943, The United States and the United Kingdom signed the Quebec Agreement, which stipulated that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. Stimson therefore had to obtain British permission. A meeting of the Combined Policy Committee, which included one Canadian representative, was held at the Pentagon on July 4, 1945. Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson announced that the British government concurred with the use of nuclear weapons against Japan, which would be officially recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee. As the release of information to third parties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion then turned to what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the bombing. The meeting also considered what Truman could reveal to Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, at the upcoming Potsdam Conference, as this also required British concurrence.\nOrders for the attack were issued to General Carl Spaatz on July 25 under the signature of General Thomas T. Handy, the acting Chief of Staff, since Marshall was at the Potsdam Conference with Truman. It read:\nThe 509th Composite Group, 20th Air Force will deliver its first special bomb as soon as weather will permit visual bombing after about 3 August 1945 on one of the targets: Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata and Nagasaki. To carry military and civilian scientific personnel from the War Department to observe and record the effects of the explosion of the bomb, additional aircraft will accompany the airplane carrying the bomb. The observing planes will stay several miles distant from the point of impact of the bomb.\nAdditional bombs will be delivered on the above targets as soon as made ready by the project staff. Further instructions will be issued concerning targets other than those listed above. \nThat day, Truman noted in his diary that:This weapon is to be used against Japan between now and August 10th. I have told the Sec. of War, Mr. Stimson, to use it so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children. Even if the Japs are savages, ruthless, merciless and fanatic, we as the leader of the world for the common welfare cannot drop that terrible bomb on the old capital [Kyoto] or the new [Tokyo]. He and I are in accord. The target will be a purely military one. \n\n\n=== Potsdam Declaration ===\n\nThe July 16 success of the Trinity Test in the New Mexico desert exceeded expectations. On July 26, Allied leaders issued the Potsdam Declaration, which outlined the terms of surrender for Japan. The declaration was presented as an ultimatum and stated that without a surrender, the Allies would attack Japan, resulting in \"the inevitable and complete destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland\". The atomic bomb was not mentioned in the communiqu\u00e9.On July 28, Japanese papers reported that the declaration had been rejected by the Japanese government. That afternoon, Prime Minister Suzuki Kantar\u014d declared at a press conference that the Potsdam Declaration was no more than a rehash (yakinaoshi) of the Cairo Declaration and that the government intended to ignore it (mokusatsu, \"kill by silence\"). The statement was taken by both Japanese and foreign papers as a clear rejection of the declaration. Emperor Hirohito, who was waiting for a Soviet reply to non-committal Japanese peace feelers, made no move to change the government position. Japan's willingness to surrender remained conditional on the preservation of the kokutai (Imperial institution and national polity), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for disarmament and demobilization, no occupation of the Japanese Home Islands, Korea or Formosa, and delegation of the punishment of war criminals to the Japanese government.At Potsdam, Truman agreed to a request from Winston Churchill that Britain be represented when the atomic bomb was dropped. William Penney and Group Captain Leonard Cheshire were sent to Tinian, but found that LeMay would not let them accompany the mission. All they could do was send a strongly worded signal to Wilson.\n\n\n=== Bombs ===\nThe Little Boy bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. There were two uranium-235 components, a hollow cylindrical projectile and a cylindrical target insert. The projectile was completed on June 15, and the target insert on July 24. The projectile and eight bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the powder charge and fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on July 16 aboard the cruiser USS Indianapolis, and arrived on Tinian on July 26. The target insert followed by air on July 30, accompanied by Commander Francis Birch from Project Alberta. Responding to concerns expressed by the 509th Composite Group about the possibility of a B-29 crashing on takeoff, Birch had modified the Little Boy design to incorporate a removable breech plug that would permit the bomb to be armed in flight.The first plutonium core, along with its polonium-beryllium urchin initiator, was transported in the custody of Project Alberta courier Raemer Schreiber in a magnesium field carrying case designed for the purpose by Philip Morrison. Magnesium was chosen because it does not act as a tamper. The core departed from Kirtland Army Air Field on a C-54 transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on July 26, and arrived at North Field July 28. Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were picked up at Kirtland on July 28 by three B-29s, two from the 393d Bombardment Squadron plus one from the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving on August 2.\n\n\n== Hiroshima ==\n\n\n=== Hiroshima during World War II ===\n\nAt the time of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of industrial and military significance. A number of military units were located nearby, the most important of which was the headquarters of Field Marshal Shunroku Hata's Second General Army, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan, and was located in Hiroshima Castle. Hata's command consisted of some 400,000 men, most of whom were on Kyushu where an Allied invasion was correctly anticipated. Also present in Hiroshima were the headquarters of the 59th Army, the 5th Division and the 224th Division, a recently formed mobile unit. The city was defended by five batteries of 7-cm and 8-cm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) anti-aircraft guns of the 3rd Anti-Aircraft Division, including units from the 121st and 122nd Anti-Aircraft Regiments and the 22nd and 45th Separate Anti-Aircraft Battalions. In total, an estimated 40,000 Japanese military personnel were stationed in the city.Hiroshima was a supply and logistics base for the Japanese military. The city was a communications center, a key port for shipping, and an assembly area for troops. It was a beehive of war industry, manufacturing parts for planes and boats, for bombs, rifles, and handguns. The center of the city contained several reinforced concrete buildings and lighter structures. Outside the center, the area was congested by a dense collection of small timber workshops set among Japanese houses. A few larger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city. The houses were constructed of timber with tile roofs, and many of the industrial buildings were also built around timber frames. The city as a whole was highly susceptible to fire damage. It was the second largest city in Japan after Kyoto that was still undamaged by air raids, primarily because it lacked the aircraft manufacturing industry that was the XXI Bomber Command's priority target. On July 3, the Joint Chiefs of Staff placed it off limits to bombers, along with Kokura, Niigata and Kyoto.The population of Hiroshima had reached a peak of over 381,000 earlier in the war but prior to the atomic bombing, the population had steadily decreased because of a systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese government. At the time of the attack, the population was approximately 340,000\u2013350,000. Residents wondered why Hiroshima had been spared destruction by firebombing. Some speculated that the city was to be saved for U.S. occupation headquarters, others thought perhaps their relatives in Hawaii and California had petitioned the U.S. government to avoid bombing Hiroshima. More realistic city officials had ordered buildings torn down to create long, straight firebreaks. These continued to be expanded and extended up to the morning of August 6, 1945.\n\n\n=== Bombing of Hiroshima ===\nHiroshima was the primary target of the first atomic bombing mission on August 6, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets. The 393d Bombardment Squadron B-29 Enola Gay, named after Tibbets' mother and piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, Tinian, about six hours' flight time from Japan. Enola Gay was accompanied by two other B-29s: The Great Artiste, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, which carried instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt, which served as the photography aircraft.\n\nAfter leaving Tinian, the aircraft made their way separately to Iwo Jima to rendezvous with Sweeney and Marquardt at 05:55 at 9,200 feet (2,800 m), and set course for Japan. The aircraft arrived over the target in clear visibility at 31,060 feet (9,470 m). Parsons, who was in command of the mission, armed the bomb in flight to minimize the risks during takeoff. He had witnessed four B-29s crash and burn at takeoff, and feared that a nuclear explosion would occur if a B-29 crashed with an armed Little Boy on board. His assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, removed the safety devices 30 minutes before reaching the target area.\n\nDuring the night of August 5\u20136, Japanese early warning radar detected the approach of numerous American aircraft headed for the southern part of Japan. Radar detected 65 bombers headed for Saga, 102 bound for Maebashi, 261 en route to Nishinomiya, 111 headed for Ube and 66 bound for Imabari. An alert was given and radio broadcasting stopped in many cities, among them Hiroshima. The all-clear was sounded in Hiroshima at 00:05. About an hour before the bombing, the air raid alert was sounded again, as Straight Flush flew over the city. It broadcast a short message which was picked up by Enola Gay. It read: \"Cloud cover less than 3/10th at all altitudes. Advice: bomb primary.\" The all-clear was sounded over Hiroshima again at 07:09.At 08:09, Tibbets started his bomb run and handed control over to his bombardier, Major Thomas Ferebee. The release at 08:15 (Hiroshima time) went as planned, and the Little Boy containing about 64 kg (141 lb) of uranium-235 took 44.4 seconds to fall from the aircraft flying at about 31,000 feet (9,400 m) to a detonation height of about 1,900 feet (580 m) above the city. Enola Gay traveled 11.5 mi (18.5 km) before it felt the shock waves from the blast.Due to crosswind, the bomb missed the aiming point, the Aioi Bridge, by approximately 800 ft (240 m) and detonated directly over Shima Surgical Clinic. It released the equivalent energy of 16 kilotons of TNT (67 TJ), \u00b1 2 kt. The weapon was considered very inefficient, with only 1.7% of its material fissioning. The radius of total destruction was about 1 mile (1.6 km), with resulting fires across 4.4 square miles (11 km2).Enola Gay stayed over the target area for two minutes and was ten miles away when the bomb detonated. Only Tibbets, Parsons, and Ferebee knew of the nature of the weapon; the others on the bomber were only told to expect a blinding flash and given black goggles. \"It was hard to believe what we saw\", Tibbets told reporters, while Parsons said \"the whole thing was tremendous and awe-inspiring ... the men aboard with me gasped 'My God'\". He and Tibbets compared the shockwave to \"a close burst of ack-ack fire\".\n\n\n=== Events on the ground ===\nPeople on the ground reported a pika (\u30d4\u30ab)\u2014a brilliant flash of light\u2014followed by a don (\u30c9\u30f3)\u2014a loud booming sound. Some 70,000\u201380,000 people, around 30% of the population of Hiroshima at the time, were killed by the blast and resultant firestorm, and another 70,000 were injured. It is estimated that as many as 20,000 Japanese military personnel were killed. U.S. surveys estimated that 4.7 square miles (12 km2) of the city were destroyed. Japanese officials determined that 69% of Hiroshima's buildings were destroyed and another 6\u20137% damaged.Some of the reinforced concrete buildings in Hiroshima had been very strongly constructed because of the earthquake danger in Japan, and their framework did not collapse even though they were fairly close to the blast center. Since the bomb detonated in the air, the blast was directed more downward than sideways, which was largely responsible for the survival of the Prefectural Industrial Promotional Hall, now commonly known as the Genbaku (A-bomb) dome. This building was designed and built by the Czech architect Jan Letzel, and was only 150 m (490 ft) from ground zero (the hypocenter). The ruin was named Hiroshima Peace Memorial and was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 over the objections of the United States and China, which expressed reservations on the grounds that other Asian nations were the ones who suffered the greatest loss of life and property, and a focus on Japan lacked historical perspective. The bombing started intense fires that spread rapidly through timber and paper homes, burning everything in a radius of 2 kilometers (1.2 mi). As in other Japanese cities, the firebreaks proved ineffective.\n\nThe air raid warning had been cleared at 07:31, and many people were outside, going about their activities. Eiz\u014d Nomura was the closest known survivor, being in the basement of a reinforced concrete building (it remained as the Rest House after the war) only 170 meters (560 ft) from ground zero at the time of the attack. He died in 1982, aged 84. Akiko Takakura was among the closest survivors to the hypocenter of the blast. She was in the solidly-built Bank of Hiroshima only 300 meters (980 ft) from ground-zero at the time of the attack.\n\nOver 90% of the doctors and 93% of the nurses in Hiroshima were killed or injured\u2014most had been in the downtown area which received the greatest damage. The hospitals were destroyed or heavily damaged. Only one doctor, Terufumi Sasaki, remained on duty at the Red Cross Hospital. Nonetheless, by early afternoon the police and volunteers had established evacuation centres at hospitals, schools and tram stations, and a morgue was established in the Asano library.Most elements of the Japanese Second General Army headquarters were undergoing physical training on the grounds of Hiroshima Castle, barely 900 yards (820 m) from the hypocenter. The attack killed 3,243 troops on the parade ground. The communications room of Chugoku Military District Headquarters that was responsible for issuing and lifting air raid warnings was located in a semi-basement in the castle. Yoshie Oka, a Hijiyama Girls High School student who had been mobilized to serve as a communications officer, had just sent a message that the alarm had been issued for Hiroshima and neighboring Yamaguchi, when the bomb exploded. She used a special phone to inform Fukuyama Headquarters (some 100 kilometers (62 mi) away) that \"Hiroshima has been attacked by a new type of bomb. The city is in a state of near-total destruction.\"Since Mayor Senkichi Awaya had been killed while eating breakfast with his son and granddaughter at the mayoral residence, Field Marshal Shunroku Hata, who was only slightly wounded, took over the administration of the city, and coordinated relief efforts. Many of his staff had been killed or fatally wounded, including a Korean prince of the Joseon Dynasty, Yi U, who was serving as a lieutenant colonel in the Japanese Army. Hata's senior surviving staff officer was the wounded Colonel Kumao Imoto, who acted as his chief of staff. Soldiers from the undamaged Hiroshima Ujina Harbor used Shinyo-class suicide motorboats, intended to repel the American invasion, to collect the wounded and take them down the rivers to the military hospital at Ujina. Trucks and trains brought in relief supplies and evacuated survivors from the city.Twelve American airmen were imprisoned at the Chugoku Military Police Headquarters, about 1,300 feet (400 m) from the hypocenter of the blast. Most died instantly, although two were reported to have been executed by their captors, and two prisoners badly injured by the bombing were left next to the Aioi Bridge by the Kempei Tai, where they were stoned to death. Eight U.S. prisoners of war killed as part of the medical experiments program at Kyushu University were falsely reported by Japanese authorities as having been killed in the atomic blast as part of an attempted cover up.\n\n\n=== Japanese realization of the bombing ===\n\nThe Tokyo control operator of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation noticed that the Hiroshima station had gone off the air. He tried to re-establish his program by using another telephone line, but it too had failed. About 20 minutes later the Tokyo railroad telegraph center realized that the main line telegraph had stopped working just north of Hiroshima. From some small railway stops within 16 km (10 mi) of the city came unofficial and confused reports of a terrible explosion in Hiroshima. All these reports were transmitted to the headquarters of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff.Military bases repeatedly tried to call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It was felt that nothing serious had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.The staff officer went to the airport and took off for the southwest. After flying for about three hours, while still nearly 160 km (100 mi) from Hiroshima, he and his pilot saw a great cloud of smoke from the bomb. After circling the city to survey the damage they landed south of the city, where the staff officer, after reporting to Tokyo, began to organize relief measures. Tokyo's first indication that the city had been destroyed by a new type of bomb came from President Truman's announcement of the strike, sixteen hours later.\n\n\n== Events of August 7\u20139 ==\n\nAfter the Hiroshima bombing, Truman issued a statement announcing the use of the new weapon. He stated, \"We may be grateful to Providence\" that the German atomic bomb project had failed, and that the United States and its allies had \"spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history\u2014and won\". Truman then warned Japan: \"If they do not now accept our terms, they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth. Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well aware.\" This was a widely broadcast speech picked up by Japanese news agencies.\n\nThe 50,000-watt standard wave station on Saipan, the OWI radio station, broadcast a similar message to Japan every 15 minutes about Hiroshima, stating that more Japanese cities would face a similar fate in the absence of immediate acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration and emphatically urged civilians to evacuate major cities. Radio Japan, which continued to extoll victory for Japan by never surrendering, had informed the Japanese of the destruction of Hiroshima by a single bomb. Prime Minister Suzuki felt compelled to meet the Japanese press, to whom he reiterated his government's commitment to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on.Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov had informed Tokyo of the Soviet Union's unilateral abrogation of the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact on April 5. At two minutes past midnight on August 9, Tokyo time, Soviet infantry, armor, and air forces had launched the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation. Four hours later, word reached Tokyo of the Soviet Union's official declaration of war. The senior leadership of the Japanese Army began preparations to impose martial law on the nation, with the support of Minister of War Korechika Anami, to stop anyone attempting to make peace.On August 7, a day after Hiroshima was destroyed, Dr. Yoshio Nishina and other atomic physicists arrived at the city, and carefully examined the damage. They then went back to Tokyo and told the cabinet that Hiroshima was indeed destroyed by a nuclear weapon. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, estimated that no more than one or two additional bombs could be readied, so they decided to endure the remaining attacks, acknowledging \"there would be more destruction but the war would go on\". American Magic codebreakers intercepted the cabinet's messages.Purnell, Parsons, Tibbets, Spaatz, and LeMay met on Guam that same day to discuss what should be done next. Since there was no indication of Japan surrendering, they decided to proceed with dropping another bomb. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have it ready by August 11, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if the bomb could be readied by August 9. Parsons agreed to try to do so.\n\n\n== Nagasaki ==\n\n\n=== Nagasaki during World War II ===\n\nThe city of Nagasaki had been one of the largest seaports in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of ordnance, ships, military equipment, and other war materials. The four largest companies in the city were Mitsubishi Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90% of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90% of the city's industry. Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate at night with AN/APQ-13 radar.Unlike the other target cities, Nagasaki had not been placed off limits to bombers by the Joint Chiefs of Staff's July 3 directive, and was bombed on a small scale five times. During one of these raids on August 1, a number of conventional high-explosive bombs were dropped on the city. A few hit the shipyards and dock areas in the southwest portion of the city, and several hit the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works. By early August, the city was defended by the 134th Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the 4th Anti-Aircraft Division with four batteries of 7 cm (2.8 in) anti-aircraft guns and two searchlight batteries.\n\nIn contrast to Hiroshima, almost all of the buildings were of old-fashioned Japanese construction, consisting of timber or timber-framed buildings with timber walls (with or without plaster) and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of timber or other materials not designed to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had been permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley. On the day of the bombing, an estimated 263,000 people were in Nagasaki, including 240,000 Japanese residents, 10,000 Korean residents, 2,500 conscripted Korean workers, 9,000 Japanese soldiers, 600 conscripted Chinese workers, and 400 Allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of Nagasaki.\n\n\n=== Bombing of Nagasaki ===\nResponsibility for the timing of the second bombing was delegated to Tibbets. Scheduled for August 11 against Kokura, the raid was moved earlier by two days to avoid a five-day period of bad weather forecast to begin on August 10. Three bomb pre-assemblies had been transported to Tinian, labeled F-31, F-32, and F-33 on their exteriors. On August 8, a dress rehearsal was conducted off Tinian by Sweeney using Bockscar as the drop airplane. Assembly F-33 was expended testing the components and F-31 was designated for the August 9 mission.\n\nAt 03:49 on the morning of August 9, 1945, Bockscar, flown by Sweeney's crew, carried Fat Man, with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the secondary target. The mission plan for the second attack was nearly identical to that of the Hiroshima mission, with two B-29s flying an hour ahead as weather scouts and two additional B-29s in Sweeney's flight for instrumentation and photographic support of the mission. Sweeney took off with his weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged.During pre-flight inspection of Bockscar, the flight engineer notified Sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use 640 US gallons (2,400 l; 530 imp gal) of fuel carried in a reserve tank. This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live. Tibbets and Sweeney therefore elected to have Bockscar continue the mission.This time Penney and Cheshire were allowed to accompany the mission, flying as observers on the third plane, Big Stink, flown by the group's operations officer, Major James I. Hopkins, Jr. Observers aboard the weather planes reported both targets clear. When Sweeney's aircraft arrived at the assembly point for his flight off the coast of Japan, Big Stink failed to make the rendezvous. According to Cheshire, Hopkins was at varying heights including 9,000 feet (2,700 m) higher than he should have been, and was not flying tight circles over Yakushima as previously agreed with Sweeney and Captain Frederick C. Bock, who was piloting the support B-29 The Great Artiste. Instead, Hopkins was flying 40-mile (64 km) dogleg patterns. Though ordered not to circle longer than fifteen minutes, Sweeney continued to wait for Big Stink for forty minutes. Before leaving the rendezvous point, Sweeney consulted Ashworth, who was in charge of the bomb. As commander of the aircraft, Sweeney made the decision to proceed to the primary, the city of Kokura.\n\nAfter exceeding the original departure time limit by nearly a half-hour, Bockscar, accompanied by The Great Artiste, proceeded to Kokura, thirty minutes away. The delay at the rendezvous had resulted in clouds and drifting smoke over Kokura from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. Additionally, the Yahata Steel Works intentionally burned coal tar, to produce black smoke. The clouds and smoke resulted in 70% of the area over Kokura being covered, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and exposing the aircraft repeatedly to the heavy defenses around Kokura, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese anti-aircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.With fuel running low because of the failed fuel pump, Bockscar and The Great Artiste headed for their secondary target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and would be forced to divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth agreed with Sweeney's suggestion that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured. At about 07:50 Japanese time, an air raid alert was sounded in Nagasaki, but the \"all clear\" signal was given at 08:30. When only two B-29 Superfortresses were sighted at 10:53, the Japanese apparently assumed that the planes were only on reconnaissance and no further alarm was given.A few minutes later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped instruments attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, urging him to tell the public about the danger involved with these weapons of mass destruction. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later. In 1949, one of the authors of the letter, Luis Alvarez, met with Sagane and signed the letter.At 11:01, a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed Bockscar's bombardier, Captain Kermit Beahan, to visually sight the target as ordered. The Fat Man weapon, containing a core of about 5 kg (11 lb) of plutonium, was dropped over the city's industrial valley. It exploded 47 seconds later at 1,650 \u00b1 33 ft (503 \u00b1 10 m), above a tennis court, halfway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south and the Nagasaki Arsenal in the north. This was nearly 3 km (1.9 mi) northwest of the planned hypocenter; the blast was confined to the Urakami Valley and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills. The resulting explosion released the equivalent energy of 21 \u00b1 2 kt (87.9 \u00b1 8.4 TJ). Big Stink spotted the explosion from a hundred miles away, and flew over to observe.\n\nBockscar flew on to Okinawa, arriving with only sufficient fuel for a single approach. Sweeney tried repeatedly to contact the control tower for landing clearance, but received no answer. He could see heavy air traffic landing and taking off from Yontan Airfield. Firing off every flare on board to alert the field to his emergency landing, the Bockscar came in fast, landing at 140 miles per hour (230 km/h) instead of the normal 120 miles per hour (190 km/h). The number two engine died from fuel starvation as he began the final approach. Touching down on only three engines midway down the landing strip, Bockscar bounced up into the air again for about 25 feet (7.6 m) before slamming back down hard. The heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control. Its reversible propellers were insufficient to slow the aircraft adequately, and with both pilots standing on the brakes, Bockscar made a swerving 90-degree turn at the end of the runway to avoid running off it. A second engine died from fuel exhaustion before the plane came to a stop.Following the mission, there was confusion over the identification of the plane. The first eyewitness account by war correspondent William L. Laurence of The New York Times, who accompanied the mission aboard the aircraft piloted by Bock, reported that Sweeney was leading the mission in The Great Artiste. He also noted its \"Victor\" number as 77, which was that of Bockscar. Laurence had interviewed Sweeney and his crew, and was aware that they referred to their airplane as The Great Artiste. Except for Enola Gay, none of the 393d's B-29s had yet had names painted on the noses, a fact which Laurence himself noted in his account. Unaware of the switch in aircraft, Laurence assumed Victor 77 was The Great Artiste, which was in fact, Victor 89.\n\n\n=== Events on the ground ===\n\nAlthough the bomb was more powerful than the one used on Hiroshima, its effects were confined by hillsides to the narrow Urakami Valley. Of 7,500 Japanese employees who worked inside the Mitsubishi Munitions plant, including \"mobilized\" students and regular workers, 6,200 were killed. Some 17,000\u201322,000 others who worked in other war plants and factories in the city died as well. Casualty estimates for immediate deaths vary widely, ranging from 22,000 to 75,000. At least 35,000\u201340,000 people were killed and 60,000 others injured. In the days and months following the explosion, more people died from their injuries. Because of the presence of undocumented foreign workers, and a number of military personnel in transit, there are great discrepancies in the estimates of total deaths by the end of 1945; a range of 39,000 to 80,000 can be found in various studies.Unlike Hiroshima's military death toll, only 150 Japanese soldiers were killed instantly, including 36 from the 134th AAA Regiment of the 4th AAA Division. At least eight Allied prisoners of war (POWs) died from the bombing, and as many as thirteen may have died. The eight confirmed deaths included a British POW, Royal Air Force Corporal Ronald Shaw, and seven Dutch POWs. One American POW, Joe Kieyoomia, was in Nagasaki at the time of the bombing but survived, reportedly having been shielded from the effects of the bomb by the concrete walls of his cell. There were 24 Australian POWs in Nagasaki, all of whom survived.\n\nThe radius of total destruction was about 1 mi (1.6 km), followed by fires across the northern portion of the city to 2 mi (3.2 km) south of the bomb. About 58% of the Mitsubishi Arms Plant was damaged, and about 78% of the Mitsubishi Steel Works. The Mitsubishi Electric Works suffered only 10% structural damage as it was on the border of the main destruction zone. The Nagasaki Arsenal was destroyed in the blast. Although many fires likewise burnt following the bombing, in contrast to Hiroshima where sufficient fuel density was available, no firestorm developed in Nagasaki as the damaged areas did not furnish enough fuel to generate the phenomenon. Instead, the ambient wind at the time pushed the fire spread along the valley.As in Hiroshima, the bombing badly dislocated the city's medical facilities. A makeshift hospital was established at the Shinkozen Primary School, which served as the main medical centre. The trains were still running, and evacuated many victims to hospitals in nearby towns. A medical team from a naval hospital reached the city in the evening, and fire-fighting brigades from the neighboring towns assisted in fighting the fires. Takashi Nagai was a doctor working in the radiology department of Nagasaki Medical College Hospital. He received a serious injury that severed his right temporal artery, but joined the rest of the surviving medical staff in treating bombing victims.\n\n\n== Plans for more atomic attacks on Japan ==\n\nGroves expected to have another \"Fat Man\" atomic bomb ready for use on August 19, with three more in September and a further three in October; a second Little Boy bomb (using U-235) would not be available until December 1945. On August 10, he sent a memorandum to Marshall in which he wrote that \"the next bomb ... should be ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after 17 or 18 August.\" Marshall endorsed the memo with the hand-written comment, \"It is not to be released over Japan without express authority from the President\", something Truman had requested that day. This modified the previous order that the target cities were to be attacked with atomic bombs \"as made ready\". There was already discussion in the War Department about conserving the bombs then in production for Operation Downfall, and Marshall suggested to Stimson that the remaining cities on the target list be spared attack with atomic bombs.Two more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on August 11 and 14, and Tibbets was ordered by LeMay to return to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to collect them. At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until August 16. Therefore, it could have been ready for use on August 19. Unable to reach Marshall, Groves ordered on his own authority on August 13 that the core should not be shipped.\n\n\n== Surrender of Japan and subsequent occupation ==\n\nUntil August 9, Japan's war council still insisted on its four conditions for surrender. The full cabinet met on 14:30 on August 9, and spent most of the day debating surrender. Anami conceded that victory was unlikely, but argued in favour of continuing the war nonetheless. The meeting ended at 17:30, with no decision having been reached. Suzuki went to the palace to report on the outcome of meeting, where he met with K\u014dichi Kido, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan. Kido informed him that the emperor had agreed to hold an imperial conference, and gave a strong indication that the emperor would consent to surrender on condition that kokutai be preserved. A second cabinet meeting was held at 18:00. Only four ministers supported Anami's position of adhering to the four conditions, but since cabinet decisions had to be unanimous, no decision was reached before it ended at 22:00.Calling an imperial conference required the signatures of the prime minister and the two service chiefs, but the Chief Cabinet Secretary Hisatsune Sakomizu had already obtained signatures from Toyoda and General Yoshijir\u014d Umezu in advance, and he reneged on his promise to inform them if a meeting was to be held. The meeting commenced at 23:50. No consensus had emerged by 02:00 on August 10, but the emperor gave his \"sacred decision\", authorizing the Foreign Minister, Shigenori T\u014dg\u014d, to notify the Allies that Japan would accept their terms on one condition, that the declaration \"does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign ruler.\"On August 12, the Emperor informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender. One of his uncles, Prince Asaka, then asked whether the war would be continued if the kokutai could not be preserved. Hirohito simply replied, \"Of course.\" As the Allied terms seemed to leave intact the principle of the preservation of the Throne, Hirohito recorded on August 14 his capitulation announcement which was broadcast to the Japanese nation the next day despite a short rebellion by militarists opposed to the surrender.In his declaration, Hirohito referred to the atomic bombings, and did not explicitly mention the Soviets as a factor for surrender:\n\nDespite the best that has been done by every one\u2014the gallant fighting of military and naval forces, the diligence and assiduity of Our servants of the State and the devoted service of Our one hundred million people, the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage, while the general trends of the world have all turned against her interest. Moreover, the enemy now possesses a new and terrible weapon with the power to destroy many innocent lives and do incalculable damage. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.\nSuch being the case, how are we to save the millions of our subjects, or to atone ourselves before the hallowed spirits of our imperial ancestors? This is the reason why we have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the joint declaration of the powers. \nIn his \"Rescript to the Soldiers and Sailors\" delivered on August 17, however, he stressed the impact of the Soviet invasion on his decision to surrender.\n\n\n== Reportage ==\n\nOn August 10, 1945, the day after the Nagasaki bombing, Y\u014dsuke Yamahata, correspondent Higashi, and artist Yamada arrived in the city with orders to record the destruction for maximum propaganda purposes, Yamahata took scores of photographs, and on August 21, they appeared in Mainichi Shimbun, a popular Japanese newspaper. Leslie Nakashima filed the first personal account of the scene to appear in American newspapers. A version of his August 27 UPI article appeared in The New York Times on August 31.Wilfred Burchett was the first western journalist to visit Hiroshima after the bombing, arriving alone by train from Tokyo on September 2. His Morse code dispatch, \"The Atomic Plague\", was printed by the Daily Express newspaper in London on September 5, 1945. Nakashima's and Burchett's reports were the first public reports to mention the effects of radiation and nuclear fallout\u2014radiation burns and radiation poisoning. Burchett's reporting was unpopular with the U.S. military, who accused Burchett of being under the sway of Japanese propaganda, and suppressed a supporting story submitted by George Weller of the Chicago Daily News. Laurence dismissed the reports on radiation sickness as Japanese efforts to undermine American morale, ignoring his own account published one week earlier.A member of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, Lieutenant Daniel McGovern, used a film crew to document the effects of the bombings in early 1946. The film crew shot 90,000 ft (27,000 m) of film, resulting in a three-hour documentary titled The Effects of the Atomic Bombs Against Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The documentary included images from hospitals showing the human effects of the bomb; it showed burned-out buildings and cars, and rows of skulls and bones on the ground. It was classified \"secret\" for the next 22 years.\nMotion picture company Nippon Eigasha started sending cameramen to Nagasaki and Hiroshima in September 1945. On October 24, 1945, a U.S. military policeman stopped a Nippon Eigasha cameraman from continuing to film in Nagasaki. All Nippon Eigasha's reels were confiscated by the American authorities, but they were requested by the Japanese government, and declassified. The public release of film footage of the city post-attack, and some research about the effects of the attack, was restricted during the occupation of Japan, but the Hiroshima-based magazine, Chugoku Bunka, in its first issue published on March 10, 1946, devoted itself to detailing the damage from the bombing.\n\nThe book Hiroshima, written by Pulitzer Prize winner John Hersey, which was originally published in article form in the popular magazine The New Yorker, on August 31, 1946, is reported to have reached Tokyo in English by January 1947, and the translated version was released in Japan in 1949. It narrated the stories of the lives of six bomb survivors from immediately prior to, and months after, the dropping of the Little Boy bomb. Beginning in 1974, a compilation of drawings and artwork made by the survivors of the bombings began to be compiled, with completion in 1977, and under both book and exhibition format, it was titled The Unforgettable Fire.The bombing amazed Otto Hahn and other German atomic scientists, whom the British held at Farm Hall in Operation Epsilon. Hahn stated that he had not believed an atomic weapon \"would be possible for another twenty years\"; Werner Heisenberg did not believe the news at first. Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker said \"I think it's dreadful of the Americans to have done it. I think it is madness on their part\", but Heisenberg replied, \"One could equally well say 'That's the quickest way of ending the war'\". Hahn was grateful that the German project had not succeeded in developing \"such an inhumane weapon\"; Karl Wirtz observed that even if it had, \"we would have obliterated London but would still not have conquered the world, and then they would have dropped them on us\".Hahn told the others, \"Once I wanted to suggest that all uranium should be sunk to the bottom of the ocean\". The Vatican agreed; L'Osservatore Romano expressed regret that the bomb's inventors did not destroy the weapon for the benefit of humanity. Rev. Cuthbert Thicknesse, the Dean of St Albans, prohibited using St Albans Abbey for a thanksgiving service for the war's end, calling the use of atomic weapons \"an act of wholesale, indiscriminate massacre\". Nonetheless, news of the atomic bombing was greeted enthusiastically in the U.S.; a poll in Fortune magazine in late 1945 showed a significant minority of Americans (23%) wishing that more atomic bombs could have been dropped on Japan. The initial positive response was supported by the imagery presented to the public (mainly the powerful images of the mushroom cloud). During this time in America, it was a common practice for editors to keep graphic images of death out of films, magazines, and newspapers.\n\n\n== Post-attack casualties ==\n\nAn estimated 90,000 to 140,000 people in Hiroshima (up to 39% of the population) and 60,000 to 80,000 people in Nagasaki (up to 32% of the population) died in 1945, though the number which died immediately as a result of exposure to the blast, heat, or due to radiation, is unknown. One Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission report discusses 6,882 people examined in Hiroshima, and 6,621 people examined in Nagasaki, who were largely within 2000 meters from the hypocenter, who suffered injuries from the blast and heat but died from complications frequently compounded by acute radiation syndrome (ARS), all within about 20\u201330 days. The most well known of these was Midori Naka, some 650 meters from the hypocenter at Hiroshima, who would travel to Tokyo and then with her death on August 24, 1945 was to be the first death officially certified as a result of radiation poisoning, or as it was referred to by many, \"Atomic bomb disease\". It was unappreciated at the time but the average radiation dose that will kill approximately 50% of adults, the LD50, was approximately halved, that is, smaller doses were made more lethal, when the individual experienced concurrent blast or burn polytraumatic injuries. Conventional skin injuries that cover a large area frequently result in bacterial infection; the risk of sepsis and death is increased when a usually non-lethal radiation dose moderately suppresses the white blood cell count.In the spring of 1948, the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) was established in accordance with a presidential directive from Truman to the National Academy of Sciences\u2013National Research Council to conduct investigations of the late effects of radiation among the survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1956, the ABCC published The Effect of Exposure to the Atomic Bombs on Pregnancy Termination in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The ABCC became the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), on April 1, 1975. A binational organization run by both the United States and Japan, the RERF is still in operation today.\n\n\n=== Cancer increases ===\nCancers do not immediately emerge after exposure to radiation; instead, radiation-induced cancer has a minimum latency period of some 5+ years and Leukemia some 2+ which peaks around 6\u20138 years later. Dr Jarrett Foley published the first major reports on the significant increased incidence of the latter among survivors. Almost all cases of leukemia over the following 50 years were in people exposed to more than 1Gy. In a strictly dependent manner dependent on their distance from the hypocenter, in the 1987 Life Span Study, conducted by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, a statistical excess of 507 cancers, of undefined lethality, were observed in 79,972 hibakusha who had still been living between 1958\u20131987 and who took part in the study. As the epidemiology study continues with time, the RERF estimates that, from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths which may include Sadako Sasaki and 11% of solid cancers of unspecificed lethality were likely due to radiation from the bombs or some other post-attack city effects, with the statistical excess being 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality. Both of these statistics being derived from the observation of approximately half of the total survivors, strictly those who took part in the study.\n\n\n=== Birth defect investigations ===\nWhile during the preimplantation period, that is 1\u201310 days following conception, interuterine radiation exposure of \"at least 0.2 Gy\" can cause complications of implantation and death of the human embryo. The number of miscarriages caused by the radiation from the bombings, during this radiosensitive period, is not known.\nOne of the early studies conducted by the ABCC was on the outcome of pregnancies occurring in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and in a control city, Kure, located 18 mi (29 km) south of Hiroshima, to discern the conditions and outcomes related to radiation exposure. James V. Neel led the study which found that the overall number of birth defects was not significantly higher among the children of survivors who were pregnant at the time of the bombings. He also studied the longevity of the children who survived the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, reporting that between 90 and 95 percent were still living 50 years later.While The National Academy of Sciences raised the possibility that Neel's procedure did not filter the Kure population for possible radiation exposure which could bias the results. Overall, a statistically insignificant increase in birth defects occurred directly after the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima when the cities were taken as wholes, in terms of distance from the hypocenters however, Neel and others noted that in approximately 50 humans who were of an early gestational age at the time of the bombing and who were all within about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) from the hypocenter, an increase in microencephaly and anencephaly was observed upon birth, with the incidence of these two particular malformations being nearly 3 times what was to be expected when compared to the control group in Kure, were approximately 20 cases were observed in a similar sample size.In 1985, Johns Hopkins University geneticist James F. Crow examined Neel's research and confirmed that the number of birth defects was not significantly higher in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Many members of the ABCC and its successor Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) were still looking for possible birth defects among the survivors decades later, but found no evidence that they were significantly common among the survivors, or inherited in the children of survivors.\n\n\n=== Investigations into brain development ===\n\nDespite the small sample size of 1,600 to 1,800 persons who came forth as prenatally exposed at the time of the bombings, that were both within a close proximity to the two hypocenters, to survive the in utero absorption of a substantial dose of radiation and then the malnourished post-attack environment, data from this cohort does support the increased risk of severe mental retardation (SMR), that was observed in some 30 individuals, with SMR being a common outcome of the aforementioned microencephaly. While a lack of statistical data, with just 30 individuals out of 1,800, prevents a definitive determination of a threshold point, the data collected suggests a threshold interuterine or fetal dose for SMR, at the most radiosensitive period of cognitive development, when there is the largest number of undifferentiated neural cells (8 to 15 weeks post-conception) to begin at a threshold dose of approximately \"0.09\" to \"0.15\" Gy, with the risk then linearly increasing to a 43% rate of SMR when exposed to a fetal dose of 1 Gy at any point during these weeks of rapid Neurogenesis.However either side of this radiosensitive age, none of the prenatally exposed to the bombings at an age less than 8 weeks, that is prior to synaptogenesis or at a gestational age more than 26 weeks \"were observed to be mentally retarded\", with the condition therefore being isolated to those solely of 8\u201326 weeks of age and who absorbed more than approximately \"0.09\" to \"0.15\" Gy of prompt radiation energy.Examination of the prenatally exposed in terms of IQ performance and school records, determined the beginning of a statistically significant reduction in both, when exposed to greater than 0.1 to 0.5 Gray, during the same gestational period of 8\u201325 weeks. However outside this period, at less than 8 weeks and greater than 26 after conception, \"there is no evidence of a radiation-related effect on scholastic performance.\"The reporting of doses in terms of absorbed energy in units of (Gy and rad) rather than the use of the biologically significant, biologically weighted Sievert, in both the SMR and cognitive performance data is typical. The reported threshold dose variance between the two cities, is suggested to be a manifestation of the difference between X-ray and neutron absorption, with Little Boy emitting substantially more neutron flux, whereas the Baratol that surrounded the core of Fat Man, filtered or shifted the absorbed neutron-radiation profile, so that the dose of radiation energy received in Nagasaki, is mostly that from exposure to x-rays/gamma rays, in contrast to the environment within 1500 meters of the hypocenter at Hiroshima, were instead the in-utero dose more depended on the absorption of neutrons, which have a higher biological effect per unit of energy absorbed. From the Radiation dose reconstruction work, which were also informed by the 1962 BREN Tower-Japanese city analog, the estimated dosimetry at Hiroshima still has the largest uncertainty as the Little Boy-bomb design was never tested before deployment or afterward, therefore the estimated radiation profile absorbed by individuals at Hiroshima had required greater reliance on calculations than the Japanese soil, concrete and roof-tile measurements which began to reach accurate levels and thereby inform researchers, in the 1990s.Many other investigations into cognitive outcomes, such as Schizophrenia as a result of prenatal exposure, have been conducted with \"no statistically significant linear relationship seen\", there is a suggestion that in the most extremely exposed, those who survived within a kilometer or so of the hypocenters, a trend emerges akin to that seen in SMR, though the sample size is too small to determine with any significance.\n\n\n== Hibakusha ==\n\nThe survivors of the bombings are called hibakusha (\u88ab\u7206\u8005, Japanese pronunciation: [\u00e7ibak\u026f\u0325\u0255a]), a Japanese word that literally translates to \"explosion-affected people\". The Japanese government has recognized about 650,000 people as hibakusha. As of March 31, 2019, 145,844 were still alive, mostly in Japan. The government of Japan recognizes about 1% of these as having illnesses caused by radiation. The memorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki contain lists of the names of the hibakusha who are known to have died since the bombings. Updated annually on the anniversaries of the bombings, as of August 2019, the memorials record the names of more than 500,000 hibakusha; 319,186 in Hiroshima and 182,601 in Nagasaki.If they discuss their background, Hibakusha and their children were (and still are) victims of fear based discrimination and exclusion when it comes to prospects of marriage or work due to public ignorance about the consequences of radiation sickness or that the low doses that the majority received were less than a routine diagnostic x-ray, much of the public however persist with the belief that the Hibakusha carry some hereditary or even contagious disease. This is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects/congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of the nuclear weapons used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or indeed has been found in the later conceived children of cancer survivors who had previously received radiotherapy.\nThe surviving women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that could conceive, who were exposed to substantial amounts of radiation, went on and had children with no higher incidence of abnormalities/birth defects than the rate which is observed in the Japanese average.\nA study of the long-term psychological effects of the bombings on the survivors found that even 17\u201320 years after the bombings had occurred survivors showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and somatization symptoms.\n\n\n=== Double survivors ===\nPerhaps as many as 200 people from Hiroshima sought refuge in Nagasaki. The 2006 documentary Twice Survived: The Doubly Atomic Bombed of Hiroshima and Nagasaki documented 165 nij\u016b hibakusha (lit. double explosion-affected people), nine of whom claimed to be in the blast zone in both cities. On March 24, 2009, the Japanese government officially recognized Tsutomu Yamaguchi as a double hibakusha. He was confirmed to be 3 km (1.9 mi) from ground zero in Hiroshima on a business trip when the bomb was detonated. He was seriously burnt on his left side and spent the night in Hiroshima. He arrived at his home city of Nagasaki on August 8, the day before the bombing, and he was exposed to residual radiation while searching for his relatives. He was the first officially recognized survivor of both bombings. He died on January 4, 2010, at the age of 93, after a battle with stomach cancer.\n\n\n=== Korean survivors ===\n\nDuring the war, Japan brought as many as 670,000 Korean conscripts to Japan to work as forced labor. About 5,000\u20138,000 Koreans were killed in Hiroshima and another 1,500\u20132,000 died in Nagasaki. For many years, Korean survivors had a difficult time fighting for the same recognition as Hibakusha as afforded to all Japanese survivors, a situation which resulted in the denial of the free health benefits to them in Japan. Most issues were eventually addressed in 2008 through lawsuits.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\n\n\n=== Hiroshima ===\nHiroshima was subsequently struck by Typhoon Ida on September 17, 1945. More than half the bridges were destroyed, and the roads and railroads were damaged, further devastating the city. The population increased from 83,000 soon after the bombing to 146,000 in February 1946. The city was rebuilt after the war, with help from the national government through the Hiroshima Peace Memorial City Construction Law passed in 1949. It provided financial assistance for reconstruction, along with land donated that was previously owned by the national government and used for military purposes. In 1949, a design was selected for the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the closest surviving building to the location of the bomb's detonation, was designated the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was opened in 1955 in the Peace Park. Hiroshima also contains a Peace Pagoda, built in 1966 by Nipponzan-My\u014dh\u014dji.\n\n\n=== Nagasaki ===\n\nNagasaki was also rebuilt after the war, but was dramatically changed in the process. The pace of reconstruction was initially slow, and the first simple emergency dwellings were not provided until 1946. The focus on redevelopment was the replacement of war industries with foreign trade, shipbuilding and fishing. This was formally declared when the Nagasaki International Culture City Reconstruction Law was passed in May 1949. New temples were built, as well as new churches owing to an increase in the presence of Christianity. Some of the rubble was left as a memorial, such as a torii at Sann\u014d Shrine, and an arch near ground zero. New structures were also raised as memorials, such as the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, which was opened in the mid-1990s.\n\n\n== Debate over bombings ==\n\nThe role of the bombings in Japan's surrender, and the ethical, legal, and military controversies surrounding the United States' justification for them have been the subject of scholarly and popular debate. On one hand, it has been argued that the bombings caused the Japanese surrender, thereby preventing casualties that an invasion of Japan would have involved. Stimson talked of saving one million casualties. The naval blockade might have starved the Japanese into submission without an invasion, but this would also have resulted in many more Japanese deaths.Japanese historian Tsuyoshi Hasegawa argued that the entry of the Soviet Union into the war against Japan \"played a much greater role than the atomic bombs in inducing Japan to surrender because it dashed any hope that Japan could terminate the war through Moscow's mediation\". A view among critics of the bombings, that was popularized by American historian Gar Alperovitz in 1965, is the idea of atomic diplomacy: that the United States used nuclear weapons to intimidate the Soviet Union in the early stages of the Cold War. Although not accepted by mainstream historians, this became the position in Japanese school history textbooks.Those who oppose the bombings give other reasons for their view, among them: a belief that atomic bombing is fundamentally immoral,  that the bombings counted as war crimes, and that they constituted state terrorism.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nLike the way it began, the manner in which World War II ended cast a long shadow over international relations for decades to come. By June 30, 1946, there were components for only nine atomic bombs in the US arsenal, all Fat Man devices identical to the one used in the bombing of Nagasaki. The nuclear weapons were handmade devices, and a great deal of work remained to improve their ease of assembly, safety, reliability and storage before they were ready for production. There were also many improvements to their performance that had been suggested or recommended, but that had not been possible under the pressure of wartime development. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy had decried the use of the atomic bombs as adopting \"an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages\", but in October 1947, he reported a military requirement for 400 bombs.The American monopoly on nuclear weapons lasted only four years before the Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb in September 1949. The United States responded with the development of the hydrogen bomb, a nuclear weapon a thousand times as powerful as the bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Such ordinary fission bombs would henceforth be regarded as small tactical nuclear weapons. By 1986, the United States had 23,317 nuclear weapons, while the Soviet Union had 40,159. By 2017, nine nations had nuclear weapons, but Japan was not one of them. Japan reluctantly signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in February 1970, but it is still sheltered under the American nuclear umbrella. American nuclear weapons were stored on Okinawa, and sometimes in Japan itself, albeit in contravention of agreements between the two nations. Lacking the resources to fight the Soviet Union using conventional forces, the Western Alliance came to depend on the use of nuclear weapons to defend itself during the Cold War, a policy that became known in the 1950s as the New Look. In the decades after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States would threaten to use its nuclear weapons many times.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPresent dayAre Nagasaki and Hiroshima still radioactive? \u2013 No. Includes explanation.Decision\"Order from General Thomas Handy to General Carl Spaatz authorizing the dropping of the first atomic bomb\".

          "The castle is located a 15-minute walk from the Peace Park. The construction of the castle ended between 1592 and 1599. At that time it was the largest castle in Western Japan. The area around the Delta of the Ota river was called \"Carp Bay\", so the castle was nicknamed \"Carp",
          "Visited the castle as part of our 3 day stay in Hiroshima, part of the grounds are free and to view and climb the castle was 370\u00a5. A great view from the top but the castle itself was more like a museum with many samurai swords and interactive displays. Well worth the few \u00a5 to",
          "A small but, very well presented museum housed in the rebuilt castle. The grounds tell an interesting story while, the artifacts in the museum are exceptional. It doesn't require more than a morning to see all but, is certainly worth a visit.",
          "The surrounds are lovely and good to stretch your legs - but if short of time I would not consider this a highlight. I walked it from Peace Park - seemed short distance - but wasn't'. From here wasn't too far to Shukkeien Garden from memory - and that is worth the visit.",
          "Not much to do here but walk by unless you're keen to pay for admission to get into the refurbished castle for a price.",

          "This is the reconstructed version of the destroyed castle but it is a wonderful building with good exhibition.",
          "Walked to the castle but didn't enter due to time constraints. The exterior is well maintained, along with the traditional moats that surround the castle. Can get some good pictures from the outside without entering.",
          "There are centuries of history behind Hiroshima Castle, but that was destroyed by the A-bomb in 1945. What has now been rebuilt looks gorgeous from the outside, but it is obvious from the inside that it is now a modern concrete-and-steel museum. For international tourists, the",

          "The structural shape of Japanese castles is broadly similar so as we had already visited Matsumoto castle were just looked at this one from the castle gardens. Very photogenic in its setting within the old castle ruined stone walls. If you visit Japan do go inside a castle and",
          "Hiroshima castle is very beautiful. The moat has carp in it and the castle grounds are very pretty- especially in cherry blossom season. You can go inside one of the reconstructed gates for free. The main castle tower itself has lots of exhibits inside and is really interesting.",
          "The castle was totally destroyed with the atomic bomb. The city took it upon itself to rebuilt the castle from original plans and now is a real sight to behold.",
          "It's a rebuild, naturally, after the atomic bomb. Good displays of Samurai outfits and swords. Very nice grounds too.",
          "The castle was not so big but the grounds around was huge. Inside it was fascinating that they provided information in English via headphones. There were costumes on display which they allowed you to dress up in to take photos. We enjoyed the beautiful view and breeze on the top",
          "This castle was destroyed in the atomic blast and rebuilt in the 1950's to its original form. You realise that the people in those days were somewhat shorter than us as a few bumps to head testify. The grounds are immaculate, the buildings have magnificent timber interiors. You",
          "The castle was rebuilt after the dropping of the bomb flattened Hiroshima. It is in large grounds in the centre of the city. We were here at cherry blossom time and in the evening the castle was lit up with changing colours and music was played, in the grounds there was an art",
          "You can get there by taking either the Orange Route or Lemon Route bus of the Hiroshima Sightseeing Loop Bus. It is not too far away from the Shukkeien Garden. There was a minimal charge to enter. It was not crowded unike the Osaka Castle. The view of Hiroshima looked amazing",

          "We saw 4 castles in Japan this being the last one on our trip. Even tho it's completely reconstructed and smaller than Himeji Osaka or Nagoya it has its own charm. The inside is full of interesting stuff. You can also wear kimonos and samurai armour for a few photos.",
          "We did not go in the castle itself, but the grounds were very beautiful. Of course the castle is not the original thanks to the atomic bomb.",
          "What an amazing building. It looks like it was built centuries ago. It is in fact a replica of the original which was destroyed by the atomic bomb. Nice grounds. You can walk around along the river and get some stunning views or go in the castle gardens and get a close up",
          "Ad this is only a 15 min stroll from the busy attractions associated with the bombing of Hiroshima we were surprised this place was almost unvisited - which is a real shame as aid what had become an ultra modern city this is a gorgeous reconstructed medieval castle which is just",
          "Visited the castle as part of an outdoor art series where the castle was illuminated at night... Beautiful but watch your step",
          "It was the first time I saw a Japanese castle and I was all excited, so new and classic, I don\u2019t mind it\u2019s a remake of the old one, it doesn\u2019t need to be ancient to be pretty in my eyes, I like it like it is, with its youth and inexperience.",
          "The entrance fee for adults is 370 \u00a5. The building itself might not be original (it had to be rebuilt after the atomic bomb in 1945), but it looks beautiful nevertheless. Inside where a lot of old things displayed, that were from the original castle or from the different eras",
          "The building is so pretty outside, but, inside there is nothing japanese in there, is a little expostion of samurai clothes, etc... the cool part is that you can go out at the top of the building and have a nice views.. 380\u00a5 fee entrance",
          "Just before you enter the castle grounds is a large 'moat' with some huge carp. You can buy food to feed them which is fun. The grounds of the castle are interesting - there are a number of trees with markers to indicate that they survived the bomb blast and how far away from",
          "There is an excellent museum inside the castle. There are five floors nad when you get to the top you can go outside and get great views in all directions. They have mounted telescopes in each direction. Definitively worth visiting.",
          "It is a relatively small castle with five floors and there are quite a few steps to climb to get to the fifth fllor which is observation area. It has good history of hiroshima, castle, life and culture of the city etc",
          "Large outer area while the castle itself is a small resconstruction after the Hiroshima-Bombing. Lovelier to see from outside, go in if you are interested in a bit of feudal history and artefacts.",
          "From the outside the castle looks very grand and traditional. Was slightly disappointed with the museum inside. Lots of steps to get to the top where you can step outside and walk all the way round with good views.",
          "Good Castle w interesting displays. Good location in the city and part of the Peace Park experience. It is a post WWII reconstruction. Not nearly as impressive as Himeji Castle or some others but convenient and worthwhile. Much easier to traverse than other castles. I like",
          "While Himeji Castle may appear majestic and glistening white, Hiroshima Castle also looks stunning and insta-worthy. Even without entering it, we enjoyed strolling in the gardens leading to the main entrance and taking in the views. Nice to visit in the morning when it's less",
          "Very interesting castle with unique aged wooden lattice slats making up the face of building.Beautifully illuminated as a beacon inside the surrounding castle walls at night. Historical remains for view inside remaining main tower,and surrounding garden area dedicated to ruins",
          "one of the landmark well preserved from the past. Giving insight into the past and the old way of living.",
          "Hiroshima castle has lovely grounds, a couple of watch towers and a peaceful moat - not bad for a city that experienced an atomic bomb.",
          "This is a pretty interesting castle. The building and grounds are beautiful and interesting. Inside, there are 5 floors of exhibits covering the castle, the area, and life back in the day. I particularly enjoyed the samurai swords. Note that the English signage stops on the 2nd",
          "Like a few other sights, this was not open during the new year holiday period! Sob! Still able to view this building from the outside - impressive.",
          "Great- easy to get to- covers history of hiroshima. Although simple - made to appeal to general population. Great views from the top floor- external access to top roof provides vista over Hiroshima",
          "What a great introduction to castles in Japan. The grounds were extensive and lovely while the castle itself was brilliant (with so much to see inside too). There was even a traditional headdress to try on! The view from the top was great, I just stayed up there for ages.",
          "A good Castle located in the gardens of Hirsoshima and near the Atomic Bomb Done. I found this not the be the most exciting castle. However there are some great photos to be taken here. Only a small admission fee to go into castle",
          "We were at Himeji Castle earlier so did not go into this one, just a photo stop as it is on the Tourist bus loop and we did not have the time. Nice park & grounds to visit & take pics.",
          "In our recent Hiroshima trip, Hiroshima Castle is our first stop for a short visit and photo shoot. This is a nice Castle in the city. We have been to Japan many times and have came across several castles before, this castle is smaller and less grand than the others. But it has",
          "The castle was completely demolished in 1945 by the atomic bomb. It has since been rebuilt as magnificent restoration and is a great example of the meticulous care that the Japanese have taken to never lose touch of their antiquity. The castle is called Carp Castle because",
          "It is not the most spectacular castle in Japan but if you are in town go and have a look. It is not an original and therefore I did not go into the castle itself). This is my time in the grounds of the castle and I would always recommend it if you have time.",
          "A small entry fee, although there are lots of info board in English, there are many without any. It's a fantastic view from the top, even if you're not really into the history of it. It's an ok place, but not something I would describe as a must-do.",
          "Only visited the grounds and outside- absolutely stunning. Did not go in as heard that it was overly rennovated and modernised and therefore does not capture the feel of the original building. I believe the history within the castle is excellent though and if I had more time I",
          "This is a well made replica of the original castle. It has many artifacts from that era including samurai costumes, swords, guns, etc. the bonus is the view of the city from the top floor balcony. Highly recommend.",
          "this castle was rebuilt after it was affected by the atomic blast. been to many castles in japan, but this was worth the visit. on the castle grounds is a tree that survived the blast and still blooms",
          "Yes, the castle was destroyed from the Atomic Bomb and had to rebuilt, and yes the castle won't be the most impressive you'll see in Japan. However, it does have some benefits. MUSEUM Inside you'll find a museum containing swords, reconstructions of rooms, samurai information,",
          "You can visit, but do not put your expectations too high. The museum part is not done in an interesting way.",
          "It took me around one and half hour by shinkansen from Osaka Station to Hiroshima Station. Then from Hiroshima Station you can hop on a JR sightseeing bus and it will take another 30 minutes to reach Hiroshima castle. The castle is actually reconstructed after being destroyed by",
          "We loved walking through the castle and seeing the awesome work that went into building this piece of history. I recommend everyone if they get a chance to visit the castle.",
          "Was plenty to look at and has alot of history attached. Lots to read as you wander around inside. Only certain floors where photos are allowed. This Casle has been hughley renovated so its not what you would expect inside as all walls are are lined with photos etc, no view",
          "what an amazing castle. allow heaps of time. steep steps to climb so not suitable for wheelchair access or prams. once you finally get to the top there are views to die for. a must to visit,",
          "The castle grounds are really beautiful and you can go inside the rebuilt structure to view exhibits on Samurai history. The views outside of the windows are really gorgeous. There are plenty of colorful carp in the moat that you can feed. I would definitely recommend a stop",
          "I understand that the castle was destroyed and rebuilt after the A bomb hit Hiroshima, however I was extremely disappointed with this. The outside looked lovely, it looked like nothing had happened to it. Really beautiful to look at and see how the castle would have looked.",
          "This castle is a prominent tourist stop in the city of Hiroshima. It was demolished in the World War with the atomic bombing. Access to the castle is through beautifully landscaped gardens with trees, some of which withstood the bombing and some of which were destroyed, their",
          "My room in the Rihga Royal Hotel overlooked the Castle and adjacent park lands so I navigated my way through the underground walkways to tour the park and view the castle from the outside. I was amused to see locals playing a version of golf in the wooded areas of the park using",
          "Interesting castle with nice grounds to stroll through. The castle itself costs 300 yen, and makes for a somewhat interesting visit. You can lift a samurai sword (which is pretty cool) and the view from the top level is interesting. I enjoyed the grounds. There are some",
          "The Hiroshima castle is a beautiful building not too big like the castles in Europe. It has 5 floors, each floor has expositions about samurais armoury, weapons, the history around the castle, has video and audio. Some parts it is possible to take pictures some others are not",
          "We didn't expect a museum inside the castle but it was well done explaining the history of the town as a center for the ruling family. Hiroshima means \"wide island \" and has many swords, one you can actually handle, traditional warrior armor you can try on and traditional",
          "Hiroshima Castle isn't as grand as Himiji of course but it was better than I expected. It was reconstructed after WW2 but it's still a fine castle with traditional Japanese castle construction. The Castle is five-stories and was built out of concrete and wood. Not at all",
          "We visited the castle twice as we missed the opening hours. It was great -filled with old artifacts. No photographs were allowed. There\u2019s an observation deck which is caged off at the top. Definitely worth a visit or two! The area has what remains of living quarters after the",
          "Beautiful to look at, did not go in as had to be else where, observation deck within. Surrounding gardens a little drab which is a shame.",
          "This Castle is surrounded by moats with a huge compound including a Shrine. The remain of the East Tower is at the far end of the compound. The main tower was destroyed during the first atomic bombing. The Castle is within 10 mins walk from the Hiroshima Bus Centre.",
          "Okay to be clear, this is the rebuilt Hiroshima Castle, using both traditional and modern techniques. The most interesting element of this castle is that it contains a museum detailing the history of Hiroshima from its origin as a castle town built to control the Seto sea to the",
          "This place is good for learning the history of Hiroshima as well as getting a 360 degree view of the city. Unfortunately, at the higher levels, all the exhibits only had information in Japanese. There were QR codes to obtain information in other languages. However, they only",
          "We arrived in the mist and entered this authentic castle which has 5 levels and incredible armour and costumes from the time. Well worth the visit as it opened our eyes to ancient fortifications and the ancient war of the times.",
          "It was being rebuilt since the original one was being destroyed during the atomic bomb, it wasn't the exact replica but it still gave out the Japanese styled castle back in the Edo era. Beautiful view at the top. Shame that there were not much descriptions displayed in English.",
          "Lovely beautiful castle in the heart of Hiroshima, 10 minutes walk from the Atomic Bomb dome, really nice green place!",
          "Liked the walk through the park with remains from World War II but we decided not to enter the castle. Sorry to say it was a bit disappointing to look at this comparing visiting other historic sites in Japan. (Did not take a photo of castle). Maybe if sun had been shining - but",
          "It was a relief to distract myself by visiting this rcastle which was rebuilt in 1958 after the original was destroyed in the Hiroshima bombing. It now serves as a museum and you can do things like try on replica Samuri armour and generally play around. It was a good distraction.",
          "Visit the hiroshima castle if you have extra time in hiroshima. The castle nothing much to see if you have been to better castles in japan such as Himeij castle. The entrance fee is expensive as well.",
          "Nice location and interesting place to visit. Original building sevearly damaged in bombing and castle rebuilt to its former glory. Contains many displays of Japanese historical artifacts spread over the several floors of the building. Quite a climb to the top but the view once",
          "There are a lot of meh reviews about this but it is definitely worth a visit, we loved it. Having been to lots of castles in Japan, this one is a) the easiest to go up and come down that we\u2019ve been to b) has the most additional information that we\u2019ve seen in send of exhibits.",
          "We were on a castle hunt adventure and Hiroshima castle was one of the most beautiful castle in our opinion. Unlike other castles, the exterior of this castle is made by wood. If you like historic sites, then you should give this castle a visit.",
          "The castle was rebuilt with original aesthetics retained where possible. Lots of photos and exhibits to see and once you reach the top floor, you are rewarded with a brisk refreshing breeze and great views across the city.",
          "Beautiful built wooden castle that shape looks like carp, hence it is called Rijo/\u9bc9\u57ce. Ri\u9bc9 stands carp, ko\u57ce means castle. Like other Japanese castles, it is buit inside small river io prevent the enemy to get in. The castle offers the river ride by \u904a\u89a7\u8239yuransen, it might be worth",
          "If you plan to go here you have to go to the tower. It is a long way up but there is so much history on each floor. The grounds are beautiful and there is a lot of history outside. If you go in the summer stop at 7/11 and get water. You will thank me later.",
          "As an English speaking tourist, and widely traveled at that, we do not presume that others will speak or be able to communicate in English, we make the effort, enquire, point a lot, learn a bit of the local language, and work lots of stuff out. Our reading of local script is",
          "The entrance fee isn't expensive and it is worth. Before entering the main castle with tickets, you could visit the free building. it is interesting to see the how it looks for the old Japanese. On the 2nd floor, you could try the \"noble kimono\" for free. The queue was not long",
          "I went to the Hiroshima castle without expecting too much, honestly though, it was much better than I thought and had a fantastic time learning about its past and the fact the castle was reconstructed after the atomic bomb! Well worth the visit, and if you time it right you can",
          "Visited Hiroshima Castle today, I can\u2019t say that I would recommend it to others. I\u2019m sure people that can read Japanese get more out of the visit, unfortunately all the articles on display are captioned only in Japanese so not much for us to do except wander around and look at",
          "As it is part of the history of Hiroshima it is worth the visit. As with most \"castles\" we visited don't expect too many artifacts, if any, inside. There are a few steps up to the castle and then a few more inside, but you are rewarded with a good view from the top.",
          "We visited numerous castles in Japan. This is very well maintained but not for the faint hearted. Numerous steps both up and down so if you are tall watch your head as some parts are a bit low. Great views and landscaping. Be prepared to spend some time here as there was lots to",
          "We only visited the remains of the Hiroshima Castle as it was on our trail. To be honest, I was expecting a little more but it's the ruins and that's all it is. Should I go: if you have plenty of time then yes. Should I make time: NO. Would I recommend it: if it's not out of",
          "Like the rest of Hiroshima the castle was rebuilt after the bomb. There are some foundations left in the grounds, but I could only find one sign in English so you have to make educated guesses. You can climb to the top of the castle and step out for the view .. but it\u2019s summer",
          "The museum itself isn\u2019t worth the entrance fee. Explanations are given in a very oldfashioned and superficial way, many explanations are in Japanese only. The view from the tower is quite nice, though.",
          "The castle is a nice contrast to the far more know peace site. It give some longer historical perspective which is nice",
          "Used to be the highest point in the city. The castle was completely destroyed in WW2 but rebuilt to its old form after the war. A good place to visit if you are interested in ancient castle.",
          "I loved this castle. There were outfits to try on and wonderful people to help. There was a balcony to see the city.",
          "This castle can be hard to locate of you use google maps or apple maps. For some reason, both will guide you to the shrine instead. How to find it one may ask? Just looked up and enjoy the garden. U will see it once u reached the ruins of the military HQ. The castle is",
          "The castle is nice and has a good view of the city, it\u2019s mostly inside until you get to the top, the inside is a small museum which is nice, there a fair few stairs and no elevator so keep that in mind. Was cheap to get into.",
          "It\u2019s a nice castle, where you can get to the top and have a good view of the city. I will not recommend to take a boat trip.",
          "Another great place to visit on your tour around Hiroshima , not far from Shukkei-en gardens 10 min walk, and you come to the Tori gate which leads you into the gardens which as you walk through you will see the castle , built in the 14th century this large wooden building has 5",
          "Not as grand a castle as places like Osaka Castle, but if you find yourself in Hiroshima, this castle should be on your list!",
          "Ok castle but we\u2019ve seen more of them through Japan (for free) that were more impressive. The park around the castle needs some more green, we didn\u2019t like it.",
          "My family loves history, so when we went to Osaka, a day trip to the Hiroshima area was included. We got on the shinkansen from Osaka to Hiroshima and from the station got on the hop on hop off bus (Lemon line) using our JR pass. We were so pleased to find out that it was the",
          "This is an old castle that is now a samuri museum. It s five stories with a lot of artifacts. They are doing construction on the front of the building. They have a few costumes you can try on for fun! It is relatively cheap admission around 200 yen",
          "From the top of the castle, but that\u2019s it, and even this is not really recommendable. Not worth going in my opinion. The inside has been turned into a museum and nothing is original anymore, except for the exhibited articles of course (was the same for other castle)... if you",
          "You often hear about the castles in Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo, Hiroshima does not seem to get much of a mention... we visited Hiroshima and Osaka and much preferred this castle over Osaka. It is a few floors smaller but the content is far superior! And not as crowded... definitely",
          "Not a large castle, but the displays are interesting. The castle is surrounded by a moat which is original, but the castle is reconstructed. Good displays of samurai swords. Views from the top are good. The grounds are pleasant for a nice walk but not outstanding. Worth a look",
          "The castle is a small keep after a long walk. Its actually better from the outside of the castle ground than inside. The castle grounds remind more of a park than anything else. You are way better off going to Himeji which isnt that far away with the shinkansen.",
          "The castle is about a 10-15 minute walk from the tram stops, it\u2019s very easy to spot so you won't get lost trying to get to it. Not as big as I thought it would be. But still a good way to spend some free time in Hiroshima. You do have to pay to g in the castle tower museum which",
          "lot of stars but great views and somewhat interesting albeit not a lot of English translations. Easy to get to and well worth the time.",
          "There are a lot of exhibits you can touch, unlike many historical museums. You can try on a Samurai worrier costume and in another place, hold a nihontou (Japanese long sword). There is a section where you can learn how nihontou are forged, and other facts about them. Pros:",
          "The castle is a rebuilt replica of the original castle. Plenty of historic items and info inside. Half English half not which kind of made it a little difficult at times. The sword display they have in pretty great. We were there when they were cleaning them and the gentleman",
          "We really liked the castle - it\u2019s a museum on the inside and is modernised now after it\u2019s been rebuilt. Tells the story of those that ruled here and has a samurai exhibition area too - you can even hold a samurai sword!",
          "The castle is reconstructed ( 1958 ) as the original was leveled off in 1945. One can see some stones from the original castle. At the time of our visit, the base of the castle was under repair. The admission fee to see the castle tower is 370 \u00a5 ( seniors over 65 with proof of",
          "Only the moat & the wall to the Inner Bailey (plus a few trees) survived the atomic blast just a short distance away. The castle keep has been nicely reconstructed albeit in modern materials. With the rexonstruction one can get a feel for what was there. Inside the castle",
          "Huge Castle in the center of Hiroshima and only a 15 minutes walk from the A-dome. The castle which was originally built in 1559 was destroyed by the A-bomb in 1945 . It was rebuilt in 1958 in ferro-concrete but with attractive wooden exteriors. The main building is 5 stories",
          "The castle is really beautiful. The entrance is cheap and there is a small museum inside where you can see some japanese armors or traditional interiors. We could also dress like a samurai and it was really fun. The area of the castle is very beautiful.",
          "lovely architecture, very similar design to other castles visited, a real fortress, stunning views of Hiroshima, even got to wear traditional head gear",
          "This is all new and rebuilt but not with original materials, so it lacks some charm. The original was destroyed when the bomb hit.",
          "You can wander around the grounds of the castle free of charge but it is worth paying the entrance fee and actually seeing all the castle has to offer. There is a reduced fee for seniors but take your passport. There are several levels inside with lots of exhibits and",

          "There was some reno in front of the castle when we visited, but the exhibits inside were very educational and surrounding was beautiful. Worth a look!",
          "The castle grounds are free to explore, so think of it as a park. The castle keep is a reconstruction, and its exterior is attractive. The museum inside charges an entrance fee, but it was a disappointment. See review by \"geckopoo\" from about a week ago as I would simply",
          "The paid section is simply just the Castle Tower. The other areas are open for free to the public. The inside area offers more surprises than you imagine. Even though it does not look like it, the inside of the tower is pretty spacious. The exhibits went up to the 5th floor so",
          "I really loved wandering this castle's grounds, seeing the museum, and taking lots of photographs. Hiroshima is an easy city to walk in and see. Everything is easily accessible and this is one of the best cities I have been in for pedestrian tourism. The castle grounds have",
          "Beautiful architecture and grounds in this mostly reconstructed castle. Little was left post the Atomic bomb of the original. Still it told the history of the area of Hiroshima from the Shogun era to the present day. The grounds were lovely but we were unable to explore",
          "This castle is a beautiful place to walk around and enjoy the gardens and firsts buildings. Not mandatory to pay and enter the museum which is not the most interesting, at least after an impressive visit at the memorial park.",
          "We visited this location as part of an organised tour of Japan. The original wooden structures were destroyed in the blast, but have been returned to original. We spent a lovely hour walking around the gardens and buildings, looking at the exhibits and just enjoying the spring",
          "There are small video clips to listens to about the history of the castle. Interesting building with a long history",
          "I found the digital guide on the history of the castle very interesting and actually funny and the Samurai swords on floor three quite impressive.",
          "Although it looks similar to other castles in Japan, its is much different than most. The focus inside this castle is more on the history of the areas and the geopolitical history of its sorounding. There are many audiovisual elements and you may learn about the history of the",
          "We went there with an aim to visit the castle but when we reach, it somehow didn\u2019t seem to be that impressive as compared to other castles we visited previously. So focus was diverted to cheryl blossom viewing. Lots of cherry blossom tree around and I saw many local having",
          "Don\u2019t want to sound harsh but we are \u2018castle-o-philes\u2019 and have always loved visiting Japanese castles over the last few years. I guess this was the bottom of our list as we did not expect a genuine castle to remain standing in Hiroshima after the bombing 71 years ago. Make no",
          "Hiroshima castle is definitely one of the better castles in Japan particularly because there is a lot of effort put into English translations which I really appreciated. There is a stunning view from the top too.",
          "A place to visit , very easy to get there with the loop bus from JR company. It is not a long visit, about hour with the temple close to the castle and another small castle",
          "Pay to go in and check out the view from the top. Pretty cool to see how difficult the river/moat made it for intruding clans. It gives history of the samurai and clans who have occupied the castle at various times.",
          "At first we thought that it is just another castle, but we were positively surprised to see that there is an exhibition inside. It has information about the history of the castle but you can also see various weapons. There is a corner where you can try on some traditional",
          "I suppose I have been spoilt for seeing Castles in Japan. Hiroshima isn\u2019t as impressive as the others. However if you are doing the hop on hop off it is a worthwhile stop. There are plenty of samurai swords and traditional samurai dress on display",
          "Although the castle is nice and the grounds are worth walking around, it\u2019s not the best example of the architecture around. As it was rebuilt after the atomic bombing it\u2019s also not that old, so I\u2019d recommend getting the train to Kyoto which is inundated with much nicer castles,",
          "Beautiful grounds full of stunning cherry blossom. The inside doesnt feel so authentic as its newly built but a lovely view from the top. Nice to take a picnic and enjoy the grounds.",

          "Hiroshima Castle is pretty photogenic from the outside, so it's worth taking pictures of if you're in the area. However, the inside of the castle is just a basic museum--lots of swords and armor, it's kind of boring--and the view from the top of the castle isn't really all that",
          "This is by far a pretty castle. Set in amongst the expansive castle grounds, it towers above with birds eye views to the surrounds. We took a bus here, and it\u2019s a short walk from the bus stop. The grounds surrounding the castle are easily accessible on foot.",
          "Hate to say it, but if you have been inside one castle you have been in them all. Its usually just a small museum inside. That being said my son got to try on the samurai gear inside and it was really cute.",
          "I really enjoyed visiting the castle, absolutely stunning! The museum was about 500 yen a person and worth the money. Well organized, lots of info about early castle town history, samurais, and tapestry. Plus the view at the top is incredible!",

          "Honestly, I'm not sure I would pay to go into the castle again. It's really beautiful from the outside, to be sure, but on the inside there is no English. This makes it hard for travelers to really understand what they're seeing. The view at the top would be a redeeming factor,",

          "Hiroshima Castle is a must see and easy walk from the World Heritage A-Bomb dome and Peace Park. A small entrance fee opens the visitor to a wealth of historical information and artefacts. One floor is dedicated to swords and a must see for the weapons enthusiast. A fun",
          "After visiting Matsumoto Castle, which was excellent we had slightly different expectations about what we'd see here (granted we didn't really research this particular stop). The surrounds of the castle are beautiful and superbly maintained. You could sit and watch the birdlife",
          "in japan,it has 100 castle,i only visit 5 of them in my trip,different castle have their own history,the top of the castle,you can see the city view,i bought the gold coin of the castle for memory",
          "Although the castle is small, the view on the top is spectacular. However you have to climb up 5 flights of stairs to get there. Each level of the castle has exhibits, such as the history of Hiroshima and some Samurai swords and armor. Worth a visit if you are in the area.",
          "We had a little time to spare and visited for about 1/2 an hour. It was a bit of a waste of time as it really didnt have much in it except a nice view from the top.",
          "This castle was an interesting place to visit. There are 5 floors, so not suitable for anyone with mobility issues. You can't take pictures, except in designated areas. There is an opportunity to dress like a samurai, which was fun. As you go higher up the floors, there is less",
          "Wonderful view of the castle around the moat. Suggest going in the evening when it\u2019s all lit up and the crowds have vanished.",
          "This was ok, went for a look. While all of the displays are interesting, a majority are in Japanese with no English translation. So was difficult to enjoy and learn. The view from the top level is worth the walk up though.",
          "Not really impressive castle, you can enter the pagoda only which acts as a museum. Unfortunately the exhibits are widely explained in Japanese language only. The view from the top of the pagoda is not very impressive, too. You can visit much better castles in Japan for sure.",
          "This was a bit underwhelming... Little room you can walk around in upstairs. If you are short on time would be better to go to Shukkei-en Garden instead.",
          "This might not be the biggest or the castle with most gold in Japan, but it's the best one I've seen so far. Plus you can actually take a good picture from the top, there isn't any fence or glass which block the good picture.",
          "As this is a rebuilt and restored Hiroshima Castle as the original was destroyed in the Hiroshima Bombing, only the outside appears like the original. The inside is a museum about the castle. Not a must while in Hiroshima, other Japanese cities have original castles which are",
          "Not a bad castle I think over 5 levels being a rebuild after the bomb not authentic but you get a good idea of how Japanese castle would have looked in the day. I really liked the grounds and lakes/moat around the castle. If I was seeing other castle in japan like in Osaka and",
          "My wife and I went to the castle but it was only so so. Nothing of significant interest. We would have much preferred to take the ferry near the Atomic Dome to the Island.",
          "This is a very old museum with many modern touches. The collections are dated and not in a good way. I would skip this. It was difficult to understand the history as too many names and dynasties are mentioned in the videos",
          "This castle (being a reconstruction of the original that was destroyed by the atomic bombing,) feels somewhat less authentic due to the modern staircases from level-to-level (compared to my recollection of Himaji Castle from years ago). That said, they have a very nice",
          "More than just the Castle. The grounds and water way was nice. There is a side building with examples of architecture. Historical in ancient times and near present day.",
          "The museum in the day time is very cheap and covers 5 levels inside the castle going over the history of the building (note that it was rebuilt after 1945), its uses and various bits of information about the people and Meiji restoration. At night, the castle grounds are still",
          "I got to Hiroshima castle after open time but it looked beautiful. I managed to take some pictures and walk around the park.",
          "I visited a few parts of Japan on this trip, and besides temples, another thing I saw quite a few of was castles. They are pretty impressive structures, each with their distinct characteristics and historical significance.",
          "Pretty small castle and not much to see/do. The castle grounds can be nice though and you can have soft serve ice cream while strolling the place",
          "The reconstructed castle looks almost authentic to me, except for some of the timber areas. The original was unfortunately destroyed by the atomic bomb. The castle is nothing new since it\u2019s similar to another one which we have been to. We are here for the sword and gun",
          "If you have never visited Japanese Castle, then please visit. If you did, please skip going up as the scenery from the top is not so nice. Just walking in the park seeing the castle is enough. Please imagine that there are many military buildings around here before the 2nd world",
          "I didn't actually go inside the castle - it costs about 300 Yen to see the museum and go up to the viewpoint but I can imagine that the views are amazing. The surrounding park is free to enter and a very nice place for a stroll.",
          "The castle area is a careful reconstruction of the original set in elegant parkland. Giant koi circle the moat, and are drawn to visitors with the expectation of food. A tree that survived the atomic blast is an amazing icon.",
          "This is a fairly standard Japanese castle, gorgeous on the outside and set up like a modern museum exhibit on the inside. This has always been somewhat disappointing to me as someone who prefers an authentic-looking reconstruction or ruin over a museum display, but it is still",
          "I went to the castle not to see inside, but to see the chrysanthemum display which was one of the best I saw during this trip. As well as the standard specimen blooms, which can be a bit boring all lined up in rows, there was a great tableau made of chrysanthemums, featuring",
          "We saw pictures of this while touring the peace gardens. We crossed the river and were able to follow convenient signage to what we thought was the castle. lt turned out to be the fort that we assumed guarded the castle. A short walk further and the ancient castle came into",
          "After Himeji Castle with is a poor relation however there are good views from it, if the weather is good. there is not that much English signage but still you get the idea of what it is all about.",
          "The day we visited, it was free to enter. Normally there is a small charge. There was no elevator, so it was necessary to climb the stairs to reach the top. It was not required to remove shoes. On each level there were interesting exhibits. At the top there is a balcony on the",
          "Visited on my way to the Peace Park. It was rather small, but well maintained. Good to spend an hour or so when you come by it, but not a must visit in Hiroshima.",
          "Just your typical castle in almost every major cities. This is not the original castle as the original was flattened by the A-bomb too. There's just a little museum inside the castle with most exhibits that has nothing to do with the castle. Good thing is that its free entry. If",
          "Hiroshima castle was a bit of a walk to get to and heaps of stairs to walk, so if you are unstable not a good option. Interesting to see but most of the displays are in Japanese especially the Samurai uniforms, so it was hard to determine dates etc. I was glad l saw it, as it",
          "Supposed to be the best hotel in hiroshima and walking distance from the railway station.Located in one side of a big square in front of the station Good rooms and excelent food.",
          "Hiroshima Castle provides a beautiful view of the Hiroshima skyline on the very top of the castle. Inside there's a museum that showcases some weapons, clothing, artwork etc. dating back to the 1600s. Although the original castle was destroyed by the atomic bomb in world war 2,",
          "This look like a traditional japanese castle and it is...however inside it is a very concrete steel structure which is a shame but the views from the top are good and the garden and moat are impressive. Its good for architecture and view to top but not inside..",
          "The castle is just ok, especially when you visit the one in Osaka and Himeji. But if you\u2019re in Hiroshima it\u2019s one of the things to do.",
          "Quite a beautiful castle on the outside although the entrance was in reconstruction when I visited back in Oct. Great view from the top of the castle, seeing the whole of Hiroshima city. On the outside grounds, there are remnants of the old moat & some survivor trees of the",
          "The castle has a interesting look from the outside but you can take a few pictures and head on your way. It's not worth going in as no information is in English.",
          "The most beautiful if this castle is the outside, specially at night, inside has become a museum, you can try a samurai armor and a kimono. It didnt look to me like a real one but nice. And you can go to the top ti have a view of the city.",
          "Awesome Jews of the city and park below. The climb is a bit tough, but there's lost of historical exhibitions on each floor",
          "It\u2019s not himeji castle but still worthwhile visit. Need at least 90minutes from the moment you get off the bus or train.",
          "Hiroshima Castle, sometimes known as the Carp castle is a 5 storey castle that is built on a flat area in the middle of the city. It was the first castle we saw that was not built on a hill. The castle was surrounded by a moat and seemed to be a popular place for boating. We did",
          "Enjoyed the exhibition on Hiroshima Castle. To my surprise, the original castle was actually destroyed during the world war 2 atomic bomb bombing. Castle was reconstructed and for tourist to visit. A good place to visit on a rainy day.",
          "Looking for something a little lighter in mood after a morning at the Peace Park we hoped on the free loop bus and made our way to the castle. It's lovely and the gardens that surround it are worth a stroll. The castle is under repair but it is still beautiful even with the",
          "Once you've visited the Peace Museum and park, there's very little else to do in Hiroshima as a tourist (although you'd think the site of August 1945's nuclear blast would be enough). Anyway, I did visit the castle. It was OK. Flattened by that blast, this is a reconstruction.",
          "The castle features a very good viewing platform with great views over Hiroshima down town. The exhibition is, well, an exhibition of some old stuff, now presented once again. The building as such is bery beautiful buy",
          "This is a museum with a TON of historical info. Highly enjoyable and informative but we didnt stop at every single exhibit. Lots to see and take in here. Lots of stairs as well, but worth the climb. Even tried on samurai hats for some pics. A nice walk and a fun spot after the",
          "The castle has been rebuilt since the war in its original position. There is a pleasant walk through the moated enclosure to reach the castle, with foundations of destroyed military buildings left in place.. On the Sunday that we were there, the park was being used by many",
          "It is great inside and out. You can see many ancient artifacts, samurai swords and you can also try samurai outfits, like samurai armour and also Haori and also the other one for female (I forgot the name). The entrance is cheap, you can also buy a lot of souvenir items. Staffs",
          "The outside is a great building the inside is a museum with no remnants of the original building. It is a bit of a bait and switch.",
          "Worth visiting the museum in the tower. But there are a lot of stairs so not suitable for people with walking disabilities. Most exhibits don't have English information.",
          "This castle is stunning, like every castle in Japan you need to admire the intricacies and history- this one is special when you can find the tunnels where the bomb survivors sheltered. The tree standing at the entrance is a gentle reminder about the history of Japan, Hiroshima",
          "You can pay a small fee to enter the castle and walk through the exhibits on each floor up to the top which offers a great view of the city. Worth a visit if you have the time and can be reached on the JR Loop bus from Hiroshima station. No photos allowed inside with the",
          "They were renovating outside, but still the part what you can see of the castle, was beautiful. Museum was ok inside the castle and there was lot of things also in English. The view was the best thing!",
          "The castle in the city center. It is surrounded by a wall is a very nice replica of the original castle. It is open only until 6 pm. From the outside offers a nice view on the old Japanese architecture.",
          "The grounds and the castle are not as spectacular as Osaka Castle but what you have to remember is that it was destroyed by the A bomb. It has been rebuilt and contains a small museum and some great views from the top of the castle.",
          "Hiroshima castle was, obviously, destroyed by the atomic bomb dropped on the city. It was rebuilt years later and serves as a museum. I'd really recommend visiting after dark as the castle is lit and gives an eerie reflection.",
          "It is under construction for the upcoming olympics surge of visitors. The intended target of the first A bomb the old air raid bunker is still visible. The tower contains interesting images and history of the castle. A great view of the city from the top.",
          "Well worth a visit for the budding historian in you, obviously it's a rebuilt castle but a castle nonetheless. Very cheap entry.",
          "Surrounded by a moat, its entrance is pretty picturesque. The walk to the actual castle allows you up to 10 minutes walk time and see some other small structures. The main castle is on higher ground with not much room to fit within a photo. If early enough, you get the chance to",
          "This castle is a typical Japanese Castle with some pieces of history inside it. On the top, it is possible to get wonderful views over the city. In group, the cost is lower.",
          "This castle was reconstructed in 1958 as it stands today after being destructed in the atomic bomb. The view from the top is spectacular, just be prepared to climb the 5 flights of stairs. Lots of history on each floor to view if you need a rest between floors ! Now a museum",
          "The Hiroshima castle which had been affected by the A bomb was rebuilt 13 years later after the bomb. It's interesting to see a few trees still standing and not wiped out by the bomb. What a miracle. When we went, the castle was undergoing restorations and there was building",
          "I'd read some very harsh reviews on here about the museum so decided to check it out as I'd been looking at it outside my hotel window. 1. It is a reconstruction so no not the original like other castle in Japan but the rough idea and layout can still be understood. 2. The",
          "Some interesting pieces in the museum inside and a look at Hiroshimas history before the atomic bomb. The top floor allows great views of the city",
          "What a mess the outermost gardens are. Also the buildings are all obviously new since the bomb and are externally old looking but inside are modern and new looking. Don't waste your time it's for school kids to do projects at not a good place to be.",
          "Got off the loop bus to visit here only to find it is little more than park land with some course of stones marking out where it used to exist. There is nothing in the tourist literature that explains this.",
          "Only viewed this castle from the outside. Worth the walk through it if you have time to spare and you've seen all the other tourist sights.",
          "Hiroshima Castle is a pleasant experience but after seeing similar era castles in nearby cities, eg Himeji, Hiroshima didn't quite compare. Worth a visit if you have plenty of time. If time is limited focus on the Peace Park.",
          "This is a reproduction of the original castle. There are many photographs of the construction of the castle. The inside is quaint. Not much in the way of English information. It took us less than 30 minutes to get through everything. I'd give it a miss, if you're pressed for",
          "Hiroshima castle is beautiful building with nice garden. I didn't visit inside the castle because I was told by the other travelers there's not that much to see. But I'm sure for the ones who are really into castles and history would enjoy the insides of the castle as well.",
          "We went to the castle on a very hot summer day. It was quite a long walk from the Peace Memorial Park, but on a normal day it's a nice walk. We had chosen to visit the castle on a too hot day though. The combination of the heat and smog was extreme. If you chose to go to",
          "This castle, as it stands now is a rebuild of the structure destroyed by the atomic blast in 1945. If you have not visited an authentic castle, by all means visit this one if you are in the area. A great selection of ancient armor, lots of places to take your own photos at a",
          "A must see when in Hiroshima, the caste is beautiful and such a nice place to walk around. Well worth the visit.",
          "We visited on an extremely hot day and some of the buildings were exceptionally hot with little air circulation. Not as much to see as at many of the other Shrines and palaces e.g. in Kyoto, but worth a quick drop in.",
          "It was interesting to see and learn the history of the castle. I loved exploring all these. Just note it closes early, so morning visits are probably better.",
          "Hard to believe that this was preserved after many of them had been burnt. A few steps to get up to the top, well worth it.",
          "Nice building in a peaceful park with a shrine. Best part was riding the electric bikes. It was 36 Celsius and 90% humidity - riding was better than walking when hardly any pedalling required Did not go in the castle - entry fee and too hot",
          "Walking around in front of and inside the castle walls is a great experience. It takes you back to the times of the Samurais and really makes you wanna travel back in time to be able to see this in its prime time. Must have been so magnificent!",
          "The Hiroshima castle was rebuilt following the A-bomb, and as such, has been rebuilt with electric doors, and doesn't contain the lustre of other attractions within Japan. It's definitely walking the grounds and looking at the buildings and the style of how they've been",
          "the castle Keep is a lovely place to visit, there is a small entrance fee but worth it as the museum exhibits within are excellent, especially the Samurai swords on display. Also there is an outdoor observation deck on the top floors where you get great views over the city.",
          "Like numerous other buildings the castle did not survive the atomic bomb so is a re-creation of the original version. Not withstanding that, it is yet another picturesque Japanese castle and they are all a little different from each other. Lots of wooden steps to climb to get to",
          "This is a nicely restored castle which primarily showcases the architecture of the building and grounds. But the true value of the experience for the traveling tourist, is the many story-boards within the castle, which paint a vivid picture of the historical keynotes of the",
          "Beautiful grounds and the castle is worth the effort to go to the top. Be warned, there are lots of stairs. Wonder the grounds and explore, its gorgeous.",
          "Typical castles preserved here in Japan., but the highlight for us was the kimono and men's wear free to be worn for pictures., also for the Samurai's suit., which was really heavy :) The view from the top floor overlooking the area and the lake was also beautiful. Recommended",
          "The castle was rebuilt three times (the second time is just a short wooden resurrection during an expo event), and considering this the building is quite new. Thus, they had made the castle more interesting by providing us with more information of its construction history and",
          "The building is beautiful from the outside and the grounds are great to look around. Inside the museum was not what we were expecting and we did not find much of interest. The entry fee is not too bad but if we could do it again we would just enjoy the outside grounds.",
          "Really enjoyed the castle. Certainly much better than the Tokyo Imperial castle. Wonderful way to see old Japanese structures.",
          "Although this is a rebuild ( I'm sure I read that) after all it is Hiroshima, the history of the building and of the military and life style both with in its walls and around is interesting Somewhere in the grounds is a giant eucalyptus tree yes it survived the bomb",
          "We went here because of the awesome look of the castle. From the outside, it looks great. It was not busy so it was easy to get a picture with no other people in it. On the inside you pay to go up the many levels. It is basically a museum explaining what the castle and grounds",
          "There are several historical things to see inside the castle but not much. You can climb up to the top and on a hot day it feels good because there's a nice breeze that comes through. When you get back down you can take a picture with the warrior head piece. That was the coolest",
          "I wandered here at 5am, my bus arrived early morning from Osaka. From there i strolled peacefully around absorbing the views. As it was early i couldn't go inside. However, i did get to see fish and cats.",
          "The building is interesting and looks good from the outside. However, inside it looks as if designed 40 years ago. Some interesting facts and artefacts, no photography. Presentation totally outdated.",
          "The entrance and the tower are very good presentations of the period and had to be rebuilt. The artifacts are very nice but the majority are not explained in English. The view from the top is very nice. With that being said it was a long day, it was hot and it was our last",
          "The original castle is ruined, but it is worth to pay a visit to the castle. I enjoyed walking around and enjoyed the green. By the way, there is a shrine inside the compound, but you need to go early before it closed. Well, I seen the nice sunset.",
          "The castle is located near the Hiroshima city center and our first stop upon reaching here. We took the orange bus and reach here within 10 mins from Hiroshima sta. There is a discount from the 370 yen with our JR Pass. We entered via the Omote Gate, and walked past the",
          "We all enjoyed our visit to this castle. The exhibits inside were very interesting. The location is nice too since it is right along the river. The cherry blossoms were beautiful while we were there too.",
          "What's good The campus is beautiful and castle itself stands proudly at the top. What's not good Not the most decorated castle but given Hiroshima's history it is indeed something to watch. What to do Stroll around. Castle is on four floors and for a fee you are allowed to",
          "A good place to visit for an hour or so. It was cool to see the history exhibits inside. Must see if you are interested in history.",
          "Castle area is gorgeous and very nice to see. The area has beautiful grounds and the castle is nice inside and out.",
          "The castle is located near the city center. It costs 370 yen and cash only. The castle is a rebuilt and has exhibits items from pre-ww2. The observation at the top was quite nice :). The garden below the castle makes a nice walk as well.",
          "Interesting collection on display but bear in mind that everything in this city including this 'castle' despite what it appears in age is in,y 70 years old as everything was essentially wiped out in 1945.",
          "There was a lot of information inside but unfortunately it was mostly in Japanese and we couldn't understand it. It was still really interesting to see the weapons and armour of old! I would t suggest a visit if you have trouble with stairs however, as there are many and it's",
          "Took a walk around the ruins and what is left of the castle today. It's amazing how much is left but gone as a result of the bomb. The castle itself is very impressive. Not open of course at 0630 but I figured this is the best time particularly for photos as the light dappled on",
          "This building is a reproduction of the one that did not survive the A bomb. It is in a pretty setting. There is a small fee upon entry.",
          "An impressive building containing some interesting artefacts. Some particularly impressive uniforms and swords. Recommended",
          "The first place you come to on your bus tour and from here you can walk to the memorial park and other monuments. Many steps to climb as these buildings were built to oversee the city. We travelled by train from Osaka and there is a free tourist bus to take you from the station.",
          "Not the most impressive of the Japanese castles, but has some interesting artifacts of Shogun times. You can climb to the top passing exhibits on each level, and there's a little cinema show included.",
          "Despite my travel weary legs, I loved every minute of our visit here. Each level had interesting exhibits and the view from the top was stunning. To top off our day, entry was free as it was a memorial day. Tragic that it was destroyed in WW2 but has been beautifully rebuilt.",
          "We loved this castle, way better than the bigger, grander Osaka castle. Firstly - far fewer tourists, plus cheap entry, good exhibits, loads of swords & even (no extra charge) a samurai-type armour outfit to dress up in for a selfie! Even though it was a wet day we really",
          "As with most other Japanese cities, Hiroshima Castle was the headquarters from which its territory was ruled before the Meiji era. A big water-filled moat greets you as you cross into the parklands then to the castle itself. No queues or crowds to speak of but plenty of stairs",
          "After such devastation so happy to see such ancient history rebuilt as feel it is so important. Well worth a walk around",
          "We were late and so couldn't really get inside. However, we got some great pictures at Hiroshima Castle with the sun setting. It looks so tall and mighty with its bold upbent roof corners (perfectly Japanese). A sight to behold.",
          "There is a cost to enter but it is worth it. You can on the ground floor of the castle dress up like a samori and take pictures of yourself and friends. There is lots of armor and other neat stuff, but you can't take pictures of them. There is a nice view at the top whcih is",
          "We got into this town a bit late but still wanted to squeeze in some sight seeing so we walked over after sunset. It was so peaceful and beautiful. The grounds were open but the shrine and castle unfortunately were closed. But the trade off was that we pretty much got the whole",
          "This building was destroyed during the war and was rebuilt to its original exterior appearance. The inside is totally accessible to visitors and you can see the traditional architecture from inside and out. Inside is set up like a museum of the artifacts from the prime days of",
          "Was interesting to see this complex - historic reconstruction in the midst of other modern buildings and roads. The grounds are very nice - we did not go in since there was an festival going on.",
          "The castle was a five minute walk from our hotel. Once we settled in, we started there. The entrance over the moat is beautiful, as is the castle itself. Some of the grounds needed a bit of tending - rare for a Japanese attraction. But it was quiet and pleasant, and the castle",
          "What more to say \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 (370\u00a5 entrance fee/ most explanations in Japanese only/ nice view from the top floor/ pic free of charge)",
          "This is a large Castle made of wood and stands four floors high. You can see Hiroshima from the top. There is also a replica of the Palace there reconstructed in 1956. Its free to enter the site.",
          "I went to see Hiroshima Castle just before we took the train back to Kyoto in the evening, so I had a chance to see how it look in the dark. When the darkness falls they turned the ground lights on and because of the location, the castle looks like a shiny guardian on the",
          "Hiroshima Castle was originally built in the late 1500s and looks like a lot of castles from that era. It's different in the sense that it and everything else for miles around was wiped from the face of earth in August 1945 by the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima by the US in an",
          "It was beautifully rebuilt and has spectacular views of the city. It is very touristy and most of the descriptions are in Japanese, but it is worth the visit if you have the time. There are lots of steps so plan to wear comfortable shoes. There are also display items for",
          "There are more beautiful castles in Japan, and there are better places to see in Hiroshima. That said, if you have time, it is not bad. On the grounds, there are three trees that miraculously survived the nuclear bomb.",
          "We were looking for something to fill an afternoon in Hiroshima and were pleasantly surprised by the keep at Hiroshima castle. The keep is in the far corner of the castle grounds and is filled with lots of interactive displays using different mediums, from videos (available in",
          "The castle offers good overview of the historical development and changes of authority in that area. Also good overview of historical battle and defense methods.",
          "The original castle was destroyed by the Atom bomb and this is a painstaking reconstruction. Set in the centre of a moated area which it shares with a temple and it contains an interesting museum.",
          "Castle with moat, you get to walk through the building (take your shoes off); and then up 5+ stories to get a great view of the city. While rebuilt since the bomb drop - it is a great site to see. We met a \"minister\" who was there and made some origami animals for my daughter",
          "It's a must place to see and enjoy cherry trees around the castle area. You can walk around free. If you want to see the main keep then you have to pay 370 yen.",
          "Climb a few steps to get there but very worth it. The grounds were very nice and there is a moat. So happy to see one and that people use them",
          "The castle has been converted into multiple floors of glass cased artifact museum with an entry fees of 370 \u00a5 Good experience While you are there you can also visit the shrine which is in the same compound",
          "My husband, 14-year-old daughter and I visited the Hiroshima Castle on our recent trip to Japan in March. The castle was originally built in the 1500s but, like most of Hiroshima, was destroyed by the atomic bomb in WWII. The current castle is, however, a faithful",
          "We were in Hiroshima when the Sakura was in full bloom. We cycled to the castle and as we approached the main gate we were greeted with lots of sakura trees. The compound surrounding the castle was filled with gardens of flowers. Covered by the sakura trees, we could hardly see",
          "The gardens surrounding the castle are quite nice. There's a body of water with giant carp and turtles in it. The castle itself is alright - the artifacts are interesting but the explanations are mainly in Japanese so you are really just looking at objects without a story behind",
          "The castle is set in a moat contained park, so is a very beautiful place to wander around on a sunny day! Recommend.",
          "The Castle it's situated 20 min walking far from the memorial park or dome. Obviously Reconstructed after the second war it's one of the must visit in Hiroshima. If you are looking to visit inside it's open until 6 pm but the last entrance it's until 5:30 !",
          "A rebuilt castle in the middle of a lake can only be seen from a distance not visited - not worth the effort",
          "A great little island (surrounded by a moat) to visit. Has loads of things to see.. From trees that survived the blast, original stones from the castle, and of course, the beautiful and big castle itself. It is now a museum. Even if you're not keen on being in a museum, the view",
          "We walked round the outer most and didn't go i the castle but made a nice antidote to the peace park",
          "Hiroshima Castle is in an absolutely beautiful spot in lovely Hiroshima, on the water and surrounded by trees. The grounds are beautiful to walk around. We paid to go up into the castle. It was maybe 400-500 yen each. The artifacts were neat and some of the info was translated",
          "Although this is the reconstructed castle, but they not lost their glory. Hiroshima castle is the proof of the Japanese architecture achievement in the Samurai era. Its better to go there during the sakura's blooming periods to get more pure Japanese feeling.",
          "What a great place but not for the faint heated if your wanting to go to the top floor there's steep steps and your in your socks makes the knees wobble a bit",
          "The atomic bomb pretty much wiped out all the history of this place. If you have time in Hiroshima, it's a nice walk, but really big much to see.",
          "The castle was rebuilt after the atomic bomb. It's a new style building covers with Japanese castle style outside. You can find history of the area and why the castle was built. It exhibits objects in the past with English explanation.",
          "We got here very late, after they stopped selling tickets to go into turret and castle (4 pm-ish) And if weather is good, bring a picnic, very nice grounds. We hung around for sunset, nice pics of castle in sunset colors. They had 3 food trucks there too, must try the mashed",
          "After visiting the atomic bomb dome, we headed over to the castle just a little north of the site. Just as the rest of the city, Hiroshima castle was destroyed by the atomic bomb and it is reconstructed site. Unlike many other castles, this castle has more exposed wood on the",
          "Beautiful spot to wander and view gardens and buildings of the period. Parts are reconstructed and the whole area is well maintained. Great history that is well documented and presented. Cherry trees were starting to bloom and the area was beautiful. (Osaka Imperial Palace and",
          "A nice place to walk around the grounds and in the castle. For my money better than the much bigger Osaka castle and less commercialised. Also has a proper sword collection. Arrive before 1730 as it closes then and be prepared to walk to the top for a great view of the city.",
          "Another beautiful castle that has lovely gardens surrounding it. Loved the history of the original castle.",
          "We only came nd saw the structure from the outside as we were pressed for time and were aware it was a production as the original was destroyed in the A bomb drop over Hiroshima.",
          "It's a tower and a very pretty one with impressive moats so well worth a look. The blossoms were just coming out when we were there which made it even nicer.",
          "Good photo object at night if you take from outside the moat. Just make sure you arrived before 10PM because after that they will turned off the floodlight",
          "The insurance is a modern museum. Not a castle and the is no a lot in English so I would recommend taking photos outside and spending money somewhere else.",
          "The Hiroshima castle is definitely worth the visit when you are in town. You can cross the most on foot or even on vehicle. What is striking about this castle is that unlike the one in Osaka it looks quaint. The garden surrounding the castle is most pleasant and be sure to spot",
          "We misunderstood what we read and thought it no longer existed but apparently it has been rebuilt. One for next time!",
          "Hiroshima's Castle is about a 15 minute walk from the Peace Dome, near the Children's Museum. The mote surrounds the castle and the park meanders around until you get to the castle which sits high on a hill. You get a lovely view of Hiroshima from the top. I would have liked",
          "A major tourists spot, a truly beautiful five floors castle representing the Japanese architecture, it is surrounded by river and linked with the main land with a wooden bridge, inside you will enjoy seeing the Samurai culture everywhere, you can even take a great souvenir",
          "The Hiroshima castle was re-built after World War 2 but is still an interesting place to visit to learn more about Japanese castles. Climb up to the highest floor to get a bird's eye view of the City. You can also dress up as a samurai warrior and touch a samurai sword. Do",
          "You can walk up the central metal stairs safely to the top and then go out onto the secured veranda and view the city.",
          "This is one of the good castles I have visited although I could no longer tell which internal parts have been retained. Nonetheless, do not miss this during your visit to Hiroshima",
          "This is a wonderful site filled artifacts and relics from Japanese history. There is also interactive exhibits geared for younger visitors and a great observation deck at the top of the castle.",
          "The castle was rebuilt following the atomic bombing. It's an okay way to spend an hour but the museum which is inside isn't overly interesting. There's some cool samurai outfits etc but not a great deal about the castle.",
          "Everything here is Japan is very well preserved and has amazing aesthetics. And so this castle is a great example of the same. Its quite a sight for visitors.",
          "It was quite nice heading into the castle and seeing that the floors have been turned into a museum so you learn a bit about the history like how the castle had to be rebuilt after the bomb. You can also head up to the top where you can get 360 degree views of the castle area",
          "For what it offers, the amount charged to enter the tower is absurd! Few historical pieces and the view is not the best. Stroll through the garden and save your money for other attractions.",
          "If you are interested in Japanese History; specifically the Sengokujidai or period of warring states, then make time to see this replica castle.",
          "From the top floor is a panoramic view of Hiroshima city which is very nice. The displays are very interesting as well, if you like that sort of thing - history of the castle, as well as artefacts that were used within it and explanations of how the castle was built, and why,",
          "If you take the Hop On/Off Bus, this castle is on the route and one of the stops for the bus. This is not a typical castle but rather a tall structure - like a combination of a Japanese style Shrine and a building. This is now a museum housing a lot of historical Japanese",
          "The entry was 600 yen, and we arrived early and did not line up. Crowds increased steadily and there was a queue at the entrance when we came out. Very interesting exhibits and models of the history of the castle, great views from the 8th floor roof level.",
          "A short walk or you can take the tourist bus to the castle. The castle is beautiful to take pictures of. From the top level you have a good view of the city. Visit on a clear day.",
          "The castle is only one of three buildings here. Be prepared for a lot of walking. Also be aware that the castle closes at 5pm. We came just too late to go inside, but the architecture was still beautiful enough to make the trip worthwhile. Things to watch for: koi fish in the",
          "It closed on the December 31st. We walked around the castle and visited the shrine nearby. The location is very good and take a few minutes walk to the shopping malls.",
          "Nice opportunity to walk through all this great ponds, gardens and castles; try to get there before 4pm because they starting to close castles, souvenirs stores so early; if you're not interested in that then you could go there later, the main garden and ponds are closing around",
          "It is smaller compared to Osaka castle and less crowded but the feel is different here, since the original was destroyed by the Atomic bomb... Imagining it was completely wiped out by the bomb.... the sadness of destruction and the spirit of Japanese people to rebuilt the whole",
          "Not the original castle as was lost in the bomb blast. Rebuilt in 1950s. Impressive from the outside. Inside is a Samurai museum and history of the place. Well worth seeing.",
          "Despite being rebuilt in the 50's the castle and park are well worth a visit. Large gardens and lots to see with some great photo opportunities. It's just off the centre so easy to walk to and can be combined with the Peace Park for a good half day trip.",
          "Beautiful day to walk around the castle but just the outside. The holidays have everything closed. It's situated on the top of a hill so makes it a nice walk.",
          "Having been to other Japanese castles I expected this one to be similar. What I found was a museum to the Hiroshima Castle inside a replica exterior of the original. The museum contains many artifices from various eras of this castle's existence. High recommended.",
          "The Hiroshima Castle looks like an old building from the outside and inside is a museum with relics of the castle and the families who lived in this area. They had many swords on display. The castle grounds are interesting to walk around. There is a small nominal charge to enter",
          "Once you accept the fact that this is really only a castle visually from the exterior, then you will enjoy it. Quite beautiful as you approach it, but once inside it is just a museum. I am glad that they restored this castle after the destruction of the city, as historically it",
          "The castle is easily accessible (one of the stops on -pu hop on hop off bus). The castle's grounds are good for a pleasant walk. There is a tree (or was it the tree) that survived the a-bomb blast on site. The castle itself is a quick walk through. No photos except where they",
          "It is a good 2 to 3 hours entertainment, beautiful scenery, plus you would be able to see the historical things, you can also try there costumes and take pictures.",
          "This castle go wayyyy back. And was built on what was originally the sea. I walked from the atomic dome and after a Long Long walk finally found it. It's about 5 stories high and has real artefacts for show. Learnt a lot from here. Not allowed to take photos for some artefacts",
          "A fine, well-restored castle on its own right. Unfortunately, after seeing Himeji earlier, this one was sort of underwhelming. I passed on the tour inside and opted to just stroll the grounds outside. Worth a look if you have time in Hiroshima. Not necessarily \"must see\" though",
          "similar to other castles in Japan. but this one is just a stone throw 1mile from the city centre. entering the park, you'd find peace and quiet.... it was just cool to be in the city centre and have a castle there.",
          "This castle is obviously rebuilt after WW2, so instead of nooks and crannies of a restored castle, what you get is a museum with loads of interesting artifacts - swords, battle suits, maps and of course explanations on how the city of Hiroshima was established. There is",
          "On our way to the Peace Park, we were able to walk over and see the Castle and the outer moat. Really beautiful city!",
          "The building on the outside is a bit deceptive. It is quite large inside with 5 levels. Each with different array of items from samurai and shogun armour and swords. Others show the original castle structure including grounds surrounding. Allow a good 90 minutes to soak the",
          "Outwardly, the Castle appears as though it needs a \"face lift\" to bring it to the same level of beauty as the Osaka & Himeji Castles, or maybe it's just this \"rustic face\" instead of the smooth faces of those other two castles that I also got to that gives this castle it's",
          "This was pretty central in Hiroshima. We walked from the Hiroshima atomic bomb dome. It's good at sunset, a bit of a walk to actually get to but over all good. You can walk up the stairs (it's a fair few flights of stairs) but the view is good. They let you try on a kimono on",
          "used the sightseeing loop bus for free to visit this castle. Thanks to the JR pass! I love the exterior wood design of this castle.",
          "The castle was of course rebuilt and thus made it less interesting to me. However please do visit it whilst there. Good for photo opportunity. The garden was nice too.",
          "Surrounded by a moat and built on stone blocks and with a wooden structure stands this beautiful castle. The entrance is free. To visit the building inside, one has to remove shoes and use the provided slippers, or else go barefoot. There are some scale models and in the last",
          "Building has been rebuilt. Museum is ok. Interesting from historical perspective of site having been former Imperial Army Headquarters - castle is best thought of as photo op (good view from top too)",
          "You can easily reach Hiroshima Castle from center of Hiroshima City. I recommend you enter this castle to see maps,armors & swords of Edo era. I think best season is April because you enjoy seeing cherry blossoms.",
          "They have rebuilt the castle as a concrete shell containing a museum. Some interesting history and the grounds are pretty but not a must see attraction.",
          "If you want to walk around Hiroshima a bit after seeing the A bomb memorial this is set in a nice moated island so nice to see from the outside - not much going on inside and you have to pay 700 yen to go inside as well",
          "Fascinating information contained inside this museum, especially about the history of the castle and feuding families of Hiroshima and the surrounds. Only good if people are comfortable climbing stairs, as usual for Japanese castles, narrow staircases are inside.",
          "The original castle was destroyed by the atomic bomb blast in 1945 and the tower was faithfully reconstructed in 1958 adjacent to the original site. Five floors are reached by steep staircases to the observation platform at the top giving views of the city. Each level has",
          "It's not quite as you would expect with a castle it's tall but small And lucky to be there as most was destroyed Look for the eucalyptus tree in the grounds It survived the bomb",
          "The Hiroshima Castle is a small castle. The castle and the grounds can be covered in an hour easily. I understand that it is mostly made of wood, so it appears dark and dull compared to say Osaka and Nagoya castles, which are light coloured adorned with gold. Nevertheless I love",
          "A real Japanese castle rebuilt to original specifications with a sturdier foundation. Moved just steps away from the original foundation of stones this museum is a 5 floor (level) museum with nice views from the top. No elevator available for those that cannot walk the stairs.",
          "Rebuilt after the bombing but worth a visit and the tall tower affords views over the city although the climb to the top will not suit everyone",
          "This Castle was destroyed in the A bomb blast but has been faithfully rebuilt since. It offers quite reasonable views over Hiroshima from the top level which is accessed via stairs only. There are displays on each level as you go up which look quite interesting, but a number",
          "A recreation of the pre war historical side of hiroshima. A look back into samuri times where interactive stations show what life was life in these times.",
          "We were disapointed with the Hiroshima castle to be honest. We knew it had only recently been reconstructed but it fell down on presentation and display. The views from the top floor were impressive but that's about it. Oh we should add that if dressing up as Samurai is to",
          "Overlooks the park and surrounding area with a river running next to it , you can see why it was built on this site . The views from the top are great . The park also contains the remains of the naval barracks which were destroyed by the bomb .",
          "We visited the grounds only as we arrived too late to enjoy the castle. The grounds are beautiful and are free to visit. The castle was rebuilt after the Atomic attack but was built in exactly the same style and dimensions. Lots of locals walking their dogs made for a lovely",
          "Did not go inside the main castle but walked around the garden area. Lots of things to see. Old Military Defence Headquarter site and Imperial HQ. Could also see several trees which had survived the A Bomb. The only negative factor was a group of foreigners who were allowing",
          "My 14yo & I decided to take a walk through the Hiroshima Castle ruins after coming back from Miyajima early due to a typhoon warning. Hadn't read anything about it so we weren't expecting more than a nice stroll. When we came spin the castle tower we decided to go up for a look",
          "Visited this on the walking tour on the way from the peace gardens to the a dome and museum. The building is beautiful but it can get lost on you if you are also visiting the museum, a dome etc.",
          "We had a great visit to the castle. It's a reconstruction (although there is a tree that survived the bomb blast and some foundations from one of the army buildings), but looks very realistic. Interesting exhibits in the castle tower and great views from the top floor of the",
          "This was a bit different as it was also a museum and castle and you did not need to take off your shoes which was great! The exhibits were very interesting and took our time going around them all.",
          "The museum is not that good because info is provided almost always only in japanese. I would go again just for the view from the top of the tower!",
          "I stumbled across this castle after reading about it in Lonely Planet, it has a beautiful design to it. It was not too expensive to enter the castle, it is worth it if you are making your way there. Inside the castle you'll find Samurai swords and gear displayed, you will also",
          "The park is nice, there is also a Shinto temple. Good for a walk. The castle was reconstructed after the bomb, we did not get inside.",

          "As with many other castles, even though it was initially constructed in the late 500s, it was rebuilt following WW2. For a small admission fee, you're free to wander around inside. This castle has a focus on samurai. It also offers nice views of the city.",

          "Hiroshima Castle is in the middle og a beautiful park - built after the A-bomb. A sign saying no photos allowed inside, but we saw some people taking photos also inside this magnificent wooden Castle. You walk through the park before approaching the wooden castle.",

          "When we visited there were only exhibits in 2 of the 4 floors. Right up the top you can go outside and it's a nice view over the city. It was pretty cheap to get in and lower high school kids are free (15). Kids under 139cm can get dressed up as a Samurai and have their photo",
          "Very close to the A Bomb sit (about 750 meters from blast site), this entire structure was lost with the a-bomb explosion and then rebuilt years later. Its fascinating to see how one of the trees actually survived the blast and is still alive today.",

          "The castle is only about a 20 minute walk from the Hiroshima Memorial Park. I decided to go here after the G7 Summit delayed my viewing of the park. It really doesn't take long to navigate the inside of the castle. The highlight is that Secretary of State John Kerry showed up",
          "Appx $8 aud to get in. The castle is a reconstruction and when you arrive you can see why. With the automic blast neargy it amazes me that anything survived! Some original rubble is there and the castle moats. Some trees are labelled as having survived the nuclear blast",

          "You would have to climb the stairs because there are no elevators. However, it doesn't matter! You will learn a lot. You can touch actual samurai swords. You cal also take a picture wearing the traditional Japanese kimono :) You will feel like royalty. Aside from that, the top",

          "From the outside you see a interesting wooden castle. Not really big for a castle, but oke. Leave the inside for what it is. One floor has nothing to offer, the upper floor shows what you can see from every high building in town. Some swords, clothes, manuscripts is not worth",

          "A beautiful Castle that's definitely worth a visit. Good views from the top too",
          "Better than Osaka castle. Entry to grounds are free. Entry to castle tower is \u00a5660.",
          "I went to see it early morning. Totally empty. A great park around is perfect to stretch yor legs for good start of the day. There are few pathways to approach it, and all with nice view.",
          "It\u2019s a gorgeous castle but just a quick look outside is sufficient",
          "Nicely re-built castle, exhibition is well prepared but lacks depth and sparks. Still worth a quick visit when in Hiroshima.",
          "Beautiful imperial castle overlooking the river. Best views from balcony at sunset",
          "Well, no reviews should ever affect your decision to visit the castle. It's pretty much a must do if you're in Hiroshima. So take some short time off to just come by here and see it for yourself.",
          "This castle is small and rebuilt, the temple on the same ground is more interesting!",
          "Interior is too modern, basicially a museum which felt as though the translator got lazier as you go higher up the building. By the 2nd floor from the observation, there was very little to no English translations on the artifacts.",
          "Interesting museum on Hiroshima inside the fort. Enough English to get an idea of what was going on. The reconstruction of the gate house is a beautiful building",
          "Another historic place, once you have seen one the others are almost the same.",
          "It's a rebuilt replica of the castle, but still beautiful nonetheless",
          "The castle is small inside, but the cat of castle is so cute\u00b7 It will be nice on sunndy day!",
          "Beautiful castle and grounds. Incredible Koi fish and interesting displays of armour, swords and history.",
          "Excellent castle and very interesting museum inside. Very thorough English explanations and videos throughout. Lots of stairs to a lovely lookout from the top of the castle. Really enjoyed all of the exhibits and would visit again. There \u2026",
          "Beautiful! Would love to see it in spring with the cherry blossoms blooming",
          "1958 reconstruction of the original 16th century castle. The building is beautiful and the surrounding grounds are nice and pretty tranquil. Inside the five story castle is a museum chronicling the history of the original castle and the subsequent replicas. The fifth floor offers good views of the city.",
          "Other castles are more breath taking but this one is still beautiful. Fun to climb to the top and look over all of hiroshima",
          "Was expecting to see more of the actual castle, but the experience was interesting to say the least. Prepare for many stairs.",
          "Fantastic historical castle, get a real feel of old Japan. Very pleasant to walk around and worth look",
          "Great walk around and see. Don\u2019t think its worth entering this one as there are other sites with better views.",
          "If you are interested in Japanese history or historical buildings I doubt you'll ever tire of seeing edifices like Hiroshima Castle. The grounds are easy to navigate with the castle being tucked away in a corner. There is also the option to \u2026",
          "Beautiful castle but very small in size compared to Osaka or Himeji. I did not go inside but I enjoyed the walk around the park.",
          "Should really be called the ruins of Hiroshima Castle as only one tower remains, which the museum is in. However, a great visit regardless - the old castle walls now enclose a beautiful park, and there's a shrine there (Gokoku) where you \u2026",
          "It's not beautiful as I expected. I highly recommend the Okayama Castle and Korakuen Garden which are about 100km away from Hiroshima.",
          "Hiroshima Castle is a beautiful castle surrounded by water. I haven't been inside, but from the outside the castle is stunning.",
          "Nice experience to get more knowledge about 16th century Japanese conquer and expansion. Castle doesn\u2019t have any lift so that might be a bit difficult to disabled people to visit.",
          "Hiroshima Castle is located at 21-1 Motomachi, Naka Ward, Hiroshima, 730-0011, Japan. This place is a museum devoted to the history of the atomic bomb that exploded in Hiroshima. In this place you can learn historical origins and offer a pretty beautiful city view. This place is a must visit if you are in Hiroshima.",
          "A very cool area. Really liked the moat with all the fish.",
          "Beautiful rebuilt castle. It makes for a nice stroll.",
          "It an enlightenment to see the castle n how it was like before the first atomic bomb. Tis pic I posted, u need to pay for entering. \nNote: I didnt when in so don ask me for details.",
          "The castle is beautiful. Inside I was expecting more from what you see in European castles, a recreation of the living space. But here they discussed the history of the castle and it's rulers. And they has a variety of artifacts from the samurai era.",
          "So Beautiful! Be prepared to walk up and down several flights of stairs.  Bring some coins for the souvenirs at the top. Great views\n Take your time to see everything.",
          "Very good. People are very nice",
          "Good castle, this castle is rebuild after the WW2, but it is very good castle.",
          "Small restoration of the original. The museum lacks translation for most of it's exhibits. It had a fair amount of items due to its small size.",
          "Hiroshima Castle is a bit underwhelming but that's because there aren't any sort of outbuildings around it; just the remains of the compound. The building itself is actually pretty decent, however there are quite a few stairs both leading \u2026",
          "Amazing recreation of the original castle with a modern museum interior including simulated rooms",
          "Such a gorgeous castle. Very informative information as well. Love the view from the top.",
          "A very lovely castle. It was interesting to read about the history of the castle and learn about what life was like when it was first built. The view from the top floor was amazing, and they even had maps to show you what you were looking \u2026",
          "I can see the whole town from above.",
          "I absolutely loved the castle. You can wear samurai shields or Yukata inside and take photos, for free. As of now, you have to pay 380 if you're adult or 180 if you're a high school student to enter.",
          "awesome that it\u2019s been rebuilt for people to see.  maybe a little too much exhibits in this place.  the significance of the castle, how it was built and how it was affected by the atomic bomb were the most interesting draws for me. view at the top was a nice ending touch to the self tour.",
          "Great spot even when it's bucketing down with rain. Great history and lay out",
          "Pretty cool. Didn't know what to expect going here, but was very interesting and third my visit.",
          "Nice castle and gardens. You can visit the tower and go up to the fifth floor,  where there are good views of Hiroshima. The exhibition is interesting.",
          "Very important place to see while visiting OSHAKA",
          "Something to see but not to impressive. The castle was destroyed in WWII so when they rebuilt it the inside was completely modernized and was more of a shop than anything. Some cool art pieces... the view from the top is the best part but you\u2019re basically looking at the city. There are better places to spend time in Hiroshima.",
          "Well worth a visit. Very interesting place but you need about 2 hours to see it all. Also it combines well with a visit to the Hiroshima garden nearby.",
          "Great views. Limited to see inside. Some good armour and swords.",
          "Very cool Japanese Castle tower. Nice display of swords - wish that part was in English!  But there was a great video about the history of the castle. Definitely worth checking out.",
          "The castle and area was interesting. First off, there are many \"Phoenix Trees\" on the park that you might miss if you are talking or focused on other things. Also, at the time I went, there was a special event happening after the closing \u2026",
          "Brilliant loads of information on all families and how they divided up parts of the villages for each family to be in charge of also the heritage goes back a very long time amazing",
          "Quite interesting historical site of a former castle",
          "Great view of the Castle and its surroundings, very pretty architecture. However we decided not to worry about going inside of the Castle, as this has been modernised to include a museum. You can however enter paying an admission fee and can also view the surroundings from the top level.",
          "Easy walk from the attomic dome. Free to enter, but have to pay to climb the tower. Also the mens toilets are a little exposed to the public.",
          "Not alot to see but what there was was nice, more educational then scenic",
          "How amazing are the Japanese.... to rebuild such a place... !!",
          "Another very majestic, awesome and ancient castle. Very well maintained castle with its architectural design intact and good displays of many interesting old relics like samurai wears, swords etc. Great to have information translated in \u2026",
          "Located at the center of Hiroshima city, the area was clean and spacious. There is also a shrine for you to visit with a small souvenir/merchandise shop nearby that sells Hiroshima city-themed crafts. An attractive spot for tourists who visit Hiroshima city.",
          "A fantastic settlement for defending yourself from attackers",
          "Inexpensive. Was ok. Not nearly as large as nagoya castle. Lots of old swords and armour. The before and after photos of the castle area from the atomic bomb were interesting.",
          "I visited here for a special event. Team lab created amazing illustrations here!! This was sooo stunning!!! You should experience it!! They put a bunch of colorful light balloons in the park! They were so beautiful!! The entrance fee was \u2026",
          "The tower has really nice views on the top but it's more like a museum than a castle and some of the things aren't allow to take pictures. The entrance is \u00a5370",
          "The interior of the castle is actually a museum. The 5th floor offers great 360\u00b0 views of the city.",
          "I'm not usually big on museums and the like.  Buildings full of old stuff ain't really my thing.  That said: this place and the grounds surrounding it are fabulous!  I was fortunate enough to visit during the autumn food festival, but I'll \u2026",
          "Such a nice castle. We were very impressed ! \nMUST see in Hiroshima ! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "It is very beautiful. It's a must go if you are in Hiroshima and have some time on your hands. Would definitely want to go there again.",
          "Nice castle but not so special",
          "A lot of history in here. Loved it.",
          "Biking along the castle is my favourite route to go for work\ud83d\ude0a",
          "This Castle is a must see ! The castle itself is awe inspiring, and the history surrounding the A-bomb as well. There are trees here that survived it!",
          "Great experience and numerous interesting things to learn here. Like nearly all other castles,  there's an entrance fee but take it in stride. It was a cool time. Make a point to stop at the other historical spots in the area for the full history lesson. It's humbling.",
          "The garden, shrine and castle are all very nice looking. It's really picturesque and preserved history very well. Was a bit disappointed with the inside of the castle. It's a museum that starts of with many translations but on has Japanese descriptions for the majority of the floors after the 3rd floor.",
          "Very pretty attraction with several interactive exhibits and an amazing insight into Japan's history.",
          "Easily access, we took the city tour bus and it stopped close to walking distance of the castle.  It was rebuilt of course since almost nothing remained standing against the \"bomb\".  The castle park is a nice place to visit during cherry \u2026",
          "Very good. Although lots of exhibits in Japanese only.",
          "Beautiful castle with a ton of history surrounding it. Some of the former buildings next to it have been left as ruins from the atomic bomb, which is also interesting to see.",
          "Nice area but I wouldn't bother going inside the main tower if you are short for time",
          "Incredibly beautiful Castle with very interesting exhibits inside!",
          "Exterior is quite alright the interior houses a number of items but the look is that of a modern museum rather than that of a Japanese castle. Still a good place to visit.",
          "Quiet little oasis in the middle of a sprawling city.\nThe grounds are beautiful and quiet enough for you to appreciate a little calm and peace.\n\nThe views from the top of the tower are beautiful, and as you admire the history of the tower upon which you have climbed, you can appreciate the beauty of the present city of Hiroshima.",
          "I love Japanese castle!",
          "Great museum, but the best about the castle is the view from the beautiful gardens.",
          "Due to the atomic bomb this in now a rebuilt replica with a museum inside. Much nicer from the outside although the view from the top floor is splendid",
          "A little underwhelming after the power of the atomic memorial museum. I do recommend seeing the trees that survived the blast on the castle grounds.",
          "Beautiful Castle with an amazing view of the surrounding city.",
          "It is pretty good. The original building was destroyed by the nuclear bomb explosion and he current one is a reconstruction done using he same technique as the original. It is not a very big Castle, but still worth the visit. You can go all \u2026",
          "My fav place in the city!",
          "I had a beautiful story in this place",
          "Awesome piece of history. Very moving. Don't miss the chance to visit Atomic dome and peace museum.  Expect about 1.5-2 hr to see all museum exhibits and pay the 100\u00a5 for the guided audio tour headset.",
          "Another beautiful place we visited in Hiroshima. More than the castle itself the surrounding gardens with cherry blossoms was the memorable experience in visiting this place. \nSince it's a reconstruction after being destroyed by the a-bomb it had less historical value but the bored from to of the castle are stunning.",
          "Super nice to look at from outside. Once inside it is a large museum full of the history of the castle, area, and japan as a whole.",
          "Very cool museum in the main tower in the castle. A decent amount of English text in the museum made it easy to enjoy. Nice view to the atomic dome from the top.",
          "It takes not long time to reach the top, but the view is really good.",
          "you can see the beautiful surrounding at the Hiroshima castle",
          "Extensive information on the history of the Hiroshima area, plus some nice really old swords! Reasonably scenic view of the city from the top. The grounds aren't anything special though.",
          "Very informative and interesting. Goid place to learn about the history of Hiroshima.",
          "Hiroshima Castle was good.  \nIt is a beautiful place.",
          "Inexpensive and easily accessible by the sight-seeing buses. Small but detailed exhibit with English translations. Would recommend allocating 45 mins to 1 hour there",
          "That was great moment,right here",
          "For a special treat, come here early in the morning during cherry blossom season.  Costs you nothing, and the photo opportunities in good light seem endless.  Extra bonus if you are a birder, as the trees here appear to be a magnet for \u2026",
          "Good view from the top and one may try on samurai armour and kimonos. Apart from that the English translation is often lacking a little bit but the pros are enough to make it worth it",
          "I thought this was a cool thing to see. Random history on the way up to the top.",
          "Fantastic. It has large grounds but on a sunny day breaks the hubhub of the city",
          "It is one of the best options to visit an old Japanese castle since you have less tourists and can have cleaner photographs. There is a beautiful garden you can visit for free and a small castle with a small entry fee. It lacks information \u2026",
          "The Hiroshima Castle is a rebuilt (obviously) that looks really great on the outside. In the inside it is a museum with no resemblance to Japanese castles. Despite that fact it shows interesting information about ancient Hiroshima and delivers a great overview of the city from a viewing platform on the highest floor.",
          "Impressive castle with an even impressive castle ground surrounded by a huge moat.",
          "Beautiful castle worth seeing on your trip to Hiroshima. The grounds are free to wander and worth 15 minutes regardless of season. There were giant eggs throughout the grounds when we visited and we have no idea why.\n\nThis place is \u2026",
          "A beautiful castle filled with genuine artifacts related to samurai and castle specific history bound to leave you in awe of Japanese style, history, and ingenuity.\nMuch like other castles in Japan, the interior is modern and a enourmous \u2026",
          "Very interesting place to visit!",
          "Best castle structure in Hiroshima! The view from the top is breathe taking.",
          "Fantastic place to just walk amongst the nature and explore.",
          "Nice surroundings. You can go through it rather fast if you just want to see the castle or take your time exploring the garden.",
          "Beautiful castle and in a nice park area.",
          "Great castle with a great view of the city at the top. Inside the castle there is a lot of information of how it was build and there is a comparision before and after the bomn",
          "Small castle next to A dome and hiroshima station is within walking distance.",
          "Beautiful castle and great scenery all together.\nThe entrance fee isn't too much, it's only \u00a5360 but I find it a bit lackluster once you actually get inside.\nThe view is really good from the top of the castle and it makes up for it however. \u2026",
          "The castle grounds are quite historic but there are limited English translations so the significance of some of the structures is a mystery to me.\n\nThe castle itself is a rebuild three or four times over but that doesn\u2019t take away from the \u2026",
          "It was a beautiful castle with lots to see and learn. Had a few interactive stuff (like trying on Samurai gear). Would had loved it even better if more of the descriptions for the exhibitions were in english as well (only some was translated).",
          "Amazing castle. Traveled from europe so the castles I am use to are night and day different. Inside they have some cool artifacts to look at. There is a nice gold coin for tourists at the top you can buy and have names or titles printed \u2026",
          "Beautiful, stunning views at night.  Very peaceful",
          "May be a good place to know the history about Hiroshima.",
          "Such a beautiful historical place in Hiroshima. Worth it.",
          "It's an ok place, nothin great!",
          "We'll preserved castle. Nice.",
          "Very nice views on the top of the castle,  interesting displays and artifacts. And that you could dress in a samurai armor or kimono was a treat. Unfortunatly very little english on the exhibits.",
          "Lovely piece of culture.",
          "Nothing to see, cheaper thank Osaka with same quality of exhibition. Look from floor is not also great, just meh but in 370 JPY maybe it's worth to check. Also only few has description in English, but samurai costumes and photos are for free.",
          "Take hop on hop bus. Get off at castle stop, short walk thru beautiful park. Small entrance fee to walk up 4 levels of history museum. A few food spots,bathrooms. Lovely and well worth it",
          "Do not waste your time there. The park and castle are crumbling down.",
          "i enjoyed the calm atmosphere of the park around the castle and a beautiful view from the top. One warning though, there is no elevator so to get to the top you have to climb quite a few stairs. I highly reccomend it though.",
          "Cheap but cool castle. Lots of katana's are exhibited here if you like katana's. Amazing view of the surroundings and very kind people.",
          "Beautiful castle with informative museum.",
          "Beautiful surroundings grounds. There isn't much inside the castle itself. It's rebuilt and very modern inside, not an authentic castle. There are some nice weaponries on display inside, if you're interested in that.",
          "Amazing place, A great place to visit",
          "The gardens and shrine on the outside are beautiful.\n\nI was somehow disappointed because the inside of the castle it's a museum. There are some nice maps and information about how people lived there and how they defended it. But many things \u2026",
          "A dome of Hiroshima serves as a grim reminder of humanity ability to wreck destruction",
          "Beautiful castle, granted it is the replica from the original. But it has a tranquil space. Worth the visit.",
          "A beautiful recreation of the majestic Hirsoshima castle. It made me sad to imagine what this area would have really looked like.",
          "Nice place,  reasonable price, with historic artifacts.  Remember  this place was destroyed by the a bomb in ww2 so it's a reconstruction.  There are remains of ww2 barracks also on site. About 20 mins walk from Hiroshima station  & 10 mins walk from the peace park",
          "It is such a fantastic place I have ever been to. A town full of nice people and also place to visit. I will visit Hiroshima anytime when I am back to Japan.",
          "Nice place to learn about hiroshima history. Too bad it's summer. It would be better if spring or autumn. Level 5 you can see the panoramic view of hiroshima city",
          "As the castle was completely rebuilt, this is a replica. There's a lot of history inside but the website they claim to have English narrative/audio guide is not working correctly as it is in Japanese only and the same goes for all the QR \u2026",
          "Nice garden and castle structure",
          "Fairly standard reproduction that lacks anything particularly \"must see\". However, at night it looks fantastic with the lights and from the top floor you can see Hiroshima which is the real point of going. Seeing the Dome through the trees \u2026",
          "Not bad kool structure . lack of english explanations is bad .",
          "What an amazing castle and view!",
          "Great place with a lot of historical impressions. Should be on everyone's visiting list.",
          "Incredible views overlooking the city and memorial parks, not expensive, decent exhibits.",
          "Samurai armour, swords. Most information on displays not in English, butt pleasant visual experience. On island gardens with moat, greenery enjoyable.",
          "It's free until you go to the castle itself. Decided not to go in.",
          "Its recommended places to visit when u stay in Hiroshima.. just a minute by Tram u can see all around historical places",
          "Nice place to learn the history of hiroshima. The castle is beautiful. The green root color bus will directly take you the castle from hiroshima station.",
          "Loved the English commentary, helped to bring Japanese history to life.",
          "Looks really nice from outside.",

          "#3 thing to do while in Hiroshima. Missable but decent cheap time killer. Rebuilt after A bomb.",
          "Loved the castle. We did the little moat cruise which was lovely. The inside of the castle was also really good. Especially the view from the top of the castle. The grounds are all free and a nice walk around, or run if you're into that! Definitely worth the visit.",
          "Beautiful castle. Great view.",
          "Castle is well maintained, but the exhibit is a bit short.",
          "It's a very simple rebuilt castle converted to a museum. However, it's situated close to other attractions and you'll get a good view of the city. Worth going if you have some time to spare.",
          "The park is open and free to roam around. There is a nice shrine to visit with a lot of history around it. There are 2 parts to the castle, one being the entry or the turret which is a good place to go to see how the reconstructed it after \u2026",
          "Beautiful castle but boring interior. A great view from the top floor though.",

          "Another landmark that shows the hard work of the people and their ability to rebuild and start anew after a horrible tragedy.",
          ",Amazing, rebuilt in the 1950 s but a lot of history.  Views from the top are fantastic grounds are lovely.",
          "I've seen many complaints about that castle the main one being that the inside wasn't that pretty. Hum. \"Pretty\" isn't the reason why you may go to Hitoshima. That castle is a concrete replica of the old one so you know  exactly what to \u2026",
          "Wonderful work in rebuilding the castle and grounds",
          "The most beautiful castle we visited in Kansai. It was wooden and not as big as the others, but very lovely. Wish more of the exhibit information were also in English. They have a cute photo corner wherein you can wear a samurai and kimonos for free.",
          "Nice place.. well maintained..there is very big  green area around to spend time..",
          "Interesting small museum. Rebuilt from scratch after the A-bombing",

          "Great place to visit especially for those who love history of japan. The castle is the replica for the real castle which blown by atomic bomb. Its displaying the relic from the real castle.",

          "Very nice to visit! Beautiful castle ever!",

          "hiroshima castle is really pretty, and the grounds are very nice as well. i didnt go inside, but i saw tourists at the top of the castle so it probably offers some good views of the city!",
          "Much better than the website would suggest",
          "Foreign travelers don't really come to Hiroshima compared to the other cities in Japan, but I think they really should. Hiroshima Castle is, in my opinion, a historically exotic temple. It's not as big as the other ones in the country but just as pretty and not that crowded.",
          "Information mostly in Japanese. Too bad",
          "Nice replica of the original castle destroyed in the ww2 boombings. However always a shame when they go for a modern interior instead of a full on authentic replica. Ok museum inside and nice view from the top.",
          "Looks nice from the outside but is actually a full concrete replica of the original castle. Inside is a museum over 4 floors where I find the first two interesting, explaining the history of Hiroshima as a town but the to two are plain \u2026",
          "Although completely rebuilt after the war it still is an amazing castle. Surrounded by a park with beautiful sakura (cherry blossom) trees.",
          "Beautiful grounds, historic castle.",
          "beautiful architecture and great exhibits, many with English descriptions. I love the daily life section with heritage furniture etc. the grounds are ideal for a quiet stroll or moment of peace.",
          "Very Nice place",
          "Nice place, beautiful views from the top.",
          "We went at night when it was closed and just took a nice walk along the park that surrounds the castle. The castle itself is just magnificent to look at. The spotlight that shines on the castle at night causes a reflection on the water where there are koi fish and is just a really nice time.",
          "The castle, made mostly from wood was great.. i think it's better than osaka castle..\n\nBut after himeji castle, i don't know, i have no intention to enter any castle in japan.. in addition, hiroshima castle actually was rebuilt by japan goverment after a-bomb in 1945, si it's not the original building anymore",
          "Most beautyful wooden castle",
          "Good space and lots to see in the grounds, unfortunately ran out of time so didn't go inside",

          "really nice place to visit, a workout going up the stairs.",
          "Nice place to visit. But isnt as wonderful as i thought.",
          "Impressive castle atop a mound with large floodlights turned on at night.\n\nIt is now a museum featuring its history.  No elevators, so you have to use stairs to reach the top, five floors high. Breathtaking views of the castle grounds below and the city in the background.",
          "A beautiful garden and castle that is easily reached via a walk from the peace park. If you're taking a day trip through Hiroshima make sure you make a stop here. You can enter the castle for a small admission fee although we chose to not do this due to time constraints.",
          "Beautiful castle not too far to walk from peace park.",
          "This castle is focused on Samurai culture. The downside about this castle is that there were \"no picture\" and \"no touching\" signs posted everywhere inside and English was limited. It was a good experience but I wouldn't make it a priority \u2026",
          "Hiroshima good, modern place. Didn't go inside the castle. Mainly because I visited one in Matsumoto. They are empty and you need to take your shoes off.",
          "I got a personalized coin 5/7",
          "Nice experience. A lot what to picture and to enjoy. And every Sunday they have a samurai dance show at 13.30 and 15.00. It is free. You only have to pay for entrance into museum",
          "A very beautiful castle",
          "Great bit of history and really lovely grounds. Unfortunately most exhibits didn't have English signs and there are no lifts, so if you struggle with stairs this isn't the place to come. Overall though I really enjoyed it.",
          "Obviously, this castle was rebuilt after the war. There are nice park grounds and a temple around the castle, a bit of serenity. Walk around and take some photos of a pretty impressive structure. However, unless you like concrete museums, \u2026",
          "Interesting place with a lot of history. Unfortunately during this time there was not much to see. But the castle itself has some amazing views of the city and looks great from the outside.",
          "Calm and comfortable walk through a spacious park to get to this beautiful castle. Didnt go inside the castle itself, just took a photo from outside, but still a good experience",
          "Japanese history, art, architecture and culture well displayed.\nSamurai swords are the best part!!\nThe breathtaking views from the top are awesome.\nAudio guide and the written explanations are immensely helpful. \nThe castle is divided into multiple levels and distinct themes like history, armory, religion, lifestyle, etc.",
          "Interesting history, several hands-on displays, and great views from the top.  Also there are a couple of videos with headphones for the English translation.",
          "The beauty of this castle will leave you spellbound ! I have seen both Early morning and sunset view ... Pretty amazing it is !!! If planning a trip to Hiroshima, do visit the castle . \nCastle is in close proximity with The historic A-Bomb Domb ! So guys don't miss out on these two interesting places \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Picturesque place to wander around",
          "We only visited from outside, but it is nice, and also the park",
          "Good view from the top of the castle. Good to go to if you are interested in the samurai topic. Otherwise it is still interesting but probably won't enjoy it as much.",
          "Amazing history, very well done",
          "Gorgeous!  Grounds and structure are beautiful.  Rebuilt to exacting standards after WWII.  Make sure to walk all the way around the castle to see the whole thing.  The grounds  and garden are also lovely.",
          "A small castle with a nice view of downtown Hiroshima.  There's always some ongoing exhibition.  Next to the castle grounds is a small park and a temple worth visiting.  You can also take a cruise around the castle grounds.",
          "The stories are true that Hiroshima Castle looks like a real castle from the outside but is just a 5 story museum in the inside. If you've been to Osaka Castle, this is basically the same format. There were enough English translations to \u2026",
          "Very well detailed castle museum.try the samurai dress for free here.also walk around the entire castle..",
          "Slightly disappointed that the interior was modernised, but I understand that it was all destroyed In the blast, and then refurbished to this current condition.\n\nLove seeing Japanese buildings in its former glory, so felt this was a shame.",
          "Beautiful rebuilt castle. The museum inside is definitely worth the entrance fee.",
          "The history of the first governing body is here. From weapons to how they survived in the past. Seniors and children's entrance fee is a discount, adults are 300 yen. The place is pretty quaint. At the top of the castle is panoramic view of the surrounding area.",
          "Beautifull castle, is a reproduction of the original destroyed in 1945",
          "Very nice castle grounds, the main tower is a modern museum inside, but the walls and side tower at the edge is very interesting to go inside. There you can get a reeling of what it was like.",
          "The castle looks good from outside. Unfortunately, entering inside the castle is totally worthless. Teamlab illumination was good though out the park.",
          "This castle is unique as it is made in wood but if you have seen all the other castles, it is a similar architecture and look.",
          "Its amazing.. 7th march there was a light show... its also amazing..we enjoy very much.",
          "The original castle was destroyed by the atomic bomb so this is a replica. As a result it is very modern inside. Lots of English available in the display area. Also a nice view from the top.",
          "Amazing event going on right now by teamLab. If anyone is in the area between now and April 7th, please visit at night, you will not be disappointed! These pictures don't do it justice.",
          "Went during the day and saw teamLab had an exhibit set up for the night. Went back at night and holy God damn! It was amazing 1000 yen for an adult but it was worth the money, lights in the trees and castle and also large egg things. Starts \u2026",
          "It's a small castle, if you get a chance to do a bigger one, do that instead.",
          "Nice piece of Japan history.",
          "The mini museum housed in the castle proper is a great touch. The remains of buildings destroyed by the Bomb are a poignant reminder.",
          "Very impressive castle. Definitely worth a visit if in Hiroshima",
          "Very nice experience. It cost only 370 yen for adult to go inside the castle tower. There is also a nice shrine and a drummer tower, which is free to visit. Highly recommend \ud83d\ude0a",
          "It's just a replica... There are better places to spend your time in Hiroshima, which by the way, is a great city",
          "Interesting little castle, however a fair bit unfortunately didn't have english translations.",
          "Visit in summer please.",
          "Wonderful architecture.  Lots of stairs but the view from the top was awesome!",
          "Go around New Year's. There are multiple food stands. The shrine is beautiful. The Castle itself was like $4/person to explore. It is really cool inside. The grounds are beautifully kept, but be mindful-thr castle has stairs. Don't go if you can't climb 4 flights of stairs.",
          "Rebuilt Castle with great views. A lot of history inside and definitely worth the visit",
          "Very impressive structure! Also this is a very informative museum.",
          "The courtyard and area around it is beautiful.  The inside of the main building is a bit lacking and an information dump... a brochure with the information would be nice.   Not being allowed to take pictures is also a negative.  However, the view from the top is great and the entrance fee is cheap.",
          "Historical places, beautiful at night, dont forget to take the cruise at day",
          "Nicely done for tourism, very informative with a touch of fun. It was totally worth dropping by",
          "Beautiful parc and castle tower. Inside the castle there is a museum on the history of Hiroshima and the castle. Mostly in Japanese but the key points are translated. There's a good view from the top. The entrance fee is quite cheap.",
          "Moderately interesting as a museum but really it's sufficient to walk the grounds and skip going inside. Some of the plaques are only in Japanese so you don't get the full experience as a foreigner that can't read. Plus it's a lot of photos \u2026",
          "Very inexpensive fee to enter the 5 story castle replica of the original (which was destroyed with the a-bomb). The rebuilt castle serves as an informative museum. Went with our two kids 13 & 7 who were entertained at every floor. Were in \u2026",
          "Amazing like the Osaka's Castle but less crowded. You can walk under the Sakura's three in your way to the castle",
          "It looks quite similar to Osaka castle, nice and well maintained",
          "Go up and see the views of Hiroshima.\nYou can also wear their traditional costumes for man and woman....touching the samurai sword etc....",
          "Hiroshima Castle is a replica of the original- looks nice and is well kept. The grounds are clean, quiet and serene.  Be warned though,  uneven stairs leading up to the castle and no elevator inside, so keep that in mind if important to you.",
          "This is a museum with many floors with great history",
          "It's basically a museum and the view from the top is worth going up",
          "Beautifully rebuilt, captures the old essence of the castle with a cool surprise that lies within it.",
          "It is a nice, but small castle, rebuilt after the war. It hosts an exhibition of traditional Japanese armour and the like. You can have a decent view of the surroundings from the top. The park is also quite nice, especially the shrine there. However, there are certainly more interesting and culturally relevant castles in Japan.",
          "Bit over it after visited several castles in Japan.",
          "Lot of history about Hiroshima, nice view at the end.",
          "Closed on december 29 to 31 2019",

          "Really nice place to visit",
          "A must stop when visiting Hiroshima. Museum of the history of the city and Castle. Plus good center city views.",
          "The castle itself is just one building with 5 floors. Lots of things to see but no photos allowed. At the top floor is a nice spot to view the vicinity and to get a nice souvenir of coin/keychain where you can engrave your name. The lowest floor has an area where you can try to don costumes/clothes belonging to the era.",
          "A reconstruction of the original now housing a museum. Very good exhibits, some English, a guide pamphlet is offered, outstanding views of Hiroshima from the top floor observation deck. My children had a lot of fun!",

          "Excellent view of the castle and surrounding area",
          "Good castle and worth a visit!",
          "Worth the money, the exhibits inside are very nice. Bring some carp food, you can feed the Koi in the moat if you like. Very from the top of the castle is great during the day.",

          "Pretty organized just an extreme amount of people passing through. Still fun for family",
          "Reconstruction of the old Hiroshima Castle and surrounding castle compound. The castle itself contains a museum. Lots of fascinating history. Well worth a visit!",
          "Really cool place to visit but castle is a little small. Still a good place to see in Japan",
          "There is a view at the top and inside the castle there is a museum with various displays showing the history of Japan and Hiroshima.  There is one floor dedicated to japanese swords and armour, that is neat for those interested in that.  We \u2026",
          "A non-original reconstruction in pure concrete, not worth the visit.",
          "Very cool spot to visit when visiting the peace park as well, the grounds are gorgeous and well taken care of.  Many different varieties of trees make it awesome to walk around, it's free other than the castle entrance",

          "I liked that we could go to the top and see outside. I was surprised at the history exhibits inside as well.",

          "Lots of history.  Quite interesting story to read about the change of leaders and how it expanded under each leader.  Great spot.",
          "It's more of like a castle from outside,but from inside it's a completely renewed museum. \nInteriors was completely changed due to Atmoic Bomb.\nOnly place for refreshment.",
          "You can learn very interesting things about the history of the castle including all the expansions and posterior reconstruction",
          "Nice view. Walk from the tram around 15 minutes",
          "One of the flatland castles you must see while you are visiting Hiroshima. If you are cycling you can bring your bike inside.",
          "Lovely grounds. A peaceful place to visit. Less so during the new year.",
          "While not perfect I'd still give it a 5 star based on the historical value. They make you check your backpack at the door and give you a ticket for it. The 5th floor was amazing for views. It can get super hot in there but they try to put \u2026",
          "It needs more English information signs. I, as a tourist can't read Japanese.",
          "Nice castle but less impressive than the Fukuyama or Himeji ones.",
          "Very good place. U can see alot of things inside, also good view from top",
          "We were lucky enough to get to the castle during an event and the lights made the surroundings and the castle look trippy",
          "It's a pretty relaxing place. Not huge as u'd expect it to be, but totally worth a visit. Its located next to a river alongb which sakura blossoms, therefore is has an iconic scenic beauty. Photos are prohibited in the interior of the \u2026",
          "This castle is smaller than the others, but if you are in Japan visiting castles, do not forget this one.",
          "Worth a visit. The upper levels do not have English explanations",
          "Very cheap at 370 yen per entry. Inside the castle is a beautiful view of Hiroshima and some of the mountains surrounding it. Inside the castle are preserved pieces of the castle along with old art, weapons, armor, and   other old world \u2026",
          "I recommend visiting this castle if you dont have much time but want to visit one. Its relative small compared to the other, more famous castles and you can dress up like a medivial samurai family for free (makes only sense if its not crowded). The view from the top is not very spectacluar. Hard to take good pictures from top.",
          "If you are in town definitely worth a visit!",
          "Castle has lots of history and a great place to visit",
          "Very beautiful scenery with cheery blossom blooming in the garden around the castle.",

In 1989  the inside was restored. Today, it has turned into a history museum featuring Samurai culture.",
          "Peaceful park.",
          "Definitely climb to the top for a great view of Hiroshima. There were costumes from the Edo period that you get to try on, which was unexpected and fun. Most of the exhibits were in Japanese, and we didn't buy the audio tour but it was still nice to see all the displays of samurai swords and castle models.",
          "Well maintained with a good mixture of information, photos and videos.",
          "Ancient Japanese castle surrounded by serene surrounding of blooming Sakura trees.",

          "Hiroshima castle is not as big as Himeji or Osaka but it is still really nice.\nWe arrived in the afternoon just before sunset and had a chance to see the castle illuminated.\nIf you visit the peace park, continue to the castle afterwards. It worth the walk.",
          "Beautiful.",
          "Nice place, gardens and moats are quite pretty. Easy stroll around, but the castle has 6 flights of stairs....so if climbing isn't your thing, you may be disheartened. Easy walk through gardens and parks to the dome. I liked it.",

          "The castle is located on an impressive moat with an impressive view from the top of the castle.\nWe went here to tick it off as a place to have visited more than anything else. \nIt would be great for someone who is aware of the Japanese \u2026",
          "Castle was interesting but the tower was very modern inside which was a bit of a let down.",

          "Good historical place.  Do try to put on the armor.",

          "Beautiful Japanese castle to take pictures at; the grounds are impeccably maintained. The history of the castle is a fascinating one, and many of the museum's placards are translated into English (a spoken tour is not a necessity). Has a \u2026",
          "Beautiful castle in stunning cherry blossom park. Excellent views of the surrounding city and beyond. Interesting exhibits on each of the landings as you walk up. The swords were very interesting.",
          "Went late at night, it's open, but also scary and dark. It's japan so it should be safe, but try to go with someone else if you want to visit at night.",
          "Hiroshima Castle was originally called carp castle and around its moat are teaming schools of carp. The castle was destroyed on August 6th 1945 by the atomic bomb. The Japanese have restored this magnificent Castle to hold on to their \u2026",

          "Very beautiful and very interesting, definitely worth the visit",

          "I had a group of 22 students and 2 teachers today. You need to visit the castle in 4 steps, 1 enjoy the serrounding with water viees and gardens  2 move to the shrine 3  then move to the ruins which in diffrent elevation  4 go inside the castle. The 4 stepz will take good 2 to 3 hours. I think it is a must if you pass bye hiroshima",
          "Ok as Castles in japan go.\nIts not original of course rebuilt after bomb.\nGreat city to visit no where as busy as Tokyo or Osaka pleasant and inexpensive.\nIf you wish to see a great Japanese Castle Osaka castle is fantastic .",

          "Fantastic museum",
          "I've seen many complaints about that castle the main one being that the inside wasn't that pretty. Hum. \"Pretty\" isn't the reason why you may go to Hitoshima. That castle is a concrete replica of the old one so you know  exactly what to \u2026",
          "Hiroshima Castle is about a 10 minute walk from the Peace Memorial Park but definitely worth checking out. The grounds are very small but the castle is pristine and not very crowded.

          "A beautiful and tranquil place in an otherwise busy city. The sounds of the city fades away and in the summer it is replaced by the sound of the cicadas. A perfect place if you want a break from the noise and crowd of the city and it's all free! Except for the museum, off course.",

          "Beautiful place , so much rich history",
          "Nice castle, which had been rebuild, like most of the city. Inside you have a museum. However not everything is translated to English. Also it is hard to find a tour guide. From the top of the castle you have a wonderful viel over the city.",
          "The original castle was pretty much obliterated during WW2. This is a pretty good replica of the original. It looks new in some ways, which is kind of nice, but there's a lot of traditional parts, too.\n\nI loved the look and feel of the \u2026",

          "Not what we expected. We thought we would get to see how the inside of the castle used to look, but it was completely gutted and modernized. There is a museum inside though which was okay, and the grounds outside are pretty.",

          "After 3 weeks in Japan, we were a bit \"gardened out\", but it was on our way back from seeing a movie soooo what the heck ... And it turned out to be one of our favorites. I think this is due to its compact design around a relatively large lake. It was very well manicured and",

          "This garden is a peaceful oasis in the city. We were fortunate that it was a 5 minute walk from our rental. I thought it was even more beautiful than Korakuen Garden in Okayama. The only tree that survived the atomic bomb can be found here. It is a Ginko tree which is as",

          "I can only add my voice to those who consider this one of the most picturesque gardens, especially in spring when the cherry blossoms are in bloom. Look for the plaques, written in English, which place the garden in some historical contexts. Quite interesting.",
          "We stumbled upon this garden by accident and spent an hour walking through it. It was quiet, peaceful and serene. Since we were there late in the afternoon, the fish were feeding and jumping all over the pond. We definitely recommend it!",
          "Well worth the 260yen entrance fee. It takes no more than an hour to cover the small garden. The designs are immaculate. There are over 14 islands in the small garden which speaks of the thought that went into the design despite the size. The path is well marked (even with",

          "Read about this one but the one we visited in Kanazawa is much better and bigger. On the other hand there is not much to visit in Hiroshima apart from the atomic dome.",
          "Visited here in October. As a person who enjoys gardens this was spectacular and rather hidden which made it all the more interesting. This is an exquisite Japanese style garden and is very easy to look around with explanation with a map and explanation boards along the way.",
          "This garden was not on my list to do but found it in a tourist information. This place is absolutely stunning. Walking around this peaceful setting whilst taking it all in. You do not need to be into gardens to enjoy this idyllic sitting. It was worth the entrance fee indeed.",

          "Lovely garden with the pond being a main focus. However, there are gems of views being bridges, small hills, forests and shrubs/plants. It is not well advertised/promoted which may be the bonus as it is not crowded. Definitely worth a visit just to escape the pace of the city",

          "A short walk down a side street from Shukkeien-Mae Station (streetcar/tram stop) or Sightseeing Loop Bus (stop 2/3) will take you to the entrance to these spacious gardens. Everything from a lake to mounds to a herb garden to a bamboo forest can all be found here. It seems so",
          "This ancient green was pretty much destroyed in 1945 - only one tree survived. It has been beautifully restored and is a tranquil and beautiful spot in the middle of the city. The size is deceptive- one keeps on finding more corners to turn and therefore different views. This",

          "Shukkei-en Garden is a wonderful place to visit even if you are not a gardener (which I am not). The reason you should visit is for the serenity and authenticity of the garden, but also to contemplate the time when it was a refuge for surviving victims of the A-bomb. I know this",
          "We haven't seen all the ponds in Japan, but saw several ponds in Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Kyoto and the koi at this pond were by far the best, more what we expected to see in Japan. My husband has koi at home so was really interested in this garden. Colorful, active and looking",
          "My husband and I planned to just do a quick walk through of the garden, but an hour later we were still enjoying the calm feeling of the garden. The walkways around the trees and bridges over the ponds made for the peaceful break from the busy streets and mad dash of Hiroshima.",

        "wiki": "The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum is a museum located in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, in central Hiroshima, Japan, dedicated to documenting the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in World War II.\nThe museum was established in August 1955 with the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Hall (now the International Conference Center Hiroshima). It is the most popular of Hiroshima's destinations for school field-trips from all over Japan and for international visitors. 53 million people had visited the museum from its opening in 1955 through 2005, averaging over one million visitors per year. The architect of the main building was Kenz\u014d Tange.\n\n\n== Museum content ==\n\nAccording to the introduction in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum's English guide: \n\n\"The Peace Memorial Museum collects and displays belongings left by the victims, photos, and other materials that convey the horror of that event, supplemented by exhibits that describe Hiroshima before and after the bombings and others that present the current status of the nuclear age. Each of the items displayed embodies the grief, anger, or pain of real people. Having now recovered from the A-bomb calamity, Hiroshima's deepest wish is the elimination of all nuclear weapons and the realization of a genuinely peaceful international community.\"\nTo facilitate education, the museum was renovated in 1994 and was now divided into two sections.\nThe East Wing\u2014the newest addition\u2014explained the history of Hiroshima City before the bomb, development and decision to drop the bomb, the lives of Hiroshima citizens during World War II and after the bombing, and ended with information about the nuclear age and efforts for international peace. Included in this section was a model showing the damage done to the city. It had some important letters exchanged between scientists and top leaders of that era talking about atomic development and predicted result of its use.\nThe West Wing, which was part of the old museum, concentrated on the damage of the bomb.  Sections included Material Witness, which showed clothing, watches, hair, and other personal effects worn by victims of the bomb; Damage by the Heat Rays, a section that looked at what happened to wood, stone, metal, glass, and flesh from the heat; Damage by the Blast, focusing on the destruction caused by the after shocks of the blast, and Damage by the Radiation which went into detail about the health effects suffered by humans.\nThe museum began major renovations in 2014. The East Wing reopened in April 2017, featuring more interactive displays and replacing the model of the city with a new version that uses projection mapping to demonstrate the effects of the bomb blast. When the East Wing reopened, the Main Hall was closed for seismic retrofitting until 25 April 2019. The exhibits were also renovated during this time to focus more on victim's belongings, and are now divided into four sections: an introductory exhibit in the East Wing, \"Reality of the Atomic Bombing\" and a gallery in the Main Building, \"Dangers of Nuclear Weapons\" in the East Wing, and \"Hiroshima History\" in the East Wing.\n\n\n== List of notable visitors ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAtomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\nHiroshima Peace Memorial\nHiroshima Witness \u2013 1986 documentary film\nNagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum\nNagasaki National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims\nNagasaki Peace Park\nSadako Sasaki\nHuman Shadow Etched in Stone - one of the exhibitions at the museum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nHiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims\nHiroshima Peace Memorial Museum @ architecture in Hiroshima\nHiroshima Archive\n Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park travel guide from Wikivoyage",

          "A long way using shinkanshen train..i visit the hiroshima peace memorial. Started from the 1st floor just like read a story..and the sadness is getting higher especially when we saw several materials collected from the bom victim. This museum complex is really big and contain",
          "To see some of the graphic pictures and accounts of the day is a very somber experience. The trip through the museum by oneself is good but get the audio guide when it's crowded as you will not be able to read all the descriptions on the exhibits.",
          "Important to visit this museum when Travelling to Japan. It is also near the memorial park. Borg Places narrats about the A-bomb and its terrible consequencies.",
          "When visiting Hiroshima, the Peace Memorial Museum is one of the must do museums. We made the mistake of not getting an audio guide and felt as though we missed out. We weirdly couldn\u2019t go back to purchase it, so if you\u2019re keen on the stories behind the items, you definitely",
          "Good and short visit. All enjoyed it. Especially the the Shinkasen ride from Osaka. Advise to visit in the day time.",
          "I was surprised.... in a good way. It\u00b4s a place where you can feel peace and it makes you think how simple things are so important. After that visit you will be touched in a special way.",
          "This is a very important and moving experience. The grounds of the Memorial are stunning and poignant. The museum itself is beautifully done and conveys the horrific nature of what happened on a very personal level. Leave plenty of time and be prepared to need time when you are",

          "It was incredible. It is sad to see what happened but the way the people reacted and help themselves to make a nation. The museum is very well operated with a lot of information. We went from Kyoto by train for a day. It is very easy to walk from the station. It is very",

          "This museum very effectively relays the human aspect of the Atomic Bomb by giving they innocent victims a voice. Hear their stories to really understand the impact. Confronting experience but a must do while in Japan",
          "This museum has been put together so well. It is interesting, shocking, heart wrenching, and wonderful all at once. Captures the horror inflicted upon Hiroshima with unnecessary gore. If you don\u2019t think nuclear armament should be stopped - I think this museum will change your",
          "We visited this museum on Hiroshima Day- 6th Aug 2019. It was extremely busy on this very important day and we didn't get to read all the stories or get to experience everything in full but what we did read made us all feel very emotional. This place is a must see. We traveled",
          "I have been putting Hiroshima and Nagasaki in my travel plan for quite sometime and finally got the chance though only Hiroshima this time. Reading a lot of history on the two cities in particular the A-bomb unfortunate event back in the horrific month of August 1945, over 70",

          "We visited all of us family Teens and young adults The whole visit will teach to all, something about humankind..and past horrors. What I m saying also is that it s very visual Museum. Young kids should be carefully attended , when making the visit and have the right",

          "A very powerful memorial and museum. A must do, if only to remind us of the devastation war causes. You need at least 3 hours but I'm sure some could spend a whole day there.",
          "We paid the extra 200 yen and got the audio guide and it was so worth it! Everyone would crowd to read the signs but with the audio guide you can stand back and listen and look at the pictures or items without having to get through the crowds. I learnt so much and it was truly",

          "We took a day trip on the JR from Kyoto for a few hours. Upon arriving at the station, our JR pass got us in the red site seeing bus for free. We took that to the museum. We did a self guided tour with took about an hour and a half. The items and information provided really put",

          "Prior to visiting; I was mistakenly under the illusion that this museum would detail Japan's involvement in WW2 culminating in an atomic bomb being dropped on the site of the museum. It is not this. Please do not expect more than a momentary museum placard detailing any events",

          "The world must never again be allowed to unleash the horror of atomic weaponry, and this museum shows you just exactly why. It is quite graphic at times (there is a warning about bringing in children at the entrance, for good reason), but never sensationalist and the",
          "I spent half a day with a Japanese government-licensed guide touring this museum. I'm sorry to say that she presented a dishonest, completely one-sided diatribe on the events that led up to the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima. Astonishingly, she said the US was responsible for",
          "It is sad to see at the museum, well preserved , one could go back in time and feel the pain and suffering, sad to see. On the other hand it is well preserved with minute detail, has to be appreciated, such thing should never happen again in the human history of mankind.",
          "This is a very moving museum; I spent a lot of time trying to control my emotions. The architecture of Kenz\u014d Tange is superb.",
          "The day I visited, they allowed multiple large groups to enter at about the same time, which made for a very uncomfortably crowded viewing of the images. There is a warning as you enter the main exhibit about the graphic nature. It can be disturbing if one is sensitive.",
          "We were pleased that we had first walked around the park visiting the numerous memorials and tributes. The Peace Memorial Museum shows the devastation to life not only instantaneously but sadly after-effects of the uranium on those that died in the days and years after the bomb.",
          "Firstly went to a slide show/talk relating the story of a young school girl present on the day, then a walk around the museum with exhibits of before, during and after-a struggle at times as very thought provoking. Ended with a walk through the park to the iconic remains of the",
          "The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum is a must see. It's a mind numbing view with pictures and stories of the people who were killed or injured when the A-Bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on 6th August, 1945. You cannot but feel for the people involved and who suffered for years",
          "We came to Hiroshima for a one night stay. The Peace Memorial Park and museum were the first places we went to. The museum details the plight of the civilian victims after the atom bomb was dropped on this city. It was crowded with many school groups and other tourists, but was",
          "The devastation brough about by the N- bomb is vividly depicted through photographs, videos and belongings of survivors and victims. It is heart wrenching to say the least.",
          "Very impressive. Besides information on the war and the development of the A-bomb the museum is Full with stuff that tells of the persons that fell victim to the bombing and contains countless witness accounts that blew me away. This was the highlight of our 17 Day Japan trip",

          "The Peace Memorial Museum was very well done. The entrance fee is cheap and give yourself at least a couple hours to browse the exhibits and read the stories of the victims. I learned a lot while here, and am still saddened by some of the stuff I read, mainly pertaining to the",
          "Consider myself to be fortunate to have paid my respects to those who perished in both Pearl Harbour & Hiroshima. It was more a pilgrimage for me. The Atomic Bomb Dome, Children\u2019s Peace Monument, Students Conscription Monument, Peace Park & Museum. It was so sombre and",
          "No guide for this or peace park is necessary. Essential to visit. We allowed 1 hour for this, before checking out of hotel, but should have allowed 2 hours. Very, very well presented.",
          "The museum is brilliant. It really brings home the terrible effects of nuclear bombs. I would insist all politicians are made to visit it to make sure the extremely important lessons of the dropping of the atom bomb are learnt and never repeated. Very well presented. I would",
          "This is a place you must go to when you visit Hiroshima. It is very crowded from 10:00 to 15:00. Full of students on school excursions. It is recommended to go to 8:30 or 16:00. Don't forget Please look at the exhibition room on the first basement. This place appeals to",
          "A truly moving presentation. Very balanced, so as not to vilify either party, but just to present how it happened, the suffering that resulted, and the commitment to non-proliferation that follows. Plan to spend at least an hour as the displays take a long time to get through.",
          "I may have been better prepared than last year from the effect you have walking through the remnants of lives lost.",
          "Very dramatic and realistic details of what occurred when the atomic bomb was dropped. Well presented. 200 yen entry. Hop on hop off bus drops u right outside. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Really great museum. It gets quite full, especially because many school classes come here as well, but if you go in the afternoon it is not as bad. There is so much to see so if you want to see (and read) everything you need more than three hours. Be prepared though that many",
          "A well laid out museum that although it shows graphic details it puts it across in a very sobering manner. Yes it helped end a war but the human losses and the pain involved long term make you ask was it the best way .",
          "The photos and exhibits in this museum can break your heart. It's overwhelming but so effectively presented. The images will linger in my mind for many years to come....",
          "Not a happy visit, but a must. My husband says it is like preventive driving course: Makes yiu realize what can happen. With Iran developing the bomb and threatening Israel with anihilation, it us televant as ever.",
          "A well presented account of what happened informative and should be seen by all to prevent this again",
          "It is worth to visit this place even if you leave in a very sad mood seeing what the bomb had caused. For me best is to see this museum at the end otherwise you have no eyes for the peace park.",
          "The A-Bomb helped to end the war but the devastation to families and the town is incomprehensible. You need a couple of hours in the museum and 2 outside in the Peace gardens. I would recommend you visit the museum first thing and then go to Miyajima in the afternoon and then",
          "Worth visiting. Every single exhibit tells you how precious your ordinary life is, and makes you think seriously about \"peace\". They say the Pope Francis is scheduled to visit there on Nov. 24 and due to that the opening hours of the museum will be changed. Please check out the",
          "The Peace Park and museum are definitely a grim reminder of the horrors of WW2. The park is big and spacious enabling the thousands of visitors to spread out but the museum gets very congested. We were there early but still moved through the museum like a \"human sausage\" - not",
          "The Museum is very well done, and costs only 400 yen per adult, it will take a couple of hours to truly take it all in. There is an area which is really graphic and quite harrowing, the individual stories, pictures, personal artefacts and clothing are very moving and",
          "It covers all aspects of the aftermath of the bomb, with some excellent video and diarama displays.Can be a little repetitive as much of the 'debris' on display is similar. A well laid out museum.",
          "From what I managed to pull through, the museum is so well done. Unfortunatelly I had to leave after about 15 minutes because it was simply too much to bear. I strongly recommend to think the visit through if you aren't dealing with this kind of stuff well or if you are",
          "... of nuclear warfare, it is quite breathtaking, very moving and its normal, totally normal to be touched by the pictures and to break into tears. The building is really interesting 60ies archtiecture and Tadao Ando did a mrvelous job here.",

          "This is a tough place to visit but the memorial are done well and evoke a solemness that is appropriate. The peace flame comes from a fire that has burned for 1200 years.",
          "This was a very moving and emotional visit. Important to see, I believe, to help us all understand. The presentation of the city of Hiroshima before and after the bombing is in the first room and it really makes an impact. The museum displays all kinds of artifacts and",
          "We visited the memorial and must say it was very moving and I was surprised by how much it hit me. I think the Japanese have presented a very good account of what happened in a way that asks the world to remember these horrific events, but in a way that we learn rather than",
          "This is an amazing museum devoted to the bombing of Hiroshima The displays and photos are graphic Perhaps I am a cynic but there seems to be poor us and we are now trying for world peace They forget they started it and they were warned",
          "Although the museum itself is great and very educational, the amount of people let in at the same time completely ruined the experience for us. In addition to at least 5 or 6 different school groups, there were so many people in there it created a jam and we actually got stuck",
          "Worth the time to visit, easy to find, with the exhibits well documented and researched. Allow 1-2 hours, easy stroll around peace park. Plenty of areas to rest and eat nearby. Can also catch ferry to Miyajima Island.",
          "Very important and beautifully made Museum. Pictures, stories, horrors of war. Not an easy place and not recommended for young kids. Personally, I think they should have started the story telling from WW2 but anyway this is the most important stop on Hiroshima.",
          "This museum is a harrowing experience. It is about the effectof the A bomb. It is seen through the personal impact on people's lives, their families and the longer term impact on individuals and their families. Seen from this perspective the museum is excellent in achieving what",
          "Very interesting place to visit which obviously goes into great detail regarding the dropping of the bomb in 1945. I must say I learned a few things that I wasn\u2019t aware of about the catastrophic incident. Very graphic pictures and details and so not for the faint hearted but",
          "This museum is excellent. I love how they focused on the lost and the survivors instead of the political propaganda and science. It was very touching and impactful. Just note that the stories, pictures and photos are confronting. It was also very crowded when I was there. So",
          "We had been warned that this could be quite harrowing, with depictions of everything that happened before, during and after the bomb. Many others have put into words the feelings we had on viewing displays of injured, dead and surviving Japanese, Koreans and American prisoners.",
          "It's rare to visit a place that produces deep emotion and tears and for anyone with a soul you will experience this. This museum represents catastrophe on a scale that cannot be imagined or agreed with. Yes there are so many of those around the world but here we have shocking",

          "A visit to the museum and surrounding peace park is a must for any traveller to Japan. The museum does include very graphic images of the aftermath of the atomic bomb explosion so discretion should be used. The museum also doubles as a centre for peace and explores options and",
          "This is where you will see and remember those years that changed the landscape of the world. This museum made me feel how bad war is bar none. The deaths of the Japanese caused by the atomic bomb lobbed in Hiroshima is unimaginable. The museum has really captured it.",
          "You'll need a couple of hours here to fully appreciate all the information they are providing. The guards start to kick you out 10 minutes before closing so it can feel a little rushed, however we got a good view around the place and learnt so much about before, during and after",
          "The museum is excellent, no blame, no criticism, just story telling of an horrendous event that obliterated lives in an instant and led to suffering on an untold scale for years to come. Very moving, but the experience was not one of quiet contemplation given the place was",
          "If in Hiroshima take the time to visit this Museum. Some parts of the exhibit are interactive, some are mainly texts and pictures and some donated objects are shown aswell. Its touching and heartbreaking at times but worth a visit for educational reasons. An eye opening",
          "As we all know this is where the atomic bomb was dropped and ended the second world war.nuclear era began with this massive destruction, we should never forget all the innocent people that died august. 1945",
          "As you'd expect - harrowing, tear-jerking and thought-provoking. They've done well to highlight the human stories after the atomic bomb and link it to modern politics. I'd challenge all politicians to do a tour here before taking office. However, it was absolutely rammed. I",
          "My title says it all: sober, informative, evocative, important. Everyone should have the chance to visit here, and gain an insight into how crushingly indiscriminate and frighteningly devastating an atomic explosion is. This place pulls no punches, as you would expect. It is",
          "It goes without saying, but be prepared to leave with a heavy heart. This museum provides not only an emotional perspective of the aftermath, but also an educational experience on the history and adverse effects of nuclear war.",
          "Definitely worth the 200yen entry price.... definitely worth the visit. However very hard hitting and emotional. Gives a complete understanding of how terrible wars and nuclear can be. Also very busy but can deal with that",
          "Well worth the visit to truly understand the impact of the nuclear bomb. Was very busy which meant it could be a bit slow to move through but the exhibition was very well done. It was good value too.",
          "Very sobering to see the devastation caused when the U.S.A. dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima during the second world war. Photos, artifacts and some of the surviving people all make this a reminder to the rest of the world that hopefully nothing like this ever happens again.",
          "Every Politician in the world needs to see this. Listened in on English language head set and while crowded with tourists and school trips a truly emotional and important site to see. Museum was very well organized and extremely well done. Not morbid, but definitely sobering.",
          "Visited recently on a trip with teens from Australia studying Japanese. This museum was so well put together. Its very hard to look at everything and not be effected. We spoke with a local later who advised the museum was not done for tourists but rather for the Japanese as a",
          "The museum has recently been renovated and extended and the exhibits are now well laid out. It was extremely busy and you can\u2019t really read all the information because of that but what you will see is very thought provoking. I was particularly moved by the children\u2019s exhibits. I",

          "Very sad but historically accurate. Shows the suffering of the local community. Very reasonable 200 yen entry and 400 for an audio guide. Would recommend but can have gruesome and difficult imagery so be prepared.",
          "If stopping by Hiroshima, this is a must see museum. It is even worth doing a day trip here from Osaka or Kyoto. There are a lot of stories to hear from survivors. All pretty horrifying to read but it is important that everyone understands their suffering. Plenty of artefacts",
          "We paid $2 admission and walked inside. The museum was very very crowded, there were groups of all ages from all over the world. We heard tour guides speaking many different languages, leading somber groups from exhibit to exhibit. We began by walking through vibrant",
          "As per my last review of the childrens park - this is a must visit aswell Very moving and you will be thinking about yourself and mankind a lot - for a few days after thats for sure Do go though lots of interesting exhibts",
          "This is a must see in Japan. It is important to honestly face the reality of decisions made by our country, even though it was the right decision, the horrifying consequences must be faced without hiding from the reality of that decision. I pray it will never happen again, that",
          "This museum is so fantastically designed and set-up to take your through the history of the A-Bomb, Hiroshima and the after effects (both negative and positive) of the bombing. I would highly recommend it and take your time, regardless of how busy it might be to take a look at",
          "Well set out but visit was frustrating as there is no limit to number of visitors. Very slow and too many visitors to see the photographs and exhibits Properly - too crowded which spoilt the visit. You definitely should take the audio guide. Very sobering and thought",
          "We visited for the morning with friends. This museum gives a portrayal of the effects of the nuclear bomb from a local perspective. Many pictures and facts are represented in this large museum. A message of peace is the central theme",
          "Extremely interesting, very thought provoking, a must on anyones Japanese adventures. It is very well laid out and gives clear information.",
          "This museum is excellent, it leaves nothing to the imagination. In places it is quite graphic, and will probably darken your mood. It is impartial, but leaves no stone unturned. There are some quite horrific pictures and you can see people quite tearful. A definite must visit",
          "It's amazing how the residents of Hiroshima (where the first nuclear bomb was dropped on humankind) have taken it on board to use the events of August 6th 1945 to strive for peace in the world. This is a really moving experience, telling personal stories as well as the historic",
          "For the Japanese to exhibit this part of their history and phrase it as \u2018 Japan was on the war of path and initiated the conflict\u2019 was reflective of how far they have come since this bombing. Parts of the museum can be confronting with photos of the injuries inflicted. There was",
          "Not sure that there is a good time to go to the museum, probably after you have seen the beauty of the gardens. It\u2019s one of those places you have to go if only to ensure nothing like this ever happens again. As you go through the museum, everyone is silent, there is a chilling",
          "The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museums is newly renovated and a credit to the people that designed and set up this Memorial Museum. You are able to wonder through at your own pace and take in the exhibits that will bring tears to your eyes. Its sad, devastating and certainly makes",
          "Well curated, extremely impressive museum about the atomic bomb and it's aftermath. Many personal stories and artifacts of the people living there when it happened",
          "This was one of the most anticipated places during our trip to Japan and it did not disappoint. If you are aware of the picture story called Sadako by Eleanor Coerr, and/or another picture story called My Hiroshima by Junko Morimoto, then this place is a must to visit. Easy to",
          "The museum is a good and covers the impact of the bomb and rebuilding. Unlike German memorials there is little reflection on why the situation happened. Truly devastating and impactful take time after to reflect.",
          "Extremely informative and sobering place Spend the extra 400 yen for the headset Can get quite busy and hot so suggest you take a bottle of water ! How the A bomb impacted the children was heart wrenching , showing burnt clothes etc",
          "A beautifully presented museum that explores the events leading up to, during, and since the Hiroshima bombing. Would recommend the audio guide, too as was very cheap and very informative. A little bit busy when we went so struggled to read everything but if you really",
          "Don\u2019t spend any time reading these reviews, just go inside. They have a well planned and considerate experience awaiting anyone that wants to know about the traumatic devastation from an Atomic bomb.",
          "Strange to say visit was excellent being at the sight of such a terrible event. Very Sobering. But also can feel the message of peace.",
          "Go and see. Yes it's a dark place but it happened. The A-bomb drawings by survivors were so moving. There were no cameras at the time, so survivors were asked to draw what they remembered. Very powerful and heart wrenching. The museum is dedicated to not repeating history.",
          "It is a reminder on the extreme pain and suffering of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Vivid photos. Emotional stories. Worth a visit to remind ourselves not to repeat history.",
          "What a museum. There were so many feelings at once when visiting. The horrors of the a-bomb and the distructions of hundreds of thousand lives are so vivid inside the museum and in the paintings that survivals have painted, in the stories and in the remaining clothes, letters",
          "This place is an amazing tri ute to the past that Hiroshima had to endure. The exhibits, the detail and the information left me both emotional and breathless during my visit. It was also a wake up call to us all that we can never have this happen again. Hiroshima is a must visit",
          "As part of a tour including the A Bomb Dome and the Peace Park concluded your visit with the Museum. It is extremely well done and presents a completed picture of the the destructive force of the A bomb and it effects on the people. Very moving experience.",
          "Everybody needs to come here and meditate on important things in life. Walking through the Museum made me think how easy the \"civilized\" people could commit an act of violence taking away hundreds of thousands of human lives in a few seconds. Today Americans are discussing the",
          "Very spacious & well laid out museum. Easy to get around as the route is well sign posted. It was not expensive to get in. Some of the pictures in the exhibition are quite graphic although they are a true reflection of events, they could be upsetting to some people especially",
          "Absolutely worth a visit. The saddest and most confronting exhibition that I have ever seen. Be prepared for graphic images and heart rendering stories of the victims of the bomb. The design of the exhibition is cleverly done as you walk through very dimly lit areas whilst",
          "As you walk through the exhibits which can be confronting for some you can hear nothing but silence apart from people crying from the sheer emotion of what they are seeing. Extremely powerful and for some overwhelming experience but one you must do.",
          "It was a very powerful, somber & memorable visits to The Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima. I always wanted to see this & SO GLAD I did it. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to you. It will be a very stirring & moving experience!",
          "Hiroshima, Japan. Monday 6th August 1945. It is 8.15am. The residents of Hiroshima are preparing for a new day. 31,000 feet above them Colonel Paul Tibbets of the U.S. army is flying a Boeing bomber aircraft. It is called the Enola Gay and is named after his mother. A moment",
          "The museum is very good, it gives a comprehensive and very personal overview of the tragedy that happened here. The feeling is so intense that you feel unwell a whole while after.",
          "Definitely a must see when in Hiroshima. The exhibitions are very interesting and the intention is to share manu stories of the victims. The museum is made in a very personal way and is really touching and gets to you. Lots of tourists that makes it a bit difficult to see/read",
          "While touring, you will see the devastation wrought by man's evil inventions. Many may feel it was a necessary evil, I'll not argue that. However, when you're standing quietly side-by-side with Japanese tourists (and yes, it's very quiet and respectful), it's hard not to",
          "The museum does a wonderful job of showing the impact that the atomic bomb had, not only for those directly impacted by the bomb, but also by the hundreds and thousands of people who tried to help those in need after the bombing. Between the museum and the nearby monuments",
          "Given the history of Hiroshima this museum is always going to be sobering but it was informative and unbiased. I would definitely recommend visiting but lots would be difficult for young children to see as there are many upsetting images.",
          "Happy that we finally made it to Hiroshima, it was so detailed everyone has learnt in history about the World War and the bombing of japan..here you are actually seeing what happened in 1946 ..the bombing of Hiroshima. The graphics of the explosion is so well done , the photos ,",
          "A fascinating museum that tells the stories of the people of Hiroshima during the atomic blast. Very cheap and all the displays include an English translation beside them. The first half of the museum is sombre and includes lots of items (including the belongings of children)",
          "Interesting and moving place A bit crowded Personalised narrative of the victims family A sense of the gravity and sadness that this was required to end a war",
          "This is perhaps one of the most moving experiences we had during our Japanese holiday. The Atomic Dome, Peace Park and Museum are all captivating, with many deeply personal stories and reflections. There is an audiovisual display that gives a depiction of the bomb dropping which",
          "This was a place we just had to visit since we saw the film, Rhapsody in August, some two decades ago. The Atomic Dome, the Peace Park and the Museum were deeply moving to see and to reflect upon. The exhibits in the museum made the story very tangible. The stories of the",
          "This is a must place in Hiroshima. Prepare to be touched by the horrific personal stories of victims and relatives of the first atomic bombing.",
          "If you are in Hiroshima you must come to this museum. If you are in Japan you should come to this museum.",
          "Good museum with lots of details and facts. But not very organised with too many tourists. Long queue for ticket.",
          "Wow. What a truly memorable experience. An incredible museum capturing so much emotion and truth. I learnt a lot. The memorials all around the park are also amazing. Highly recommend. One of the best museums I\u2019ve ever been to.",
          "Very well laid out. Brought me to tears on more than one occasion. I think every would leader should visit this place before they are allowed to govern a country. Putin, trump, kim jong un take note! No more Hiroshimas! \u975e\u5e38\u306b\u3088\u304f\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u4f55\u5ea6\u304b\u6d99\u3092\u6d41\u3057\u305f\u3002",
          "No doubt this is a good museum but avoid it at peak times. We could literally hardly move in some displays due to the massive crowds and it was hot. I could barely see the displays. I think it is dangerous to crowd so many people in. This museum would be good if it was properly",
          "We were not sure what to expect, but this made us cry. You see the history, people, artifacts, and notebooks. It tells the story of what happened after and how people lived and survived. It talked about radiation and it's effects. There were a lot of field trips / Japanese",
          "This museum was very well done. It was just so hard to go through it. We cried a lot. It was good for our teenage children to understand what had happened but I don't think I would have taken them if they were younger. It is definitely a place you should visit and respect",
          "This museum is a must for historical purposes. It really gives you the perspective of what occurred in Hiroshima when the A-bomb was dropped during WW2. The story it told of the people it affected really makes you feel for them. I have been to this museum once before in October",
          "This is a place you must visit. So many people had died and hope will not happen again anywhere in the world.",
          "This is a very busy place. Much to see and very depressing. There are many pictures and diaramas to see.",
          "The museum is a strong reminder of the horrors of nuclear weapons. The main exhibit focuses on the bombing of August 6th, 1945 and the effect on the people of Hiroshima. Which was horrible. Be aware that the exhibit can evoke strong emotions with photos and portrayals of the",
          "The whole peace memorial park is a great place to visit and it promotes contemplation and respect. It\u2019s right in the heart of the city and easy to find. The shrine and memorial are both close to the Promotion building (the remnants of the building closest to the blast centre).",
          "The world of today needs museums like this, as we need to understand our past to do our best for the future. There are other horrifying things we need to remember, like Holocaust, Pearl Harbor etc, which also have important memorials. The horrors of the atomic bomb are",
          "I spent 3 nights in Hiroshima as I wanted to take my time when I was visiting the Hiroshima Peace Memorial sites. I worked in the Nuclear Power industry when I was working and I realize that a lot of the knowledge that we have on radiation exposure came from the data on the",
          "We spent a couple of hours visiting today. The photos and stories of the people that lost their lives were quite haunting. It gives a better perspective of what the people endured. Great tribute",
          "Walked here from the Dome. Paid the Y200 --no JR pass here. The artifacts they have gathered are incredible. There is so much to see and read here. This is worth so much more than the entrance fee they charge. Outside this museum, you can catch the loop bus going back to",

          "It's amazing how after so long this place still has such a strong feeling of pain and remembrance. The way the museum is arranged and the detail of everything, you would be hard done not to bring a tear to your eye. Great to experience something like this to give you hope and",
          "This well set out museum is dedicated to documenting the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in World War II. It is a harrowing story and not suitable for young children. I found the information and photographs quite disturbing but I think every person and particularly our world leaders",
          "Keen that we should visit Hiroshima it\u2019s hard to avoid the past and the horrors of war. Not just the war but the aftermath and the lack of support given to the Japanese here. There were many stories of death and survival. The shock was how many passed away in the period",
          "What a fantastic museum. There is so much information laid out in a really interesting and informative way with lots of good little videos, lots of pictures etc. It's really well done. Hard to believe the devastation that was cause here.we spent about 3 hours here and could have",
          "Despite the crowds, there\u2019s virtually no noise. People are locked in their own thoughts. The feeling is similar to that of the Holocaust museum. The focus is very much on the ordinary people of Hiroshima - and the suffering they endured, not the politics of the time. Looking",
          "This museum is a critical part of Hiroshima and not to be missed. Even our teenage boys who are unimpressed with everything put down their cell phones long enough to immerse themselves in the exhibits. Personally, I am so touched and impressed by the resiliency of this city",
          "Visiting the museum was a powerful experience. Definitely a place I would recommend to anyone visiting Japan.",
          "Great place to remember a horrible day in Hiroshima\u2019s history. Definitely must see. A lot of memories of people who suffered",
          "Currently going through seismic upgrades. It does what museums are supposed to do. Inform and provoke discussion. We took friends from China with us, who has heard of an atomic bomb but never understood the scope of damage and the horror inflicted. The children, five and",
          "This museum give a human face to the tragedy of the atomic bomb. Reading first hand accounts of this event was very impactful.",
          "When tragedy happens, the easy thing to do is the shy away from it. The people of Hiroshima have done the hard work for you and preserved the experiences of their relatives and loved-ones and placed them in a safe place to be seen and better understood. Yes, it is heavy and sad,",
          "This museum accomplishes it\u2019s goal to remind us of the people whose lives were affected. With many photos, quotes, pictures, and personal items, the horror of this event was brought to life. Near the end of the one way walk through the museum was an interesting display",
          "This museum focuses primarily on the innocent victims of the Atomic Bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Roughly 90% of the victims were nonmilitary. They don't spend too much time talking about the US and Japanese governments or how we got to the events of August 6, 1945. The primary",
          "Very informative and good value. Most transcripts in English as well as Japanese. Some harrowing stories of the effects of the atomic bomb.",
          "This was one intens museum to visit, it's super heavy, but shows why world peace is needed. Anyone who comes to Hiroshima should go here, be amazed and be humble. You'll need at least 2 hours to see it all, but I personally rushed through it a bit on the end.. it's quite a lot",
          "This place is a telling depiction of the tragedy of A-Bomb. A fascinating way of showing the devastation and educational to a point that you will loathe all the nuclear warfare activities. Simply outstanding and you will Tear up",
          "Mention museum to me and I fail to get excited. However, as this building dominates the Peace Park you may as well take a look. My advice. Don't miss it. Full of remnants of the atomic bomb blast, clothes, toys etc. You will never forget it and you will be anti-nuclear forever",
          "The Peace Memorial Museum is definitely a must-see in Japan, and much can be learnt from the displays. It's a humbling place which captures the horror of nuclear warfare and also details the sequence of events leading to deployment from the Allies. That said, if I had to go",
          "...which is really the point the museum is trying to make. It presents the dropping of the bomb and its aftermath, and their effect on the population. Virtually everything on display has descriptions in English as well as Japanese, and headsets can be rented in other languages",
          "There is so much more to this site than the Peace Dome, which is very moving in its own right. Make sure to take time to walk the grounds and to see the Peace Mound, where all the unidentifiable cremated bodies were buried, the Peace Bell, and the Children's Memorial. The",
          "Truly moving experience explaining, in a high-tech, innovative way, what happened during the bombing and the aftermath. While it does talk about how the Americans planned the bombing, it very obviously avoids any explanation or information as to why Japan was bomb (so for the",
          "We have visited many museums in our travels over the years but I have to say that this is the best, and most moving place I have ever visited. I was born just after the events of Hiroshima and it is so hard to believe that this could happen. The attitude and belief of the people",
          "I have wanted to visit JAPAN for many years and I now have made it twice now with more planned visits. Hiroshima has been in my thoughts for many years and I new I would visit when I got here and I am so very glad I did. Its amazing city",
          "This is an incredibly moving experience. It's not often a Museum will shock you or move you as much as this one. Its fascinating too as it documents Hiroshima before, during and after the Atomic Bomb detonation. Some very arresting displays of photos of victims and their burns,",
          "The museum was absolutely beautiful and very well designed- I wish we had similar ones in Australia. However, the story was told from the Japanese perspective and this can be difficult to understand if you had family or friends who fought. Would highly recommend, but suggest",
          "This is the major attraction in Hiroshima and probably why you are here or going so it goes without saying it's a must see. Very thought provoking but be aware also very confronting which is the point. The focus on the local children will leave an impression. I think no matter",
          "The horror and heartbreaking real life stories of victims and survivors of the A-bomb are sensitivity told through exhibits and artefacts. However, most importantly, the museum carries an important message about the vital need for nuclear disarmament to avoid a similar tragedy",
          "The Peace Memorial and Museum is extremely evocative with an array of well presented artefacts, testimonies and photographs supported with interactive screens which allows each user to explore those aspects of the memorial and event to their own level. The building itself is",
          "If you are traveling w/ children 10 years old or younger, you should prepare them for the exhibits. There were a lot of school children ~ ages 10-12 on field trip. We saw a few students crying and their teacher had to escort them out of the exhibit. A worthwhile education",
          "We really enjoyed our visit the this museum. It was well laid out and we learnt heaps about the atomic bomb of hiroshima. Very sad but a very informative museum.",
          "We wanted to know more about the bombing and this was perfect. Maps, a great video (personal survivor stories), mementos (clothing) and affecting stories of loss, bravery....not to be missed. Makes a definite argument for world peace (esp nuclear disarmament).",
          "See written review for further details. All in all a great and modern way to commemorate the events leading up to, and the aftermath of, that fateful morning of August 6th 1945.",
          "Very moving memorial with well-considered exhibits and stories. The beginning of the museum starts with an aerial projected map of Hiroshima city and provides an insight into the devastation and extent of damage on that fateful day, and is a perfect lead into the rest of the",
          "Some of the exhibits can be quite upsetting including clothing & personal effects worn by the victims. We had a private talk with a Hiroshima survivor who told us her sad story. She was 8 years old & was only 3km from the hypocentre & she very open discussing that day & her",
          "There were lovely volunteers at the museum who approached you to explain the different artefacts and items that you are looking at. They helped make sense of what you were looking at. The displays at the bottom level was truly inspiring. You see all the items that the citizens",
          "Such a nice place to visit and see the history. such a nice park area. great place to spend an hour or so walking around",
          "An incredible collection of artifacts from the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima in 1945. Bottles, ceramics and metal items fused together by the intense heat. The stone step from the Sumitomo Bank, with the shadow of a customer, waiting for the bank to open, all that remained of",
          "The museum houses a stunning collection of artifacts associated with the bombing of Hiroshima, and the devastating aftermath. Parts of it may be difficult to go through because the museum doesn't shy away from showing how the blast directly affected the human body. And if you",
          "Exhibits were well presented and moving. The first part of the museum tells the stories of people who experienced the atom bomb. The latter part explained the historical context and a little of the science. Well worth visiting.",
          "This Museum gives you an insight into what occurred to the Japanese civilians during the last stages of WWII when the A-bomb was dropped. The photos are chilling and very emotive, but when you read the stories it really hits you. Some people were actually sobbing. It's a slow",
          "The purpose of the museum was to raise awareness of the devastation caused by the atomic bomb dropped on the city. It was very impactful and you left feeling sad for the victims and fearful that this can occur in the future. It hopes that such awareness will hopefully make",
          "Absolutely worth seeing once in your life if you ever visit Hiroshima. The peace parc and museum are both very informative and you can also even touch some of the original pieces of houses that are from that time. Be prepared to get emotional though as it is nothing for weak",
          "The museum handles a difficult subject exceptionally well. The content is perfectly balanced: a range of fact and emotion, covering all aspects. It's hard to see how a museum could cover this in a better way. Highly recommended for all ages and everyone should learn something.",
          "If you want to understand the impact of atomic bombs this is the place to learn. You are guaranteed to leave a little different to when you arrived. Outline graphically the consequences.",
          "My husband and I visited this place with G Adventure as a guided tour. The guide took us on the bus. So easy and quick to get in. So easy to get around and literally see and read everything to fully understand what went on. There are posts to read, pictures to see, illustrative",
          "I\u2019m going to echo the sentiments precisely of the previous review on TA. The exhibition itself is superb; thought provoking, moving, educational. But the museum needs to address its entrance policy. Literally over a thousand school kids were let in at the same time. It was, at",
          "A very well laid out museum, only recently opened when we visited. Very clearly laid out and tells the story so well. Unfortunately when we visited it was also the time for thousands of school children to also to visit and it was so crowded we were unable to walk around and it",
          "Very clearly exhibits the tragedies of war. Allow several hours for this museum if you want to read all the posted stories. Definitely need to rent the audio guide.",
          "The museum has graphic photo's and stories from survivors of the atomic bomb blast. You can become quite emotional looking at the photo's, and reading some of the stories from the survivors, but they are a must to read. If you go to Hiroshima you have to come here to see the",
          "An Absolute must. to see the true reality behind the stories we were all taught in school. A glimpse inside the account of the people who went through this atrocious act and to see past the american propoganda to hide it.",
          "While sobering in its images of devastation, there emerges a feeling of how courageous and resourceful the people were in rebuilding their city after such a cataclysm.",
          "The museum was reopened at the end of April and we had the opportunity to visit. The museum is a hard visit as are all things related to war. It is sobering and redeeming.",
          "Museum was extremely busy, tourists and schoolchildren packing it out. The pictures and items they have on show are quite graphic but absolutely relevant and shows the reality. As someone else already wrote, there are two sides to the story and there is a very brief mention to",
          "Wow very confronting, I wasn\u2019t born in 1945 and only heard about it from television docos. We listened to a brilliant talk from an A bomb survivor, it was her perspective of what happened and she was able to draw what she actually saw. I shall never forget her passion for peace",
          "We were near the end of an 8-day bus tour of Japan. An optional tour on the bullet train to Hiroshima was available. To see the miraculous recovery of a destroyed city and landscape, was well worth it, but the Peace Memorial Museum is something I think everyone on earth should",
          "I think it's one of these places everyone should visit at least once in their life. We all learn about Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the horror of the atomic bombings at school, but here, with all of these photographs, stories and survivors artwork* it takes that knowledge to a",
          "I usually don\u2019t post reviews on sightseeing only hotels but on this occasion I will. This Museum is everything you would imagine and then more. So tastefully done with photographs of survivors mixed with paintings drifting the scenes from the survivors point of view. I was",
          "The museum was very well made and the fee was very reasonable. We liked the exhibitions, especially the first one explaining about the US atomic bomb programs and testing prior to the bombing of Hiroshima. They also have exhibits about people\u2019s injuries and the effects from",
          "History was right before my eyes as I walked through this Museum looking at all photographs and exhibits. My heart went to the innocent folks who perished especially the many innocent school children. Any kind of War should never have happened, revenge & retaliation belong to",
          "A detailed explanation of what happened when and after the bomb was dropped. It\u2019s at times harrowing but if you\u2019re in Hiroshima this is a must-see. The animation showing before and after is particularly shocking. If you take kids be aware that they may find some images scaring.",
          "The museum does a very good job sharing what happened on the day of the bombing and the time afterward. As one can expect, there was very little about the Japanese aggression that ultimately led to the bombing. I was somewhat troubled by the storyline that the bombing occurred",
          "This museum is very moving, what man can do to man, awful. My visit was overwhelming sad , the museum is well set out and informative. The surrounding Peace. park full of memorials also moving.. every visit to Hiroshima should include going around this area.",
          "This museum really brings to life the magnitude of the atomic bomb's impact on Hiroshima. You are not only presented with the statistics, which are mind-blowing, but real examples, wome of which can be touched. The before and after of a roof tile and blasted bottle made an",
          "This Museum was originally considered as the main part of the Peace Park. The architect of the Museum and the Park as a whole Kenzo Tange made the Museum deliberately simple to strengthen the impact of the exhibition. Despite the fact that I came prepared, the exposition is",
          "I found Hiroshima to be a beautiful city! But as we entered the peace park to head to the memorial, as beautiful as it is, it feels heavy.. the whole area still has a sadness about it that is palpable. On entering the museum you are immersed straight away by walking into a",
          "We specifically came to Hiroshima to visit the peace park and museum, it was very easy to get here on the Sightseeing loop bus, stops pretty much out the front. The day we went was relatively busy but manageable, definitely recommend getting the guide as it was hard to read",
          "I was deeply touched by my visit . Crowds representing many nations walked around in almost total silence as they viewed the display and read the accounts of suffering and loss . I had a wonderful visit to Japan and it would not have been right to return home without visiting",
          "Impressive exhibit showing Hiroshima before the bomb and then again after the bomb. The photographs and exhibits are poignant. The museum tells the stories of the victims and their families in graphic detail. Some of the exhibits and photos may not be the best for small",
          "We visited the museum and it was reasonably busy. I have never experienced such a silence with so many people. Everybody must have been with their thought when walking through the museum. Facts are displayed, stories are told. It must have been hell on earth. Please visit as",
          "Looked like it could have been good, however there were about 6 schools attending (well over 1000 kids) and the museum staff had zero crowd control. You couldn\u2019t even see any of the displays in the expos. Sad really. All they needed to do was to let a few people through, wait fa",
          "After you\u2019ve done the peace park you must not miss the museum. The peace park gives you a flavour of what happened here in 1945. The museum gives you a fuller, more frank and sobering experience. Be warned it is upsetting. However what\u2019s the point in shielding yourself from",
          "I did not actually attend - and if you can pre book to skip lines I would. They were soooo long possibly as I was visiting during Golden Week so many locals. I was disappointed I didn't go - but plenty to keep you educated.",
          "If you are contemplating weather to visit the Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima, I highly recommend it! It was extremely affordable and laid out beautifully. We spent about an hour and half in there but you could easily spend even more time since there is so much to see and",
          "The museum is well done, though heart breaking. Bring tissue! The museum goes over the daily life, the aftermath and info about nuclear weapons and the history.",
          "The Peace Museum is a highlight of the town- emotional and heartbreaking. The artefacts that are scattered throughout take you back to a time that was harsh and crewel and have you leave hoping that the prayer for Peace truly does come true.",
          "The Hiroshima peace park tragedy of world war 2 thousand of people affected by the atomic bomb It is beautiful place to reflect on the impacts of war",
          "If you come to Hiroshima and do not visit this museum; shame on you. Do yourself a favour and invest in the headphones, they are well worth the money. It is incomprehensible what the Japanese must have gone through on that fateful day and for generations afterwards. My children",
          "This museum is one of the best I\u2019ve been to, low entry fee yet great displays, a must do on a visit to Hiroshima. It was still under renovation when we visited but you would never have known. I loved the little section about Sadako & The Thousand Paper Cranes, a story that has",
          "This is a fairly large space for what there is in it, but given the number of people visiting, it needs to be. It means that you can back out of the crowds and get your breath back, which is a good thing. I found the chronology/ build up information about the Manhattan project",
          "It was a heavy experience reading the eye witness accounts from children and family members of having to bury parents and siblings, having to deal with their own sickness and injuries, then having to find a place to live. The USA sent personnel to study the effects, but not to",
          "A very nice museum which is presented very well. Obviously it\u2019s a shocking thing to read and see about and they portray the victims journeys very well. Worth a visit if you\u2019re in Hiroshima.",
          "This museum has it all. Artifacts, photographs, paintings and documents on display, everything with excellent description in English. There are also film clips and interactive multimedia displays. The rental audio guide is well worth the extra 400 yen, as it gives more in depth",
          "When visiting Hiroshima this museum is a must. The stories told are powerful and moving. There are many personal items on view which add to the overal experience. Don\u2019t miss it!!!",
          "When you are in Hiroshima you also get know the sad story of this city. In this museum they show you the horror of this brutal attack. The story and the pictures make you sad and i did not spend to much time here, it\u2019s for sure not something you wanna hear during your vacation.",
          "I can\u2019t really explain anything further than what you would expect from this museum. It is a very thought provoking experience which leaves you with a sad feeling inside but also one of hope too. It\u2019s a must see for all visitors to the city.",
          "Very sad to see everything in here.I rent the audio which is worth it.Not much to say.Go check it out.The entry fee very cheap compare to what u get",
          "Although only the smaller building is currently open, the exhibits capture the enormity of that day, and was well worth the time spent wandering through the three story exhibit space. It is also just a short walk to the overlook for the dome building.",
          "The main museum is currently being renovated I think so the museum we saw was rather small and gives a very biased version of WWll and the reasons for the bombing. However, the video of the survivors of the nuclear bomb - the hibakusha - was really informative and frankly was",
          "Exhibits and information was incredible. It was humbling to be an American there. Make sure you take the time to sit and listen to the live accounts of the events from survivors. Absolutely heartbreaking",
          "You will remember this visit forever. When you see the human and physical impacts of the nuclear bomb it makes you wonder why we persist in developing and deploying more of them. Some of our world leaders should visit here. The visit was made even more impactful by a talk by an",
          "This museum is very powerful, but for those who are sensitive it might be graphically overwhelming. It is very much like the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, but smaller.",
          "This museum is well thought out but extremely emotional. Make sure you have somthing fun planned for afterwards.",
          "A very nice museum with many very graphic images of the aftermath of the bombing. Not for the faint of heart but very necessary to see.",
          "Let\u2019s pray this will never happen again. A powerful demonstration of how it can all go so wrong. The suffering that the people of Hiroshima have endured is unfathomable. I am a rather stoic individual, I could not hold back the tears during this visit.",
          "A very well thought out and organised museum. the highlight of our visit was an hour presentation from a lady who survived the bomb. We were all moved by her story. The exhibits, and more particularly the pictures and stories about the hundreds or even thousands of children who",
          "Words cannot describe the images and accounts from people who survived the atomic bomb. The exhibition is beautifully constructed and gives a very balanced view. There is also a very good section on the state of nuclear arms today and the risk to humanity as a whole.",
          "A very thought provoking place to visit to understand the past and the decisions that were made and the consequences of those decisions for generations to come. A must do if you visit the country.",

          "My wife and I were here on a Gate1 tour, Optional Excursion to Hiroshima and Miyajima. We had never been to either place and Hiroshima was on my bucket list. It is very moving, seeing the terrible tragedy of what can happen when countries use nuclear weapons. Museum is very",

          "We queued for about an hour (during golden week) and it was busy but attended a presentation in English which was excellent and very informative. I had no idea how bad the a-bomb was and what far reaching devastation it caused - quite frightening- WE NEED TO RID THE WORLD OF",

          "I took the train from Osaka to Hiroshima with a tour group. The peace memorial park and museum were moving and heart-wrenching. We had to visit the museum without a guide, but the explanations were well done. I loved seeing the memorial to Sadako and the thousands and thousands",

          "This was one of the most touching museum I\u2019ve been to. It helped me understand more about the tragedy one nation caused to another one. Civilian lives destroyed and wasted because of the atrocity of a war. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",
          "The most impressive are the testimony of survivors and the stories and pictures of those that did not.",
          "The upstairs wall has a timeline of events , there is also a 3D reconstruction of the bomb explosion over the city. By far the most interesting and touching are the artefacts, clothing, personal belongings and household items from the day . Whilst some might find this",
          "We came here with one of the two remaining guides that was in a cave playing with friends when the bomb exploded. That made the visit more of an impact. He was 86 years old. The exhibits are well documented and there was plenty of room to move around the rooms.",
          "Hiroshima is a beautiful, easy to navigate city with a wonderful message about peace and the end to war. Nothing brings home the message of why that is like the Peace Museum. My young neice and I spent several hours reading and viewing the informative and compelling exhibits in",
          "The numbers are so huge that it is hard to take it in but I suppose that\u2019s part of the intention behind this memorial. Include it in your visit as it won\u2019t take long and you will be glad you did.",
          "The museum is very good- they have lots of interesting exhibits so it is worth visiting. The only thing is that some of the exhibits and information is very hard to see when there are lots and lots of people as it is all either small or set low down- it hasn't been designed to",

          "I felt some disappointment with this museum, not only because the main hall was closed when we visited (Nov '18), but I felt the displays made it very difficult to access everything without people standing in front of you, getting in the way. There is a long wall of letters,",
          "If in Hiroshima, you must visit the museum. Best thing to do is to initially look round area, then call into museum.",
          "Very emotional place to visit. The museum gives and excellent insight to life in Hiroshima before and after the atomic bombed was dropped on the city. Depicts the sadness and horror of war here and around the world.",
          "It is a beautiful site with obviously lot of information the nuclear attack on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Lot of decency and inspiration for a peaceful world. We were only available for a few hours early in the morning and therefore could not benefit from the guided tour",

          "Very well done! We visited Pearl Harbor in Hawaii first and then travelled to Hiroshima. No comparison. Such a beautiful message of peace. No blame. Just a factual account of devastation. I left in tears as I did in Auschwitz and Cambodia. Thank you. May we never forget.",
          "I always knew that this would be an emotional event but towards the end I couldn\u2019t continue to read the harrowing stories. I am very glad I went but it was quite upsetting especially when it came to reading and seeing the photos of the young children who were impacted by this",
          "It\u2019s located next to the Peace Park. It cost 300 yen to enter. The history of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima was well documented here, it was worth the time spent here learning more about what happened on that fateful day and the days after that.",
          "The museum underwent renovation when we were there, but nonetheless it was an interesting place. You learn a lot about the devastation that hit the city, and some exhibits and the story behind them are very touching.",
          "One of the highlights of my trip to Japan was visiting Hiroshima. While it was emotionally difficult to walk through the museum and see the devastation that was imposed on this city and the people, it is so important that we recognize the horror and atrocity that was done.",
          "After seeing the A-bomb building wasn\u2019t sure if we were up to this one. Hiroshima is a very sobering experience - but there is also a feeling of hope. Very emotional experience.",

          "A must visit if in Hiroshima. A very graphic account of the horrors this town endured both in 1945 and for many years afterwards. An historical account which explains in depth the history behind the bomb and the devastation caused. A very humbling sad experience. Hats off to",
          "No visit to Hiroshima should be complete without visiting this museum. It's informative well structured. It is a very harrowing and sobering experience. Hats off to the people who helped rebuild Hiroshima to what it is in this modern age.",
          "This was an incredibly emotional experience for me. Seeing the suffering of those not killed immediately in the explosion and reading how their tragedies unfolded was quite confronting. But it isn\u2019t just all doom and gloom. From this absolute horror comes a spirit of peace and",
          "My 11-year-old was overwhelmed by the videos, the artifacts that were there and esp pictures that were very graphic of injuries. However, the power is important, and even with half the museum closed we learned a lot. It is great that it is in the lovely large park for some brain",
          "Very interesting but also sad. Had difficulty viewing the result of the bombing especially the torn clothes of the children and the photographs of before and after the event.",
          "This is where it all comes together. A mixture of factual development, science and human endeavour followed by suffering from release above Hiroshima in August 1945. No one should tell you how long to take to absorb the impact.",

          "Our extended family traveling group of ten visited the museum and all found it immensely worthwhile. It is well done, informative, and moving. No matter what individual conclusions you may reach regarding nuclear weapons, it\u2019s hard to not appreciate the immense human impact",

          "I think Hiroshima has done this really well and with both visual displays and a strong storyline gets the message over that we don\u2019t want another A Bomb dropped anywhere, ever. From an educational point of view I think this Museum deals with Japanese military involvement in the",
          "One of the things you'd NEVER miss in Hiroshima (obviously) is it's reprocessing of history - especially the dropping of the worlds first atomic bomb. For me the Peace Memorial Museum is a must see for everyone coming to Hiroshima (besides the A-bomb dome). The exhibition",
          "Mesmerizing and overwhelming in spirit! It would require a truly cold callus individual not the be moved by the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. Required viewing for everyone in the world!",

          "very well done, thoughtful and heart touching museum. Must visit if you are anywhere near this side of Japan.",
          "Anything I can say about this museum will seem petty as the exhibits really do speak for themselves. During my visit, the main building is under renovation but there was still enough on show to fill several hours as you try and comprehend exactly what happened to Hiroshima in",
          "The main part of the building was closed during our visit. It was being made earthquake proof. Even so, there was still plenty to see. One of the highlights was a presentation made by a lady telling the story of one survivor in the words of the survivor. The story of the bombing",
          "Our visit there was well with the travel, wait and price. No disappointments here. Striking displays and video histories during the tour. Well worth the visit.",
          "While the main museum is under renovation, there is a temporary exhibit for people to view. I felt there was enough information and enough of the collection displayed to give me a better understanding of how devastating and horrific the atomic bombing was. I can say that I was",
          "This museum has built for the peace and because we shoud not forget the atomic bombing or total destruction it caused. The museum has a message: No more hiroshimas. The museo itself is not very big and it is easy to follow the route and it took me about sn hour to walk all room",
          "A fitting tribute to an unparalleled tragedy. Solemn memorial that captures the essence of the suffering, and the rebuilding. Must visit when in Japan - should make into everyone's Japan itinerary.",

          "We spent over an 2 hours reading and watching the video displays of how devastating the effects of the nuclear bomb was on Hiroshima it was only 200\u00a5 to get in and then another 200\u00a5 if you had the audio tapes we didn't get that everything is well displayed in English and it was",
          "Only a portion of the museum was open, but the displays were still quite large and very nice. They are very thorough. There is a nice gift shop where you can purchase books, or other souvenirs and the cost to get in was only 2 yen per person. Definitely worth your time",
          "This is a large memorial museum with parts of it still under construction. The ground floor is free to visit with upper floors pay to enter. We decided we would give the upper floors a miss - I understand these were largely devoted to a history of Hiroshima both before and",
          "Very interesting! Amazing museum done very well. Very sad visual of artifacts kept by families of victims on display. Allow plenty of time to read & take in the information.",
          "This is a must see place, despite being saddening to see how nuclear weapons can impact such large area. It is very well organized and educational museum and it is fascinating to see how devastating it is for humans",
          "Although the main building will reopen later in 2019 after renovations and earthquake upgrades, the well-organized collection in the side documents very jarringly the history of nuclear weapons and their devastation of the city in August 1945.",

          "Take the time to sit and watch the display of quotes from world leaders who have visited the Museum that are displayed on the wall above the reception area. One can only hope that never again will an atomic bomb be detonated over a population centre.",
          "Only the east wing is open while undergoing renovation now. Exhibits are still good, from survivor testimonies to artefacts to history of the making. Seeing some of the artefacts really bring about a lot of sadness the world can be so harsh, and a good reminder for us to keep",

          "You should go to have the Japanese perspective of the WW2. The information they provided was very one-sided though. It said nothing about the sufferings and unimaginable tortures Japan inflicted on other countries. It\u2019s however worth going as it\u2019s informative and it does show",
          "The museum brings to light the destruction caused by atomic warfare. Part of the museum was closed for renovation so we only saw a small portion. Rented an audio headset which was nice as we didn\u2019t have to get close to the exhibition or elbow through the crowd reading the",

          "This is not a \"beautiful\" museum, it's not its purpose. It must inform on the history, the consequences and the pain suffered by the people as a result of the nuclear bombing. It must give something to think about, it must make everyone feel involved in preventing that another",

          "This is a must see stop if you visit Hiroshima. The museum itself was modern, the exhibits fascinating and highly Interactive and it holds no punches. You will learn the answers to almost any question you may have about what happened that fateful day as well as the aftermath.",
          "Its amazing what you can learn from the history of how the war in the Pacific has ended. By the least, the museum and the standing building from the Atomic bomb gave me some goosebumps. I have learned a-lot. Whats close to it are a-lot of food shops that you must visit while in",

          "A very impressive place, nobody can remain indiferent during a visit to this museum. A very simple architecture as should to be but at same time cozy. Very well organized and it's easy to spend 3 or 4 hours to visit. When we leave out we feel a knot in the throat",
          "The main building is closed for renovation; they are making it more earthquake ready. The exhibits are all housed in the building to the left (when looking at the main building from the eternal flame). We got the audio guides but I wouldn't recommend as everything the audio",
          "This was an intense experience. I am generally a sensitive person, and more or less I cried all the way through the museum. Seeing the results of the atomic bomb up close is completely different to reading about it from afar and I can recommend staying a while to watch some of",
          "It was great to see how many japanese school kids there were at age of 6 to 9. They study history, because knowledge is everything... Yes. Fears and tears during our visit, but in a good way. Lot of discussions afterwoods, so go. Now.",

          "The main part was closed due to earthquake prevention so the exhibit is in a side building. But still definitely worth the visit. We were lucky enough to arrive in time for a talk in a small room. It was going to be 45 minutes but the lady said we didn\u2019t have to stay for it all.",
          "With the small price tag of 400yen for a Family of 4 it is certainly fantastical priced and we visited whilst half the museum was under renovation but this did not lessen our experience. This is not a war museum but a way of remembering and ensuring that another nuclear bomb is",

          "Our family travelled to Hiroshima to go to the Peace Museum which is a phenomenal experience and not to be missed. Very moving and sad and an important historical place. Highly recommended.",
          "We visited here while in the area recently. As noted, the main museum is undergoing renovations, but a second building houses many moving and disturbing exhibits that make you think about war and how horrible it is. As difficult as some of the exhibits are to see, I think",
          "A must see for anyone interested in history or the future. Will stay in you memory as it has for those who lived through this.",
          "The museum and the peace park are so incredibly moving - at times they just stopped me dead in my tracks trying to comprehend the horror of what happened and the personal costs of the tragedy. In fact, what I think this place does so well is connect the personal 'details' to the",
          "Although there were renovations taking place while we were there, I still felt that I learned a great deal from this museum, and that it gave me a good explanation of what happened to Hiroshima. It had some really excellent photography, and also use of projection so that you",

I thought it was very fair in depicting the situation, and very interesting. Today, there was nothing",

          "We planned a trip to Osaka, Miyajima and Kyoto. I think for all of us, an unexpected highlight was the Peace Park. It is beautifully done and very poignant. Everyone should see it so we can remember the past, pay tribute to the victims and learn for the future.",
          "I've been to both the peace museums of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Both tell the same story - the history of the war and the time leading up to the bombing, things we already covered in our own history textbooks, and something else - the suffering of the normal civilians from the",

          "Perhaps like yourself, I have thought deeply about whether the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was just or necessary at the end of WW2. So many deaths of civilians, so much loss, so much suffering. Was it any worse than the Tokyo/Shanghai/London/Dresden conventional",

          "Hard to describe the emotions this museum's exhibits evoke.

          "Of course, this isn't the place to go if you're looking for a fun day out in the city, but if you do go you'll have a day you never forget. The heartbreaking exhibits contain facts, photos, art and a powerful digital rendering of the blast \u2026",

          "Hauntingly beautiful museum recounting the atrocities of the nuclear bomb. We came to Hiroshima for this museum alone and whilst it\u2019s very confronting it\u2019s also extremely important. The whole area has been preserved very nicely.",

          "Fantastic experience. It really depicts the horrors of atomic warfare.",
          "Queue to enter the museum building to get your ticket is quite long. Outside queue area is protected from the sun but still very hot. Once inside the queue continues but air-conditioned. Don't know if queues are always this long. Admission \u2026",

          "A definite worthwhile cost that is compelling but harrowing (particularly for younger attendees)",

          "Amazing reflection of what hsppened. It does not glorify but causes one to consider the event and why it should never happen again. The personal testimonials aee extremely moving.",

          "Beautiful place but somber memories and vibe",
          "This place made me cry more than I ever thought I could. It was something I had to see and I'm glad I did. I can't explain the hurt I felt reading all the entries and stories but all I can ever say is this is something every person needs to see and witness and experience.",

          "A spectacular museum and well worth the trip from Osaka. This museum really opened my eyes on the devastation of the bombings and the impact it had on the Japanese civilians. It's a must go even if you're not a history nut. The museum does an excellent job on immersing you in this destructive act during world war 2.",
          "Get mus\u00e9um for learn about the Hiroshima bombing.  Only negative is that it is very busy and thus slow to get through when you want to read throughout.  At 200 Yen you can understand why it is so busy.",

          "It is so emotionally here, it contains debris, news and effect from the occasion, explaining how hard people survived the bomb. The war is not what we want but peace.

          "Harrowing but very worthwhile.",
          "This monument has been one great reminder for the living to keep spreading peace. The place has many memorabilia from the the day. It has many informations on the time the tragedy happens. The entrance ticket is reasonable. The place has \u2026",

          "Not to be missed on your trip to Japan...extremely moving",

          "Nothing can quite prepare you for the personal stories and photographs of the 6th August 1945, and the days and months after.

          "Incredibly sombre experience. Perfectly represented",
          "Hiroshima was my one destination of my Japan trip. Everything in the peace memorial was full of sadness of the war and loss. I couldn't take photo as many I as possible because I was sunk into every detail and too emotional. Particularly \u2026",
          "It great insight on the last weeks and days before first A-bomb has been used and than an overview of devastating results of the blast. It just reminds us that Nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction should be band.",
          "Can be too much for some as stories and items presented are from children. Explains the build up, the day and aftermath in clear ways. Uses videos, pictures, artefacts and many other forms to help you understand",
          "An absolutely must in Japan! The heavy meaning of the memorial and the museums in the zone is to great for humanity. I suggest to expend from 2-3h in there to access the museum, read the meaning of every location and memorial. An excellent place for reflection as an human being.",
          "Great museam with a lot of history and artifact as well as loads of interactive exhibits. Gets extremely busy on weekends.",

          "Very well organized especially with the new expansion.",
          "Definitely worth a visit for an education.",
          "Lots of history. Great pictures. Well worth the price",
          "If you feel tired of the hustle and bustle of the city, maybe sitting on the edge of the river will refresh your mind, just sit down and enjoy the breeze. If you have JR Pass, you can enjoy visiting landmark/tourist attraction of this city with red bus for free.",
          "Best exhibit I've ever seen.",
          "Set aside at least 3 hours. Seriously!\nYou may think you'll go through all the content in a swift hour or two but there's a lifetime worth of carefully curated Hiroshima-related artifacts along with countless stories of individuals affected \u2026",
          "100% must visit. Not a nice place, but interesting and important.",
          "Heart touching to know the i.pact humans create on the world and world peace",

          "A surreal place and a fitting memorial to the victims of a truly bad day in history.",
          "A must visit. Went on one of their late opening days. We paid 400 Yen extra for the audio guide. Well worth it, definitely recommended since its quite crowded and might not be able to get close enough to read every tag.",
          "A sobering journey reminding us of the human cost of war...   And, at the same time, a hopeful future for the world, if we can maintain \u262e\ufe0f.  Somewhere everyone should visit...",
          "A reminder of a dark history and a beautiful resolve.",
          "We were there on 2 Jan. It was quite crowded and the whole crowd moved like a conveyor so it was a bit mechanical. The exhibits were moving and showed the personal impacts of the victims.",
          "Interesting and full of history, definitely reccomend",
          "So much content for the 200 yen fee. Just an amazing tribute to the events of Hiroshima bombing and the accounts of many who experienced it first hand and the history altering realities it brought. Whatever you do go see this! (With tissues in hand)",
          "Too immersive experience. Literally everyone had tears in their eyes.",
          "A little hard to take, but he who fails to study history is doomed to repeat it.  as an American I understand the socio-political circumstances behind why we drop the bomb. However it is important to better understand the real human \u2026",
          "Memorable - a must as part of induction for any political leader.",
          "Confronting,insightful and well worth visiting if you wish to understand some history and the deceitful and cruelty on politicians and war people.",
          "The museum is a strong reminder of the horrors of nuclear weapons. The main exhibit focuses on the bombing of August 6th, 1945 and the effect on the people of Hiroshima. Which was horrible. Be aware that the exhibit can evoke strong \u2026",
          "Excellent way to immerse oneself in history and understand the Hiroshima experience.",
          "Currently this museum is undergoing renovations, so many of the exhibits have been reduced or clustered together. It makes it difficult to fully appreciate each item, but the impact is still there and I think it is important for every \u2026",
          "Very good but harrowing. There was a lot mentioned about the horrors of what happened but they finish with a message of hope. Go there first then visit the dome and the monument of where the bomb hit. It makes a nice antidote to visit the city after to remind yourself of how brilliant the Japenese were to rebuild afterwards.",
          "A place that must visit. Inside the museum showing lots of pictures and items about the world war II. I really no more war in this world Nd atomic bomb free.",
          "The right place for knowing how to respect life and to reject war",
          "Very well put together museum. Pictures and multimedia modalities are available. I really liked that all the information is also in English. There are audio guides available for rent. There are also free English language volunteers for \u2026",
          "It was a moving experience for me. Have some time on your hands since there is lots to read and internalize. But beyond a point, the reality actually becomes difficult to handle.",
          "What a powerful museum. The curators' skills are masterfully displayed in a solemn, sweeping, jarringly honest, and incredibly apolitical account of the terrifying cost of nuclear warfare.",
          "Man's remberance ofbhisnworst self.",
          "Must see. Not very busy during the colder months.",
          "Impressive. Shows how less human some humans are.",

          "Historical place! There is no entry fee for the park and only 200 yen entry fee for the museum.",
          "Absolutely worth visiting.  The main museum was closed for earthquake renovations at the time I visited, but the artifacts on display and survivor stories will change your perspective forever.  It's much like visiting Dachau, reading about it is nothing compared to seeing the place and results first hand.",
          "Hiroshima Peace Memorial was very sombering. Just the thought of countless lives that were senselessly lost, made me feel sad. The park is nice. I encourage every Americam who comes to Japan to visit Hirosima and Nagasaki.",
          "This is a must if you are in Hiroshima. The museum displays all the raw details of the Hiroshima bombings with displays of melted steel structures and burned in shadows on the walls. The museum shows the power of the atomic bomb as well as the devastating effects it has on the people and the generations afterwards.",
          "Very informative but extremely emotional. Not to be missed but be prepared to be upset",

          "Cant describe in words. Must visit place if you are in japan. Catch a bus from hiroshima station to get to this place quick n easy.",
          "It speaks for itself, and to the world. Should be compulsory visit for all aspiring politicians and military trainees.",
          "An amazing museum and very comparable to the museum of tolorence in LA. Be prepared for some graphic images and stories. I couldn't help but notice that many of the logistical facts and motaves of the US government expressed were skewed slightly.",
          "This museum shows the heart wrenching facts about nuclear weapons and its effects.  Everyone who comes to Hiroshima should visit this museum to see the terrible effects of nuclear weapons.  The visual pictures and stories has much more impact than just reading a book.  You can also sign a petition to help eliminate nuclear weapons.",
          "Immaculate, well designed, impactful. However it completely ignores the atrocities committed by the Japanese abroad which got the world to that point, and therefore presents only half the story when compared with similar places in Germany.",
          "Most impressive museum I have ever been to. All information about what happened with lots of details and explanation, all in English. Pictures, items, drawings, reconstructions, it's all there. Must visit",
          "One of the best historic places in Japan and one of the places where Japan acutally deals with it's earliest history. Definitely the place to go in Hiroshima. Since there is a wide use of media and short informative texts, it's easy to grasp the idea. Audio guides available.",
          "Interesting, makes you think.",
          "Hiroshima peace memorial or you can say it's a museum where you go and find out how much destruction was done \nAnd how they have survived and reached the number one position in this world\n\nPeace is the only remedy for avoiding the \u2026",
          "Amazing memorial, you can easily spend 2+ hours here so make sure you factor that in. Japanese school children are frequently at the memorial but be warned there's some extremely graphic content.\n\nIt's worth a day trip to Hiroshima for on its own, entry is 200jpy and getting a tram from Hiroshima station is very easy and costs 180jpy.",
          "People must visit here, and deeply think about peace!",
          "It's one of the most horrible experiences I've ever had in a museum, purely because of the effectiveness of the exhibit. The museum is filled with personal stories of the victims and show in gruesome details, the extent to which this \u2026",
          "Eye opening and really sad, but the amount of people standing blocking the path really sullied my experience. The price is very cheap and everyone should see the pain that people suffered because of the bomb.",
          "Amazing place. The museum is fantastic",
          "Very informative museum with exhibits showing all you need to know about the bombing.",
          "Amazing museum, dark stuff but well displayed.",

          "Good place , dont forget to enjoy okonomiyaki near this place",
          "The museum was high on my list of places to go but was so crowded I couldn't even read the exhibits. Rushed round and left after around 30mins. The number of people meant I couldn't give the place the attention and respect it deserves. I \u2026",
          "One of the better museums I\u2019ve been to. (I heard the nagasaki one is pretty good too.) This museum evokes so many feelings as you go through the different exhibits. Entry is 200yen and audio guide is 400yen per person. Start with the video \u2026",
          "Very moving..\nHow could anyone justify this action!\ud83d\ude22",
          "Really educational.  However some facts are misleading.",
          "Definitely a somber point in out tour through this glorious country. Very well done. Informative, interactive and very heartbreaking. A must see museum if in Hiroshima.",
          "Caution to prepare yourself to see some really emotional stories. Became pretty depressed, but it's something everyone needs to see!",
          "I highly recommend learning the history of this incident. Especially if you're with an educational group.",
          "A must visit place. The museum did a great job in delivering pure history without putting the blame on anyone or anything. There are some volunteers too that you can talk with, and you can spend hours by reading everything.",
          "Historic place.\nHiroshima, a modern city on Japan\u2019s Honshu Island, was largely destroyed by an atomic bomb during World War II. Today, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park commemorates the 1945 event. In the park are the ruins of Genbaku Dome, one of the few buildings that was left standing near ground zero.",
          "Undergoing works as of early 2019, so most exhibits were moved to the annex wing. The biggest, heaviest ones cannot be seen, however new interactive installation and expanded explanations are quite well done compared to 6 years ago. Take your time to browse all explanations, war documents, and pictures!",
          "Loved the exhibit talking about politics surrounding the war",
          "The exhibition was very good and covered a huge range of perspectives and stories.  I highly recommend preparing emotionally before coming here because it can be quite overwhelming.",
          "Very moving museum, very well put together.  It was crowded, but not a problem as the museum is laid out well.  Entry was only 200 JPY per person.  A lot of information about the history of Hiroshima, the effects of the bomb on the \u2026",
          "Museum is an overwhelming experience, however it does take the dropping of the bomb out of the WW2 context. Comparing with WW2 museums in Germany, where reasons for the war are very well explained, this museum is lacking such vital \u2026",
          "Interesting yet morbid museum about the history of the bombings for 200 yen. The museum's main building currently is undergoing renovations so they have moved a lot of the exhibits to a smaller building. \n\nExpect it to be crowded and difficult to enjoy many of the displays.",
          "Haunting reality of Atomic bombs... survivors memories paint a grim picture.",

          "Very powerfully made exhibition. Absolute must to see",
          "Very interesting place. Not good for sensitive people.",

          "A very sobering experience. If you visit Hiroshima, you must visit this museum.",
          "Informative, well organized, modern and very well maintained. It was very interesting visit. We watched documentary White Light, Black Rain before coming to museum, which only added to strong impression and feeling the impact of this \u2026",

          "We all learn the history is the first atomic bomb dropped in war, seeing the real place and experiencing the peace park is something else.  There is a wrist watch that stopped at the moment of detonation it was the most moving thing for me.  It's a must do in Japan as far as I'm concerned. Peace",
          "The museum is detailed and a lot to go through but it is necessary viewing.",
          "Everyone needs to experience this. All the exhibits were impactful and well presented. The personal accounts were truly touching.",

          "Great place to visit. Hiroshima is beautiful",
          "You don't really understand the horror and the danger of nuclear weapons until you've visited the Hiroshima peace memorial museum. During my visit i witnessed horrors beyond belief and thus the dangers of nuclear wars were put into perspective.",
          "Intense. If it was quiet I probably would have cried through the whole thing. Fortunately, a horde of hundreds of noisy children came through. Even that was not enough in some places.",
          "Beautiful memorial about the WW2 and the bombs. You have to go there if you\u2019re in Hiroshima. Obviously it\u2019s tough, sad but for memory you must visit the center and the park. After that, go to Miyajima, it\u2019s a paradisiac island, it will make you think about something else.",
          "A sobering experience, definitely recommend that everyone sees this.",
          "Powerful reminder of the cost of war",
          "Very moving and sad. 200Y per adult entry. Not a sound could be heard in the memorial while walking through. Very raw and graphic images pertraying the horror of that day.",
          "Wow, be prepared to be shocked and very sad. Everyone should visit this museum.",
          "Very nice place to visit, at least u have 4 hrs to visit this complete place, do watch the video of about 1 hr taken by one of the member of A bomb victim family.You will literally cry after seeing the effects of nuclear weapon.",
          "Must see if you know world histoey",
          "Got to be honest the Nagasaki museum was a lot better so if you got the opportunity to go there I definitely recommend. Then again it's only 200 yen",
          "Gut wrenching, grief strickening, shell shocking, entrancing. It's like being back to the scene of devastation the minute you enter the halls of the museum.  The pictures tell the suffering of victims from the attack to the life long \u2026",
          "Seizing moments of the world war II and the atomic bomber ravaged... A strong  message is delivered by the museum and only for 200 yen! If you want audioguide it's 400 yen more.",
          "Visit this place to know the atrocity committed on August 6, 1945.  It is a tasteful museum where respect is given to the victims.  I would highly recommend anyone in the area to walk the museum and the grounds.  One survivor in a video \u2026",
          "Emotional site to visit. Worth spending atleast 3 hours here reading about the history. Entry fee is quite affordable at 200 Yen per adult.",
          "Morbidly fascinating. Artwork by survivors is tells of pure horror",
          "An absolute must see for everyone. A treasure trove of information in great - sometimes painful - detail. The exhibits have been carefully put together and have a huge impact but are also done sensibly too. That said, it contains graphic \u2026",
          "A stark and chilling yet strangely beautiful memorial to the horrors of atomic warfare. A must visit.",
          "Extremely well done, modern exhibit. The history is explained well, and the artifacts are truly \"one of a kind\" (thankfully). Be prepared to shed a few years, especially if you read through some of the materials on the computers, which you should definitely do by the way.",
          "Very informative with excellent exhibits, unfortunate it was made child friendly and the horror display of the mother and child was removed.",
          "My understanding is that this was the real ground zero, not the dome. The entrance is just about the facts surrounding the bombing. It does not prepare you for the very emotional second part of the museum where you will be faced with the human reality of a nuclear attack. I cried.",
          "My dream of coming here came through. A month ago I visited the place where WW 2 started - Westerplatte in Poland. Here symbolically WW 2 ended in an absolutely barbaric, horrible, primitive style. How could humanity did something like this?",
          "Truly an experience that is a complement to your visit to Hiroshima. \n\nUnderstanding is one of the greatest benefits post war.",
          "Bring your tissues. Very detailed account of all the effect the bomb had on Hiroshima and the people that lived there.",
          "Really not well regulated. There were a TON of people here today and in the first half of the museum there was no room to stand. It would greatly benefit from a timed entry system like the Holocaust museum in DC. There were some artifacts but mostly pictures and printed info. It was just okay. Really heavy topic.",
          "Touching, deep, and a sad reminder of the acts mankind has committed in the past in the pursuit of progress and victory.",
          "So moving,  such a sad memorial.  We need to take heed and remove all atomic weapons from the entire world",
          "It was a very nice museum. We had fun reading about it.",
          "A very nice memorial park reminding us about the devastating result of the A-bomb",
          "Do not miss this. Give yourself at least 3 hours if not longer. The main building was closed when we visited but we were still amazed by all the artefacts and information provided. A moving experience. Afterwards take a stroll through the \u2026",
          "Very good place to remember this tragedy.",
          "When you buy the tickets you can get a postcard which is made out of the paper cranes that were left in the Peace Memorial Park. The main building was closed for renovations when we visited but it was not an issue. Before visiting I was \u2026",
          "Very sad!!!!!! But worth to go there just to never forget how cruel the human being can be.\nAnd to admire the marvelous power of the japanese people to rise from their own ash.",
          "A deeply moving place to visit.",
          "The main exhibit is under construction currently but don\u2019t let that defer you from going into the museum.  They still have an extensive amount of information and displays currently showing that is completely eye opening and sad.  Reading \u2026",
          "Very nice and very underrated place.",
          "The museum has been designed and displayed very well, very informative while giving the subject the emotional impact it should. Information displays are in English and Japanese and have been translated very well. We took a full day to look around the museum, park peace park and dome, great experience but an emotional one as well.",
          "It was a bit cramped due to the rennovations doubled with sakura season but it was still well worth the visit. There is a lot of reading but it's engaging. I was interested to learn more from start to finish. It truly was a devastating \u2026",
          "The museum is excellent at depicting how inhuman of an incident this was and how it should never be repeated. The exhibition is filled with heartbreaking stories of children who met tragic ends, families who were ruined and items to show how the bomb affected the area.",
          "Broke my heart seeing the children victim from the bombing.",
          "The Memorial is a testament to the destruction caused by the bombing of Hiroshima.   It is very emotional.",
          "It\u2019s the store from the other side \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe",
          "You need to go here if you are in Japan. It truly shows the horror of nuclear weapons and why they should not be used.",
          "An absolute must see sight. A place of rememberance. Educational and thought provoking but not a pleasent experience. NOT a selfie-place",
          "Words are not very relevant. You should go and see for yourself and make sure you do whatever is in your power to stop the world repeating such inhumane act. Praised be Japan for its strenght to forgive (but never forget)!",
          "A great place to reflect on what humans are capable of",
          "Good Musium, but very very busy.",
          "Very moving and well done. I highly recommend.",
          "Great museum that features with the sorrow of people who died and survived Hiroshima Atomic bomb",

          "Nice place,when you go to Hiroshima, visit here to understand history of world war 2",
          "Atmosphere is so silent and respectfull.",
          "Worth to visit and feel the pain :(",
          "I went there on August 6 when the annual memorial ceremony was held. Of course, it had far more visitors as usual on that day but nevertheless it was an unforgettable event.\n\nHaving grown up in Europe in the 80ies I am a cold war child so I \u2026",
          "Stark reminder of what man can do to man. Lest we forget. Yet we see as.many wars as before. Agent Orange did as much damage to mankind as the A Bomb.",
          "Was good to come n pay respect to the many casualties of war",
          "Scary, but everyone should visit",
          "A must see to remember the tragedy and pure destructive force of a nuclear weapon.",
          "Very well designed and laid out museum. Informative without being information overloading. An absolute must visit in Hiroshima. Allow a couple if hours to see the main parts of the museum, but you could spend longer here if you wanted to.",
          "OMG, and we nearly missed that place. Such an amazing experience to visit this memorial museum and feel what the worst and the best of humanity can do. Was humbled and moved beyond words. A must visit. A place to remember history and learn \u2026",
          "Nostalgic. Wish there are no more bombs used anywhere",
          "Very impactful experience that definitely leaves a mark. The video testimonials, the residents memorabilia and photos of the victims brings chills down your spine. I found the viewpoints balanced and with a focus on the effort for \u2026",

          "This obviously is a must to see when you get to Hiroshima. Entry fee is really low; 200 yen.\n\nTake your time listening to all the experiences that people had experiencing the bombing. There is a video section that loops all the interviews. \u2026",
          "Walkable from the tram station, and extremely good museum. The entry price is very cheap, and there are plenty of English translation for each of the exhibits descriptions. There is nearby peace park and you can also walk all the way to the A-bomb dome and the hypocenter. Expect to spend about 2-4 hours here depending on your interest.",
          "Only 200 \u00a5 entrance (with audio guide another 400) and very educational.",
          "Now main building is under construction and will open Spring 2019. Current place of museum is limited space but contents is enough that give us strong memory and impression. What will you feel, probably depend on your nationality but I expect all of us  have same eye that peace is most important in our life.",
          "Really impressive and shocking",
          "The museum is a must-go if you're in the area. They signage and videos all have English explanations. It's a good place to learn about the atomic bombing during WWII and witness first hand accounts of the incident through stories, pictures, \u2026",
          "Could really feel the sense of peace many years after a tragedy.",
          "Few places in the world move you to tears, and this is unfortunately one of them. We all know the history of Hiroshima, but to be in this place personally can not be taught. When looking at half-melted objects, real black rain stains and \u2026",
          "Moving and educational, but mainly moving.",
          "This museum is standing to spread up the message of peace in the world. I highly recommend everyone in Japan to visit Hirosima and specially this museum and get inspired for World Peace. The museum tells the story of the past Hirosima and \u2026",
          "Mistakes, consequences and (probably) the omens for the immediate future. Amazing place, a must see",
          "Come here you will know how terrible the war is. Looking for peace is the obvious thing in the world. Hopefully, people pay much attention to the disaster come from the atomic bomb and war. Keeping peace in mind to make life and world better.",
          "The main building is currently under construction (March 21, 2019)  so they've moved stuff around a bit. There may be some missing items, but I'm not sure as it is a very powerful and moving exhibit well worth a visit",
          "it was such an amazing experience, would 100% recommend anyone in the area to visit.",
          "Wel presented and very detailed information about this sad part of history",
          "Lots of information on Hiroshima before and after the atomic bombing. The interactive screens contain much more info than the audio guide (which is actually redundant if you are willing to read a bit), also with references to informative original documentation.",
          "So full of information of what happened",
          "A must visit place to see and remind ourselves on the atrocity of war.",
          "it is very moving. definitely worth the trip to hiroshima. Dont know if I would take kids...",
          "A must visit museum. Very informative, interesting and disturbing. However, sometimes it seems like everything is very technical. Its a bit hard to explain but it felt like something was missing. \nAgain, as sad as this topic is, it's important to visit and learn this part of history.",
          "What to say more! If you like military, firepower and bombs then you should visit this place to see the disasters made by them in ww2 and change your mind. 140000 ppl died in this place by an american atomic bomb. Its a shame for the entire world and its human civilization. Hiroshima bearing all the signs.",
          "The first part of the museum are about the victims, and this is probably the most interesting part. But the emphasis is heavily put on children, which gave me the impression to miss so many other victims.\n\nThe next part is really a one side \u2026",
          "Definitely worth the visit! This museum bears a lot of historical significance and displays memento/small items which tell the story of love and lost lives from the atomic bombing. Pictures and stories are not easy to see and can be depressing but it is a necessary tribute and reminder of the events that took place in Hiroshima.",
          "Very informative yet sad sectios",
          "So sad but it should be visited to understand Japanese history in The world war II",
          "A moving experience. The exhibits are well-thought out and contribute to your understanding of what happened. Go early in the morning before it gets too crowded. Should be a required visit for everyone.",
          "When you are in Hiroshima must to go to this place. $2 cad to get in. Do have locker to lock your stuff. Once you finish will give you back locker money. Lot of video about tomic bomb survive people and material for you to see. Take around 2 hours to wall around.",
          "I have always wanted to see this memorial. It has changed my perspective entirely. Met alot of school kids here who were interested in learning about where we were from and our family and in exchange gave us paper cranes as thanks. My new favorite place\u2764\u2764\u2764",
          "The memorial museum gives an incredible insight into what it was like for the people of hiroshima the moment their world was destroyed, which I saw move many people including myself to tears. Some people critizise that there is not more \u2026",
          "Take the free guide tour from 10:30 in the morning (they speak great English!) the complete thing takes around 3 hours and they tell you about all the history before, during and after the boming. Loved the look for a brighter future throughout the whole museum.",
          "It's smaller than the one in Nagasaki. Well managed exhibits about the terror of nuclear weappon. The musuem needs some parking space.",
          "Informative, but not anything special. Most of the museum consists of texts and pictures that you can Google at home. The interviews were very interesting and gave a clear picture of this tragic event. Drawings were also interesting, \u2026",
          "This museum is located in the Memorial Park and near to the bus terminal, which makes it extremely convenient. There are stories and belongings of those who where involved in the bombing.",
          "A very sombre but educational memorial, and a must-visit for anyone who comes to Hiroshima. Really conveys the impact of the atomic bomb at the individual level, and reinforces the need for a push to live in a world without nuclear weapons.",
          "Great place reconstructed after demolished by atom bomb",
          "Amazing experience which gives a much deeper understanding of what happened",
          "This is an important museum to visit. It it's easy to go through and learn about the atomic bombing in Japan as well as the development of the bomb and the aftermath. The library with recorded accounts of the survivors is very powerful (most are translated to English).",
          "Such a moving experience. I don't think I will ever forget this. Brought me to tears.",
          "It shows The Inhumanity of Nuclear Weapons.",
          "Very informative, with many photos, videos, infographics, and testimonials.  The one star deduction is for the overwhelming crowd that made it difficult to get to the front to see the videos and read the paragraphs of information.  The crowd paired with the limited space and seating made for a cramped, standing-room-only experience.",
          "An absolute must go if you're in Hiroshima. The museum is very detailed (and in English also). It's a great way to learn about the history of the Atomic Bomb and how the city moved forward from it."

        "wiki": "Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park (\u5e83\u5cf6\u5e73\u548c\u8a18\u5ff5\u516c\u5712, Hiroshima Heiwa Kinen K\u014den) is a memorial park in the center of Hiroshima, Japan. It is dedicated to the legacy of Hiroshima as the first city in the world to suffer a nuclear attack, and to the memories of the bomb's direct and indirect victims (of whom there may have been as many as 140,000). The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park is visited by more than one million people each year. The park is there in memory of the victims of the nuclear attack on August 6, 1945. On August 6, 1945 the US dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima Japan. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was planned and designed by the Japanese Architect Kenz\u014d Tange at Tange Lab.\nThe location of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was once the city\u2019s busiest downtown commercial and residential district. The park was built on an open field that was created by the explosion. Today there are a number of memorials and monuments, museums, and lecture halls, which draw over a million visitors annually. The annual 6 August Peace Memorial Ceremony, which is sponsored by the city of Hiroshima, is also held in the park. The purpose of the Peace Memorial Park is to not only memorialize the victims, but also to establish the memory of nuclear horrors and advocate world peace.\n\n\n== Notable symbols ==\n\n\n=== A-Bomb Dome ===\n\nThe A-Bomb Dome is the skeletal ruins of the former Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall. It is the building closest to the hypocenter of the nuclear bomb that remained at least partially standing. It was left how it was after the bombing in memory of the casualties. The A-Bomb Dome, to which a sense of sacredness and transcendence has been attributed, is situated in a distant ceremonial view that is visible from the Peace Memorial Park\u2019s central cenotaph. It is an officially designated site of memory for the nation\u2019s and humanity\u2019s collectively shared heritage of catastrophe. The A-Bomb Dome was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List on December 7, 1996. Many A-Bomb survivors and Hiroshima citizens were pushing for the A-Bomb Dome to be registered as a World Heritage Site as it was \"a symbol of horror and nuclear weapons and humankind's pledge for peace.\"\n This collective petition from many citizens groups was finally given influence when the Japanese government officially recommended the dome to the World Heritage Site committee in December 1995. A marker was placed on the A-Bomb Dome on April 25, 1997 by Hiroshima City. It reads:\n\nAs a historical witness that conveys the tragedy of suffering the first atomic bomb in human history and as a symbol that vows to faithfully seek the abolition of nuclear weapons and everlasting world peace, Genbaku Dome was added to the World Heritage List in accordance with the \"Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage (World Heritage Convention).\"\nDecember 7, 1996, Hiroshima City\n\n\n=== Children's Peace Monument ===\n\nThe Children's Peace Monument is a statue dedicated to the memory of the children who died as a result of the bombing. The statue is of a girl with outstretched arms with a folded paper crane rising above her. The statue is based on the true story of Sadako Sasaki (\u4f50\u3005\u6728\u798e\u5b50, Sasaki Sadako), a young girl who died from radiation from the bomb. She is known for folding over 1,000 paper cranes in response to a Japanese legend. To this day, people (mostly children) from around the world fold cranes and send them to Hiroshima where they are placed near the statue. The statue has a continuously replenished collection of folded cranes nearby.\n\n\n=== Rest House ===\nThe Rest House of Hiroshima Peace Park is another atomic bombed building in the park. The building was built as the Taishoya Kimono Shop in March 1929. It was used as a fuel distribution station when the shortage of fuel began in June 1944. On August 6, 1945, when the bomb exploded, the roof was crushed, the interior destroyed, and everything consumable burned except in the basement. Eventually, 36 people in the building died of the bombing; 47-year-old Eizo Nomura survived in the basement, which had a concrete roof through which radiation had a more difficult time penetrating. He survived into his 80s.The former Nakajima District, which today is Peace Memorial Park, was a prominent business quarter of the city during the early years of the Showa period (1926\u201389) and had been the site of many wooden two-story structures. However, in 1929, the three-story Taishoya Kimono Shop was constructed, surrounded by shops and movie theaters. It was said that if you went up to the roof, a panoramic view of the city awaited. In 1943 the Kimono Shop was closed and in June 1944, as World War II intensified and economic controls became increasingly stringent, the building was purchased by the Prefectural Fuel Rationing Union\nAt 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, the explosion of the atomic bomb about 600 meters above the hypocenter destroyed the building\u2019s concrete roof. The interior was also badly damaged and gutted by ensuing fires, and everyone inside was killed except Nomura, who miraculously survived. The building was restored soon after the war and used as the Fuel Hall. In 1957, the Hiroshima East Reconstruction Office, which became the core of the city\u2019s reconstruction program, was established there.\n\nAt the time of the bombing, 37 people were working there. All of them perished, with the exception of Eizo Nomura, who had gone down to the basement at that moment and survived the bombing. Nomura, who was then 47,  was a worker for the Hiroshima Prefectural Fuel Rationing Union. Nomura managed to escape through rising fire and vigorous smoke. However, after his survival, he struggled with high fever, diarrhea, bleeding gums, and other symptoms caused by the radiation.Although the building was heavily damaged, it stood still and was renovated soon after the war, including a new wooden roof. After the war, the Hiroshima municipal government purchased the building and established a postwar recovery office in it. Today it is used as the Rest House in Peace Memorial Park.\nThe Rest House has been in debates many times over whether or not it should be preserved. In 1995, the city decided to demolish the building, but the plan was put aside. One of the reasons was because of the announcement of the A-Bomb Dome as a World Heritage site.Right now, the first floor of the Rest House is used as a tourist information office and a souvenir shop, the second/third floors as offices, and the basement is preserved nearly as it was at the time of the bombing.\n\n\n== Ceremonies ==\n\n\n=== Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony ===\n\nEvery year on 6 August, \"A-Bomb Day,\" the City of Hiroshima holds the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony to console the victims of the atomic bombs and to pray for the realization of lasting world peace. The ceremony is held in the morning from 8:00, in front of the Memorial Cenotaph with many citizens including the families of the deceased. During the ceremony, a one-minute silence to honor the victims is observed at 8:15, the time of the atomic bomb's explosion.\n\n\n=== Lantern Ceremony ===\n\nIn the evening of the same day, Lantern ceremony is held to send off the spirits of the victims on lanterns with peace messages floating on the waters of the Motoyasu River.\n\n\n== Museums ==\n\n\n=== Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum ===\n\nThe Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum is the primary museum in the park dedicated to educating visitors about the bomb.\nThe Museum has exhibits and information covering the buildup to war, the role of Hiroshima in the war up to the bombing, and extensive information on the bombing and its effects, along with substantial memorabilia and pictures from the bombing.\nThe building also has views of the Memorial Cenotaph, Peace Flame, and A-Bomb Dome.\n\n\n=== International Conference Center Hiroshima ===\nInternational Conference Center Hiroshima is in the Peace Park, west side of the main building of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.\n\n\n=== Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall ===\n\nThe Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims is an effort by the Japanese national government to remember and mourn the sacred sacrifice of the atomic bomb victims. It is also an expression of Japan's desire for genuine and lasting peace. The Hall contains a number of displays. On the roof, near the entrance (the museum is underground) is a clock frozen at 8:15, the time the bomb went off. The museum contains a seminar room, library, temporary exhibition area, and victims' information area. The Hall of Remembrance, contains a 360 degree panorama of the destroyed Hiroshima recreated using 140,000 tiles \u2014 the number of people estimated to have died from the bomb by the end of 1945.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\n\n\n=== Memorial Cenotaph ===\nNear the center of the park is a concrete, saddle-shaped monument that covers a cenotaph holding the names of all of the people killed by the bomb. The monument is aligned to frame the Peace Flame and the A-Bomb Dome.\nThe Memorial Cenotaph was one of the first memorial monuments built on open field on August 6, 1952. \nThe arch shape represents a shelter for the souls of the victims.The cenotaph carries the epitaph \u5b89\u3089\u304b\u306b\u7720\u3063\u3066\u4e0b\u3055\u3044 \u904e\u3061\u306f \u7e70\u8fd4\u3057\u307e\u305b\u306c\u304b\u3089, which means \"please rest in peace, for [we/they] shall not repeat the error.\" In Japanese, the sentence's subject is omitted, thus it could be interpreted as either \"[we] shall not repeat the error\" or as \"[they] shall not repeat the error\". This was intended to memorialize the victims of Hiroshima without politicizing the issue, taking advantage of the fact that polite Japanese speech typically demands lexical ambiguity in the first place. The epitaph was written by Tadayoshi Saika, Professor of English Literature at Hiroshima University. He also provided the English translation, \"Let all the souls here rest in peace for we shall not repeat the evil.\" On November 3, 1983, an explanation plaque in English was added in order to convey Professor Saika's intent that \"we\" refers to \"all humanity\", not specifically the Japanese or Americans, and that the \"error\" is the \"evil of war\":\n\nThe inscription on the front panel offers a prayer for the peaceful repose of the victims and a pledge on behalf of all humanity never to repeat the evil of war. It expresses the spirit of Hiroshima \u2014 enduring grief, transcending hatred, pursuing harmony and prosperity for all, and yearning for genuine, lasting world peace.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the ambiguity of the phrase has the potential to offend; some right-wing circles in Japan have interpreted the words as an admission of guilt\u2014implicitly reading it as \"we (the Japanese people) shall not repeat the error\"\u2014and they criticize the epitaph as a self-accusation by the Japanese empire. In July 2005, the cenotaph was vandalized by a Japanese man affiliated with the Japanese right.\n\n\n=== Peace Flame ===\nThe Peace Flame is another monument to the victims of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, but it has an additional symbolic purpose.\nThe flame has burned continuously since it was lit in 1964, and will remain lit until all nuclear bombs on the planet are destroyed and the planet is free from the threat of nuclear annihilation.\n\n\n=== Peace Bells ===\nThere are three Peace Bells in the Peace Park. The smaller one is used only for the Peace Memorial Ceremony. Except that day, it is displayed in the east building of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. The more well-known Peace Bell stands near the Children's Peace Monument and consists of a large Japanese bell hanging inside a small open-sided structure. Visitors are encouraged to ring the bell for world peace and the loud and melodious tolling of this bell rings out regularly throughout the Peace Park. The Peace Bell was built out in the open on September 20, 1964. The surface of the bell is a map of the world, and the \"sweet spot\" is an atomic symbol, designed by Masahiko Katori [1899\u20131988], cast by Oigo Bell Works, in Takaoka, Toyama. The inscriptions on the bell are in Greek (\u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd), Japanese, and Sanskrit. It is translated as \"Know yourself.\" The Greek embassy donated the bell to the Peace Park and picked out the most appropriate ancient Greek philosophical quote of Socrates. The Sanskrit text is a quotation from Longer Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra which was attested by the Indian ambassador.  The Japanese text was provided by a university lecturer.\n\n\n=== Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound ===\nThe Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound is a large, grass-covered knoll that contains the cremated ashes of 70,000 unidentified victims of the bomb.\n\n\n=== Cenotaph for Korean Victims ===\nAmong the 400,000 people who were killed or exposed to lethal post-explosion radiation, at least 45,000 were Korean, but the number is uncertain, because the population has been neglected as the minority. Additionally, 300,000 survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki returned to Korea after liberation from Japanese colonialism. The monument, decorated with Korean national symbols, is intended to honour Korean victims and survivors of the atomic bomb and Japanese colonialism. The monument's inscription reads \"The Monument in Memory of the Korean Victims of the A[tomic]-Bomb. In memory of the souls of His Highness Prince Yi Wu and over 20000 other souls\", while the side-inscription reads \"Souls of the dead ride to heaven on the backs of turtles.\"\n\n\n=== Gates of Peace ===\nAdded in 2005, this monument contains ten gates covered with the word \"peace\" in 49 languages from around the world. The gates represent the nine circles of Hell plus one: \"the living hell of Hiroshima caused by the atomic bombing.\" Each gate is 9 meters high and 2.6 meters wide.\n\n\n=== Memorial Tower to the Mobilized Students ===\nThe Association for the Mobilized Student Victims of Hiroshima Prefecture built this tower in May 1967 in order to console the souls of over 10,000 students, including those who were Atomic Bomb victims, who died in bombings during the Pacific War. In Hiroshima, there were 8,387 students who were mobilized; 6,907 of which were killed in the Atomic Bombing. The memorial is twelve meters tall, five stories, and is decorated with the Goddess of Peace as well as eight doves which are placed around the tower.

          "Very moving place. We saw the Dome, Children's Memorial, Teenagers memorial, the Flame of Peace and Peace Bell.",
          "The Peace Memorial park is an area where you can walk and remember the horrors of the war by seeing several points: Genbaku Dome, Eternal Flame of Peace, Peace Flame or the Children's Peace Monument. Memories come and it's a good moment to think about what we have done (and",
          "While the peace memorial park might not be among the most beautiful parks we got to enjoy in Japan, was it one if not the most significant one in meaning. Together with the museum and the A-bomb dome, does the park conclude the complex erected to commemorate the human tragedy",
          "Start from the \"preserved\" ruin and walk towards the war museum via the eternal flame (if man don't destroy nuclear bombs) till the museum. A pensive tour.",
          "Visited in June 2016. Enjoyed walking around the area and seeing the peace memorials. Hydrangea flowers were in bloom and there were lots of visitors. Went with my husband and brother.",
          "This is a beautiful park with a very sad history, where they have managed to create a place with a positive message, i.e. no more nuclear war, from one of the darkest events in modern history. The memorial to Sadako, the girl who made 1000 paper cranes believing her wish to",
          "This even really shaped Japan. It is important as a tourist to learn about the things that have made Japan what it is today.",
          "Peace and solemnity around this sacred ground, filled with historical memories of WWII, resting place, and strongest hope for it not be repeated. From the Dome to the museums and monuments, well preserved for generations to learn and pass along life\u2019s virtues and resiliency\u2014that",
          "Well designed beautiful park. One can spend at least an hour or two reflecting as one strolls around the park. A piece of history to be remembered and reflected upon.",
          "We visited this practice memorial park in feb 20, quite astonished to hear the story from the japanese point of view. Later on, we get to hear a war survivor to share her experience , felt so sad for the Japanese during that time.",
          "the park contains the children's peace monument, the cenotaph and the museum, which we viewed and visited. there is also a hall and a mound. the park helps one process the feelings that arise from what is exhibited. a lovely sunny autumn day. many groups of school children",
          "There are things to see here but the things to think about are more important. It would be great if there was an outreach from here to every city on Earth, installations to mirror what Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park represents.",
          "You can't help but feel sad and sombre when visiting the peace park. Nice area to take a walk and reflect. Peaceful.",
          "One of the most difficult events to witness. Vital information for all those who wish for peace- one could not leave here without a sense of purpose to prevent this horror from ever happening again.",
          "This is a beautiful park to walk around. You feel the sadness and hearing and reading the stories you couldn\u2019t help but have that lump in your throat and tears down your face. The Peace Flame stays lit till all nuclear bombs are destroyed. The Peace Bell to ring loud to remind",
          "Hiroshima was not a priority for my visit to Japan and visiting the Peace Park even less so. But we did go to Hiroshima and also the Peace Park and I am glad we did. Great that it isn't commercialised and the various memorials scattered around the park including monuments, ponds",
          "It is a strategy that the authorities perfectly develop the place where used to be the suffering of mankind into a peaceful park with various symbols :- Peace Bell, Children's Peace Monument : Sadako Sasaki & folded paper cranes, Peace Flame, Pond of Peace which makes everyone",
          "Beautiful park with an amazing history. Many amenities and fantastic views, great for a walk and to learn about the city.",

          "This whole area to include the A-bomb dome and museum is incredibly sad yet very well done. The park is decent sized and has several memorials throughout and many signs with tragic descriptions. You can easily spend an hour here viewing the memorials and reading, I then",
          "We went to the Peace Park as part of a tour. We first visited the crossroads where the bomb was planned to be dropped. Then we visited the ruins and the water memorial. Other notable memorials are to mobilised students ( children who had to work for the war effort) who were",
          "Whole family went for a walk at this historic site to remember what happened more than 70 years ago. The walk take almost 2 hours to finish the road with time taking photos.",
          "Walking around here, it's very nice and peaceful. In between the museum and atomic bomb dome. Both worth a visit.",
          "This is a very special place and the way the memorial park has been designed is brilliant and encourages people to stop and reflect on this special place. Spend a full half day and walk from one end to the other looking at all the shrines, memorials, water features and gardens.",
          "Part of the complex in the pond you can see the dome down the road and the epitaph is beautiful. It was a very beautiful experience albeit sad...",
          "This park highlights the overall focus of the city that a devastating was like this should never happen again. Seeing the school children assembled and somberly singing at the shrine makes you realize the profound and lasting effect the event had on the city and nation.",
          "Worth visiting when you are in Hiroshima.. U can buy food n drinks on the way and then sit at the available seats..saw at least 2 toilets",

          "Good to see for everyone but... Interesting is the common lack of memory in Hiroshima. There is no mention of the war. The bomb is remembered but it just happened and nobody seems to know why. Out of the blue sky without reason? You feel a bit like in Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s The",
          "I visited in September 2018 but there is not the option to put that date. The Peace Memorial Park is a wonderfully moving and evocative place to visit. Unfortunately I was in Hiroshima for long and did not have time to get an official guide. However, it is possible to just",
          "Given that it is built on one of the biggest events in 20th century history, it\u2019s obvious to say this place is a \u201cmust visit\u201d especially if you\u2019re in Hiroshima. As someone who has read a lot on WWII and bombings, I expected this experience to be cathartic and making me cry like",

          "A beautiful way to reflect on human frailty. We wandered the park including visiting the famous A-bomb dome. It\u2019s a very moving experience though was disappointing to see both locals and tourists taking smiling selfies - don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s appropriate at such a sad site. We",
          "If visiting Japan a visit to the peace park has to be one of the most moving experiences ever. Absolutely incredible",
          "The Peace Park complex is a tranquil place, despite its horrific history. Apart from one guide with some faded photos, you are not assaulted by the horror but rather left to imagine for yourself the events of the day of the bombing and this is supported by the museum, which we",
          "This is a special open space with various memorials dotted around. The view to the domed house is very thought provoking. The park leads to the museum which is badly organised but mentally devastating.",
          "Take your time and walk the Peace Park area. There is alot to take in, in this area. We spent over half a day waling around and viewing the monuments and Museums",
          "This simple, beautifully kept park is made up of various walkways and gardens dotted throughout with memorials, and with the cenotaph and flame of peace at its centre. Moving in its honest and heartfelt commemoration of those lost and with a clear sense of the desire for peace",
          "You know abt Hiroshima but going to the museum and memorial park you have a much better and deeper understanding of it all. A great educational journey. The museum was really worthwhile and i came out with a much better understanding of the event.",
          "Great place to visit to understand more about the devastation of Hiroshima during the WW2. The exhibitions are very informative.",
          "One can not visit the Peace Park without feeling humbled. The world may be a better place if everyone could experience this marvelous place. You can not visit without feeling a range of emotions.",
          "Just go and remember why you should be angry when politicians talk about the need for nuclear weapons.",
          "This a large park in the heart of Hiroshoma and serves as a symbol of peace for the world. It is at the epicenter of the A -bomb explosion. The park houses the peace memorial museum, the A-bomb dome, a cenotaph for the victims and a children's peace monument.",
          "The park is very impressive. You feel the dignity to Hiroshima bombing in a very respectful way. The quiet atmosphere there is very moving",
          "The museum here is fantastic. The pictures are startling and moving. We can only hope and prey that nothing like this ever happens again.",
          "NO GUIDE NECESSARY. My husband and I self guided and were very glad we did. We had a great quiet day contemplating this site and Peach Park. 6th August 1945 the world changed. Amazing place to visit.",
          "This unique place is perfect to remember and understand more clearly what cruelty has happened due to mankind. This is a must do for all visitors. Keep these memories in mind for that it won\u2019t ever happen again.",
          "This is a classically moving world war atrocity site (like European concentration camps, Gallipoli, Pearl Harbor etc etc). Take plenty of time to take in the grounds free of charge reading signs that are in Japanese and English. Memorials variously remember the children, those",
          "Anyone visiting Japan, like us from half a world away, must include Hiroshima. This park is a delight. The pond/lake, eternal flame and memorial line up with the Atomic bomb dome providing a world class destination",
          "Located in Hiroshima city. The park includes the museum. Definitely wo rth a visit. It u hold a JR Rail Pass, get the JR hop on /off bus whick will takd u there and costs nothing with the pass. The museum costs 100y for entryabd is very good",
          "Very thoughtfully sculpted memorials and well designed park. I felt a little rushed as the sun was setting and there was a large tour group often getting into any photos. Very thought proving.",
          "The memorial park is definitely worth a visit and has the Museum in it that is a must see when in Hiroshima, as well as the A-bomb dome across the river in close vicinity. I would suggest going early if possible especially if you want to get any clear photos of the cenotaph the",
          "Within the Peace Promanadem and surrounding the peace memorial museum and wonderful Peace Hall is the park. The park is an open area where you can stroll through and contemplate the horror of the bomb as you make your way to the dome. The park has many places to stop and just",
          "We were the only Americans visiting the park the day we were there. It was very well done. Enjoyed the walk through and all the statues and explanations. Every American needs to visit there just to be reminded of how far we have come. We saw several school groups there so",
          "It\u2019s a pleasant walk round several iconic memories of a world tragedy. They\u2019ve made a good job of preserving the dome as it ended up after the bomb dropped and if you make a visit to the museum, which is only a 5 minute walk you can get lots of context as to how the area looked",
          "This park is a must for all in Hiroshima to understand the issues of war. It is easy to walk around with a number of monuments to visit",
          "Standing looking through the arch does give you a feeling of calm and hope even if it tinged with a good dose of sadness. A place for reflection. A must visit site.",
          "The Park right next to the Atomic Dome is a very poignant place. The center of the park contains the Cenotaph and peace flame. A visit here is both emotional and powerful.",
          "I'm including Children's Peace Memorial, the A-bomb Dome, and the cenotaph as part of this review. Moving and haunting. Hiroshima has rebuilt this area with dignity, respect, and beauty.",
          "You can't come to Hiroshima and not visit the Peace Park. The Peace Park is a place to reflect and think of the horror that occured and also to realise the hope it ignates to humanity of a world free from nuclear warfare.",
          "The Hiroshima Peace park, is both very emotional and confronting, but yet content and peaceful to visit. The horrible history that is contained within the park, us very sad, but the rest of the area is very compassionate, it is worth visiting.",
          "This beautiful and peaceful park... which includes the ruins of the Exhibition Hall... now known at the A-Bomb Dome... is a fitting reminder of the devastation that was wrought here in the successful bid to end WW2 in this part of thew world. Hiroshima is now an open-feeling,",
          "I'd recommend visiting the museum first before walking around the park so you would have time to reflect and recover from the sad pictures you just saw.",
          "This place is a must visit location for anyone visiting Japan. The park has numerous memorials to those killed as a result of the 1945 nuclear bomb. It\u2019s a very somber reminder of the awful results of war. Highly recommended",
          "I believe a visit to Hiroshima Peace Park should be included in any visit to Japan. In a time when we must deal with the proliferation of nuclear weapons, to visit the place where the first such weapon was used gives great dimension to the issue. In spite of what we think we",
          "After visiting the museum, everyone visiting this City should take the time to walk through the Memorial Park to further reflect on this tragic day in Japan's history.",
          "I read about the story in our English classes with my students and been curious about it. I was given a chance to visit Hiroshima, finally I got to see it!",
          "We were both extremely moved by our visit here, a hareowing reminder but so important and the respect that continues to be paid is admirable",
          "It\u2019s well made and organised. The tour takes around 60-90 minutes and you have a lot to see. Very sad story and a must see location in Hiroshima.",
          "We all need to be reminded of this horrid event. Even though it is SO sad and very moving, it is worth going to Hiroshima just to see this memorial park.",
          "This park is beautiful, full of symbols, full of thought and pays respect to all the people of Hiroshima which died at the bombing and of the consequences.",
          "I'm lucky to have had nearly 70 years of peace. You can't come here without reflecting on the madness of war and the insanity of those on both sides who allowed the deaths of thousands of innocent Japanese to happen. This must never happen again. Th park and monuments understate",
          "I felt compelled to take a day trip from Kyoto down to Hiroshima with my family to visit and reflect on the horrors of nuclear weapons. We took an early morning bullet train from Kyoto and arrived in Hiroshima at 10am and went straight to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, Peace",
          "I pledge to do everything in my power to make sure this never happens again. If you have a heart, this will rip it out. Make sure to go to the museum and the victim's memorial. Some of the \"side\" spots, like the Korean victims memorial are worth a few steps off the path to",
          "We traveled by train to Hiroshima. On arrival there were many staff around helping tourists. The staff at the information office provided maps and additional information to make our visit run smoothly. As we had a JR rail pass we could travel for free on the hop on hop off bus.",
          "This was far more contemplative than I thought it would be. The school tours seem to be never ending but they are well behaved and can be avoided by changing direction or sitting for a few minutes. It is well laid out and is within a short walk of the atomic bomb dome which",
          "Ride the bus and get down here so you can walk tothe museum.hopefully one day the pace flame can benput off when the whole world be in peace",
          "A very beautiful spot in Hiroshima that has great historical significance of course. The park is very well kept and quiet and certainly a place for reflection of those past events. You cannot comprehend how this area once looked before and after and then now. Certainly worth",
          "Simply one of those places that one should visit. So calm & peaceful (like the whole city) that it is hard to imagine the horror it commemorates. Combine with a visit to the museum.",
          "All part of the war memorials. Look through the arch to see the liberty bell. Beautiful promenade to walk along.",
          "No trip to Japan would be complete without a visit to the Peace Park and Museum in Hiroshima. An excellent way of reminding us all about the need to eliminate nuclear weapons from the planet.",
          "Visited recently on a trip with teens from Australia studying Japanese. Lots to see here, look through the whole park not just the cranes. Lots of hidden gems.",
          "A guided tour through the park is a must along with the museum when visiting Hiroshima. The photo scene above is very moving in real life with the flame and dome in the background together with the tomb containing the names of over the 300,000 victims.",
          "War is never good. I like how the park and the museum focuses on human suffering but does not justify the Japanese atrocities. Of course it does not also openly admit to Japanese culpability in the war. However, I felt that the focus was good - on how war brings about human",
          "The park has several monuments dedicated to memory of the dropping of the atomic bomb. Some of the monuments were very moving to me. At the Children's Peace Monument there are thousands of folded paper cranes said to to done by school students. From a distance I thought they",
          "Again similar to the atomic dome is part of the memorial park. Only a few hundred metres from the museum and the dome.",
          "Others have written about the power of this site, I can only concur the emotional impact was significant.",
          "A park to reflect on the horrors of was and it's after effects, central located close to the museum and dome",
          "A beautiful rememberance garden for all generations to enjoy. Well done to Hiroshima remembering the horrors of war with such power, but beauty",
          "A very beautiful place that allows personal reflection of what happened at the end of WWII. Everyone should go who can",
          "The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park is a very special place to visit, its beautiful, somber and sad all at the same time but a place you must see, with the hope that something as devastating as this event will never happen again.",
          "A beautiful and open space where you can reflect upon what you have seen or heard in the museum. Under the cenotaph are the names of those killed in the blast. As more of the original survivors decline in number, their names are added during Peace Day Commemoration. Visitors",
          "We were impressed with the Park.The children's memorial and Peace Bell are particularly striking.The Peace museum is achingly sad.The stories of the suffering of the children are tragic.",
          "The whole park is wonderful and worth wandering around. Take several hours to explore the centre of Hiroshima",
          "The history comes alive. Various elements reinforce the horrors of the bombing. The juxtaposition of the dome against the modern buildings around it create powerful images. The peace bell, the clock and the memorial of the young girl who made 1000 cranes hoping to survive her",
          "For those who have been to Auswich this is the Japanese version. Lots of pictures and murals of events after the bomb. An educational experience and insight into how the Japanese people rebuilt their country and nation after the bombs.",
          "The park is so peaceful with time to reflect on how and why we came to Hiroshima-Shi. The city will always be famous for all the wrong reasons and yet they give us reasons to hope for the future. The way that over 70 years on we see Japanese people enjoying their surroundings",
          "Sad but beautiful memorial to the victims of a terrible event in history. But at the same time the message and call for peace is also present. A remarkable testament to the Japanese people who suffered through this terrible event.",
          "All I can say is that if one is visiting Hiroshima the Peace Memorial Park is the one place to visit. Everyone will have a different opinion on the completion of the tour. Everything to see is in close proximity so it's easy to get around",
          "I felt this park was going a long way to reminding us all that peace is always the best option. The eternal flame and the statues and monuments throughout the park brought a sense of tranquty to a place forever bookmarked in history. The Children's monument feature the story of",
          "The park is a good place for remembering the crimes we as human beings committed against other human beings. How easy the \"civilized\" people could commit an act of violence taking away hundreds of thousands of human lives in a few seconds. We need to be concerned and preoccupied",
          "Walk around the grounds of this park and visit the shrines and memorials and you cannot be moved by the power of this area.",
          "Everyone who comes to Hiroshima should visit the memorial park. Words can not describe how moving and reflective experience it is. You certainly need",
          "Nice park with many memorials and monuments inside. You can simply stroll through it when going to the Peace Memorial Museum",
          "beautiful park clustered with the historical sites. a good place for self reflection, appreciating peace.",
          "Worth any detour from wherever you are in japan. Words don\u2019t describe the feeling this place evokes. It\u2019s horrible and stunning.",
          "So serene and peaceful this is what you feel .. beautifully landscaped with lot of greenery...the peach arch , the peace bell and the origami memorial are all in the complex.",
          "For those who don't know, there are free tours offered by volunteers. If you go to the information desk in the Peace Museum, they can arrange it for you there if one is available. Our tour lasted about an hour, and it made the experience more personal hearing from one of the",
          "Very nice and peaceful park, which you can visit in about 30 minutes. Lots of different memorials with a cenotaph as the centrepiece. We visited on a rainy day and were worried that it would ruin it but if you have an umbrella to keep you dry the rain adds to the sombre and",
          "The whole memorial area is a graceful way of embracing the history associated with the occasion that resulted, the gardens and the museum are truly worth taking a few hours to stroll through, read everything, look around and observe others reactions. We were there just after",
          "Kenzo Tange's first building focused on A-Dome and its dramatic training. Such building is aimed at drawing all attention to A-Dome",
          "The peace museum is such a moving memorial to the catastrophe that happened here. It stirs the emotions to think that so many people died while countless others suffered for years and years. The many photos and stories are often hard to bear. But I will never forget it.",
          "The Park is one of the attraction places in Japan. It designed beautifully, and lovely. There are many monuments. Museum was Wonderful and It was a memorable experience for us.",
          "The park is the must place to visit in Hiroshima. It is not a place of happiness but the park is very beautiful and having many places to remember and think about what happened here. From my point of view many japanese people come here for praying, remember or historic reasons.",
          "Definitely walk around the park and look at all of the memorial plaques and statues donated by different groups/countries/people from around the world. Do this after visiting the museum and on your way to seeing the atomic bomb dome ruins.",

          "Beautiful park with a museum that tells the story of the bombing and aftermath. A sobering experience. Very well done. Staff in the museum are in each room to answer questions and explain the displays. There is a simulation of the actual bombing that is very effective and shows",
          "Absolutely a must do and I happened to be there on the day of the anniversary of the atomic bomb so it was even more emotional with 50k people on site. It\u2019s an open area to walk around with a museum to the side",
          "This is a very large park and much to see when walking around. It is on the grounds of the museum and everything can be seen in one afternoon.",
          "Beautiful and peaceful park to remember ... To promote peace throughout the world. A lovely walk. There's a tourist information center.",
          "Peace Memorial park is a lovely park with a strong message, promoting peace and disarmament of nuclear weapons. We went there after we had been to the museum and being so close to hypocenter of the 1945 bomb and seeing the dome across the river was a strong experience.",
          "A must do for anyone, including children, visit the Peace Memorial Park, it will fill you with emotions and remind you of what human is capable of. It is also a good way to show your sympathies with the Japanese people and your respect for those who lost their life or whom",
          "A beautiful and peaceful park... It was a shame it was ruined by a horrible group of American tourists, climbing on the memorial for a group photo.",
          "Free to get to using the Loop Bus with your JR Pass. You can see the Atomic Dome, the various sculptures, and then walk to the Peace Museum , and then across the street, catch the bus going back to the station.",
          "Plan to spend at least at a couple of hours to half a day in an unhurried manner here as there are lots of learn and to contemplate. This very well designed and picturesque park situated between the Honkawa River and the Motoyasu River has about 47 memorials, monuments and",
          "The park occupies some of the area destroyed in the atomic attack. It is very peaceful. Respectful. There were a lot of children in the park, school groups, visiting as part of their studies. We were stopped by a couple of groups, one of which were primary school age. They",
          "Hiroshima has done a wonderful job of making this Memorial area so pleasant. It is spacious and a joy to wander around. I particularly liked the display area of the paper origami cranes made by thousands of children. So uplifting and a lovely area for young children to run",
          "We visited as a small group and came away with a newfound commitment to peace and a no nuke world. A tribute to the city and its people.",
          "A special place. Well maintained park containing a museum and many monuments relating to the atomic blast. A must see attraction of Hiroshima",
          "Lovely park which is easy to walk around and contains a number of memorials, museums, etc and information concerning the bombing of Hiroshima in 1945. The dome building is eerie! The museum was being renovated so we didn\u2019t go through it but enjoy 1 to 2 hours wandering the",
          "This museum is a fantastic display of the consequences of A-Bomb. The displays of tragedy that was caused is graphically and realistically depicted. A very heart warming experience and well displayed.",
          "Hiroshima in general is a place of rebirth after the fall of the atomic bomb. The whole area, including the museum is a remembrance of the dangers of war and atomic weapons.",
          "I\u2019m so glad we were able to visit the peace park and the museum. It\u2019s an important reminder of the devastation that humans can cause and arise from. The museum is heavy, but important to witness.",
          "It is likely intended to be peaceful, but is usually quite busy, so quiet contemplation isn't really possible. The Park links the Atomic Dome to the Museum, contains a pool, an archway to look through, and a rose garden, featuring the rose \"Peace\" among other famous varieties.",
          "this place is what they call peace park it a historic place you can see everything happened inside the museum in this place and the preserve totally damaged building its nice to walk around here on sakura blossom its family friendly and kids friendly park",
          "We have all seen pictures of this place but it's when you visit that it all becomes so real. We spent a few hours just walking around, reading and thinking about the events that happened to make this beautiful place available for us today. So sad and yet so beautiful.",
          "We visited this memorial on a Bunniks tour of Japan. The whole experience was very informative and confronting. The message I received was for the world to stay away from the nuclear option. The photo and artefacts display was the most moving and thought provoking.",
          "A big park with lots to see. Start at the Museum then work your way down the park to the Atomic Dome. Might be best to get a map and plot your route. Don't miss the children's peace monument - The beautiful art work and sentiments expressed will leave an impression on you.",
          "I had an absorbing and moving few hours in Hiroshima Peave Park, a truly wonderful place in that the city has turned its lowest ebb into a message of peace and defiance. The park is beautifully landscaped and is full of lovely memorials  The river runs alongside it and there are",
          "This whole area is a really eye opening place to the event that took place in 1945. It is peaceful, beautifully set and not too busy considering it being such a well known area. I really enjoyed my time here reading about each memorial and visiting the museum! My only issue was",
          "In this park burns a flame that will be lit until all nuclear weapons have been cleared off this planet. I think each and everyone of us can do our bit to help extinguish this flame. Not that the flame uses too much fuel or is polluting the air. Rather, what actually fuels it",
          "Not to forget the tragedy of the atomic bomb and why this never happens again. It is right to visit this place and remember the victims of one of the greatest crimes against humanity",
          "We visited the Peace Memorial Park as part of a tour by Odysseys. In the short time we were there, we saw the A-Bomb Dome, Children's Monument, Peace Flame, Hall of Remembrance, and Cenotaph. The message that the use of atomic weapons should never be considered again resonates",
          "The complex houses the A-Bomb Dome, the Children's Peace Monument, the Memorial Cenotaph & Peace Flame & the Peace Memorial Museum amongst other monuments. The story of the young girl & the paper cranes from the Children's Peace Monument is very sad. Highly recommended.",
          "A must visit when in Hiroshima. Experience eye opening accounts of a historical moment which should never happen again.",
          "I can't imagine going to Hiroshima and -not- visiting the park. There are quite a few monuments so take your time and take it all in.",
          "The city itself is very beautiful, but it's history is worth a visit to honor those lost to the horrors of war. Wandering the castle and peace park areas is deeply meaningful. Near the castle, some of the ancient trees that survived the bombing can be visited.",
          "The park is very well laid out with multiple monuments, highlighting different aspects and in a variety of styles and formats. All very well done in a sensitive and appropriate manner.",
          "Japan is the only country that have been A bombed and Hiroshima was the first to suffer this. The park, museum and the skeleton of the only remaining building - a police station directly under the explosion must be visited to try and grasp the horror of nuclear weapons. Don't",
          "Standing at the Cenotaph you can see the eternal flame and the Atomic Bomb dome framed by the arch. What a moving site. Ladies put fresh flowers on the Cenotaph every day, in memory of all those who lost their lives. It is hard to imagine that on the 6th of August 1945, at 8:16",
          "The Hiroshima peace park is a very moving monument to the people who were killed when an atomic bomb was dropped on them. The A dome and the museum were must see places and it was so moving to hear the recounts of people who actually survived. The children\u2019s memorial has",
          "The walk around the peace park and its memorial is calming and hopeful. Make sure you ring the peace bell on the grounds and hope the sound reaches the eaars of all people around this sacred planet.",
          "My children weren't too sure about visiting Hiroshima Peace Park on our family holiday as they thought it may be depressing. I'm so glad we went. It's powerful and affected each and every member of my family in a way that I hadn't imagined it could. We all took something a",
          "Nothing to say really, if you're in Hiroshima I would hope you would already be going. A most do bit of reflection for any visitors.",
          "If you are in west Japan this is a definite must. The memorials and museum here are worth a visit and serve to remind people of what destruction war brings. The park itself is very pretty and well maintained, it is by the river and there are some performances you can catch.",
          "Upon arrival in Hiroshima for the 1st time, this park was a must visit for me! So much hurt and pain as we strolled through the park with different statues/erected features/folded cranes reminding us of the event on 6 Aug 1945! Please do take your time to pray for the departed",
          "Salute to the people of Hiroshima who braved the tragedy and now spread the message of PEACE \u262e\ufe0f The dome, the angel installation & hundreds of paper planes signify \u201cPeace on Earth & Heaven\u201d\u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f Today, Hiroshima is a sprawling modern city with all chic brands like Louis Vuitton,",
          "This place is a reminder of the terror of war. The place is calm and serene and is in a simple form. Earth, fire and water combine in a style that when looking through the memorial your eyes take in these elements to the final view of the shell of the atomic dome. This place",
          "The city center was here before 9th of August 1945. The commander of the B-29 Colonel Tibbets chose the landmark just on the T-shaped Aioi bridge. Very handy, like a marker in a scope. The bomb \"Little boy\" exploded 300 metres further from the bridge, destroying the major",
          "This is a place worth visiting. Stop and read all the plaques along the way for an educative experience. The park is small, well kept and clean. Don\u2019t forget to visit the museum at the bottom end for a more in-depth explanation.",
          "An eternal flame that will not go out until all nukes gone - great concept - sad is needed. Many paying their respects here.",
          "The Peace Park is full of subtle reminders of WWII but shows very clearly how the Japanese have built their lives up beyond the torment, death and pain caused so many years ago- from the countless paper cranes around the Children's Peace Memorial, the park itself or the broken",
          "Must see for any nation! A-bomb Dome, large nice park with sculptures, cenotaph, rising so many emotions... For mankind to remember.",
          "The Japanese are known for their contemplative strolling gardens, and they have carried that on here. Sculptures and memorials for you to take in on your way around and stop and think about actions, consequences and who pays the real price.",
          "A place that one should visit, to remind every one the grim realities of war. A large garden with the remnants of a building destroyed, a memorial for the children who lost their lives, and an eternal flame.",
          "There are a number of separate features to this park. The museum is at one end, then there is a cenotaph, water features, an eternal flame, some more sculptures, and then the Dome off to one side across the river. It is easy to walk around and there is some seating.",
          "A lovely peaceful place to wander, sit or view the memorialisation. Beautiful environment with tasteful sculptures and thought provoking memorials. Well worth visiting.",
          "The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park is a reminder of the cost of nuclear power and a hope for the future. The skeleton dome next to the river . The memorial to the children who served and died is also a reminder of the cost to a generation of Japan.",
          "When you think of what happened in 1945 it\u2019s unbelievable. There is now a beautiful memorial park with a burning flame. It makes you really think! Go to this place",
          "The Peace park is amazing. It is such a tribute to the people and their culture. The museum was very crowded, but extremely informative. The whole place is a must see!",
          "We wandered through this beautiful park space after visiting the museum, so were in a subdued mood. The garden design does an excellent job of conveying the peace message of the entire complex. One end is anchored by the museum, and the other by the atomic bomb dome.",
          "A very well laid out park. Many monuments throughout. Worth the time to see the major ones. Pay attention to how many line up with the dome.",
          "A walk in the past. It was almost too horrific to comprehend. This event site is where WWll and the Imperial reign in Japan ended and led to the only country in the world to state Peace as a goal in their constitution. Just overwhelming.",
          "Hiroshima is now bustling with modern buildings, but the central theme of peace still pervades this city. The Peace Park is subtle with brilliant art....moments from the epicenter. Sadness, tragedy....it is unexplainable when combined with the museum. The Dome haunts.",
          "If you like biking in Hiroshima, absolutely a great way to visit beautiful Hiroshima. Compared to Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo it\u2019s easygoing. The peace park is serene and absolutely worth the visit. Biking on the pavement is 100% acceptable, but don\u2019t go to fast, take care of the",
          "The park didn't feel like a solemn place, instead it was a tranquil and peaceful environment. Our visit coincided with Hiroshima flower festival which made it extra special.",
          "After you have been to the peace museum it is worth a walk in the park to put your thoughts together. Very serine and calming, a must do.",
          "The park sits on the site of the main business area of the city pre the bomb. It's a reminder that such a terrible event must never again be allowed to happen.",
          "This sprawling and impeccably maintained park is a beautiful modern reminder of the horror faced by the city at the end of WW2. There are numerous often artistic memorials to be seen as you navigate the inter winding paths of the park. It is also a great place to view the atomic",
          "Sad & true, never quite realised the extent of this..def a time to reflect & hope it never happens again..innocence lost forever..",
          "I think it\u2019s a perfect way (building a park) to honour the thousands of innocent people affected by the atomic bomb. It\u2019s a beautiful place to reflect on the impacts of war. A must see when visiting Japan.",
          "Next to the A dome, the Peace Memorial Park is a beautiful and thought provoking place to visit. We went to the museum, which presents a balanced, though rather harrowing, history of the horrific past of Hiroshima. We then toured the park, and even though it was fairly busy,",
          "The park is packed and for good reason....it is good, lots to see and various individual sights and don't miss them all. Easy to wander round and enjoy. Even when raining",
          "Wonderfully done monument to the a bomb and the hope that we never see it again. A must see in this great city. I have always wanted to visit hiroshima and its well worth the effort.",
          "After seventeen stops the number 3 tram, which we boarded a short distance from the port, deposited us in the heart of Hiroshima at the Peace Memorial Park which had a river running through the centre. Both the Park and the river were peaceful . To make the most of this",
          "We spent several hours first in the museum (the main museum building is closed while the 'earthquake-proof' it but there is an adjoining building housing exhibits. I don't recommend the audio tour addition because all it does is read the labels which are in multiple languages.",
          "This park is a must visit when in Hiroshima, along with the Museum and the Atomic Dome. The residents of Hiroshima are dedicated to nuclear disarmament, so it will never happen again.",
          "Interesting to see that after the bombing the city applies for world peace every year, Park is really beautiful.",
          "Right next to the Atomic Bomb dome, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park cradled right next to the two rivers is a must visit place, it is well maintained. Names of those who died in the first ever atomic bomb is displayed......it is a great place for youth and children to learn",
          "This park connects the A dome with the museums dedicated to the bombing. Places to rest and relax while sightseeing, and to contemplate what happened here. Wasn't busy during cherry blossom season when I visited.",
          "We visited the peace park and it was wonderfully done to remember those who perished. It was a stark reminder of what not to do. In these times innocent people still being killed by terrorist and the like we need to enforce our views on peaceful outcomes whenever possible.",
          "The park is leafy and we had a pleasant walk around on our last day on the area. We were able to see the memorials and reflect upon the things that we had learned about the atrocity. It was good to see so many children visiting in groups to learn about the horrors of the bomb",
          "The most extraordinary part of the museum is a video display showing an aerial view of Hiroshima and the bombing. It shows how fast and brutal it was and why the dropping of the atomic bomb was so unacceptable. The point of the exhibition is not to lay blame, but to show the",
          "The Hiroshima Peace Park reflects on the tragedy of World War 2 and comments on the need for \u2018No More Hiroshima\u2019s.\u2019 We went on a rainy day making the day more meaningful",
          "Excellant exhibition with verbal videos of people\u2019s personal experience , lots of photos , lots of reading but very informative! Very well displayed very sad .... and educational for most people who wouldn\u2019t know much about this catastrophic event ....well worth visit . Allow st",
          "These gardens start near the place the atomic bomb was exploded and a derelict building remains. There are peace bells and sites for prayer. There is an area where people leave there origami cranes as votives for world peace.",
          "As you walk through the paece park the reality of nucleur war hits, you see many monuments, and eternal flames but the peacefulness of the park is truly unbelievable",
          "There was an independent exhibition of newspaper cuttings that spoke of the horrors of the war. It was very impressive, though not entirely unbiased.",
          "we had a walk on the 7th of august, the day after the commemoration. A very silent atmosphere. Every human shall experience such unforgettable lesson.",
          "You can walk the park on your own and read the information at each memorial, but if you book in advance (via email) you can also book a private guided tour for free by the volunteers and it is so worth it. Our guide was so passionate about the history and explaining everything",
          "They have a monument and an eternal flame. There also cherry trees along the river. The museum is worth visiting.",
          "My wife and I took a walk in the park for the morning during the blossoming of the Cherry trees. People were out and about having picnics and enjoying the day. Hiroshima has grown up after the bombing and the city is modern and has good will to all",
          "has to be done:so much to see here. Allow at least 2 hours. The big museum was closed for renovations but due to open April 25th 2019",
          "If in Hiroshima, you must visit the museum. Best thing to do is to initially look round area, then call into museum.",
          "Be aware that at present the main museum building is undergoing major renovation so there is a smaller display next door.....still excellent but not on the same scale as our last visit.",
          "A visit of these grounds is a must for the upbringing and education of your offsprings. An impressive lifelesson for those. Who were born and brought up after the cold ware en the wars before that.",
          "A beautiful large park standing in the devastated area if Hiroshima. Dhrubd snd trees were destroyed but many gardens from around the world provided plants to rebuild and bring some beauty aftet the devastation. I saw the rose bushes sent from Canada and was glad to see that",
          "This is a location well worth the time and effort to visit as it is a reminder of what happens when the world goes crazy and embarks on a war which in the end, no one wins and everyone suffers for years to come.",
          "The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park is a memorial park in the centre of Hiroshima, dedicated to the legacy of Hiroshima as the first city in the world to suffer a nuclear attack, to the memories of the bomb's direct and indirect victims. This needs to be seen in conjunction with",
          "Loved our visit to the Peace Memorial Park. Lovely gardens and sculptures. Peaceful place to reflect on the atrocity that occurred there.",
          "A peaceful oasis in a busy city. I found the children\u2019s memorial with all the origami birds particularly moving.",
          "After spending time absorbing the atomic bomb dome is is very peaceful to walk through the park and reflect the significance of the area. It is beautiful along the river and through the gardens in such a significant site in human history",
          "Visited here today. Something you have to see being in Hiroshima. The remaining building from the atomic bomb stands here. Very moving experience",
          "The park is situated alongside the river and on the other side of the river from the A-bomb dome. The park is very simple with a central memorial which has a flame which will remain lit until the last nuclear weapon has been destroyed.",
          "The place was obliterated some 74 years back. The Gembaku dome still sends shiver down the spines. But Hiroshima is an inspiration to mankind. A reminder that a ghastly event such as nuclear massacre cannot stop a determined and disciplined human race to progress. A lesson that",
          "The entire peace park has many beautiful symbols to honour those who died when the atom bomb hit. The view through the arch along the pond to the flame is well designed. There is also the children\u2019s memorial, the piece bell and the Korean monument. It is a very well thought out",
          "A very relaxing park to wander through juxtaposed by its history. Include a visit to the National Peace Memorial Hall, which is in the park (and free) to appreciate the full scale of what happened. Only about 2-3 hrs required including return tram ride from Hiroshima station, so",
          "It is easily accessible via the JR\u2019s Orange, Lemon or Green Route buses. It\u2019s free with the JR Pass, so there is no need to waste money taking the tram. It was a valuable experience seeing first hand how an atomic bomb can devastate so much. Expect to spend about one hour here.",
          "The park itself is nice, but not overall impressive - if you ignore all the history that has happened here. Everything that makes the devastation of the city is within sight and walking distance. A very moving place.",
          "Great place to relax and think about the terror of the past and the beauty of today. The blossom was epic",
          "Even though there were many people here it was quiet and serene. Beautiful place to walk, wheelchair and stroller accessible. Nice landscape surrounding the pond and flame. It's free with plenty of parking garages and food options nearby and within walking distance of the other",
          "OK, this isn't a place you visit to feel great. But, you do feel the love and support of a worldwide community and walk away with some hope that maybe, just maybe we can avoid another large war. Even without the deeper meaning, this is a beautiful park along the river.",
          "usa should lead denuclearization, not race for more nuclear disasters. Humble acceptance of responsibilities along with showing the lethal consequences of nuclear Holocaust to a nation, to innocent people clearly shows the evil. A reminder that peace, perhaps not profitable for",
          "Walking around the park is bitter sweet you get that peacefulness but it hits home the tragedy the city underwent. Well maintained grounds.",
          "We did a quick overnight visit to Hiroshima to visit the park, museum and hypocentre. It was worth the trip. It would be a day trip from Osaka all be it a long one. The park etc isn't close to Shinkansen station but bus and tram systems get you there. What happened here in 1945",
          "A very lovely and peaceful place to visit. The Museum is a must see. We should all know the devastation caused by conflicts in the past, and this gives us a good view of the horrors of the bombing of Hiroshima. You could spend several hours here. I would love to come back",
          "This will bring back history lessons Was nice to see how Hiroshima recovered from the disaster Eternal fire was well done Atomic done was sad",
          "Botanically, historically, culturally...the park is well laid out and full of things to see and learn. Lots of information about the atomic bomb of course. Includes peace bell, statues recognizing various groups (including Koreans migrants who died...powerful shrine) and",
          "I was travelling with my 13 year old nephew and we spent he best part of a day here. He didn\u2019t know much about the war or the dropping of the atom comb but he quickly became enthralled as the stories of the sculptures and various sites unfolded. He was genuinely interested and",
          "To actually stand and see this place in the flesh was a reality check. This place is sad but to see the way the Japanese people rebounded is bloody marvellous and a credit to them. The museum was good but I found it sad with some of the stuff on display but that is all part of",
          "There are a lot of monuments in the Park to visit to learn about the bombing and repercussions. Highly recommend spending 1-2 hours walking around.",
          "We took our time and tried to see all the park had to offer, it will be even prettier beside the river when the blossom trees are out and the sculptures are worth looking at",
          "wouldn't have missed it even though the museum was under review the temporary exhibition was something to see and contemplate",
          "So close and so informative. A must see in Hiroshima. A beautiful place to reflect on history and the damage it has done and what we need to learn from this",
          "We were on a tour which included a visit to the park and museum. There are many memorials and a peace bell. Especially poignant was the children\u2019s memorial with a special display of paper cranes made by school children.",
          "The reason you made the trip to Hiroshima. Remember and never forget how war is cruel and ends with killing innocent civilians",
          "It's a beautiful park with many monuments and memorials for the victims of the atomic bomb. We arrived in Hiroshima in the afternoon and walking around the park was the perfect way to spend the late afternoon/early evening. It's not huge, so you can see everything within an hour",
          "After visiting the Atomic Bomb dome and hearing the story of a survivor, i was amazed at the different perspective I had of the Hiroshima Peace Park. It is a well maintained and spread out park with different memorials positioned to give you an opportunity to reflect about how",
          "And feel a Lear\u2019s for making tourism here, a little guilt, can you smile in the photos? Are selfies appropriate? I think no, but free will right? Don\u2019t plan too much time here, the park is not that big.",
          "We walked around this area with a guide and you could not help but me moved by its past. It's an easy area to walk and reflect on what happened here. It has been beautifully designed. We should never forget the victims of war.",
          "The park is beautifully laid out and part of the memorial to the victims of the atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima in 1945. Very peaceful place to wander and sit and contemplate.",
          "We had looked forward to the visit and had expected to spend a whole day there. The fact was that we only spend around 2 hours there. The subtitles on the videos were poor.",
          "Nice place which can be visited on your trip to the main museum. You can easily walk in the park and rest for a bit.",
          "The park is beautifully laid out and contains some amazing structures. You can easily spend a whole day wandering around the park and going into the Peace Museum. A definite must see.",
          "Well worth the time to visit. It was a moving display of the tragedies of nuclear war and and a testament to the long lasting effects",
          "This is a wonderful centerpiece for Hiroshima. Well-kept and beautiful, with some nice memorials to history.",
          "Visiting the Peace Museum was one of the many highlights of our Japan trip. The entire history and after effects of the A Bomb are brilliantly and sensitively portrayed and a fitting honour to the victims. Could spend many hours browsing the collections, reading the material",
          "The park is a beautiful place and a fitting memorial to those who died in the 1945 atom bomb attack.",
          "This was a visit we both completely enjoyed. The park is put together with much thought and evokes emotion as you visit each space. The walk around the park does not take long and is quite easy for anyone with good mobility. There is a shuttle that will take you from place",
          "I have no idea how to rate the peace park as it was constructed to highlight suffering and survival rather than as a \"tourist attraction\". I did not think it was a particularly beautiful park - there was a lot of concrete and little by way of any flowers, trees, shrubs or",
          "The park is less intresting then seeing the actual museum. It is well kept and has a large peace bell in the park",
          "A concrete space which lacks any drama like the dome building or the little memorials around the city telling real life stories, tragedy & heroism. Find the big peace bell river end facing the dome building & sound your own message of peace around the world. I was disappointed",
          "It's a breath taking place, I cannot explain my real feeling...sorrow..everybody has to see and feel the great soul pain that every stone release...",

          "I visited in the winter, so the park was largely free of crowds. The design and visual elements were very well integrated. I rang a huge bell for peace, that even some Japanese were reluctant to try and ring (It was a bit difficult due to the size). A beautiful deep tone that",
          "Just the most beautiful place to be and reflect on the past history. A very short walk from here across the T bridge to the right and you\u2019ll find a small plaque which is the epicentre of the explosion. A must for a trip to Hiroshimau",

          "Simply and carefully laid out for contemplating life while strolling. Cold morning doing this was calming.",
          "The peace memorial ia very simple. But the ruin of the town building near it gave me a goosebump. It is a must to visit to face the horror of the past. The peace museum is highly recommended as it is very informative and thought provoking. Might be a bit depressing too.",
          "The park has been well-designed as a place for contemplation and remembrance. With the cenotaph and eternal flame as centrepieces perfectly aligned with the A Bomb Dome across the river, the Park is deceptively tranquil and stands as a fitting tribute to the victims of the Bomb.",

          "We came here as part of a tour group. We also visited the Museum. This was an amazing and sobering day. So much more then what you thought you knew. Our guide Kate was very informative. She walked us through every part of the park, explaining each of the memorials and monuments.",
          "Walked from the Atomic dome through the park and the lovely yellow Ginko trees. Saw the children\u2019s paper cranes and the Monument to peace. The park was full of children on day excursions who wanted to ask us questions in English which was lovely. If any people know the horrors",

          "I believe this is one of the main reasons to visit Hiroshima. The park itself is a just another park but since its more or less ground zero for the bomb it makes this such an important place. Inside the park is also important places like the Memorial and the peace museum.",
          "They did a wonderful job with the layout of the park. Walking through it was very sobering, peaceful, reflective, and inspiring all at the same time. There weren't many people around at all. The various monuments are very strategic and meaningfully applied. Definitely worth",
          "The first structure we saw approaching the Park was the A Bomb Memorial. It is striking in its state of destruction, being left to look the way it did right after the bomb. As you walk through the park, we came upon many different memorials erected for different victims. The one",

          "Take allot of time to walk around and drown in the surroundings. The park is beautiful. The museum was only 200yen; everything else is free. Don\u2019t forget to find the epicenter, which is a street over from the dome. Walk along the water. Listen to the testimonials from people who",
          "The park is easily accessible by tram or bus and your first sight is usually what's left of the Dome. An elderly lady there will ask you to sign a petition to the U.N. to ban nuclear weapons. For me, what made the visit to the park particularly special was the singing of the",
          "The park is beautiful, vast and it is hard to believe the horrific moments of 1945 August 06 that changed the world forever. No visitor to Hiroshima should miss visiting this park and the many monuments and memorials it includes. My last photo is of the hypocenter:a very small",
          "What today is a park was Ground Zero during the Atomic bombing. The most prominent structure is the UNESCO World Heritage Atomic Dome, the remains of what was once an exhibit hall. You'll also see the Cenotaph shaped like an ancient tomb and holding the names of the dead as well",

          "High on our list of things to see in Japan was the Peace Park and Atomic Dome in Hiroshima. Our cruise ship was docking in Osaka over 200 miles away. Figuring out the logistics of a one-day visit required expert help. TripleLights recommended several local guides in Hiroshima.",
          "The peace park is very well laid out, landscaping and monuments are well spread out and carefully maintained. Most monument Tablets are in both Japanese and English. The Peace Bell (when rung by passers by is to declare \u201cno more Atomic Bombs\u201d, the Remains of the Dome etc are",

          "A pleasant walk around the park will allow you to visit all the memorials within its boundary. We missed the peak of the cherry blossom by a couple of days but still nice. The T bridge intersection at the northern end of the park was the actual target for the A bomb",

          "We visited this location as part of an organised tour of Japan. This is a lovely garden and worth spending a little time walking around and contemplating the events of 1945. It is very hard for those of us who never saw this first hand to envisage the devastation and suffering,",
          "The Japanese have a way to take a terrible situation and make it both a learning experience and a thing of beauty. The park has several parts to it: The Dome, the Bell, the Origami Cranes, among others. Find a place to sit and reflect.",
          "The small park is home to numerous reminders of the atomic bomb detonation, with Children's Peace Museum, Cenotaph, Flame and lines up perfectly with the Atomic Dome. On a beautiful sunny day, it's perfect for a walk, and for reflection.",

          "This park ranks among the most moving experiences I've had during my travels. So many monuments commemorate that fateful day when 140,000 civilians were wiped from existence in seconds, and this park provides stark evidence why the world must strive to eliminate nuclear weapons.",
          "This was one of the most emotional aspects of our Asian holiday. It is very somber and very emotional but the theme throughout is one of peace, not blame. Some of the photos and exhibitions are graphic and confronting but in my view necessary. This was a must on our trip and I",

          "Very somber experience. To know what happened here and to see the displays and the awful things that happened I hope never again will this happen. Although the main museum is under renovations the building next door has a lot to see.",

          "The memorial park is simple but done very well. The link between the external flame and the Atomic Dome works really well There is also the Crane statue. The story behind this is both sad and uplifting in the way children of the world have responded.",
          "I urge everybody who visit Hiroshima to visit the Park as it does a great job highlighting the futility of war and especially the use of the atomic bomb and the resulting horrors for the survivors. I found it moving at times and it also left me deeply angered that this was ever",

          "At first we were slightly unsure about visiting the Peace Memorial Park and Museum as we were unsure of how our 9 year old would react. I am glad we decided to show him this history and it's importance to not repeat. The city is beautiful and the people are extremely friendly",
          "My visit to the Peace Park was one filled with emotion. While the history is there to be learnt, just being present in the area was what I liked the most. The peace park has been well presented and is a touching space of remembrance. Even if you know the history, a visit to",

          "Took the Shinkansen from Osaka to hiroshima, and from there if you have a JR rail pass you can hop on the JR bus to take you to the Peace Park. Once you get there, the first thing you see is the A bomb dome and the T bridge where the bomb was aimed. It was a very moving",
          "Really worth a visit - especially when you\u2019ve been to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum also and seen how this small island in the river used to have many cute little houses before the a-bomb. Also a very peaceful and beautiful park to take a stroll and watch all the monuments.",
          "Privileged to visit one of the famous historical place that we learnt in school days however you can feel pain and the loss from the face of the local people who came to pray there. A-Bomb Dome is the most significant landmark where the atom bomb geographically dropped. The",

          "Really enjoyed the whole park. The tourist information centre were extremely helpful with brochures to navigate the area. The tourist buses that drop you off are also free (if you have a JR pass). A must do if in Hiroshima.",
          "Obviously the park should remember to the first drop of an atomic bomb over the city of Hiroshima and to ask people for a peaceful life. If you like or dislike a park is a subjective impression. I like it but other people could have a different opinion of course.",

          "Plaques are located in both English and Japanese throughout. The Children's Monument to the A-Bomb Dome and the Peace Bell. So important for people to learn about the destructive powers of weapons of mass destruction. A very easy walk for anyone and so beautiful and informative.",

          "A short walk from the A-Bomb Dome, the huge park with many greenery also includes the Children's Peace Monument, Museum and Cenotaph. The large open space can accomodate large number of people and is superb to spend a quiet afternoon during autumn to relax and reflect.",

          "We went to Heiwa kinen Koen during Gorlden Week in Japan. There are so many people to visit. I saw a orizuru made by President Obama. He did pray the peace for all over the world I was very shocked since there is terrible tragedy that is caused Genshi\u30fcbacdan. My children also",
          "Regardless what you think about the \"victimization\" or not of this place, it is worth visiting. The kids should visit to learn what hatred can do. To learn not to support those people in the present day seem not to have learned any lesson from history.",
          "The aptly named \"Peace Park\" is a must visit if you are in Hiroshima. Well maintained garden and serene atmosphere awaits you. The arch is majestic and you can see the Atomic Dome from the center of Arch. Statue of a little girl who fought with radiation, provokes thoughts.",
          "The park is spacious and has lots of benches where you can sit if you get tired from all the walking. It is a very quiet place so please try and observe that",
          "A must place to visit when in Hiroshima. A grim reminder of the devastation of war. Take your time to review all the structures. However, read the literature of the remarkable recovery of the city and the resilience of its people.",
          "As this place attracts many tourists, it may be nicer to visit in the early morning while not so many people around. I saw a young gentleman prays alone before going to work. It takes about 30 minutes to see many statues etc so you just add necessary time for the museum to it.",
          "Volunteer guides are available for the one and a half hours it takes to see and undestand it all. Get one from the museum for free or for a slight charge get one from the volunteer guiding group that works to alert all to the horrors of nuclear bombs. We chose the later group",
          "Just standing here, both on a dark evening is very moving. From some angles it brings home the atrocity of the bombing. From other angles it stands out next o the modern city and shows what a recovery Hiroshima has made over the years.",
          "I loved this park. If you are a tourist you can spend half to full day here! There is a lot to walk if you want to go to each and every corner inside. The park seemed like a subtle reminder to me of how forgiving the Japanese are!",
          "It feels weird that this is such a calming, relaxing place marking such terrible events. I wouldn't say that it's a 'destination' as the park itself is more of a walking route, but it's the link between the atomic bomb dome and the peace memorial museum. Definitely worth taking",
          "A Must for every visitor to Hiroshima - a reminder to what mankind is able to do. Walk past the Peace Bell, see the Origami cranes children produced to commemorate a little girl victim. Think!",
          "I've been to the Peace Park in Nagasaki, Japan, many times, but this was the first time I'd been in Hiroshima. After a bus ride to the train station, I took a 25-minute ride to the Peace Memorial Park area (the stop is labeled for the A-Bomb Dome), and then spent several hours",
          "The park is worthwhile for anyone interested in the history of WWII. It somberness is highlighted by the peace bells, children\u2019s memorial, the memorial centopath. We spent about a half hour walking around, but it was raining...so you could easily spend more time.",
          "A beautiful park with fitting tributes dotted around. A lovely area to explore and relax. A really well laid out park.",
          "It is sometimes enough to just wander through the park looking at the various memorials. As an Australian I found that enough for me although I did visit the museum briefly. Just sit and contemplate. I guess everybody finds the park memorable in their own way.",
          "We walked around the park with our two boys 7 and 9 and visited the many memorials while making our way to the museum. The park is very peaceful and the different memorials really give you time and opportunity to think and talk about the deviation that happened on this now",
          "We arrived at the park prior to the opening of the museum in order to have time to see other parts of the park. Didn\u2019t realize that the bells would chime at 8:15 daily. At that moment we were in front of the Hiroshima peace memorial. Seemed a fitting time to be there. Leaves",

This monument is located in Hiroshima, Japan. Sadako Sasaki, a young girl, died of leukemia from radiation of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe monument is located in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, Japan. Designed by native artists Kazuo Kikuchi and Kiyoshi Ikebe, the monument was built using money derived from a fund-raising campaign by Japanese school children, including Sadako Sasaki's classmates, with the main statue entitled \"Atomic Bomb Children\". The statue was unveiled on 5 May 1958, the Japanese Children's Day holiday. Sadako Sasaki, who died of an atomic bomb disease radiation poisoning is immortalized at the top of the statue, where she holds a wire crane above her head. Shortly before she passed, she had a vision to create a thousand cranes. Japanese tradition says that if one creates a thousand cranes, they are granted one wish.  Sadako's wish was to have a world without nuclear weapons. Thousands of origami cranes from all over the world are offered around the monument. They serve as a sign that the children who make them and those who visit the statue desire a world without nuclear war, having been tied to the statue by the story that Sadako died from radiation-induced leukemia after folding just under a thousand cranes, wishing for world peace. However, an exhibit which appeared in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum stated that by the end of August 1955, Sadako had achieved her goal and continued to fold more cranes. Unfortunately, her wish was not granted and she died of the leukemia on October 25, 1955. Her main reason of death was from the radiation poisoning from the atomic bomb Little Boy.\n\n\n== Monument ==\n\nBeneath the main structure lies a bronze crane that works as a wind chime when pushed against a traditional peace bell from which it is suspended. The two pieces were donated by Nobel Prize winner, Hideki Yukawa.\nAt the base of the monument is a black marble slab on which is inscribed in Japanese:\n\nThe figures that surround the monument are angels, representing that Sadako is in heaven among the other fallen angels who died during the atomic bombing in Hiroshima.\nToday, people all around the world have the opportunity to donate cranes that they have folded in honor of Sadako and the others.  The paper crane is a symbol of peace, which was her last dying wish.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHiroshima Witness\n\n\n== References ==\n\nMinistries, Global. \"Global Ministries\".

          "This memorial was for us one of the most poignant memorials that we have visited. It is worth Googling the story of the young girl - Sadako Sasaki and the 'paper crane story' This young girl is considered to be a heroine to many Japanese schoolgirls and is a site much visited by",
          "While the Peace Park has a lot of great monuments, the Children's Peace Monument is one of my favorites. The paper cranes left at the monument are really a testament to the ongoing desire for a peaceful world.",
          "If you have children with you then make sure you visit .....this will help them understand. A very moving monument.",
          "This is located exactly opposite the light of peace. This monument has great paper cranes displayed. My kids enjoyed visiting this place. Loved the handmade paper cranes.",
          "This striking monument stands tall and has thousands of colourful hand folded cranes around the base of the monument. Worthwhile visiting if you're in the area.",
          "I've been to Japan a number of times often admiring the folded paper cranes (origami) but never knew the story behind them. As I understand it a little girl who survived the atomic bomb believed that if she made a paper crane every day she would live for another day. She made",
          "This was my favorite monument of all in the park. There are several structures containing paper cranes made by children from all over the world. It's a beautiful and symbolic art piece that is a lovely commemoration of the children who lost their lives.",
          "This is a lovely memorial to the children lost in the blast. It is set within the Peace Park, and is easily accessible. The cranes represent the hope of a young girl who thought if she made a thousand papers cranes she would survive her injuries from the blast. She didn't",
          "A bit sad because you can see young kids and young student praying and say something nice full of hope in front of this monument which is dedicated to a japanese little girl who was survived at the atomic bomb but after that event she is passed away because the radiations...",
          "Another MUST SEE when in Japan - next to the atomic bomb and the Peace Museum. Children and there reactions are our hope for a more peaceful future",
          "This memorial to the lost children of Hiroshima is very moving and is surrounded by cases containing millions of paper cranes sent from all over Japan and the world. Read about the story of Sadako Sasaki before you go and learn how to make a paper crane and take one with you to",
          "A nice sculpture in the middle of the island dedicated to the destruction of the bomb above The city",
          "The Children's Peace Monument is part of the Memorial Park and is free to visit. It has sculptures of three children on the outside and was built to commemorate the life of Sadako Sasaki who was two years old at the time of the bombing, but subsequently died of leukaemia. The",
          "This was my favorite monument at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. It's a hopeful, peaceful monument; it somehow exudes the innocence and loving nature of children, and their playful spirit lives in the hundreds of origami cranes hung in there. It's no wonder why the origami",
          "Read the story of Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes before you visit the Memorial. Make some paper cranes and add them to the Peace Offerings made by millions of people from all over the world.",
          "This monument erected in the memory of the children who perished in the A-bomb was designed by Kazuho Kikuchi. It is a moving (as in it touched your heart)structure .At the top of the monument a girl in bronze lifts a golden crane.Make sure that you go around the structure for",
          "Built in tribute initially to one girl, it epitomizes the will to survive for children and adults alike",
          "After reading the story of the young girl who had no immediate effects from the bomb, but ten years later died of the effects. After her death the school children of Japan set up a fund which then went global and resulted in this monument.",
          "Seeing this was a beautiful site. There were banner ribbons on display from all over the world and it is all encompassed with the museum & adult memorial & Peace Park. A site to see!! It was really nice with the Cherry Blossoms too.",
          "About the Paper Crane Girl - Sadako Sasaki was two years old when the Atomic Bomb was dropped. According to her mother, she was blown out of the window by the blast but survived. As time passed she developed leukemia from and become the most known hibakusha or bomb affected",
          "Cool monument with cranes and a bell for kids to ring. Nice picture spot for the kids. In the middle of the park, so you can't miss it on you day here.",
          "A memorial to one of the girls who died after some years of struggle and due to the effects of the blast. Nice but not a must see and would probably be seen whilst investigating the Peace Park and surrounds.",
          "Set in the middle of the Peace Park, this is a memorial with detailed explanations about the Peace Movement in Japan. Stories of 1000 cranes are the basis here and it is very moving. Take a few minutes.",
          "Such a sad story of a young innocent girl who wanted to live but lost her life to war. May it never happen again.",
          "Just walk around the whole park, this is part of it. Not sure why you would just go there to see this monument, but worthwhile as part of the whole experience.",
          "The paper cranes that the Japanese call Origami that children add upto at this monument add so much reality to this place and gives hope that future kids will desist from wars for it is the children who lost so much more in the dropping of the atomic bomb . The moving",
          "This makes more sense after visiting the museum which details some of the children who lost their lives during the bombing. The colourful crane garlands also make sense once you have heard about the little girl who made them as a symbol of her wishes to be cured of leukaemia",
          "We had to visit this monument as our children read the story of Sadako prior to this trip. The monument itself is beautiful. The kids enjoyed ringing the bell beneath the monument. The paper crane \"drop off\" area was also a great experience. We stopped by a local rest",
          "I recommend reading 1000 Paper Cranes prior to visiting this attraction. It is a short read and provides powerful context for this memorial. It is also helpful to visit the Museum prior to this spot.",
          "If you know the story and have read the boom, this is a place you have to go to when visiting Hiroshima. The cranes and monument were very well done. A sad story but a good reminder of happened and what shouldn't.",
          "I'm a teacher and one of my more difficult students loves origami so he helped me make a paper crane to take here. I loved visiting to see all the other cranes that kids around the world had donated and took lots of photos to show him when i got back to school.",
          "The statue on the top symbolizes a victim child of the nuclear bombing, when we were their we saw school kids standing respectfully singing and repeating words in Japanese after their teacher",
          "We visited Hiroshima with our 6 and 8 year old kids. On the Shinkansen over to Hiroshima, I bought origami paper (to make paper cranes) and told the kids the story of the 12 year old girl who died of leukaemia due to being exposed to radiation and that she only made it to over",
          "This monument was erected in remembrance of the children who suffered during and after the dropping of the atomic bomb. Hundreds of cranes (origamis) adorn the sides. A reminder that never again shall we see children suffer and that war is stupid.",
          "there is a cabinet open every day where you are able to leave a paper crane in memoriam to those children who perished and also those who were left behind with no where to go",
          "This monument is one of the most moving in the Peace Park. It really highlights the impact of the bomb on children even though it is dedicated to one child. Her story represents all the children impacted. What's particularly moving about it is how children around the world",
          "Hiroshima's memorial statue for the atomic bomb. There are many paper crane, but please leave it rest in peace.",
          "This is where I totally lost it and needed more tissue. The story here of the little girl who lost here life and inspired all to make paper cranes in the hope our wish chill come true. Her legacy lives on. Now the paper crane represents the wish for world peace.",
          "Once of the monuments present in the peace park. The thing I've noticed about this one is the masses of paper cranes located around the monument, giving it colour. Simple and sad memorial.",
          "This was a very nice addition to the park - I recommend spending some time here after visiting the museum so you have more context regarding it.",
          "I really enjoyed the simple layout of the shrine and the superb origami cranes that are sent from all over Japan, there are thousands of them arrive each week to hung in the booths around the monument",
          "For me, the most moving part of this monument were the thousands of colorful paper cranes created by students and other visitors to the park, to commemorate the suffering of Sadako and the other children who perished in the atomic bombing.",
          "This monument is a must see!!! It was erected as a result of a young girl dying from leukemia 10 or so years after the bomb... It was paid for by school children around Japan and there is an area set aside for paper cranes made by students around the world...",
          "The Sadako's story can be found in the museum and I can say it was extremely touching. Human should start to ask ourselves why a war should be carry out. War wont bring good thing, it'll only bring some negative tragedies. Guys, I was standing there with heavy heart but I would",
          "Unfortunately we didn't get to see the cranes out because it was snowing it it was still a lovely peace monument. Truly momentous in the context of the dome and the museum.",
          "one of the monuments in the peace park. beautiful statue and cases of paper cranes provided by schools from all over Japan.",
          "This was another favourite of the park. Very visually nice. So lovely the faded old paper cranes are reused - you see them in the museum. Many people ringing the bell of memory.",
          "Great opportunity to imagine what would it happen inside children's mind during and after bombing; If you visit the area with a total open learning mood, it gonna be an amazing experience.",
          "Thousands of children died on August 6, 1945. Many more died soon thereafter from their burns and injuries. And many more in the years that followed from the cancers and other ailments they developed from exposure to the radiation. The monument itself is not much to see, but the",
          "The memorial is inspired by the life after the bomb of a young girl, who survived the initial explosion and it immediate aftermath, yet eventually lost her life due to the consequences some years later. Her life moved a nation to celebrate Peace. The origami cranes, which you",
          "This monument tells the story of Sadako, who died of leukemia due to radiation exposure in Hiroshima, and memorializes the many children who lost their lives in the atomic bombing. Once you visit, you will understand the many chains of paper cranes.",
          "Bring your pre made paper cranes and add them to the exhibit--they have forms waiting for you to fill out to tell where the cranes came from. Be a part of history in this lovely memorial!",
          "Maybe everyone knows the story of Sadako but it was so touching hearing the bell and mourning all the children lost, in the silence of the moment.. A memorial to all the innocents, the victims that couldn't have a life..",
          "This place dedicated to many children that died from the bomb immediately and later. Sadako representing those children. There are peace bell under Sadako monument and many paper crane. Visitors should consider about the damage caused by the eruption. This is why so many",
          "Take a walk through the park, day time or evening, to experience each and every monument. It is a memorable and deeply moving experience. Highly recommended.",
          "I actually did manage to have a bit of a smile at this monument, as I was reflective and hopeful that a child should be able to laugh and have fun. This really seemed to attract a lot of children, and it was good to see parents explaining to their children about this monument.",
          "Located in the park, it was a nice place to visit. Ring the bell and say a prayer or give your condolences to the victims.",
          "This place is more hopeful than the memorial hall and the museum, but not any less poignant. It's really lovely to see the local school kids hanging their paper cranes, remembering what happened here but still remaining upbeat.",
          "I got a photo of a little Japanese girl standing under the statue and she was soon joined by her dad at this monument to the fallen children. Really special place",
          "As we got here, there were school groups singing beautifully, and placing their paper cranes at the monument. I could hear that one of their songs was a song to Sadako, the girl who inspired the monument. Such a moving experience.",
          "If you have very young children, the atomic bomb museum is not a great idea just because it will be difficult for them to understand and even scary. This monument, however, you can visit with a nice stroll through the park, and it's abstract enough that kids aren't going get",
          "We came upon this monument after crossing the bridge from the Atomic Bomb Dome on our way to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. It\u2019s a fitting tribute to all the children that died from the result of the atomic bomb explosion. There is a plaque near the monument describing",
          "Never been so moved by witnessing school children from all over Japan proceed in front of this monument to honour what this statue stands for. It did and still does bring tears of joy to my eyes to see how the japanese people evolved from the darkest day in human history to",
          "Once you hear the story behind this memorial in the museum, you will be moved upon seeing this memorial and understanding just how many children lost their lives on that fateful day and the years that followed.",
          "I wouldn't go back again, however it was on the way to the dome. It's quite a small monument but has a great reasoning for is existence.",
          "This is a memorial to the children that died on that fatal day in world history. Surely if we ever needed an example of why nuclear weapons should not be part of this world this is it. Really moving.",
          "This made me cry more than any other place. It was a tribute to all the children who died in the attack, or as a result of exposure.",
          "During school we studied Japanese and heard this story many times of the 1000 paper cranes. It was great to finally see this memorial in person. I found it to be really moving.",
          "This monument is dedicated to the children who died because of the atomic bomb explosion. It was inspired by the death of one of them 10 years after and this child who died of leukemia inspired a fundraising among many schools in Japan which ultimately led to building this",
          "really is all part of the peace museum area and a natural part of it. Surrounded by 1000s of paper swans. Do all as one visit with the museum and A bomb dome",
          "The overall experience of visiting the Peace Park is hard to explain in words. All the memorials, gardens etc. are evocative. This particular monument has a very poignant personal story about a particular child. Viewing It creates a combination of emotions yet although sad",
          "The Children's Peace Monument (lit. \"Atomic Bomb Children Statue\u201d) commemorates Sadako Sasaki and the thousands of child victims. She was two years old when the bomb was dropped and is one of the most widely known hibakusha \u2014 a \"bomb-affected person\u201d. She attempted to fold one",
          "As part of the Peace memorial park it's a sobering reminder of the children involved in this tragedy of their plight in an adult world",
          "Beautiful monument and tribute to the children who perished in both the war and the atomic blast. Definitely a must see.",
          "A monument to the innocence and hope of children. sombre and joyous at the same time. the ringing of the bell mourns but provides hope.",
          "It's a monument for the childrens that died with the effects of the atomic bomb. One girl was sick and started to make tsurus (the legend says that if you make 1000 tsurus you'll be health), but she died.",
          "Still today thousands of children make beautiful decorations and bring them here to honour those children suffered back then.",
          "The monument here is both beautiful and hopeful and all the paper cranes make you think about all the little things in life",
          "A beautiful monument from children to those children killed in the atomic attack and those died subsequently . Very moving especially all the paper cranes .",
          "good design and centralized. except beautiful place it also good for taking picture and doing strolling.",
          "Take a picture and get depressed of what the human race can do. The monument is located in the park close to the museum.",
          "The children's peace monument consists an attractive sculpture with a central bell and several kiosks around it which contain paper cranes sent from all around the world in memory of a young victim of the atomic blast. Possibly the saddest part of the whole peace park.",
          "The special thing about this place is the clear boxes forming an arc around the statue. Japanese people fold 1,000 cranes to make a wish come true, and school children from all over the world (including mine,) fold cranes, string them, and send themk carry them here to be hung",
          "The monument fascinating to look at as it incorporates Sadako's story. Be sure to bring a paper plane if you can as there is areas where you can leave them and submit where you came from.",
          "The gardens around the memorial are lovely and the children's monument is a serious memorial but also encapsulates the joy of childhood. Good for reflection and for smiling.",
          "Support the effort along with millions of others that support nuclear disarmament. This child died from radiation poisoning, but the idea is to call attention to the issue and prevent another catastrophe.",
          "ON the edge of the Peace Park this area is reserved for childrens perspective on the A bomb events. A large group of somber children were giving readings and thoughts that this event should never happen again",
          "For me, this was a moving and humbling experience and one not to be missed. It is a peaceful place located in close proximity to the peace memorial and park. We saw probably 13-14 groups of school children making their own journeys to this special place to remember the children",
          "The story of the origami cranes is known world wide , it is an inspirational story of a young girl who had ongoing complications from the A bomb .",
          "We saw groups of children coming to make their peace pledges - very touching and gave a lasting impression.",
          "We loved visiting the Hiroshima peace memorial park. Inside are all of these monuments at a very close proximity to one another. This was a very nice monument respecting and remembering the lives of the lost children.",
          "Lovely memorial in the park for the children who were embroiled in the disaster. Some children were being taught the meaning of the memorial whilst we were there and it was lovely to see them acknowledge the significance of it.",
          "The Children's Peace monument is a memorial to all the lost children of Hiroshima. For some it might also be thought of as the Sadako and the Paper Crane monument. In Australia many of us are familiar with Sadakos story and my partner who is a school teacher brought a chain of",
          "We were lucky to witness a group of school children singing a special song and presenting garlands of paper cranes. Very moving experience. The monument itself is very plain but the paper cranes in exhibit cases were spectacular.",
          "It is part of the peace park complex. The whole complex of the peace museum, peace park amd cenotaph is important to visit.",
          "The monument itself is nice. It's in the same area as the other ground zero monuments. The paper cranes....",
          "Lovely design but thought there would be more. Perhaps a playground, some interactive elements. It's part of this historic area and only 5 minutes from the museum or a-bomb so you'll wonder past it anyway.",
          "See my review of the Peace Garden. I did'nt realise this monument had its own review at time of writing.",
          "This is a lovely tribute and the story is very touching. I could not help but stay and watch all the school children visiting, many to bring paper cranes they had made. Then next generation bringing their own little bit of peace, hope and understanding to this special spot.",
          "I spent half day in this area but this made me teary with all the combinations of singing children, the story behind the saddest war, and reaction of travellers who were touched by the story. Please spare time to see this monument and museum...",
          "Our guide Miki told us the story of the little girl who started the paper crane ropes. It is amazing to see in person and the story warms your heart. A little walk to site from the dome, but not far.",
          "This is a heart moving memorial surrounded by colourful paper cranes made into pictures and hanging in chains. Take some time to watch groups of school children delivering bagfuls of paper cranes and ringing the bell.",
          "As part of the Peace Memorial Park, you will need to stop in and visit. This part of the park changed as well and is more organized and permanent in it's display.",
          "This spectacular statue is surrounded by hope in the form of thousands and thousands of brightly coloured origami cranes - birds of hope - folded over the years by the school children of Hiroshima (and still being folded today). Wonderful optimism for the future. I found this",
          "This is extremely moving, as the memorial is surrounded by thousands upon thousands of paper cranes, sent from all over the world. An easy walk from the museum and atomic bomb dome.",
          "This is worth a quick look, it is quite moving and worth seeing. The paper cranes left by school children were inspiring.",
          "A reminder of the innocent who died it will leave you moved and the one little girl sadako sasaki who became a symbol for the peace movement",
          "A memorial to the all those innocent children lost to the devastating event that occurred 6 August 1945",
          "The memorial is in the middle of the Peace Park and a very moving place. After reading countless stories of individual cases of child suffering and death resulting from the a bomb, I joined a large and very silent queue of families waiting to ring the small bell on the child",
          "This monument is to commemorate and remember all the children who died in Hiroshima. Dedicated to one young girl who developed leukaemia in the months after the bomb detonated",
          "Perhaps in the near future young people make sure that the suffering of the Japanese people was not in vain.",
          "When I learned the story about this little girl who suffered and dies of leukemia I felt so sad. There is a book and translated in English if you get a chance I recommend to read before you visit Hiroshima.",
          "This memorial honours all children who were victims of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. It was inspired by the sad story of Sadako Sasaki who survived the atomic blast as a young child. She got leukemia as a result of the blast. In her time at hospital before she died she spent her",
          "As with most of the monuments in and around the Peace Park, this fills you with an overwhelming sense of sadness, but also hope. Walking through the park brings with it many, many emotions and this monument is the one which seems to stop people in their tracks.",
          "This was designed around the story of a girl who survived the initial bombing but contracted cancer as a result of the radiation she experienced. She was determined to create a number of origami birds before she died and the monument reflects this. A reminder of innocent",
          "The story about this girl takes your breath away. Being there and witnessing a group of schoolchildren that in remembrance of this girl start singing makes you humble and silent. Something like this should never happen again.",
          "This is simple memorial but a touching one. The story of the girl who inspired the memorial is well told in the museum and not so much here. The origami cranes are symbols of hope from around the world and more could be done to display them better.",
          "The Children's Peace Monument was quite beautiful and sort of drew us toward it with the thousands of paper cranes encased in exhibits behind the memorial. Our Japanese friends shared a story of the a young girl who survived the original blast but years later developed",
          "All elements that are in this area of the dome and the memorial are relevant as being part of the all not as a stand alone, even if each of these places have a specific message and value to bring.",
          "Interesting to view the children's representation and schools tributes such as the origami. It is in the memorial park near the peace bell.",
          "Childrens Peace Monument is in the middle of The memorial Park. You can line up and ring the bell for peace yourself.",
          "Great story behind this, particularly for the kids, good for them to get an understanding of the impact of the bomb.",
          "Sadako Sasaki was a Japanese girl who was two years old when an American atomic bomb dropped. She got leukemia when she was about 11 years old. She is remembered through the story of the one thousand origami cranes she folded before her death, and is to this day a symbol of the",
          "This is the statue for Sadako the last girl that survive the atomic bomb but has to die with cancer while still young. It is a sad story but show how cruel the war is to the innocent people.",
          "Atop the monument is a statue of Sadako Sasaki holding wire model of a paper crane. Real paper cranes also surround the base. The story goes that Sasaki attempted to fold 1000 paper cranes, which according to Japanese legend, grants the folder a wish. She died of leukemia before",
          "One of the most touching spots in the Peace Memorial Park. The story of an individual child behind the monument somehow makes the whole think more real. And the colourful origami made by other children... Strangely, there is th element of hope present in their message here.",
          "This is straight from my travel journal: \"I loved the hope that it represents. Around the memorial are 1000's of paper cranes folded by children all over the world, including Australia. I loved the feeling of hope that children also seem to give us. I wrestled with the thought",
          "Went with a group here. It was moving, sad and emotional. Needed more time here but with a group this is always the problem. It was interesting and really emotio al and I ,earnt a lot.",
          "Its located right between the dome and the museum, visitors are allowed to put their folded crane into a destinated locker for wishing the world peace.",
          "It's definitely worth stopping by this, and all the other features of the park after a visit to the museum. It won't add much more time (although the park is something better done when you're not rushed anyway).",
          "Visiting this monument in particular was very sad. So many lives taken on that fateful day No crowds on a sunny Sunday. Worth looking for it in the peace park",
          "a nice memorial. my kids liked ringing the bell. after visiting shrines they used it to say prayers/wishes. The mursls made with paper cranes are truely beautiful.",
          "This is another peace monument in the Hiroshima Peace Park, dedicated to children. You can ring the monument's bell, and don't forget to check the millions of paper cranes in the display around this monument - amazing.",
          "This memorial is for a young girl; exposed to the atomic bomb who later on in childhood developed cancer and succumbed to it. As she believed that making paper cranes will make her wishes come true, she made 1000 cranes during her illness. Now people from all walks of life and",
          "See the 1000s of small origami cranes then go home and see how difficult they are to make yourself. The children enjoyed ringing the bell. It's very quiet here in the evening.",
          "The tragic story of Sadako Sasaki is memorialised here with thousands of paper cranes, sent from all over the World. You can leave paper cranes and your wishes for peace, to be recorded for posterity.",
          "We visited the peace monument alongside the peace museum and atomic bomb dome. The children's peace monument is a tribute to all of the children who lost their lives in Hiroshima when the atomic bomb was dropped. The paper cranes that have been boxed up around the monument",

          "Very peaceful place to remember the horror....visit whilst seeing the museum and fountains and peace bell. Submit a paper crane in memory of all the children who lost their lives during this dreadful period of history.",
          "The children of Hiroshima send completed strings of paper cranes to be hung at the entrance to the Peace Park. They are stored in plastic-covered stands. Thousands of hours of pain-staking work have gone into making the origami cranes to continue to message for peace. Not only",
          "It was a rainy day when we visited but there were still lots of visitors here. This monument had lots of origami crane art around it in different glass columns. It's amazing to see the different things people have put together with paper cranes.",
          "Beautiful and solem. A tribute to the 1000 paper cranes and world peace . Leave your paper crane at the monorail and view what others have left. You can also leave your name and address so they can send you a thank you letter (they appreciate knowing who you are and why you",
          "I've learned the story of Sadako when I was visiting the peace museum. When the atomic bomb was dropped, near her home, she was only two years old. She grew up until eleven when she started to feel more and more tired. Soon, she discovered that she had leukemia (one of the",
          "The children peace monument is another, along with many, great memorial. Many different origami cranes made by various people offer a lighter side of a memorial.",

        "wiki": "Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park (\u5e83\u5cf6\u5e73\u548c\u8a18\u5ff5\u516c\u5712, Hiroshima Heiwa Kinen K\u014den) is a memorial park in the center of Hiroshima, Japan. It is dedicated to the legacy of Hiroshima as the first city in the world to suffer a nuclear attack, and to the memories of the bomb's direct and indirect victims (of whom there may have been as many as 140,000). The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park is visited by more than one million people each year. The park is there in memory of the victims of the nuclear attack on August 6, 1945. On August 6, 1945 the US dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima Japan. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was planned and designed by the Japanese Architect Kenz\u014d Tange at Tange Lab.\nThe location of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was once the city\u2019s busiest downtown commercial and residential district. The park was built on an open field that was created by the explosion. Today there are a number of memorials and monuments, museums, and lecture halls, which draw over a million visitors annually. The annual 6 August Peace Memorial Ceremony, which is sponsored by the city of Hiroshima, is also held in the park. The purpose of the Peace Memorial Park is to not only memorialize the victims, but also to establish the memory of nuclear horrors and advocate world peace.\n\n\n== Notable symbols ==\n\n\n=== A-Bomb Dome ===\n\nThe A-Bomb Dome is the skeletal ruins of the former Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall. It is the building closest to the hypocenter of the nuclear bomb that remained at least partially standing. It was left how it was after the bombing in memory of the casualties. The A-Bomb Dome, to which a sense of sacredness and transcendence has been attributed, is situated in a distant ceremonial view that is visible from the Peace Memorial Park\u2019s central cenotaph. It is an officially designated site of memory for the nation\u2019s and humanity\u2019s collectively shared heritage of catastrophe. The A-Bomb Dome was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List on December 7, 1996. Many A-Bomb survivors and Hiroshima citizens were pushing for the A-Bomb Dome to be registered as a World Heritage Site as it was \"a symbol of horror and nuclear weapons and humankind's pledge for peace.\"\n This collective petition from many citizens groups was finally given influence when the Japanese government officially recommended the dome to the World Heritage Site committee in December 1995. A marker was placed on the A-Bomb Dome on April 25, 1997 by Hiroshima City. It reads:\n\nAs a historical witness that conveys the tragedy of suffering the first atomic bomb in human history and as a symbol that vows to faithfully seek the abolition of nuclear weapons and everlasting world peace, Genbaku Dome was added to the World Heritage List in accordance with the \"Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage (World Heritage Convention).\"\nDecember 7, 1996, Hiroshima City\n\n\n=== Children's Peace Monument ===\n\nThe Children's Peace Monument is a statue dedicated to the memory of the children who died as a result of the bombing. The statue is of a girl with outstretched arms with a folded paper crane rising above her. The statue is based on the true story of Sadako Sasaki (\u4f50\u3005\u6728\u798e\u5b50, Sasaki Sadako), a young girl who died from radiation from the bomb. She is known for folding over 1,000 paper cranes in response to a Japanese legend. To this day, people (mostly children) from around the world fold cranes and send them to Hiroshima where they are placed near the statue. The statue has a continuously replenished collection of folded cranes nearby.\n\n\n=== Rest House ===\nThe Rest House of Hiroshima Peace Park is another atomic bombed building in the park. The building was built as the Taishoya Kimono Shop in March 1929. It was used as a fuel distribution station when the shortage of fuel began in June 1944. On August 6, 1945, when the bomb exploded, the roof was crushed, the interior destroyed, and everything consumable burned except in the basement. Eventually, 36 people in the building died of the bombing; 47-year-old Eizo Nomura survived in the basement, which had a concrete roof through which radiation had a more difficult time penetrating. He survived into his 80s.The former Nakajima District, which today is Peace Memorial Park, was a prominent business quarter of the city during the early years of the Showa period (1926\u201389) and had been the site of many wooden two-story structures. However, in 1929, the three-story Taishoya Kimono Shop was constructed, surrounded by shops and movie theaters. It was said that if you went up to the roof, a panoramic view of the city awaited. In 1943 the Kimono Shop was closed and in June 1944, as World War II intensified and economic controls became increasingly stringent, the building was purchased by the Prefectural Fuel Rationing Union\nAt 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, the explosion of the atomic bomb about 600 meters above the hypocenter destroyed the building\u2019s concrete roof. The interior was also badly damaged and gutted by ensuing fires, and everyone inside was killed except Nomura, who miraculously survived. The building was restored soon after the war and used as the Fuel Hall. In 1957, the Hiroshima East Reconstruction Office, which became the core of the city\u2019s reconstruction program, was established there.\n\nAt the time of the bombing, 37 people were working there. All of them perished, with the exception of Eizo Nomura, who had gone down to the basement at that moment and survived the bombing. Nomura, who was then 47,  was a worker for the Hiroshima Prefectural Fuel Rationing Union. Nomura managed to escape through rising fire and vigorous smoke. However, after his survival, he struggled with high fever, diarrhea, bleeding gums, and other symptoms caused by the radiation.Although the building was heavily damaged, it stood still and was renovated soon after the war, including a new wooden roof. After the war, the Hiroshima municipal government purchased the building and established a postwar recovery office in it. Today it is used as the Rest House in Peace Memorial Park.\nThe Rest House has been in debates many times over whether or not it should be preserved. In 1995, the city decided to demolish the building, but the plan was put aside. One of the reasons was because of the announcement of the A-Bomb Dome as a World Heritage site.Right now, the first floor of the Rest House is used as a tourist information office and a souvenir shop, the second/third floors as offices, and the basement is preserved nearly as it was at the time of the bombing.\n\n\n== Ceremonies ==\n\n\n=== Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony ===\n\nEvery year on 6 August, \"A-Bomb Day,\" the City of Hiroshima holds the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony to console the victims of the atomic bombs and to pray for the realization of lasting world peace. The ceremony is held in the morning from 8:00, in front of the Memorial Cenotaph with many citizens including the families of the deceased. During the ceremony, a one-minute silence to honor the victims is observed at 8:15, the time of the atomic bomb's explosion.\n\n\n=== Lantern Ceremony ===\n\nIn the evening of the same day, Lantern ceremony is held to send off the spirits of the victims on lanterns with peace messages floating on the waters of the Motoyasu River.\n\n\n== Museums ==\n\n\n=== Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum ===\n\nThe Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum is the primary museum in the park dedicated to educating visitors about the bomb.\nThe Museum has exhibits and information covering the buildup to war, the role of Hiroshima in the war up to the bombing, and extensive information on the bombing and its effects, along with substantial memorabilia and pictures from the bombing.\nThe building also has views of the Memorial Cenotaph, Peace Flame, and A-Bomb Dome.\n\n\n=== International Conference Center Hiroshima ===\nInternational Conference Center Hiroshima is in the Peace Park, west side of the main building of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.\n\n\n=== Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall ===\n\nThe Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims is an effort by the Japanese national government to remember and mourn the sacred sacrifice of the atomic bomb victims. It is also an expression of Japan's desire for genuine and lasting peace. The Hall contains a number of displays. On the roof, near the entrance (the museum is underground) is a clock frozen at 8:15, the time the bomb went off. The museum contains a seminar room, library, temporary exhibition area, and victims' information area. The Hall of Remembrance, contains a 360 degree panorama of the destroyed Hiroshima recreated using 140,000 tiles \u2014 the number of people estimated to have died from the bomb by the end of 1945.\n\n\n== Monuments ==\n\n\n=== Memorial Cenotaph ===\nNear the center of the park is a concrete, saddle-shaped monument that covers a cenotaph holding the names of all of the people killed by the bomb. The monument is aligned to frame the Peace Flame and the A-Bomb Dome.\nThe Memorial Cenotaph was one of the first memorial monuments built on open field on August 6, 1952. \nThe arch shape represents a shelter for the souls of the victims.The cenotaph carries the epitaph \u5b89\u3089\u304b\u306b\u7720\u3063\u3066\u4e0b\u3055\u3044 \u904e\u3061\u306f \u7e70\u8fd4\u3057\u307e\u305b\u306c\u304b\u3089, which means \"please rest in peace, for [we/they] shall not repeat the error.\" In Japanese, the sentence's subject is omitted, thus it could be interpreted as either \"[we] shall not repeat the error\" or as \"[they] shall not repeat the error\". This was intended to memorialize the victims of Hiroshima without politicizing the issue, taking advantage of the fact that polite Japanese speech typically demands lexical ambiguity in the first place. The epitaph was written by Tadayoshi Saika, Professor of English Literature at Hiroshima University. He also provided the English translation, \"Let all the souls here rest in peace for we shall not repeat the evil.\" On November 3, 1983, an explanation plaque in English was added in order to convey Professor Saika's intent that \"we\" refers to \"all humanity\", not specifically the Japanese or Americans, and that the \"error\" is the \"evil of war\":\n\nThe inscription on the front panel offers a prayer for the peaceful repose of the victims and a pledge on behalf of all humanity never to repeat the evil of war. It expresses the spirit of Hiroshima \u2014 enduring grief, transcending hatred, pursuing harmony and prosperity for all, and yearning for genuine, lasting world peace.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the ambiguity of the phrase has the potential to offend; some right-wing circles in Japan have interpreted the words as an admission of guilt\u2014implicitly reading it as \"we (the Japanese people) shall not repeat the error\"\u2014and they criticize the epitaph as a self-accusation by the Japanese empire. In July 2005, the cenotaph was vandalized by a Japanese man affiliated with the Japanese right.\n\n\n=== Peace Flame ===\nThe Peace Flame is another monument to the victims of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, but it has an additional symbolic purpose.\nThe flame has burned continuously since it was lit in 1964, and will remain lit until all nuclear bombs on the planet are destroyed and the planet is free from the threat of nuclear annihilation.\n\n\n=== Peace Bells ===\nThere are three Peace Bells in the Peace Park. The smaller one is used only for the Peace Memorial Ceremony. Except that day, it is displayed in the east building of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. The more well-known Peace Bell stands near the Children's Peace Monument and consists of a large Japanese bell hanging inside a small open-sided structure. Visitors are encouraged to ring the bell for world peace and the loud and melodious tolling of this bell rings out regularly throughout the Peace Park. The Peace Bell was built out in the open on September 20, 1964. The surface of the bell is a map of the world, and the \"sweet spot\" is an atomic symbol, designed by Masahiko Katori [1899\u20131988], cast by Oigo Bell Works, in Takaoka, Toyama. The inscriptions on the bell are in Greek (\u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd), Japanese, and Sanskrit. It is translated as \"Know yourself.\" The Greek embassy donated the bell to the Peace Park and picked out the most appropriate ancient Greek philosophical quote of Socrates. The Sanskrit text is a quotation from Longer Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra which was attested by the Indian ambassador.  The Japanese text was provided by a university lecturer.\n\n\n=== Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound ===\nThe Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound is a large, grass-covered knoll that contains the cremated ashes of 70,000 unidentified victims of the bomb.\n\n\n=== Cenotaph for Korean Victims ===\nAmong the 400,000 people who were killed or exposed to lethal post-explosion radiation, at least 45,000 were Korean, but the number is uncertain, because the population has been neglected as the minority. Additionally, 300,000 survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki returned to Korea after liberation from Japanese colonialism. The monument, decorated with Korean national symbols, is intended to honour Korean victims and survivors of the atomic bomb and Japanese colonialism. The monument's inscription reads \"The Monument in Memory of the Korean Victims of the A[tomic]-Bomb. In memory of the souls of His Highness Prince Yi Wu and over 20000 other souls\", while the side-inscription reads \"Souls of the dead ride to heaven on the backs of turtles.\"\n\n\n=== Gates of Peace ===\nAdded in 2005, this monument contains ten gates covered with the word \"peace\" in 49 languages from around the world. The gates represent the nine circles of Hell plus one: \"the living hell of Hiroshima caused by the atomic bombing.\" Each gate is 9 meters high and 2.6 meters wide.\n\n\n=== Memorial Tower to the Mobilized Students ===\nThe Association for the Mobilized Student Victims of Hiroshima Prefecture built this tower in May 1967 in order to console the souls of over 10,000 students, including those who were Atomic Bomb victims, who died in bombings during the Pacific War. In Hiroshima, there were 8,387 students who were mobilized; 6,907 of which were killed in the Atomic Bombing. The memorial is twelve meters tall, five stories, and is decorated with the Goddess of Peace as well as eight doves which are placed around the tower. To the sides of the tower are plaques which depict the work that the students did, such as factory work, female students sewing, or showing students working to increase food production. There is a plaque in front of the tower which has two buttons that narrate the background information in either Japanese or English.\n\n\n=== Other monuments ===\nPond of Peace \u2013 encircling the Cenotaph\nPeace Clock Tower\nA-bombed Gravestone \u2013 gravestone of Jisenji temple \u2013 the temple used to be there\nPeace Fountain\nMonument to the Old Aioi Bridge\nPhoenix Trees Exposed to the A-bomb \u2013 also known as Chinese Parasols, these trees have deep scars from the blast.

          "This has a quiet, contemplative atmosphere focusing on the victims of the bomb. Free entry and only took us 15 minutes (although you could spend a awful lot longer there). Worth a visit.",
          "This place should make you cry. So many people died in an instant. Has a small theatre where stories of survivors are told of the minutes hours after the blast. Excellent and is a must see to reflect. We were in the main hall at 11am on the 11th. Sort of personal tribute.",
          "Located in the Peace Park, free admission.The whole atmosphere makes a lot of people cry... This visit will help you to try to imagine the Tragedy.",
          "Must go into Memorial Hall when you're visiting. Entrance is to the right of the Cenotaph. A lot of information and videos shown inside.",
          "The Hall is in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. The hall curators have collected atomic bomb memories and stories from the survivors of the bombing that are displayed with names and photographs of victims. There is no entry fee, and a lift for the disabled. No photography",
          "This well designed memorial has a modest but provocative above ground presence. Walk down the steps and enter an informative and contemplative space. This is a good place to slow down and really think about it.",
          "Loved Hiroshima and when in this place had time to reflect on a bad time in human history. There are many tiles arranged that show a devastated city after the A-bomb was dropped. Each tile represented a life lost and when you look at it, there is a lot. Very emotional, but a",
          "Big big chambers filled with the names of all the people that died. A very humbling and somber experience. We took our 1 year old who decided it was a great place to scream in delight as it echoed. Thankfully people in Japan are very understanding as we rushed her out the door!",
          "Quite interesting to walk through this memorial and to see the faces of those who died. They were also showing some videos of people remembering loved ones and what they were doing on the day the bomb dropped. An important reminder of the impact of war on the ordinary people.",
          "An elegant building that tells stories of the life of victims...a very human rendering. This is at the entry to the Peace Park.",
          "The park sits just across the river from the A Bomb Dome - such an awful memory but the park is just a beautifully peaceful place and so well looked after. Ring the Peace Bell !",
          "the relics will leave you dumbfounded. also recommend watching the short animated film PIKADON in one section of the museum. it moved me to tears.",
          "Not very much to see, but what you see triggers your mind and sets you to remember the impact of the atomic bomb.",
          "This place is easy to miss out. It is only about 100 m behind the Peace Museum. Beside being a memorial hall, people can still register the names of victims of the A-bomb.",
          "This memorial is located in the Peace Park and is an important stop as you go through this area. The memorial is very tastefully done and very moving to see. There are also resources for scholars in the library in the building. I would be sure to come here to get a sense of the",
          "We stumbled across this place and I'm glad we did - its better than the main museum. Its free to enter and wasn't crowded at all. As you go in there is a video of survivors stories that is very moving. The hall of remembrance will leave you silent. It is made up of 140,000 tiles",
          "At the entrance of the museum there is a panoramic photo of the city after of the bombing. In the museum, you can also read about sadako sasaki - a young girl that died in 1955 following the consequence of the bombing of Hiroshima. She died from leukemia. Just reading that",
          "A beautiful memorial to those accounted for with tiny tiles of each name forming the wall piece. Sensitive and tasteful",
          "it is one of those place that leaves you silent. The cost of war and its atrocities become apparent here just like visiting and old concentration camp or the vietnam memorial place in the US. Furthermore you can feel when in hiroshima how the local population is so positive",
          "I have been to the killing fields in Cambodia and it is very emotional, the war remnants museum in Saigon, bot are chilling places showing the history of the last 40 years but heer was my bucket list to visit, and it is frightening to think that a decision could be made to blow",
          "It is free to visit and gives names and information about the victims of the atomic bomb. Very sad place, but I learned a lot, and I think there is a purpose for places like these, so we don\u2019t forget and let this never happen again.",
          "Perhaps all of us knows more or less the history. If you know everything is still good to remember. If you do not, you will learn the history of Hiroshima bomb attack.",
          "A place for reflection as it names the victims and remembers them. Able to sit in the hall and reflect or look up names of victims and read about them. Makes you realise how many people were affected.",
          "HIroshima is one of the places one must visit. The site of a horrific act of war, it preserves the scars of the atomic bomb with savage effect. The memorial, while sober on the surface, highlights the brutality of the attack and warns against any future use of this horrific",
          "A truly moving experience. This memorial really brings out the reality of war and the cruelty that mankind can bring on each other. The videos projected towards the end of the exhibition and truly eye opening and I couldn't help shed a tear. This place is a must visit for anyone",
          "A great attraction! Located inside the peace garden it\u2019s such an experience inside the hall, so detailed, this attraction is free so no excuses.",
          "We visited the Memorial Hall on a recent cruise call to Hiroshima. The hall is easily found as you walk towards to museum, and is dedicated to all the people who were killed as a result of the atomic bomb blast. It is a very quiet and respectful place, and visitors instinctively",
          "It really brings home the horrors of nuclear war. Very somber and moving experience. It was busy when we visited but there was a stillness and silence as everyone took in the enormity of the event",
          "A little hidden in the park, but very worth seeking it out. When I went it wasn't crowded at all (unlike the main Peace Museum), so it had the suitably sombre ambience.",
          "The National Peace Memorial Hall is a solemn reminder of the lives lost in Hiroshima when the atomic bomb was dropped. It is a modern building with clever architecture. It is free to enter. Inside you will see the names of 300,000 victims. There were also some video accounts",
          "The memorial hall is a nice tribute to those who lost their lives as a result of the bombing of Hiroshima. There is no entrance fee to go through the facility. From the outside, just follow the stairs down leading to the entrance. Definitely worth going if you have the time",
          "This memorial is so cleverly designed and is a stunning tribute to the victims of the A-Bomb. All of the names are listed as well as photos. Many of their stories are told and are quite emotional. The stopped clock is also an eye catcher. A must see museum to add to the list in",
          "Visiting this place is a must. Not because its big with lots of different things to look at, but because seeing the names and faces of the innocent victims of the bomb gives you something to think about. Especially in the time we live in today where threats of using such weapons",
          "There is a clock stopped at 8:15, the time of the Bomb. You take an elevator down to the circular hall. On the walls is a 360 degree picture of the destruction of Hiroshima. In the room adjacent to the round hall is lists of the victims. There are even pictures of them. This",
          "This is a subtle entry into the experience of the bombing. A clever design takes you into Hiroshima before the blast, and after. Hundreds of names and photographs of the dead. A movie of personal experiences. Confronting and worthwhile.",
          "taken back in time to the day of the bombing through the eyes and mouths of the victims, travel down to the base of the hall to see all the names of areas devastated in the attack, very thought provoking especially in today's climate",
          "This memorial has been very carefully planned to allow you to appreciate the effect of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and it's citizens. Its is noteworthy that they have accepted that the war was instigated by the Japanese. Take some time tor read a least some of the many stories",
          "The main structure is constructed below ground level so from outside you could miss this amazing hall if you don\u2019t realise it. Getting to the main hall through a concentric circle ramp is a clever design, and once at the \u2018epicentre\u2019 you\u2019ll appreciate the 200,000+ tiles on the",
          "Come here for a quiet and stark reminder of the human cost of war. The facility is as much a piece of art as it is a memorial.",
          "This structure, mostly below ground, was beautifully finished in granite and is a suiting memorial to all those who perished. You can actually look up names of the 140,000 who died while you are there.",
          "Just when we were about to conclude an underwhelming visit to the Memorial Park, we saw this out of the corner of our eyes. Unfortunately there are no photos to share, but it's for a good reason. The stories told in this venue is highly personal which reaches the depth of your",
          "With free admission and built at the vortex of the atomic bomb blast, this memorial is well worth visiting. You journey through a downward spiral to the bottom where records can be accessed of the victims. I didn't have enough time to explore fully and check the videos that",
          "They have a video screening room which screens video of the tragic event and real life account interview. We spent some time walking around the place reading up bite size information. There is a staircase which leads to a circular memorial showing tracing of buildings.",
          "A must visit - a place to contemplate and reflect on one of the most shattering events of the 20th Century. Very respectfully and tastefully done, with no sense of bitterness, just of loss and of hope for a better future.",
          "This memorial aptly reminds of the people who perished after bombing by America during WWII. It also has pictures of people who died during the bombing. The very silence overpowers you with great sense of perils of nuclear war.",
          "If you're at memorial park in Hiroshima then definitely take the time to visit this memorial. The memorial itself is simple and beautiful, and the library gives you an opportunity to see the faces of the people who were so effected by the devastation.",
          "This is a direct memorial and tribute to the 140,000 innocents who died when America dropped the Atomic bomb on them. Unlike other spaces in the park and museum this has a hushed serenity about it",
          "Although the site was under construction during the time of my visit, it was really informative and moving to see what happened during the time of the bombing. I learned a lot about the effects of nuclear war, its victims, and the about the bomb that caused such destruction.",
          "This memorial is a must see. Free to enter. Does an incredible job remembering the victims of the atomic bomb and sharing their stories. May we never forget.",
          "I suspect most people head for the museum as we found the memorial hall to be quiet and (as bizarre as it might seem) peaceful. It is a fitting memorial to those innocents who paid the ultimate price for the decisions made by their \u201cleaders\u201d at the time. It is very tastefully",
          "It won't take you more than 30 minutes to experience this site. Once you walk down to the center, take some time to read the brochures provided. The structure is very symbolic and a wonderful place to reflect and honor the lives lost as a result of the a-bomb here in Hiroshima.",
          "A touching reminder of the victims of the bombing of Hiroshima. Names and photographs make it personal.",
          "This memorial is very poignant. You learn information about what happened after the bomb dropped, as well as spending time reflecting in a sombre and quiet place.",
          "Take some time to visit this memorial. It contains information about those who lost their lives in the tragedy. The video presentation on some of the victims before and after the bombing will really move you emotionally as it is mostly about children. Very well presented.",
          "A stunning and moving monument. Definitely take the time to visit. I was moved to tears. It is a silent space that winds down to a central area where you can stand and reflect on the devastation of the bombing.",
          "Although the memorial hall is just opposite the peace memorial museum and is admission-free (while the museum has an admission charge), the memorial hall is surprisingly much less crowded and much more quieter than the museum. It is a solemn place to pay respect to the victims",
          "A sentimental and emotional place to reflect on the destruction and aftermath of the A-bomb. Educational and insightful for all ages.",
          "Very sentimental place. We loved the monumental. You will understand the devastating effects of A-bomb one more time",
          "Even if you are not a history buff, this place will still leave an emotional impact for you. As expected from Japanese technology, the exhibition is very well executed. The audio guide is rented at about 100 Yen and available in several languages. Go get it. Must visit this",
          "Walking down the curved ramp to the circular room, I wasn't prepared for the impact of finding myself standing in a circular room looking at a wrap-around (full 360 degree) mosaic made from thousands of small tiles (one for each death caused by the bombing). Standing toward the",
          "The memorial building is a moving tribute to the lives lost in the bombing and the personal sequelae of this event. The afternoon we attended there were some survivors of the bombing reciting personal memoirs of the bombing. The memoirs are emotionally powerful and can",
          "You can see data of many victims(all?). The settings are very well done to think about them calmly.Highly recommendable.",
          "Walking down the ramp inside this Memorial Hall isn't enough to prepare you for the devastation that you see from the photographs after the bombing. You can look up victims by name if you are a relative or know of someone who was killed by the bomb. The visitors inside were",
          "A very nice tribute to the lost lives. At the end of the route, there is a short film (on a loop) of different personal accounts which is worth spending some time at to reflect the magnitude of what happened.",
          "Love the idea behind the design concept. Very simple but subtle. Free entry and wheelchair friendly.",
          "This shows the reality of what happened and is a interactive experience that really is worthwhile and teaches us all the lessons from history, let's hope that more people see this to make a difference to our futures.",
          "Seeing the stories and names of all of the victims makes you stop and think how can war be about armies and not children. Great place to spend time thinking. Not a fun place but a must see.",
          "The Museum was below ground which makes it a bit difficult to locate. There is no fee to enter. The museum is linear and very under-stated. One can spend 15 minutes here, or two hours. It all depends on how immersed you are and whether or not you read all the signs and",
          "Wandering down the middle of the park towards the fountain we almost missed this memorial as it is behind some trees. The first thing seen is the virewing spot for the fountain, and then you proceed downstairs to the entrance. From there you go down a ramp which displays a",
          "This was my favourite place. Just so nice to sit and reflect in the silence with the soft sound of water running. A must see.",
          "This is very sad perhaps hard to get something out of it unless you are japanese as its all in japanese. However very moving and you see should it to pay your respects nonetheless",
          "It\u2019s very sad to read about all the victims and the dead people but it\u2019s a message for the whole world to ban All Nuclear Weapons! Very informative and educational.",
          "A beautiful memorial hall which showcase the before & aftereffects of the atomic bomb in the unsuspected city. The devastation, the loss of hope & the thirst for water bring sadness to show that war is not the answer & peace must be preserve.",
          "The Peace Memorial hall is accessed by a staircase that slowly makes its way round the outskirts of the building to a domed room underground. This is a quiet, cool place that was constructed in 2002. Upstairs is a room with computers and they are collecting the names of all",
          "A short walk from the A-Bomb dome was the Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims. Inside this memorial stood the Hall of Remembrance that honored the victims and inspired contemplation for peace. The interior wall presented a 360-degree panorama",
          "This monument is very moving.... you walk down a circular ramp to a room for reflection.... it walls have an image of the devastated and flattened area after the bomb blast. After this area I made my way out thinking that I had seen everything however there is several",
          "Be sure to listen to the stories of the survivors. We stayed for the full 20 minute video after visiting the memorial hall. Listening to these human tales was the best thing for us. A poignant and moving memorial hall. Very glad we visited.",
          "A visit to the memorial hall was not on my agenda, but as I was walking, there it was and so I entered. And it was fortunate I did. Despite there being a large group of schoolchildren present while I was there, I was able to commune with myself and appreciate the hall as a",
          "After spending most of the morning at the nearby Peace Museum we were heading back through the park when we came across the Peace Memorial Hall. In we went and happy that we did, set underground this place was built by the Government to remember and mourn all the victims of that",
          "I found Memorial Hall the most reflective place of the park as it was least crowded and sunken from ground level. It's a must.",
          "you going down and in circles you remember all the passed away ones This place is dedicated to the memory of the people died becouse of the A-bomb All the names are kept here, photos,video-projections calling back the ones who are left becouse of the mass destruction and",
          "While not as comprehensive as the Peace Memorial Museum, the Hall has some things to offer and you can pretty much cover it all with 30-45 minutes. The highlight is the video shown toward the end of the tour. It is a come and go as you please environment, but it will be hard",
          "A must visit when in Hiroshima. This place a an architectural highlight, and it really makes you think about what happened.",
          "The Memorial Hall inspires thoughts of what happened to all the innocents killed on 6 August 1945 or subsequently following the Atomic Bomb attack. The interior wall presents a 360 degree panorama of the City as seen from the hypo centre and was made with 140,000 tiles marking",
          "A peaceful place that reminds you of the price people pay in war . Please watch the video at the end . It may make you cry but you must watch it",

          "This is a free area and is entered by going down a staircase, there are walls of names and the remembrance of the innocent people that perished in 1945. There are soundtracks and playing videos that will educate the public ~",
          "Once you descend to the basement you see a map of all the cities and towns surrounded by the bomb. You gain perspective of what happened back then and how horrible it was.",
          "The National Peace Memorial Hall is part of the Peace Memorial Park. While the park in general is packed with tourists and students, relatively few visit the Memorial Hall. That's a shame. Entrance is free. It takes a relatively short time to walk through the hall. There are a",
          "You can watch series of short movies about people from Hiroshima bomb attack. But memorial only focused on the attacked innocent people, not cause of war nor reasons of bomb attack.",
          "This is located in between the Atomic Dome and Peace Memorial. It's a wonderfully, thought-out structure and is a place so serene, that it invites you to reflect on what happened to innocence when Hiroshima was bombed. There's a digital library, if visitors want to look up the",
          "It is easy to miss this building, because it is towards the side, and most of it is underground. You go down a spiral ramp which has a calming effect. It goes counter-clockwise, to symbolize going back into time. There is fountain in the center with a gentle sound which",
          "We took a few introspective moments here to really allow it to soak in about the number of lives lost. It is really well done & worth at least a brief visit.",
          "This memorial is located within the Peace Memorial Park and is walking distance from the main Museum. There is no entrance fee. Focusing on the victims of the bomb, walking through the hall was a very heavy experience, particularly the one area in which you can actually search",
          "The memorial is a accessible with a round stairs down which goes counter clock wise because 'we are going to look back in time'. The site is very peaceful and we'll maintained. After you can look at a movie which consists of stories from survivors. Their stories make it a vivid",

          "It's a peace of art in itself. A true masterpiece to encase the people lost. Worth seeing if you have the time.",
          "As you head deeper underground in the spiral shaped building, you can read about what happened minutes before the bomb hit and what occurred afterwards. By the time you reach the centre, you may be overwhelmed with sadness and compassion for the victims. The feeling inside is a",
          "We came here as our visit to the larger Peace Memorial Park. It is free admission, not very big, and totally underground. At the reception do remember to take a copy of the brochure which has a lot of information inside. No photography, for the respect of the deceased. One",
          "We came here as our last momument for the day. At that time my mind was already a little saturated with so many peace monuments. Despite this, the visualization in this memorial was absolutely stunning. I am very grateful that my husband convinced me to visit \"yet another",
          "This museum is well worth a visit. It presents a balanced view of the events that took place in 1945 that we hopefully will never repeat in human history",
          "A visit to Hiroshima is not complete without a visit to this site. It explains in detail what happens from a personal perspective. Try to remain objective about the reason why this happened but also retain a Japanese view at this and how many lives, as you will see from the",
          "This is free to the public and doesn't really take very long to view. It is peaceful and tranquil if you care to sit in the circular room for some quiet moments. There is a screen on the main floor where a video shares firsthand accounts of survivors if the A bomb. We were",

          "I learned more about the whole Hiroshima story here than I did at the much more popular Peace Memorial Museum - there are unforgettable short films of testimonies from survivors and very somber lists of those who were lost in the bombing. As others have commented, the exhibits",
          "Whatever learned in the history over these years, you can feel that in the moment. Place where mass destruction came to reality. Informative place.",
          "The museum presents the overall story of why Hiroshima was a target in the war and also the personal remembrances of those present when the atomic bomb was dropped on the Atomic Dome.",
          "This free museum is situated next to the flame of peace. The building is a nice spiral that takes you to its heart. There is an amazing fresque?! when you arrive at the bottom. In the next rooms, you can see the faces and names (and get detailed info if you wish) of all the",
          "The library in this building is a simple history lesson. Especially the video recordings of victims telling the stories from the d-day and events afterwards are just ugly truth....It is also nice to see how Japanese people and authorities formed this place to stress the",
          "One cannot help but feel emotional in this space. As you wind your way around the spiral passage and read the inscription and photos on the way, you gain an understanding of what has happened, the towns affected and the people and families affected. At the base is this circular",
          "This is a new addition to the collection of monuments, museums and memorials in the Hiroshima Peace Park, by which I mean it wasn't here the last time I visited. We almost didn't go in, intending to focus more on the museum. We were glad we went. A very sombre and fitting",
          "This place is beautiful and peaceful. It was designed to be a place of reflection, where people can go to quietly think about what happened here, and the victims. Unfortunately there were many people here talking and taking photos and videos, which disrupted the quiet",
          "The Memorial Hall is underground, so it's easy to miss, but it's worth visiting for a moving experience. My favorite part were the video presentations, which told individuals' stories relating to the bomb. With an event so large in scale, sometimes it's helpful to focus on a few",
          "Here you go underground and can watch footage of the dropping of the bomb (in English) followed by a walk through a remembrance room dedicated to all the original areas of Hiroshima decimated by the bomb. There is a fountain depicting the time of 8.15 when it detonated. Finally",
          "I missed the Memorial Hall the first time I visited Hiroshima, as it's hidden away from the museum and cenotaph. But take the time to stroll a hundred yards, then down the spiral ramp to see the memorial hall. In it's own way, it's as moving as the cenotaph or the museum.",
          "The Memorial Hall is set within the grounds of the Peace Park. You go downstairs to enter it. It holds the names of all those known to have died in the A Bomb blast. There is a small cinema playing footage from survivors and the aftermath. There is a facility for relatives",
          "Located within the memorial park, it is a place mostly overlooked by the big tour groups, which makes it ideal for reflection and gives an appropriate dignified atmosphere to the victims of the atomic bomb. I was especially moved by the personal accounts of the survivors who",
          "Went to the peace memorial museum first, so had already seen and heard some of the same information. It was therefore a quick visit. Many sad stories here and more quiet than the other museum. 30 minutes trip is enough.",
          "They have a lot of displays on ground zero and where the first a bomb was let off in anger - lucky for us it has not happened again- nice display here",

          "We just finished visiting the city of Hiroshima. It is wonderful to see it built up into a thriving metropolis. There are water canals everywhere lined with lovely trees and cherry blossoms. The Peace Park is tastefully done and declares Hiroshima to be a \"City of Peace\". The",
          "The east building of the museum was closed for construction when I visit. You can rent a headphone that has 10+ languages. The explanation and the exhibits are really good and brought us back to the day the atomic bomb exploded and what happened after that. Really good for a",
          "Very moving video presentation exhibit. Our kids 9 and 11 were able to handle it, but we had prepared them for it before the day. It's in the middle of the park so just add it to your day here.",
          "You can sit in quiet contemplation here. Its definitely worth a visit especially for the testimonials at the end, just sit and listen to a few of them. They are quite harrowing but also reveal a bit about the mentality of locals around wartime.",
          "This free exhibit offered some very intriguing video footage. Better than at the actual museum. The hall of remembrance was very impressive.",
          "English speaking staff. Friendly and welcoming they encourage you to explore the small memorial hall. There is a small library, theatre, and memorial hall. This is a good place to start, end or supplement your visit to the park.",
          "This is a smallish memorial to those who have perished in the Atomic bomb explosion of 1945 Most of the descriptions within the building is in Japanese and we spent less than 10 min in it",
          "as you walk down the ramp there are windows with stories in English and you lead into this hall. off to the side you can sit and listen to the stories of survivors experiences and a room is available if you want to look up someone who may have been involved",
          "It was not actually in my itinerary for the day when I saw it on my way to museum from A-bomb dome. It's difficult not to connect with the victims when you are there. The plays is dim but not dark. There are full of displays reflecting stand against weapons of mass",

          "From the moment one stands in front of the Dome one is drawn into a feeling of solitude and profound sorrow. The park is large and each of the memorials tells its own story. Don't rush, take your time and even if travelling with others, find some solitude for part of your",

          "I think this National museum is not only for Japanese, but also for all the humanbeings in the world to learn about what has been done in Hiroshima in the past in order to to avoid same mistake in the future. Entry fee is just about 250JPY for maintaining the facility.",
          "A nicely designed memorial, and gives a good perspective on the scale of the devastation. While the museum will give you the detailed facts, this place had a more sobering insight into the actual human cost. I quite enjoyed the video room towards the exit which had excerpts from",
          "This was a peaceful place to finish my walk in the park. The walk into the museum was a downward spiralling ramp, bit tricky if you have trouble walking, once at the bottom it was a very beautiful area of remembrance. You could catch the lift up to the top or use the stairs.",
          "The Memorial Hall packs an emotional wallop. Audio-visual displays that allow you to hear the individual stories of people caught in the bombing were particularly harrowing. The hall seems to get fewer visitors than other areas of the Peace Park. Probably not suitable for young",
          "I knew a little of the history but after visiting this museum, it was incredibly moving and encouraging to learn even more what happened and the stories from the survivors. It's emotional but worth visiting - I would recommend a day in the entire Hiroshima as it deserves the",
          "The entire area of the Hiroshima Peace Park is a must see when you are in Hiroshima. It is an emotional experience but it is a visit everyone should make. The museum deserves at least two hours.",

          "As in, it hams it up a bit to tug at the heartstrings. There was even a bit of Japanese nationalism creeping into some of the videos. The main round exhibit is a beautiful place for quiet contemplation, though.",
          "We visited this monument after the museum and I would recommend doing it in that order. After hearing stories and seeing the displays, it allowed for a deeper reflection and appreciation of the monument's beauty. It's a very well thought out memorial and i highly recommend",

          "I thought this was one of the most powerful memorials I have been to. The great hall is done in such a way that there is no detail overlooked. Each tile used to make the mural is representative of a victim of the atomic bombing and it creates the landscape after the bombing. You",

          "I avoided going to the museum but after talking to a number of other foreign visitors to Japan, I finally went there to see it in person and not just on TV. It is terrible what the U.S. president ordered its military to do to the scores of innocent people of Japan because any",

          "This is a place for quiet contemplation of the futility of war and the horrific cost in human life. Each victim of the A-Bomb is listed here and there is a section for unknown as well. Be quite, think on and pray that this catastrophe can never happen elsewhere on the planet.",
          "It's almost impossible not to feel upset when visiting this place, not only because of many images, photos, objects from war, but because of our capacity to destroy places, kill people. War is terrible and this visit makes us think over and over about how bad it really is.",
          "This is a comprehensive yet sobering memorial to the memory of the atomic bomb victims, as well as lots of information surrounding the actual effect that nuclear warfare can wreak on victims. You will want to set aside several hours to see all exhibits although it will not take",

          "The symbolism and quietness of this memorial make it the very best part of the Peace Memorial Park. It was our very favorite parift our visit, and touched us more deeply than any other memorial. This is the one and only must-see memorial at the Park!!!",

          "This place was very emotional to visit, we missed it last time and it is mostly underground, so you really have to look for it. There is also a listing of all the people killed and videos of childrens written journals after the bomb hit.",
          "A quiet, moving place with no razzamatazz but time for reflection. It is cool and quiet underground after the heat outside and the crowds at the main museum. There are photos and biographical details of everyone who was affected that day, set out simply and unsensationally.",
          "This location is easy to miss with an \"underground\" entrance. There are two major parts of this facility. A remarkable room with a 360 degree view of the devastation from the center of Hiroshima with indicators to the neighborhoods destroyed is the main feature. Please don't",
          "It was a very educational visit for me. I was not prepared for an emotional experience. Seeing how civilians, especially the children, were devastated by the war was quite heartrending. Be prepared to walk a bit, wear comfortable shoes.",
          "I've been to lots of museums but never one quite so quiet or moving as this. I think its because the casualties were so may civilians rather than combat troops and also the significance of the nuclear strike (+ Nagasaki) on the overall conclusion of WW2. Hugely significant and",
          "Not easy to find. But while being in the park you have to go there. Especially the document with the testimonials of the school,children describing there experiences directly after the bomb impact are very impressive...",
          "We came here to listen to some readings on August 6, 2015. After the incredibly moving poetry readings and discussion, we looked at the exhibits. After all the emotions of the prior hour I was overcome and couldn't finish the exhibits in this wonderful memorial. Even today",
          "It was surreal viewing the photos and artifacts left over from the after math of the atomic bomb. Though it was a bit crowded with school groups visiting I was tremendously impacted by the displays and information provided at the museum. The cost was meager and the layout was",
          "It's a great place to go and reflect on those where were lost in the a-bomb explosion. Beautiful building with free entry.",
          "Hiroshima is very unique museum. You can learn a lot about atomic bomb sadness and soreow of Japanese people from the past till now. Japan is very unique country they try hard to prevent what they have suffered from the past and make it better nowaday.This meseum is very very",
          "Don't miss coming here to pay respects to those lost 70 years ago and to learn the survivors' stories. Victims still exist and have important messages. We attended a poetry reading here on August 6, 2015 and afterwords saw the extremely moving exhibits and paid our respects to",
          "I thought this memorial hall was more moving and more interesting than the museum. The round room at the bottom with its 360 degree view of the devastated city is very thought provoking and very well designed. The memorial wall and information on the victims with little bits",
          "Such an amazing memorial. Don't have the right words to fully express how this Memorial stirs your emotions. The exhibition by the exit brought many tears to My eyes but was so worth visiting.",
          "This muesem tells the story of what happened in August 6th 1945, the peace hall is nice to think about what happened on that day. They have short films stating the survival kids story.",
          "This beautiful and thoughtfully laid out memorial was much more moving than the crowded Museum, and had barely anyone in it.",
          "Take some time out to really appreciate this memorial. It is thought provoking, particularly the stone hall.",
          "If you visit the Peace Park you have to visit this hall.It really shows quite graphically the damage which was caused.",
          "The 360 deg view map made from stone is simply beautiful. Worth it just to go sit and take it all in!",
          "Wholeheartedly recommend that anyone who travels to Japan makes the journey to Hiroshima for the Peace Museum.",
          "This is a well done and impressive experience. It is not worth a special trip, but if one is there for another purpose, it is worth a visit",
          "The hall is really serene, and makes it easy to reflect on the horrors of war and to remember all those who died there.",
          "Being able to visit this silent memorial for the bomb victims was one of the strongest memories during our unbelievable trip to Japan. Words cannot present what this dome does to you.",
          "As a world traveller, I always thrive to visit a museum in order to learn more of the country's history. This museum shows it all. It reveals all you ever wanted to know.",
          "Good place to visit to learn more about the tragedies that happened here. It is quite graphic and gruesome in places but is essential to visit At the moment half of the museum is closed for refurbishment so not as much as normal to see They have audio guides available for 300",
          "Worth visiting for half an hour, this tasteful memorial is for the victim inhabitants of the city of Hiroshima. The centerpiece sculpture symbolizes the 8:15 time of the detonation. Great exhibit to accompany a visit to the Peace Memorial Museum.",
          "Very sad place, but very rich in culture. If you get one of the Audio Guides, which are about 300 Yen, then this will greatly enrich your experience. The audio guides have quotes and other descriptions that bring you much closer with the item you are researching and puts a whole",
          "Scary to see all the artifacts, but one needs to know what happened here. 45 minutes is good enough to visit the museum. It is amazingly organized and managed and is very well worth your time.",
          "Place is free to enter. Also has lift as access is by stairs and all is found at basement level. Consists of circular underground building with a small skylight and fountain. Furthermore there is a continuous slide show which gives profile of victims and another small film area",
          "This museum reminded me a lot of the holocaust museum. You always hear about how bad the situation was when the U.S. Dropped the a-bomb but seeing it in real life was crazy. The deviation is brought to life, however the museum does not pass blame it just seeks peace.",
          "This is situations in the peace memorial park and free entry. I recommend the special exhibit area where you can sit and watch a different videos of the victims stories. Very moving",
          "All other museums tend to victimize Japan, but this, at the very entrance, mentions that they want to focus on the truth - and they do. They mention Japans role and their war hungering ways, and they take some responsibility. It was the only museum we felt was trustworthy to",
          "It was less graphic than the museum, but still told the story. At the end there is a slide show with a story about different people. In it is mentioned a book, The Children of Hiroshima, where there are stories written by children of what happened to them when the bomb was",
          "Very busy but interesting. A bit gory for those with a weak stomach because there is a lot of pictures of injured and dead people. Lots of school kids and everyone was very welcoming to us as Americans. I was very happy to see that.",
          "Inside the building the building looks simple and beautiful, you can see the memories of how abhorrent the atomic bomb blast that claimed so many victims. Can be shared lesson for us, from various witnesses that they exhibited in the history of this place",
          "A beautiful memorial to all the victims of the Hiroshima bombing.It has a victims register so would be invaluable if trying to research someone who perished in the disaster.An amazing circular room lined with tiles to commemorate every person who died on that day.A quiet,serene",
          "A nice memorial to the victims, but not much to see here. If you actually want more details on the bombing, then this is the place to go as it has big library and victim register. Not something specific to add to your itinerary, but it's close to the museum, so might as",
          "Has similarities to S21 Prison Museum in Cambodia for those who have been there, with the wall of face photos. Very respectfully done, places like this should be compulsory visiting for all world leaders to ensure they understand the consequences of decisions.",
          "Unlike the museum, this is a place of great reflection. This is the place I shall remember about Hiroshima - a 360 panorama composed over a tile for each person killed is a sobering experience. There are three short videos at the end - definitely worth watching.",
          "Quite an amazing memorial for those who died in the Hiroshima atomic blast. Hang around and watch the video at the end, it chronicles the stories of the children who suffered through the bomb blast.",
          "Summary: A moving memorial. It feels like a mausoleum to the dead as you descend along a round walking path to the bottom of the museum. Along the walls as well as at the top of the museum are stories of the victims. Very somber and it again adds a very human quality to the",
          "The Peace Memorial Hall is a fitting tribute to those that lost their lives because of the atomic bomb. The Hall of Remembrance provides a 360 degree panorama view of the city as seen from the hypocenter (Shima Hospital) after the dropping of the bomb. The next room after the",
          "You wind down a curved corridor into the crypt of this befitting memorial. Along the walls are plaques giving a brief history of events ( although some contradictory to others at the museum and definitely to the history I was taught). An apt place to reflect on the futility of",
          "The Peace Memorial Hall is a somber place. As you enter you follow a winding path the lists the key events in the Hiroshima bombing and finally enter a large room where you stand surrounded by a 360 degree panorama of Hiroshima after the bombing as well as a graphical depiction",
          "Not the most prominent of the memorials in the Peace Park, you have to go downstairs to the entrance, but definitely should be included in your itinerary. A more contemplative experience than the Museum, but perhaps more meaningful becauser of that.",
          "Very evocative and silent tribute to all victims (known by now) of the A bomb horror. Above the memorial, outside in a park, a symbolic monument with a clock set at 8.15 when it happened with scattered bricks, glass, iron,,,,all around it.",
          "Good place to remember the tragedies of the past. Feel sorry for the events leading up to this, at what cost!",
          "Very peaceful memorial but very touching when you stand in the main hall with a fountain that depicts a clock face showing 8:15, the time of the explosion. The interior inside the hall shows a 360\u00ba panorama of the A-bombed city. Despite this is small museum and memorial it is a",
          "A fitting, moving environment that memorialises without sensationalism. This quiet space allows visitors to attempt to connect with the great human tragedy of the Hiroshima bombing, away from the grand sweep of the war narrative. A must see for people of all political stripes.",
          "I missed this place last time I visited but was happy to find it this time. The spiral downward entry with small plaques along the wall takes you down to the hall itself which is quite grand; a fitting tribute to all those who suffered and died. As you come back up to ground",
          "Appropriately somber and reflective. It is quiet and peaceful. There isn't a whole lot to see here, but it is still worth a visit. There was a nice video to watch also. There is a library with likely tons of information available, but I skipped that part.",
          "If you're here, you just as well see it all. This one doesn't take long, it's another piece of the experience. It's a memorial wall, similar to our Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC. It will move you if you let it.",
          "This place is one that will make you leave feeling reflective of the past. It is presented well, but I would recommend paying the 300 yen (approx $3 AUD) for the audio guide as it provides a more in-depth understanding of the effect this event had on the people of Hiroshima.",
          "Very well laid out with amazing artifacts and stories, plenty of English translation and personal stories. An amazing series of memorials to the people of Hiroshima, children, Koreans, and more. If you are taking children be aware that some of the pictures are graphic.  Sign the",
          "It is amazing to hear the stories of what one bomb can do in a split second. Makes you fear war and hope this never happens again to anyone. The stories and narratives will hold your attention for as long as you want to. Take the time to at least hear a few.",
          "I think most people skip this museum but it's definitely worth visiting and watching the film and reading the exhibits. There are lots of first hand accounts from children and interviews with victims which we ended up watching. In some ways, I found it better than the peace",
          "It was very moving experience to see what was the effect of bomb. But the eternal flame,the only remaining dome, the girl memorial, the Japanese old house like structure all in one line is mind blowing.",
          "Very moving. A must visit place in Hiroshima. Can get crowded. Best to take your time and wait for the crowds to past.",
          "For something as significant as an A bomb, I find the exhibits a little plain. There were pics of the explosion, mock up creations of the chaos and a model of the city and where the bomb was dropped. Remnants from buildings after the explosion were shown along with technical",
          "The Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims is part of the Peace Memorial Park. At the entrance, you will see a monument that depicts 8:15, the time the atomic bomb hit Hiroshima. Around this lies some ruins of A-bombed buildings. Inside, you will",
          "i like that place because we can relate the japaness feelings during that time..as a pilipino i can feel also what their feel,their ancestor who died during that time..",
          "The Memorial Hall is free and a must-see while strolling through the park. Highly informative and one can get quite emotional there.",
          "In the Hall of Remembrance, the circular walls showed the panoramic view of atomic bombed city as seen from Hypocenter. 140,000 tiles were used in remembrance of number of victims died by end of 1945. Fountain at the center consisted of sculpture that depicted the time 08:15.",
          "There isn't much to this place, but it is well worth a few minutes. Beautifully designed main chamber and an excellent video show on the way out. Really adds to what you learn at the museum itself and so well worth including in your walk around the site overall.",
          "This was my personal favourite in Hiroshima. terribly sad and also slightly confronting, it documents the events leading up to the end of WW2 and ultimately the detonation of the atomic bomb. Some of the exhibits will bring a tear to your eye and make you wonder how we as humans",
          "Near the entrance are some seats and video playing with English subtitles with 3 maybe 4 accounts from different people who were children/young adults at the time the A Bomb hit. There is a library also where you can sit down in your own booth and wear a headset and choose to",
          "My second time to this place, worth to visit - reminding you that we as a human being sometime can be cruel than animal. And its still continue until now ....",
          "Space for contemplation, quiet and respectful, must go and absorb the thoughtful layout and symbolism.",
          "Like the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, this is a not a place you should just \"skip over\". The stories you will come across are powerful and an important part of history that all people should be knowledgeable about. It will give you a small glimpse and better understanding of",
          "at 4pm on a Friday we were the only visitors into this incredibly atmospheric subterranean memorial. The acoustics when you stand at the very centre by the water feature are amazing and quite 'other-worldly'",
          "The simple stories of people who lived through that hell are the only decent way of telling what happened - take away politics, take away statistics, take away the sick fascination with the shear destructive power of the bomb - and what you have left are normal people, entangled",
          "If the nearby museum tells the story of the bomb, this memorial is for all individuals who were affected, directly and indirectly, by the bomb detonation. It's a very powerful yet simple display. We managed to avoid large groups during our brief visit, and the emptiness of the",
          "A simple wall can be so powerful. Seeing how each tile represents each person killed in Hiroshima is so powerful. Makes us reflect the impact on the city as well as each person who perished.",
          "A sad, sobering, powerful, intense reminder for us all. Worth the visit, especially the feel it gives you for what was Hiroshima after the bomb.",
          "This is another sobering attraction at the Hiroshima Peace Park where you can spend most of the day. I hope this never happens again.",
          "The images are in 360 degrees, striking. The small Tori gate left behind is a surprise. There are many video stories of children's experiences, done well. It's just sad, probably the devastation in 360 and the stories were the saddest part of this experience for me.",
          "This is near the museum and is worth seeing too. Entry is free. Amazing and clever structure to remember the victims.",
          "A sobering and moving tribute, which leaves you with a very real understandng of the devastation caused to the city",
          "What an experience to see what they Japanese people when through. They had displayed different artifacts from the destruction that occurred including models of children and what they looked like after the bomb went off. Amazing, and don't miss it",
          "The initial visual impact is unbelievable, huge walls with so many names!! so much wasted life, at least a very respectful memorial can pay some tribute to innocent victims.",
          "Visit at the end of the day when it is quiet, just before closing. Whe were here alone and it was more impressive than the memorial hall in Nagasaki. Entrance is free, and together with the museum, the park and the dome a must do when visiting Hiroshima. After the memorial hall",
          "Beautiful memorial with excellent information in English.. It was lovely and quiet... A fitting tribute to those who passed Free entry",
          "It is truly humbling to visit this museum and see the pictures and accounts of the bombing. No one tries to lay blame on the Americans, in fact they accept responsibility for beginning the aggression by bombing Pearl Harbor. Many American POW's were also lost in the bombing of",
          "Good to see and hear what happened and how the people and City have recovered. Very busy as there were large numbers of school children visiting. Recommend this to others.",
          "All these places are close together and blend in to one after a while It is in the same area as the museum and they really do take great pride in the location with flowers etc but seen one and you get it they are victims and don't want to ever be seen as such .",
          "Very powerful memorials that pay tribute to the hundreds of thousands people to have passed because of the atomic bomb.",
          "See my review of the peace park. The memorial hall is part of it and is a deeply depressing experience, despite the limited displays. As most of them are photographic, if you really want know about the devastation of Hiroshima (and to a lesser extent Nagasaki) then internet",
          "Nestled away in the park and mostly underground the NPMH is a beautiful and moving place to reflect on the suffering of the victims. The sound of moving water is evocative and symbolic. Upstairs the audio visual displays and personal recounts are truly sad. It really is a must.",
          "The memorial hall is nicely done. There is a research room where you can find out information on the bombing victims.",
          "The Peace Memorial Hall is beautiful - both in terms of architecture and of what it represents. The water, symbolising an offering of relief to the bombing victims, is beautiful and moving. Well worth a visit to pause and reflect while in the peace memorial park.",
          "Moving - sobering - and so very, very quiet - even kids. There is no way that a thinking person could be unmoved by this",
          "Although rather hidden away in the Peace Park this should be a must if you visit Hiroshima. We were fortunate to visit in an early evening when there were only a two or three others there - I doubt it would be quite the same if there were groups of visitors present. The whole",
          "This Hall gives you a glimpse of WW2 effects on Japan, needless to mention the effects of the Atom Bombs. At the end you also get to see short movies (10 mins each.) on what happened on the day of bombing. The stories will definitely bring tears in your eyes.",
          "Probably not known anywhere near as well as the other attractions in Hiroshima, but other than the museum I would rate this as the best. Modern and thought provoking , especially the children's story on visiual.",
          "A very sobering visit. Even with the large numbers of students there on the day of our visit, it was still very quite as visitors reflected on the many displays. Many relics from the atomic event demonstrate the magnitude of the forces involved. The sound of students singing",
          "This place is very quiet not many people were visiting maybe they didnt realise but thats what made it so great as the peacefullness added to the emotion that was being portrayed. it was free and the set uo was simple and beautiful and very emotional was well worth the visit. is",
          "This is one place that should be on everyone's bucket list; each an every one of us should come here and really understand why nuclear weapons should never be used again. We spent all afternoon wandering around the Memorial Park taking in the many, varied monuments and the",
          "you definitely have to visit this place to understand how man can destroy himself. we must learn from mistakes",
          "this is a very educative place to visit, with the history behind the bomb and why Hiroshima was chosen to get the first one. It's quite sad, but informative and interesting - worth a trip to Hiroshima.",
          "Walk around, take picture and \"feel\" the place... amazing. The ruins are the symbol of the destruction made by theA bomb.",
          "I first visited the Peace Park in 2005, and so when we visited Japan last year my wife and I made a point to include Hiroshima on our itinerary. The Memorial Peace Park is perhaps the most emotionally challenging place I have ever been. The museum, which simply cannot be",
          "The Hall is very well presented, as one circles around and around and emerges in a totally different spot. A nice touch was being given a small box with some paper cranes inside upon entering.",
          "I appreciated the tranquility of this hall, very well designed. I was completely engrossed in the 23 minute slide presentation/movie they show outside, listening to children recounting their experience on the day and the days immediately after. When it ended I couldn't believe",
          "This is well worth the visit. There is a lot of information available, so make sure you give yourself a lot of time. It is worth watching the victims own accounts of their experiences. The museum gets very busy but the Hall is a lot quieter. There is a research centre here",
          "Meditation room, audio visual stories of the surviving victims, mostly school children. And a great library if you really want to spend time getting into the history.",
          "At some point one sees on large screens the faces of the victims. It is very painful to see that so many innocent civilian casualties perished from this tragedy.",
          "This is a free memorial/museum. There were also pamphlets available in multiple languages to explain the symbolism of the memorial. As you are exiting, there is a picture wall of those that died in the blast and a library to find the names. There is also a short film by those",
          "Such a quiet peaceful place that has come from such great devastation, the pond above includes pieces of buildings that survived the bombing",
          "Tranquil place. This is a must see in Hiroshima. Everyone should visit at least once to remember the awful ugliness of World War II and the Bomb. Also to pay their respects to the people of Japan, who have survived and prospered as good world citizens since then.",
          "this is some where I always wanted to see, you read about it in school it is taught to you from a young age, so when I arrived I thought I had a good understanding of the situation, however what I learnt there hit alot harder being there onsite, this place is best in silence and",
          "A heart-wrenching experience but nonetheless a must see in Hiroshima. Extensive signage in English walks you through the events of that fatal morning of August 6 1945. Some recovered household items are on display. Well worth a visit (entry fee 100 yen)",
          "Simply sit quietly, look around and reflect on the events and causes that eventually resulted in this place being here.",
          "Speechless. The Children's memorial and the peace park as a whole are a fitting tribute to the innocents who were massacred here and to the dedication and strength of the Japanese people to rebuild. Beautiful place.",
          "I was very pleasantly surprised by how this apparently simple site has been able to communicate such a thoughtful and peaceful message. Highly recommended.",
          "Really impressive. In particular the stories of \"the children of Hiroshima\" when you're at the entrance/exit (again) are well worth watching all 6 or so.",
          "This is a very cool monument built into the ground, featuring a mosaic tile for each of the approximately 140,000 victims of the bombing. It's very serene and thought provoking",
          "We came upon this memorial hall on our way out and I'm glad we stopped in. The lighting on the circular walkway down to the circular room created a sense of peace and calm. Memorials of family names are engraved on single tiles and in the middle, is an interesting center",
          "This memorial is beautifully done. From the paper cranes given out by the entrance attendant to spread the universal message of peace to the main circular memorial hall, it is stunning and a fitting tribute to those who lost their lives.",
          "Make sure you visit this memorial hall after seeing the main Peace Museum. It is a circular hall set underground with a water feature at its centre which creates a wonderful sense of calm. In another room you can sit at desks and trawl through an extensive catalogue of memoirs",
          "This museum is an absolute must. The topic is horrible, but it is tackled in such a non-judgmental way that it is completely humbling. A total contrast to the museum in Vietnam dedicated to the victims of the Vietnam war. I was so impressed. Just make sure you allow a good 2-3",
          "Can there be a visit to Japan without seeing the Hiroshima Peace memorial ?! The 90 minute tour of the memorial is an eye-opener and reveals the essence of Japan and what it is today. The innate qualities of industrious , discipline and humility of its people becomes evident",
          "Listen to the stories of the people who were children when the disaster happened, and contemplate on the war, on its use, on life and love.",
          "This memorial puts names and faces to the mass destruction, death and tragedy. It can be difficult to walk through but the central hall balances out the other sections with its large 360 degree display of the physical damage.",
          "I highly recommend this museum, especially if you are into the WWII period. This museum gives you an excellent insight into the atrocities and total destruction of a rather large area of Hiroshima, as well as the massive power of atomic weaponry. This museum gives you an idea of",
          "I found this place amazing, but at the same time, very, very sad. You are able to search for people who were in the city of Hiroshima at the time of the bomb and read about their stories. I found myself wiping away many tears, but it was something I believe everyone should",
          "Of all the memorial sites, this is the most touching. In the basement you see a wall mosaique consisting of 140'000 elements (the number of people that died due to the A-bomb). On the way out you can read and hear the very emotional stories of people that experienced the",
          "Very elegantly, as well as very crisply modern designed memorial dedicated to the people killed in the Hiroshima A bomb attack. I went in the evening, and there was hardly anyone there, which added to the experience of it all. Haunting and beautiful architecture.",
          "Of all the A-Bomb sites I liked this memorial the best. It is a very simple hall focussing on the people impacted by the blast. It contains some basic facts on the event, but all political opinions, rights or wrongs are left to the likes of the Peace Memorial Museum. I found",
          "We all know what happened in Hiroshima over 60 years ago during WW II, but it's another thing to walk in the area of the atomic blast, see the only remaining building and listen to the story of children who were there. Should be experienced by all.",
          "This place is other stop in your visit to the area most damaged by the atomic bomb in 1945. Other opportunity to meditate, to pray if you believe, to think about violence, about the stupidity of war. To cry, if you want to cry. To take another non-smiling photograph.",
          "Certainly worth visiting - entry was free and the facility and central fountain were very nicely done. There's informational tablets, but I think the purpose of the main underground fountain area is meditative.",
          "Its really a heart touching place, you wil be completely broken by seeing those videos and photos. A must visit place.",
          "An underground hall of remembrance which bears the names of the victims is circular so as you stand in the middle you look out at neighborhoods and see the destruction in all directions. It is certainly worth a few tears and a prayer that this will never happen again.",
          "We went the the Hall before the Museum and it gave good information. There is a 15 minute video that recounts a few people's accounts of the before, during and after of the bombing which was insightful. The kids didn't pay close attention but we were all able to sit in comfy",
          "Worth taking some time to visit this site as it is a beautiful memorial to those victims of the bombing. It is a beautifully designed hall paying tribute to the victims. You could miss it as it is tucked away so try and get a map of the park and seek this out as it is really",
          "I noticed first the outside 0815 clock with the water features while I was walking from Genbaku Dome to the Peace Memorial Museum so I decided to stop in. This simple yet very classy and elegant memorial hall pays tribute to those lives that were lost on that fateful morning.",
          "Highly accessible through inner city Tram Service, giving the inner sight of the before, during and after the Hiroshima Bombing. The best war memorial site visited so far. I stood still in front of the 0815 watch for a long while... speechless, breathtaking",

          "Okonomiyaki is a typical Japanese dish, very plentiful and interesting. It is cooked with many ingredients and if you are not hungry it is better to share. Here in Hiroshima there is this place, Okonomimura, which is a floor of a building full of Okonomiyaki restaurants, as if",

          "The only issue is, you can't really tell which one to choose. You're really trying your luck here as there is there are three floors to visit. We were lucky and had a good meal, but it was relatively expensive (2150 yen) for the Okonomiyaki with everything in it.",
          "If you like okonomiyaki (a specialty in Hiroshima and the surrounding areas) this is the place to be! There are lots of places selling it, all of which were very busy when we went. It's probably not to everyone's taste, but it's certainly something everyone should try once.",
          "This is the building full of countless stalls serving Okonomiaki. It might be tough to choose the best one. We might have failed. It's in all the travel guides but somehow it still felt like the locals are also going there for dinner.",
          "Visited here on my visit to Hiroshima based on the reviews on Trip Adviser and did not disappoint. Went to a place called Ron on the 3rd floor, the host was absolutely lovely and walked through the cooking process, just fantastic. Would recommend this place on your visit",
          "I was in Hiroshima on new years day and searching for some Hiroshima Okonomiyaki as it is rumored to be the best in Japan in this prefecture, I searched trip adviser and local cheap eats and found \"Okonomimura\" just around the corner from my hotel and next to a large shopping",
          "What a fine night for an okonomiyaki lover. Friends took me there to compare to \"typical\" okonomiyaki. It was delicious. Hiroshima style or Kansai style? Love them both, I just love okonomiyaki. But the experience of watching this made, so much fun. And have some chicken",
          "The staff is really welcoming and very helpful for visitors that don\u00b4t know how to eat it or even order it.",
          "Okonomimura is a four storey building full of small okonomiyaki restaurants. The choice is a bit overwhelming. My tip would be to try to have a small amount at more than one restaurant to maximise your experience! Most definitely worth a visit while you are in Hiroshima!!",
          "Very a good place, I went there only for a good Okonomiyaki and I ate a very good okonomiyaki and I found something much more like a family than a restaurant... The okonomiyaki with oysters was very very good!!",
          "What an amazing experience! You should definitely come here. We didn't know what okonomiyaki was untill this day and we left absolutely amazed. There's plenty of little restaurants to choose from but they all serve this traditional Hiroshima dish! So worth it!",
          "We were told of this place by a local and we weren't disappointed. Having tried okonomiyaki in all the places we visited in Japan I would have to say this was our favorite and I think the reason for this was that we could have them made with a base of noodles rather than bean",
          "Okonomiyaki is a signature local dish, and this place is full of it. Hence, it is good place for an introduction to Hiroshima food culture. (And personally, I do prefer the Hiroshima version to the Osaka one.)",
          "My friends and I who live in Hiroshima prefer the one close to Peace Park or Cafe Ponte. Another okonomiyaki place I'd recommend is the one in front of Don Quijote",
          "Level 2 to 4 of this building houses tens of okonomiyaki restaurants. We chose the one of level 3 which is located just at the elevator exit. It is operated by two ladies probably mother and daughter. The okonomiyaki is one of the best we had so far - in addition to the regular",
          "While okonomiyaki is available in other parts of Japan, the ones in Hiroshima are especially delicious. This building houses 3 or 4 floors of small bookshops with counters that seat 10-12 people each. Choose one and pick your ingredients, then watch your cook prepare yours",
          "This is a wonderful place to spend a night out! Located just off of Hondori, it is super easy to find. Not only that, but you're not restricted to where to eat in it. Okonomiyaki-mura is one big building and there are 2 floors dedicated to just okonomiyaki restaurants. We",
          "Not only the locals eat this specialty in Hiroshima but also many tourists enjoy it. It's fun to watch the spectacle of the preparation in an authentic atmosphere, where you can choose the ingredients yourself - a real treat...",

          "We visited Okonomimura not once, but twice during our stay in Hiroshima. It was fun watching authentic Hiroshima style okonomiyaki being prepared. It's big enough to accommodate large groups and the okonomiyaki there is delicious!",
          "Great atmosphere as you sit on stools while your food is cooked in front of you. I had both oysters and chicken don. The chicken was good but the oysters were outstanding. People around me were ordering okonomiyaki which looked good too. This place is always packed so you may",
          "This place is full of different stall restaurants which offer the typical omelette cooked in front of you at very very reasonable prices! I loved it here! My omelette was to die for and the owner and the other people eatin with me (I was the only non-Japanese) were so lovely to",
          "There are many restaurants located here, but they all offer the great dish of Okonomiyaki. Nice experience!",
          "We had a delicious okonomiyaki here on the 3rd floor. It was great to watch our meal being cooked right in front of us and then eating the okonomiyaki straight off the hot plate. Topped off with a glass of umeshu on the rocks...excellent.",
          "Went to this place for dinner , got lost coz of wrong google point . The place is right behind parco shopping mall . It's a building which serves Okonomiyaki . There are 4 floors of restaurants , 1st and 2nd floors are always quite busy so we went to 4th floor and found this",
          "Okonomimura is a building with 3 floors full of okonomiyaki shops. We went there not knowing which one was good and just randomly picked one. It turned out pretty good. I guess they all offer similar things. Each shop is just a counter with flat pan which they use to cook right",
          "The very noisy and busy atmosphere was quite charming to my opinion. I love to see people around me enjoying their food, while mine is being made just in front of me :)",
          "There are many places to eat okonomiyaki. If the ground floors places are full, go up 2 or 3 floors to find many more places. If you don't want pork and want chicken, just ask. The meals are huge... get hungry before you get there.",
          "I was tired after a day of long walk across Hiroshima memorials and i was so hungry when my day guide brought me to Okonomimura and we had food at a place called Kyu Chan restaurant. It's in the Hondori Mall, near the hondori station. It's an incredible food, even for a",
          "After reading the reviews on this local delicacy Okonomiyaki on tripadvisor, we decided to give it a go and was so glad we did. A cheap meal but very tasty and a great expeirence having it cooked on the hotplate in front of you. After getting the lift to the second floor, you",

          "If you like something a bit different come to this busy, fast-paced tower of fast carbs and eat your pancaked bacon and noodles at (or even from, in some cases) the same counter it was cooked on. Even for a family of 5 it's worth waiting as the crammed in seats change quickly",
          "Was difficult to find as there are many restaurants of this type very close together. We went here becuase of the high number of reviews. The staff were welcoming but due to language challenges it was difficult to explain that we wanted a vegetarian option. Food was freshly",
          "Okonomimura was about four floors of Okonomiyaki stalls. My husband and I went after the lunch rush, so it was pretty dead on most of the floors (we even caught one stall owner taking a nap on the seats!). We chose the stall that had the most people sitting for a meal, and we",
          "We were told to visit Okonomimura to sample the Okonomiyaki which we were advised had to be tried as it is a local famous dish associated with Hiroshima. The building itself is not very welcoming, to be honest, and looks a bit tacky and run down but when we got out of the lift",
          "We were a little skeptical when we went inside to sample the local \"pancake\" but our friend who had lived in Japan was very persuasive that we had to give it a try. Boy, was he right! This is like a food court but it looked like most of the small little \"courts\" were offering",
          "Went to okonomimura to sample some local Okonomiyaki. It wasn't what I expected inside visually but the food was nice! It's a food court of sorts with lift and stair access. There was about 6 shops on each floor to chose from . On entering a level I felt a little pressured to go",
          "Pancakes galore! This place has 3 floors of pancake stalls. We went to the top floor and had the deluxe pancake which had all the trimmings. So incredibly delicious.one was plenty for two of us. A must-try for any newcomer to Hiroshima.",

          "We stumbled on this gem by accident but would definitely recommend a meal here. Okanomyaki is made on a large hot plate right in front of you. To observe the skill of the chefs is worth the price of the food. The bonus is the delicious outcome of the culinary performance,",

          "We had heard many top reactions to this typical Hiroshima dish, okonomi..., although you will find it also in other cities. We went to this n\u00b04 on the list, Okonomi mura, located at different floors, and apparently also with different, unrelated, businesses. They all serve food,",
          "We had heard about okonomiyaki on various tv programs before coming to Japan, so on our day trip down to Miyajima Island and Hiroshima we decided coming to Okonomimura was a must! We decided to have dinner on the 2nd floor, we were served by a lovely lady and her son, very",
          "They take their Okonomiyaki very seriously in Hiroshima and Okonomimura is its spiritual home. Hiroshima style Okonomiyaki have less batter, have layerd ingredients and more cabbage than the Osaka version. Okonomimura has three floor of Okonomiyaki vendors, with each floor",
          "You can find here 3 floors of food stalls of traditional Hiroshima style Okonomiyaki. This was my first experience to the dish so cannot compare but I enjoyed every piece of my dish. This place is conveniently located on the next bus stop from the A-Bomb site and Peace Memorial",
          "The place is awesome, many small teppenyaki booth, one after the other. It's also a great experience to see the chef cook your food directly in front of you. Problem here is that you never know if you are picking the right/best/most tasty booth, because there is no indication",
          "Hiroshima has it's own style of okonomiyaki where the ingredients are layered instead of mixed together. I was traveling with my parents who had never tried okonomiyaki before. Okonomimuri is located walking distance from the peace Park and also has a dedicated JR maple loop",

          "Easy to find and like others have said, make sure to go upstairs. This place has that casual feel and my teenagers enjoyed having the food cooked in front of them. Fast, not expensive, comfort food. I don't eat meat, so they left off the pork, which was not hard to",

          "It's an experience you apparently should have in Hiroshima but this is hangover food or a late night snack. The Japanese eat it after drinking, which is probably the best idea. It's basically the Japanese equivalent of a kebab!",

          "We grew to love okonomiyaki (a Japanese type of pancake/omelette) while in Japan. This place will have your head spinning with the choices of the different styles. People were queueing at some stalls. Customers sit on bar stools around a large hotplate and you watch the chef",
          "Great place, and proper Japanese eating experience. The building comprises any number of okonomiyaki eateries. Each one is a cook and helpers behind a hot counter who cooks your meal in front of you. We had no idea how to choose which place to eat at so we just plumped for a guy",
          "Spread over three floors, there are at least 30 okonomiyaki places. Very nice to see them preparing it right in front of you. It was a bit difficult to find a place with seats available, as many seats were reserved.",

          "If you are up for a bit of real fun, try this place. It is not as simple as it seems to find it because it's poorly marked, but follow the directions in other reviews and you will track it down. The entry point is a little confusing to, I'll admit, but once you get in, it's",

          "We went there by accident. In the building there are a lot of restaurants serving Okonomiyaki. Unlike in Tokyo, where it is cooked on the table, here it is cooked on long bar style grill. Look out for the booth 'HUMICHAN'. They have a secret sauce, unlike some restaurant that",

          "Okonomiyaki can be viewed as the Japanese pizza. Hiroshima's style has soba in it. You can choose to make your own or find a restaurant with the chef making it in front of you. I decided to try the first one I saw on 4th Floor and ordered the seafood version. It was pure joy",
          "Good collection of stalls where you usually can see the dish made. However, it was my first okonomiyaki and it seemed a hearty meal but a bit boring and bland, plus it cost more than ramen yet seemed to have less of the good bits.",
          "This place is super easy to find, and I think that contributes to its popularity with tourists. We found the okonomiyaki here bland in comparison to other places we had eaten - however it may be a matter of luck of the draw on which counter you dine at. We preferred",
          "This food court over several floors is a great way to get started with the peculiar and savoury dish of okonomiyaki. We picked one to the right of the elevator on the 2nd floor. They have an orange flag. Great food, great service, and a wonderful experience.",

          "There are two principal styles of Okonomiyaki \u2013 Osaka style and Hiroshima style. If one wants to experience the latter, then an excellent place is Okonomi-Mura \u2013 an establishment of about 20 independent okonomiyaki vendors spread over three different floors. Each of the stalls",
          "I had okonomiyaki before near the train station. It was good. I decided to try the 4 floor food court near Hondori after reading some reviews. It was great. I walked through all floors and many were full, some not so much. I decided to stop at one on the third floor with what",

          "We ate here on consecutive nights while in Hiroshima, which is very rare for us as we like to try different places while travelling. I've tried Okonomiyaki a few times since eating here and nothing comes close. Looks like I'll have to come back to Hiroshima to get my fix!",
          "Obviously such a building that is dedicated to okonomiyaki may immediately have one assume that it must only be targeted at tourists who know none the better. But we found it to be a nice experience. Firstly, we did not make any reservation but it was not a problem at",

          "You can find here mostly awesomes okonomiyakis of japan for a cheap price, even the portions are big so you can share it. I highly recomment this place if you are a tourist and if you want to enjoy some japans traditional food. There is two most knowed styles of okonomiyaki",
          "There are loads of okonomiyaki stalls in here each of which will want you to eat with them. Wander through before deciding what appeals to you. Would recommend not eating the whole thing no matter how delicious as it is incredibly filling and will induce a food coma!",
          "After a bit of figuring out where the entrance to the place was, we took the lift to the top floor of the grills and worked down. We eventually recognised one grill from Only In Japan YouTube show and were not disappointed. All the food is made right before you almost theatre",
          "Do not be fooled by the building's unattractive look. We tried a joint called Shin-Chan and ordered their best-selling version of okonomiyaki. The staff are very professional and totally efficient. They cook, clean and serve; and still manage to be alert to our needs.",
          "There were 25 stalls on two to four storeys in an old small building. This place was for tourists, but I felt convenient to find an Okonomiyaki restaurant. There were numerous places in Hiroshima city, so it would be very hard to find the best one. Local people said stalls in",

          "Don't leave Hiroshima without eating Okonomyia. We went twice to Motomarou on the second floor and ordered number 4 both times. Have them place the food on the hot grill in front of you to add to the eating experience. I promise you will definitely enjoy the food and eating",

It was very quiet when we reached around 6pm and most of the shops had no customers. We picked Daimarudou (\u5927\u4e38\u5802) on the 4th floor",
          "I had gone dinning to 4th Floor in a place named Yakidouraku, \u713c\u9053\u697d. The food was good, okonomiyaki (japanese pizza). The only problem in this place is that the ambient is very familiar and some people feels like home, and they smoke. I had need to ask to a client that please go",

          "The Osaka-style Okonomiyaki is familiar to many, but the Hiroshima-style was something I never tasted before. Therefore I was very keen to find Okonomimura, which had gotten good reviews. It is a multiple floor place, with several Okonomiyaki stalls. The atmosphere is great. Me",
          "We only had 3 nights in Hiroshima and what a lovely city. Certainly brings it home to you while staying here. We ate in this restaurant and the food was very good and the prices also good. With a warm and freindly welcome from the staff we managed to overcome the language",
          "Most of us in North America have at least one okonomiyaki restaurant in our city, however few people get a chance to try the Hiroshima style. Whereas regular (Osaka style) okonomiyaki is a pancake like patty with items mixed in, the Hiroshima style is layered, with noodles,"

Maybe it was because we do not speak Japanese, but it would be nice to have a little more interaction with the staff. Overall, nice and courteous.",

English-friendly, you may find some spots are better than others, but the general level of quality is great. Some locations do offer alternatives to the signature dish, but if you pop in, your goal should be Okonomiyaki.",

Okonomyaki is very tasty and you can add a wide variety of options to yours. Servings are big and 2 between 3 was good. Service was great and each site has its own character.",

Ron and his GF cook the most amazing food and have so many tips for things to eat and see in Hiroshima. Lots of locals dining there to so you know it\u2019s good.

          "We chose a random stall on the 3rd floor, that apparently was even  recommended by TripAdvisor (not Ron's, expensive and crowded) and the food we ate was amazing! Around 1100  - 1400 jpy per Pancake, but really good. However it might seem filling, but it is not that much.",
          "If you like okonomiyaki and happen to be in Hiroshima, then this is your place, look no further. Okonomiyaki is sold on three floors, you can pick and choose the place where you want to try and eat this dish. Don\u2019t expect fancy places, just typical eateries Japanese style.",
          "This place should be highlighted to tourists for its very tasteful okonomiyaki that you wouldn\u2019t taste in Tokyo nor in any other parts of Japan. 2 thumbs up!",

          "Good place to try original Osaka's okonomiyaki",

          "The food is pretty good and the experience is what you'd expect (cramped, loud, etc). Surprisingly low tourist to local ratio. Note that we saw one of the more prominent stalls in the (English) reviews asks guests to write reviews in exchange for free stuff.",
          "This is a building with many small stores serving the same thing - Okonomiyaki. We tried Sarashina Okonomiyaki at level 2. One interesting feature of this store is you get to eat the food directly from the hotplate with just the metal \u2026",

They seemed incredibly hospitable, had an English menu, and were packed when we arrived. We ordered a green onion and egg pancake with no pork and an oyster fries pancake without pork and with kimchi. Both were amazing!",
          "Three floors with about 10 \"restaurants\" per floor. All of them cook okonomiyaky in different versions. I ordered one without sea food but they didn't clean enough tepanyaki and it tasted like if It were full of sea food. However my firemen's really enjoyed it.",
          "So many choices, all of which are good.",
          "This was so delicious. Japanese BBQ sauce over a crepe, green onions, pork, egg, and some noodles. There was a place to hang my purse and an English menu. Staff was very attentive and counter very clean. Wine was good and meal was very affordable.",

          "This is a must if you like okonomiyaki at all. We stopped at the third floor, but you can't go wrong on any of them. Even if you've had some okonomiyaki in Osaka or Tokyo, you need to go here because the style is different. Some would say \u2026",
          "3 levels of okonomyaki restaurants, what more could you ask for? Got there just after 6 and it was already busy however by 630 you could barely move so get there early. We ate at RON based on other reviews and their seafood soba was delicious. Big serves as well so make sure you go there hungry.",
          "Loved it, staff were great, English menu, about 850 yen for basic and 1000 yen for additional items",

My suggestion: share a single one at each vendor to try different tastes/styles.",

He\u2019s been doing it for over 20 years and although he smokes and drinks while prepping the Okonomiyaki, he\u2019s a true pro. Worth a visit!",
          "A bit touristy. There's four floors worth of okonomiyaki stores. There are better options in Hiroshima city but still worth checking it out. You will find it difficult to select a store.",
          "Super fun so many cool places in here and the prices are decent",
          "This is the place to go if you want Hiroshima style okonomiyaki! \nIf you go upstairs you can find many somewhat cramped izakayas that all serve okonomiyaki. \nIt might seem full, but you have to just walk through and look for an open spot.\nYou get to sit close to the action and experience a real authentic Japanese meal.",

          "Many floors of Okonomiyaki stalls. Many of the stalls close for a break after lunch Nadia reopen at 5pm. If you go during this time then it won't be too busy.\n\nI tried the okonomiyaki from Suigun on the 3rd floor and it was good.",

          "I was told to try this place by a close friend and boy oh boy it did not disappoint. All the meals are cooked and served on a grill right in front of you. You can pick one right of the menu or be a little creative and make your own. Either way you will not leave disappointed or hungry.",

          "Okonomiyaki in Japan - Hiroshima style! Can be crowded even with several floors of different vendors!",
          "Would not have found this place if it was not for our hotel! It is quite hidden and the food is on the second floor, there wasn't any queue but just sit down as pleased. They also do not allow sharing, which would have given 5 stars but wanted money on wasted food. Overall good.",

          "Very nice and fresh food",

          "This is the best village ever!\nYou can find all sorts of Okonomiyaki here! \n*Please note that Okonomiyaki was originally from Hiroshima, and what Osaka has is called \"Osaka Yaki\", which is nothing similar to the beautiful Okonomiyaki of \u2026",

          "So many stalls to try Okonomitaki. I went to Shinchan (\u65b0\u3061\u3083\u3093) and it was delicious. Everything everywhere looked good, you won\u2019t regret stopping by. Probably no help available in English.",
          "Incredibly and interesting pancake with some noodles, seafood, meats , vegetables and Japanese sauce!!\nReally worth to try and couldn't stop having it.\nThere's menus in multiple languages, so no worry to order what ever you want if you are a foreigner visitors like me.",
          "Good food!",
          "Just so goddam good!",
          "It\u2019s delicious. But not special. You can feel like the asian atmosphere.",
          "This place was a little overwhelming. With multiple floors of many okonomiyaki stores, it was very difficult to identify which are good and which are bad so I had selected one with a lot of people already sitting around the grill. I'm not \u2026",
          "Advertised as the holy land of okonomiyaki, however while up to 6-7 years ago was still fine, now spaces are cramped, dirty, amd quality very very low. Search for better places in town!",

          "Three floors of different food stalls so it wont take long to find a spot",
          "Visited this place 2 years ago and still consider it one of our best meals. Visited as a couple late at night and were able to find a place to eat. It is a little creepy to walk through, but provides an authentic okonomoyaki experience! Would recommend to anyone visiting Hiroshima.",

          "Really tasty food, really quick.",
          "You have to go here if you are in Hiroshima. The okonomiyaki here is delicious, and it is a cool place to see several stores make the dish. Still, I do have to recommend Lopez\u2019s as the best place in town.",
          "If there's one place you have to eat at Hiroshima it's here. 6 floor building with different vendors making their own version of Okonomiyaki. A bit touristy , but worth checking out.",
          "Not the biggest fan of the dish. It was very greasy and overwhelming as a lunch. I can imagine it will be a better experience if you are very hungry, but none of our group finished the meal and enjoyed it as much as the other dishes we \u2026",
          "The best Okonomiyaki in Japan. The restaurant on the 3rd floor was delicious. When we arrived we did not like the place at all.  We were about to leave when we saw a couple of British tourists that told us they loved that place so much it \u2026",

          "Awesome atmosphere and so many delicious options! We chose the Michelin Restaurant, Takenoko on the third floor and although it was full when we got there, it was definitely worth the wait. Full of flavour, generous serving size and speedy service, we will definitely be back.",
          "Wonderful Japanese food, first time I have tried Yaki and it\u2019s something I\u2019d eat again and again. I went twice because I liked the atmosphere and vibe. Some friendly vendors who have English writing menus but there are a few dirty vendors \u2026",
          "So many small Okonomi yaki restaurant. If you don't have detail purpose of restaurant, anyway you go and find your favorite. Famous shop close around 20:00 or 21:00, but some of them open until 23:00.",
          "Great food! Kind of pricey (weak) drinks.",
          "We went and ate at Suigun (one of many micro restaurants in the building), a great okonomiyaki place one of the best I have ever had for a very reasonable price. Suigun has been here for ever. Highly recommend it , quite kid friendly too. When you are in Hiroshima and want to try genuine okonomiyaki this is the place to go.",
          "THE place to go for okonomiyaki. You will find dozens of stalls where you can eat this awesome dish. In the top floor we found one willing to do a vegetarian variation for us. Note though that it'll be done on the same grill, after a wipe or two.",
          "This building is filled w numerous Japanese pancake places... They r very good and filling because of the ramen used.  Unless u r a big eater, a pancake to share by two with drinks should be sufficient.",
          "Floors and floors of okonomiyaki",
          "An interesting place full of okonomiyaki restaurants. You should consider it as a japanese type fast food center. Still there are much better okonomiyaki restaurants in Hiroshima.",

          "Don\u2019t know much about okonomiyaki? Having a hard time choosing what kind to eat? This is the place to go! Over 25 vendors across 3 floors it is literally the Okonomi tower. Go for the deluxe seafood on the second floor. Deelish!",
          "Great food",
          "It's quite a thrill watching them cook right in front of you. You are given a small plate, but the dish is simply pushed from where they cook it to you. It is kept warm while you eat.",
          "Delicious food, friendly staff",
          "Very annoying when there are to many of the same shops crammed together. Just don\u2019t know which is good. So sat down eat and left. Had to be a local to enjoy this probably.",

          "Delicious definitely recommend it!",
          "Now this is what an Okonomiyaki restaurant is supposed to be like. Three floors filled with foodstalls each operated by different chefs with their own style. Nothing fancy. Just you, a couple of locals & tourists around hot plates. All \u2026",

The floors have lots of character, and it is ready to steer clear of stalls where foreigners sit: what's the fun in that? Sonia was more like an using dish with some sides, and fumigant was more traditional. Both tasted great.",

          "Not a big fan of Okonomiyaki, but this place is just amazing. It's a bit hidden with elevators taking you to a number of Okonomiyaki places crowded together, and I personally wouldn't be able to tell the difference between each one.

          "Mitaki Temple was supposed to be an easy way to conclude our stay in Hiroshima with an \u00abOK\u00bb last visit. It turned out to be one of our top temple sites in all of Japan, along with the Kinkakuji Temple (Golden temple) in Kyoto, although admittedly very different in nature. Why",

          "So maybe autumn would be best but a few sections have attractive cherry blossoms this time of year. The park stretches up the valley to the ropeway, so if you're going on that, you'll see it (one of the paths up the mountains goes from here as well). However, there are trails",
          "Walked around the park and by moving in to the unusual parts of the woods we managed to get away from the crowds. You need to look for the walks that aren't going directly up Mt Misen, they are usually busy, but the others are much quieter. A keen walker could spend a few weeks",
          "We were here last November and again now. I think Momijidani Park is much more beautiful in autumn, especially with the japanese maple foilage then. Having said this, an area of this park has quite a few beautiful sakura in bloom today when we revisited.",
          "We stayed for two nights on Miyajima Island and on our second day the weather was a little grey and drizzly, so we were unsure what to do. We took a walk around the shops, and then thought we would take a walk around the park. Although the day was a little damp the trees gave us",
          "I almost not noticed that there was a park ahead me when I thought I got lost looking for momijidani park, looking for Mt. Misen cable car. The park was quiet, almost no person. Do not went here after 6PM it would be dark and creepy",

          "We missed this in our last Sept trip so decided to come this time. Add this to another must-see if you go to Miyajima island. This temple is on the walking loop of Miyajima and much quieter than the main shrines/temples nearer the waterfront/promenade. You can reach this",
          "While Itsukushi-Jinja is the famous attraction on Miyajima, here is my favourite location on the island. It is compact in size, easy to get to, and has many of the best elements of Shingon Buddhist temples to be seen in Japan. The pathway with the Jizo ( small monk statues with",
          "My favorite spot on Miyajima island turned out to be this temple. Far less crowded than the throngs certain to be hanging out at the Torii gates for unending selfies, this temple is a spot for peaceful reflection. If you find the right road, it is likely a 30-40 minute walk",
          "There is a little path way just off the main stairs to the temples. It has hundreds of little monk statues with beanies on their heads. Each statue is a unique representation of a monk who lived there",

          "This is a must see if you go to Miyajima island. It felt less crowded than down by the waterfront and the temple was lovely and peaceful. It is a steep climb up quite a lot of steps. But it\u2019s worth it. The little buddhas with the wooden hats is special. On the way down we",
          "This temple is on the walking loop of Miyajima and is a lot quieter than the main shrine on the coast. You can reach this temple through the beautiful Momijidani Park or go the more direct route past Itsukashima Shrine. The temple is actually multiple temples on various levels",

          "I visited at a time when the weather was good and not many people were around. This enabled me to take some very Interesting photos and video. Even though I've seen more than my share of temples and shrines this whole complex really Impressed me. What stands out Is the variety",

          "You've come to Miyajima to see the Torii Gate, but walk up the hill to see this temple while you are here. It is huge, has lots of buildings, statues, prayer wheels, hidden corners, great views of the torii gate and shrine..... It may turn out to be your favorite shrine in",
          "This is an ancient, splendid, and huge temple complex and one of the finest in the world (I have seen so far). There are halls, pagodas and statuaries, connected by winding paths amongst beautifully tended gardens. Everywhere you look, there are more places to explore, and most",
          "Make sure to stop at Information Office to get map since there is so much to see. Some of my favorites where 1000 Fudo Images and Maniden Bodaisho Room. There are many Buddhis deities. After spending ten days in Japan, it becomes hard to keep track.",

          "Daishoin was a lot quieter than other places on Miyajima, possibly due to being on the other side of the village and uphill a bit. It is a beautiful temple, both the buildings and the gardens, and there were some very interesting features. The main steps had prayer wheels all",
          "Our legs were almost worn out by the time we arrived here, after climbing to Mt Misen and then walking back down. This temple is not that far from the waterfront and is a beautiful Buddhist temple. The little stream nearby makes this a very peaceful serene spot. Most of the",

          "What a worthwhile walk this was to this magnificent Buddhist temple. Whilst only 10 min from the water front & main activity, there were few tourists venturing to the Temple which was nice in that getting around was simple. On the side of the hill, there are some steps to",
          "Imagine having to hike up this mountain and making sure that this pot is furnished with a fire forever. Someone has to keep this fire going and it has been going for 12 centuries. Where in the world has such traditions? It is so impressive that the people here display such",

          "After 10 days in Japan we had already visited many temples and shrines, but this complex takes your breath away, with six 'halls', a cave, and literally thousands of figures/images. As you visit one 'hall' after another, you keep thinking it can't get any better, but it does. It",

          "The temple is well maintained , the fire is burning; its obviously very old , and the info board tells you the fires been going for nearly 1200 years, but there's no insight to the monk who founded the temple, why flame is the motif, etc. Worth a visit, but do your research",
          "I love history and have visited many temples throughout Asia, this one blew my mind!! I left this place feeling super spiritual, connected to the past, nature and the universe. I can't recommend this experience enough!!",

          "Do not miss Daishoin Temple if you visit Miyajima. This was our favorite temple that we saw in Japan. It is about a ten minute walk from the main tourist area on Miyajima, and worth the extra effort to see it. The grounds are lovely. There are hundreds of unique stone statues",
          "Even if you have visited many temples on your Japan trip, this is yet another unique and beautiful one.",
          "Located at the base of Mount Misen, Daishoin Temple is worth visiting. The building and statues are beautiful.",

          "Amazing temple in a beautiful location with excellent views, interesting history and so much to discover! If you are in the area anyway, go explore! Absolutely worth it!",
          "Miyajima is a destination for thousands of tourists who have just time for visiting O-torii Gate and the close Itsukushima Shrine. Few tourists have time enough to visit something even more beautiful. So if you have more time here is a destination unknown to many: Daisho-in",

          "We went to Daishoin Temple after visiting the great Torii. We walked north and uphill to Daishoin in 10 minutes. The temple is beautiful and peaceful. The views at the bay are also beautiful. We spent about one hour there. Recommended.",

          "Most people don't come this far up the hill. Big mistake, the temples at nice, and especially the lovely statues on the hill are great, but this place has a stunning view of the bay, especially if you come around Hanami, or in the fall.",

          "We stumbled across this temple while walking around Miyajima Island. I didn't have very high expectations, but I was proven wrong. This place is definitely worth a visit. Perhaps I was influenced by the lack of crowds of tourists, but it was a lovely place to walk around and",
          "The walk and the climb to the temple is more than worth it. Especially the tiny cute idols that you spot along the way are so adorable. This temple cannot be missed and is the charm of the Miyajima Island !",
          "People come to Miyajima to see the Shinto shrine and Mt. Misen and it would be a shame if they missed this hidden gem! There are several temples in this complex, each with its own treasures of buddhist sculptures and architecture, but I particularly liked the Jizo garden -",
          "This is a beautiful little temple complex adjoining the outskirts of the town of Miyajima. What sets this one apart is the humor and good nature inherent the statuary. I don't understand enough of the religious aspects of the place to say anything meaningful, but here we have",
          "I consider it a must to visit during in the island; take time to enter and see every corner of it, great surprises, for instance, at the upper level you could hear a water from the river while seeing a great view of the island bay and Hiroshima port at the bottom.",
          "This is a large temple that one can reach from the hiking trail back down from the summit of Mt Misen. They have public bathrooms, and they also had tea when I was there. The large temples in the countryside are always interesting.",
          "This temple was much less busy than the one nearer the coast yet is only ten minutes away from it. It will only take 30 minutes to visit but is beautiful and very peaceful.",
          "This place is incredible. A real complex with few buldings and smaller temples. It's worth the visit to this island. Warmly recommended.",
          "If you don't mind a few steps, you will like to visit this temple. It is very unusual and you will be surprised to see so many small figurines all wearing an hat. Not too many people go there but it is on the way to the Mount Misen.",
          "Daisho-in is a fascinating Buddhist temple at the base of Mount Misen with numerous statues and spinning 'prayer' wheels or bells. Only a few minutes walk from the shopping areas and Itsukushima. I'd definitely recommend visiting Daisho-in should you visit to Miyajima island.",
          "A really wonderful find, this temple is hidden away from the crowded areas of the island, up a road and many stairs. Worth it even just to see the autumn leaves.",
          "It is worth taking the time to visit this temple even if you are suffering from temple fatigue. It is beautifully situated, close to town and in lovely gardens. I especially like the garden of little 'beanie men'.",

          "We visited a number of temples especially around Kyoto and Tokyo but this was our favourite. It's located about 10/15 mins walk outside of Miyajima which contributes to the lack of visitors and the peace. The buildings themselves are very interesting but not spectacular - its",
          "My husband and I enjoyed strolling through this temple, visiting each of the buildings in its complex, and admiring the many Buddhas (more than a thousand) that line the paths. Located on a hillside, with the forest behind it, the Daisho-in Temple offered a lovely spot to",
          "Prestigious temple founded in the 12th century. Lining the steps to the temple are 500 Rakan Statues, all the images have unique facial expressions. Was lucky enough to watch a Buddhist ceremony on Saturday afternoon.",
          "Please walk to this temple and spend some time exploring it and understanding its story. We thought it might be our favourite temple in Japan. There won't be crowds here! If stairs are a big problem, then catch a taxi up. We were moved by the statues wearing knitted hats that",
          "A little walk from the centre of Miyajima and the famous gate makes this beautiful temple much quieter and more peaceful. Large and spread out on the side of a lush, green mountain this is really worth a visit and easy enough to find a quiet spot. Well worth the short,",
          "We made it up lots of steps and found the temple as described in the pamphlet an old man had handed us en route. Interesting to see the shrine with all sorts of Dalai LLama photos etc, and we liked the football league appearance of the woolly hatted umpteen statues. Immaculate",
          "We ended our hike here and it was perfect. A relaxing, calming and spiritual end to our beautiful journey through nature.",
          "Daisho-in is slowly stealing the protagonism of Itsukushima Jinja. While all guide books still mention the red floating shrine as the star, everyone who I spoke to about Miyajima Island told me to visit this temple. I don\u2019t think Daisho-in can be given the titles of \u2018off the",
          "This temple and its series of shrines (not to mention the little figures with a where's Wally hats!), was the highlight of our visit to the island. The shrines and Temple buildings had a real sense of the sacred, and there was a real peace to the place, not withstanding the",
          "I didn't really plan on arriving at this place, I just happened upon it while wandering around. I would say that it is one of the underrated places of Miyajima, no doubt because it is overshadowed by the floating Tori gate. In fact, I personally found this temple more",
          "Ended up on Miyajima during a break in a business trip. Didn't know what to expect so I just starting walking around town. Found the temple and had a good time exploring everything on the grounds. It was early in the day so it was very peaceful. There are lots of steps so keep",

          "Beautiful Buddhist temple nested in the lower slopes of Mount Misen, amid a forest of maple trees. Place of pilgrimage established since 806, it is divided into many different parts. Most buildings have been fairly recently renovated as a typhoon had inflicted heavy damage in",
          "We did it through Misen, it is nice walking path, doable for small kids (8 and 10 years). Daishoin makes really impression, worth to see!",
          "A sprawling temple withe an amazing amount of shrines. Like everything else in japan it involves steps but worth the effort.",
          "We are not into temples. but the temple grounds are interesting to go around. Old wood architecture details are interesting to just look at. Many small details along the path. worth a visit.",
          "Most people come to Miyajima to visit Itskushima. While that is totally worthwhile, you might want to wander up the hill a little when you emerge from the exit of Itsukushima and look for Daishoin. This is a temple complex which has about a dozen individual temples to",
          "Very nice temple, with live prayer sessions, accompanied by the priest on the taiko drum. Lots of small stone statues, that somehow made me happy.",
          "This is clearly a very spiritual place for many pilgrims and the resident monks. There are many beautiful shrines and parts thereof, all interconnected by beautiful and sprawling gardens. However, I think the simplicity and greater spiritual importance of Reikado Hall, much",
          "The temple on the island is a must. It is beautiful and set back in a nice wooded area which is quiet and very picturesque. There are lots of things to see and do within this area so make sure you make time to see it all.",
          "Beautiful serene temple visit on a mountain side. Lots of hidden gems ! This is a must see in Miyajima",
          "From my point of view, this beautiful temple is one of the most beautiful sites I have seen in Japan (and as my local friend said, I already visited top 3 in Japan). This is unique, authentic and not very crowded with tourists, since is a little far from the main focus points in",
          "This temple was very humbling, there are many things to see within it. ensure that you look through every nook and crevice when you go so you don't miss a thing. I'd recommend taking the cable care up to Mount Misen and taking the walking path down to this temple.",
          "I thought this was one of the most diverse temples of the trip. Lots of photogenic details both large and small.",
          "We missed this temple the first time we went to Miyajima, but we didn't miss it this time. It is really a good experience and the temple itself differs from many others we've seen until now. I would recommend climbing to the temple using the side way on the left as it is",
          "The small monks statue along the temple are so cute. A must visit temple in Miyajima Island. It has different feel from other temples. Walking on foot the steps up to the temple is a good exercise.",
          "This place isn't advertised as much as the other locations on Miyajima, but it is easily the best. You could spend hours here and still not see it all. Not only is there tons of interesting cultural things to see, but there are also monks who actively live and worship here. It",
          "Just up hill from the floating Tori is this temple with a short steep climb. Its devoted to children, so everything is happy there, and its very uplifting to visit. Some of the most unique and cute budah statues you will ever see. Bring a camera, because you will be taking lots",
          "One of the best temples I've see in Japan. We were there on the right day to see the \"Hiwatarishiki\" festival that is held twice a year and during which the monks, after a lenghty ritual, end up walking on hot coals. It was pretty amazing! Definitely a must see if you're in",
          "What a way to enjoy an hour. Take your time, spin the sutra scrolls on the stairs, peak in for the mandala, and the cave below. This is a great relaxation area, and photo opps galore! We enjoyed ourselves immensely, and there is free tea as well. Cold and overcast our trip,",
          "This temple is sooooo pretty. Make sure you spin the metal wheels as you walk up/down the stairs....it's said to give the blessings as if you had read the sutras. Keep an eye out for all the statues! There's a ton....some in the strangest of places. Relatively quiet as its a bit",
          "Often guarded by one of the island's wild deer Daisho-in is a wonderful shrine that you should reserve time for in your visit to the island of Miyajima. Thee are hundreds of little Jizo Bosatsu statues wearing red and white caps, which is quite something to behold. Try to get",
          "While the Itsukushima shrine takes the spotlight on a trip to Miyajima, we were appalled that we almost missed the stunning experience of this temple. The scenic ascent to the top, the 1000 deities, the symbolsm filled stairways, the temples at the top. Do make it out here. Well",
          "There are many temples in Japan and after a while they all begin to look the same but this was by far our favourite and one not to be missed. It's a bit further out than the main sites of Miyajima so it doesn't get crowded which is great. You can walk the few blocks to the",

          "Up the hill a bit from Ikutsushima shrine (one path to the top of the mountain goes alongside, while another path goes through the woods to the cable car), this complex continues to climb the hill with a scattering of temples and many statues and small shrines in between",

          "This place was interesting in that the fire to boil the water in the iron cauldron has been lit for centuries and never allowed to die. There are cups in which to drink the hot water from. It has a romantic significance to it but I can't remember what it was.",
          "This place is mainly visited by independent tourist. Groups do not go there and therefore is not very crowded. The complex is delightful and it has many different status of Buddha. It is very peaceful. It relaxes you very much. You get here by walking three blocks from",
          "I wandered to Daishoin temple after Misen walking path and there's a very peaceful and serene vibe here. It was interesting to explore around. Have some time to pray here. Good for your soul.",

          "Too many people give this a miss, as it's a little off the main track and involves (easy) hill climbing. Don't, it's no problem to find with the simplest of tourist maps, and when you get there, there are a number of temples and shrines nestling amongst colourful pine trees and",
          "A wonderful spot, full of many hidden treasures, well worth the walk up the hill. Worth spending an hour or two in this one shrine.",
          "We decided to visit Daishoin because of the great reviews on Trip Advisor. We were glad we did. We took the nice walk from the shrine through the island's neighborhoods. We visited on a Sunday so there were probably more people there than normal, as there were services",
          "Every visit to Daishoin is a wonder, starting from the ancient wooden gates, up the stairs while meditating with the use of the prayer wheels, and to the different temple buildings. One's visit is enhanced with a minimal understanding of the significance of the different",
          "I absolutely loved this area and temple. There was a ceremony going on and it was most interesting. Lots of steps to climb so be informed. It is peaceful and interesting. A must if you go to Miyajima Island. High on my priority list!!! Go!!",

          "Daishoin Temple is just a 10 minutes walk from Itsukushima Shrine, it is located at the foot of the Mount Misen, and is the famous Buddhist temple in Miyajima. You need to climb flight of stairs to reach various worship halls and statues. There are Mani Wheels (prayer wheels)",
          "One of the best temples we visited in Japan, basically due to the huge amount of details on the garden all around. Just few people, ideal to spend a couple of hours quietly. It's free, so let a tip at your exit to mantain it.",
          "This is a very old buddhist estabishment. There are many statues and halls tucked away in small hills. One can spend a couple of hours taking pictures and enjoying scenery from its vantage point. Its about 10 minutes leisure walk from Itsukushima shrine",
          "It is a Shingon Buddhist Temple with a collection of halls on the side of the mountain. You need to climb a long flight of steps to different sections. Not many tourists. Worth the walk from the Shrine.",
          "it is not a big temple but has full charms as a Japanese temple. Liked small stone monks and bell, cave, etc. It is different from other Japnese shrines that I have been visited. You can also hike toward Mt. Misen from this temple. However, the road is a bit tough compared to",
          "This temple is only a short walk from Itsukushima Shrine but is not as well-known so always seems tranquil. Lining the staircase leading to the temple are 500 Rakan statues with unique expressions and poses. As you climb the stairs you can spin the row of metal wheels inscribed",

          "This temple is worth the little walk. I was happy to get information in English in a very informative leaflet with map and information on all the different buildings and traditions and history. Learned a lot more than in the Itsukushima Shrine. I definitely recommend a visit!",
          "I didn't do much research before I headed to Miyajima so when I stumbled upon Daishoin, I was blown away. Located less than 10mins away from the main tourist areas, Daishoin is easily missed but that would be a huge mistake. The complex is quite stunning with multiple areas for",

          "This was the second site we wanted to see while on miyajima Island after the tori gate. It was a short walk to the temple up a bit of a hill but when we arrived we could already see it was nice. There are little Buddhas smiling at you from the entrance. You can go straight to",
          "The shrine is really nice, with lots of details to see, with lots of maple trees and really photogenic. If you go to Miyajima, you can't miss it!",

          "I have been to countless temples and shrines in Japan and this one is by far my favorite!! It was the most unique, most beautiful one I've been to. There is no entrance charge (but you should still throw some money in the offering boxes) but this is surprisingly one of the best",
          "I usually don't write reviews for tourist attractions, but I had to for this one. By the point we arrived to this temple we were a bit tired from temples and shrines but this one is different. This free of charge, on the way to mt.misen temple complex has many smaller temples",

          "This was one of the best temples we saw on our trip to Japan. You are welcomed with a nice brochure in English that will guide you through the complex. Virtually all of the buildings are open for viewing and most for photography as well. For some, you don't even have to take",
          "Our family of 5 (with 3 kids 8, 8, 10) walked from the Giant torii gate to Daisho-in. The walk was pleasant and the kids did not complain. The view along the way was spectacular. The shade from the trees made the way quite comfortable. It is free to walk around Daisho-in. There",

          "The Daisho-in Temple covers a large area in Miyajima and is a lot more interesting than the celebrated Istukushima Shrine down at sea level. You can easily spend over an hour here exploring the varied temples and taking part in different religious activities. Its a Buddhist",

          "I must say that I was really surprised when I arrived at this temple. I've been in a lot of temples around Kyoto, Koya-san, Kamakura, Nara, Yamadera and here in Hiroshima and I think this is my favourite one. So, if you're visiting Miyajima, do not miss this temple! I've arrived",
          "The Daish\u014d-in Temple is worth the time exploring the grounds, the Halls, small Shrines and Caves.

          "This was an unexpected delight, as having visited umpteen shrines and temples in the first 10 days of our holiday I was ready to give this a miss - thankfully I did not! The reason I enjoyed our visit so much was that there are so many elements of gardens and shrines combined on",

          "This is truly magical place. Amazingly, not so many visitors go here as visit the main shrine further down. Go early and you may be lucky enough to witness buddhist prayers being said, with beautiful chanting. There is a stunning lantern hall and lots of different shrines and",

        "wiki": "Itsukushima Shrine (\u53b3\u5cf6\u795e\u793e, Itsukushima-jinja) is a Shinto shrine on the island of Itsukushima (popularly known as Miyajima), best known for its \"floating\" torii gate.  It is in the city of Hatsukaichi in Hiroshima Prefecture in Japan. The shrine complex is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Japanese government has designated several buildings and possessions as National Treasures.\nThe Itsukushima shrine is one of Japan's most popular tourist attractions. It is most famous for its dramatic gate, or torii on the outskirts of the shrine, the sacred peaks of Mount Misen, extensive forests, and its aesthetic ocean view. The shrine complex itself consists of two main buildings: the Honsha shrine and the Sessha Marodo-jinja, as well as 17 other different buildings and structures that help to distinguish it. The complex is also listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site,  and  six of its buildings and possessions have been designated by the Japanese government as National Treasures.The tori gate is currently covered entirely by semi-transparent scaffolding while it is undergoing restoration works in preparation for the 2020 Olympics which is scheduled to take place in 2021.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nItsukushima jinja was the chief Shinto shrine (ichinomiya) of Aki Province.It is said to have been erected in 593 supposedly by Saeki Kuramoto during the Suiko period. However, the present shrine has been popularly attributed to Taira no Kiyomori, a prominent warlord (daimyo) who contributed heavily to the building of the shrine during his time as governor of Aki Province in 1168. Another renowned patron of the shrine was the warlord  Mori Motonari, lord of Choshu, who was responsible for rebuilding the honden in 1571. It is important to note, however, that as a result of waging war against Sue Takafusa there in 1555, Motonari is said to have tainted the island's grounds by battling on the island  This relates to the strict notions of sacred purity that Shinto shrines stand for. Unfortunately, the only surviving structure in Itsukushima shrine from the Kamakura period is the Kyakuden or \"Guest-God's Shrine\".\n\n\n=== Kiyomori ===\nIt was not uncommon during the 16th century for daimyo to build shrines or take on other architectural projects in order to \"reflect their power and splendor.\"  The Taira are known specifically, for their involvement in maritime trade with the Sung dynasty, and attempting to monopolize overseas trade along the Inland Sea.Kiyomori was at the height of his power when he established the Taira dominion over the island. He \"ordered construction of the main hall of Itsukushima Shrine as a display of reverence for the tutelary god of navigation and to serve as a base for maritime activities...\" Miyajima soon became the Taira family shrine. Supposedly, Kiyomori chose the location also for the reason to further establish himself in the Heian aristocracy as one who deviated from the social norms of Shinto pilgrimage .  He lavished great wealth upon Itsukushima, and he enjoyed showing the place to his friends and colleagues, or even to royal personages...\"\nIt is also said that Kiyomori rebuilt the shrine on account of a dream he had of an old monk who promised him dominion over Japan if he constructed a shrine on the island of Miyajima, and pay homage to its kami who are enshrined there for his success in life.   The renovations funded by the Taira allowed for Itsukushima to  \"grow into an important religious complex.\"\n\n\n== Religious significance ==\nThe Itsukushima shrine is dedicated to the three daughters of Susano-o no Mikoto: Ichikishimahime no mikoto, Tagorihime no mikoto, and Tagitsuhime no mikoto. Otherwise known as the sanjoshin or \"three female deities\", these Shinto deities are the goddesses of seas and storms. Kiyomori believed the goddesses to be \"manifestations of Kannon,\" therefore the island was understood as the home of the bodhisattva. In Japanese, Itsukushima translates to mean \" island dedicated to the gods\"  In fact, the island itself is also considered to be a god, which is why the shrine was built on the outskirts of the island.  Adding to its sanctity, Mount Misen is \"its tallest peak\" ranging about \"1,755 feet high.\" Tourists can either hike or take a ropeway to the top.Its treasures include the celebrated Heike N\u014dky\u014d, or 'Sutras dedicated by the Taira House of Taira'.  These consist of thirty-two scrolls, on which the Lotus, Amida, and Heart sutras have been copied by Kiyomori, his sons, and other members of the family, each completing the writing of one scroll, and \" decorated with silver, gold, and mother-of-pearl by himself [Kiyomori] and other members of his clan.\"\nOriginally Itsukushima was a pure Shinto shrine \"where no births or deaths were allowed to cause pollution. Because the island itself has been considered sacred, commoners were not allowed to set foot on it throughout much of its history to maintain its purity. Retaining the purity of the shrine is so important that since 1878, no deaths or births have been permitted near it. To this day, pregnant women are supposed to retreat to the mainland as the day of delivery approaches, as are the terminally ill or the very elderly whose passing has become imminent. Burials on the island are forbidden.To allow pilgrims to approach, the shrine was built like a pier over the water, so that it appeared to float, separate from the land. The red entrance gate, or torii, was built over the water for much the same reason. Commoners had to steer their boats through the torii before approaching the shrine.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nJapan has gone to great lengths to preserve the twelfth-century-style architecture of the Shrine throughout history.\nThe shrine was designed and built according to the Shinden zukuri style,  equipped with pier-like structures over the Matsushima bay in order to create the illusion of floating on the water, separate from island, which could be approached by the devout \"like a palace on the sea.\" This idea of intertwining architecture and nature is reflective of a popular trend during the 16th century as well as the Heian period in which Japanese structures tended to \"follow after their environment,\" often allowing trees, water, and other forms of natural beauty to enter into the decor of homes and buildings. This led to a far more intimate relationship between the two.\n\nThe most recognizable and celebrated feature of the Itsukushima shrine, is its fifty-foot tall vermilion otorii gate (\"great gate\"), built of decay-resistant camphor wood,   . The placement of an additional leg in front of and behind each main pillar identifies the torii as reflecting the style of Ry\u014dbu Shint\u014d (dual Shinto), a medieval school of esoteric Japanese Buddhism associated with the Shingon Sect.  The torii appears to be floating only at high tide. When the tide is low, it is only approachable by foot from the island. Gathering shellfish near the gate is also popular at low tide. At night, powerful lights on the shore illuminate the torii .Although the gate has been in place since 1168, the current gate dates back only to 1875.\n\nShinto architecture has many distinct parts, most of which include the shrine's honden ( main hall) consists of \" an eight by four bay structure with a kirizuma roof\"made out of cypress, and the unusually long haiden (main oratory) and its equally long heiden (offertory hall). The honden \"is an eight-by-four bay structure with a kirizuma roof surfaced in cypress bark.\" Its walls are decorated in white stucco, and the walls were constructed using a process requiring fifteen coats of white stucco, with vermilion woodwork.Extending from the sides of the haraiden of the main shrine is a noh stage which dates from 1590.  Noh theater performances have long been used to pay homage to the gods through the ritual acting out of key events in Shinto myth.\n\nOn September 5, 2004, the shrine was severely damaged by Typhoon Songda. The boardwalks and roof were partially destroyed, and the shrine was temporarily closed for repairs. Today anyone can go visit the shrine for only 300 yen.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of National Treasures of Japan (crafts: others)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (crafts: swords)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (shrines)\nList of National Treasures of Japan (writings)\nList of Shinto shrines\nList of World Heritage Sites in Japan\nModern system of ranked Shinto shrines\nMont Saint-Michel, a sister city and a similar island-temple UNESCO World Heritage Site\nThree Views of Japan\nTourism in Japan\nTwenty-Two Shrines\nThree Great Shrines of Benzaiten\nHiroshima to Honolulu Friendship Torii (Itsukushima replica)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n=== Photos ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Artwork ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUNESCO World Heritage description\nhttp://www.en.itsukushimajinja.jp/index.html (in English)\nMiyajima Guide including Itsukushima Shrine\nNational Archives of Japan: Itsukushima kakei",

          "As it is very famous, it is also quite crowded. I love the bright red color of the tori and its roof. You can take really nice pictures here. However, since it is a very tourisy spot, you might have to wait in line to take pictures. I would go here at least once in my lifetime.",
          "We visited the shrine on a short daytrip from our hotel in Hiroshima, and very much enjoyed it. We took the local train from Hiroshima train station and then the ferry across to the island, both using our Japan Rail pass. The various websites provide all the information you",

          "Very iconic thing to be able to tick off the bucket list! Try and go early in order to miss the group tours as they tend to block the way. Hint: push your way through to get the good photo. Also when the tide is out you can go and touch it which is pretty cool to do",
          "Loved the foresight, peace and balance altogether at this UNESCO heritage site. Worth a trip to Hiroshima, take a JR train to Miyajima-guchi station, followed by ferry. JR pass holders just show pass for your rides. Spend at least half the day, soak in all that the island has to",
          "Beautiful Shrine. It was so nice just wandering around, taking our time and simply soaking up the history and peaceful surrounds. Hint: Visit the shrine during high tide as the water adds to the tranquility (and makes for better photos). During low tide is when you can walk out",
          "This is the prettiest among all the shrines. Absolutely breathtaking and wonderful melding in nature. Take a full hour aside to visit the shrine excluding the ferry time etc.",
          "As part of our day tour in Hiroshima, we came to Miyajima Island for a good half-day visit here. And for visitors, this Shrine is a must see landmark, as it presented centuries old of the local history, culture, traditions and religious practises and would be eye opening",
          "It was raining when we arrived at Itsukushima shrine. The ferry to the island took less than 25 minutes and only a few people were on the boat. There are several interesting shops, cafes, and restaurants around and you wouldn\u2019t be leaving the area without buying something from",
          "Of course this famous shrime is the reason tourists come to Miyajiman and I must admit, it is impressive, high tide as well as low tide. Don't expect to be alone, it's always crowded, except at night! But Miyajima has to offer much more than only this shrine!",
          "I made this a full day trip to visit both the shrine and Hiroshima. I was travelling from Kyoto and wanted to ensure I could see a lot in one day. I felt, with young children I made the right choice. Getting there wasn't too difficult, you just need to ensure you know which of",

          "As my partner were staying on the island for 2 nights, mid Oct, we were lucky to see the shrine at sunrise, sunset, hightide and low tide. It is best at sunset and high tide - very beautiful shinto shrine. Would definitely recommend staying on the island itsself if possible.",
          "A short trip from Hiroshima and a similar ferry crossing and you arrive at Miyajima Island and on your way over you can't miss the Torii Gate out off the foreshore. The Itsukushima Shrine as a complex is worth the visit alone but coupled with the roaming deer and Buddhist Pagoda",

          "Once you land on Miyajima island, you are unlikely to miss this shrine. It is located a short walk from Miyajima port. You need to pay to enter the shrine, but the view from outside is good enough. The view of the torii is good beside the shrine.",
          "An absolute must see attraction! Visit when its low tide at night for a picturesque and awe-struck time. The gate is lit up and shines brightly making for amazing photos. It's also humongous in size, much larger and grand than photos make it out to be! You won't be disappointed.",
          "To say that Miyajima, is a tiny bit out of the way may be an understatement...but if staying in Osaka or Hiroshima, visiting for a day trip is reasonable, especially if you are using a Japan Rail Pass. My husband and I (utilizing the pass) took a Shinkansen (high speed",

          "Words cannot describe the beauty of this island. Worth the visit during the cherry blossom and autumn season. The last we were here was during the cherry blossom season. Worth the trip even for a day visit but if budget is not an issue, stay overnight in the ryokan because you",

          "Miyajima is a must... the island where this shrine is situated. The Torii gate in the water is amazing. When the ride is high the whole shrine looks like it\u2019s floating and when the tide is low you can walk out to the Torii gate. A sprawling shrine with beautiful scenery. I",

          "I would not give five stars if I had not experienced both tides. I had been there once before and just saw high tide and was not so impressed. This time the experience was amazing. Definitely worth of a visit. Take your time to look around. More you pay attention, more",
          "You come to Miyajima to see this shrine, so even if the crowds are huge, go slowly and enjoy your time here. Bring a guide book or the internet and read as you go along because there are so many details to take in - and so many pictures to take! It's a fabulous place!",
          "Hordes of people looking at... yes the Red Torii. It is as it looks in pictures I\u2019ve seen but, in all honesty, I was left disappointed. I understand it\u2019s a religious shrine and as such commands a degree of regard. But, it was a great disappointment. I was more taken by the deer",

          "All the island is beautiful, but this is over the top. I like it much more during high tide when the water is all over the shrine, so beautiful! it was not busy at all, really relaxing visit. At the ticket office, you can check when the tide will be high or low, so you can",
          "The shrine opens at 6.30am so if you're staying on Miyajima, you can visit early. This is well worth it as it gets crowded later in the day. I was able to get some really good photos of the shrine and the torii by visiting early.",
          "It\u2019s one of the main photos you see representing Japan. I\u2019ve wanted to visit since I came here. I just love the way it sits in the sea. Nice to view both in the evening and during the day. Plenty to see and do nearby too. Just enjoy something quintessentially Japanese.",

          "Whilst it may not have been peak tourist season, there were still many tourists (including lots of school groups) visiting the shrine. It is made easier by the single direction path meaning people flow through the shrine at a reasonable price and not backtracking. Lovely",

          "Lovely temple which is just a short distance away from the Torii gates. Stroll along the temple with plenty of photo opp with the Torii gate in the distance as the background. Do come during the low & high tide as well as it gives a different feeling",

          "The Torii Gate is the main attraction; you can walk up close to it at low tide for a better look (I wasn't wearing proper shoes so didn't). The shrine complex is probably best visited at high tide if you want to see it at it's best; it's still beautiful but feels a little",
          "What a beautiful sight, this shrine in the sea. We started with low tide, but when we left it was high tide, so we saw it all. Not to busy, so we could take a lot of pictures. The temple complex itself is also nice, and you have another view on the shrine.",

          "A very impressive shrine with an amazing view of the tori gate. It does get crowded in the afternoon so I would recommend going early if you can. The site opens at 6:30am so if you have the opportunity to spend the night in Miyajima, you can wake up early to visit the shrine",

          "Such a unique shrine \"floating\" above the water. Unfortunately the day we visited was pouring rain, but we are keen to visit again in better weather.",
          "We visited in day time, sunset & evening. Each time it was stunning to look at. In the evening there are boats that circle & actually sail under the Torji. It gets busy but everyone is quiet & respectful. In the daytime as the tide went out we saw people including whole",
          "We took the fast ferry across from Matsuyama and the scenery is stunning. On arrival we strolled up towards the shrine stopping to admire the local deer and a bird of prey which put on quite a display for us. It was a beautiful day and the Torii really shone out in the bright",
          "A good spot to see and walk around, but be aware it gets very busy during the day. There are many day trippers who visit the island, so getting a good photo can be tricky.",
          "This Itsukushima Shine is bigger than you think, it's 16m high and 24m wide. They say it's better to view at high tide and I think it is but it's not that important. At least the high tide covers the water marks on posts. Good photo opertunity.",
          "From all the shrines we visited in Japan this was one of the best as it is located just above the see with a view on the great Tori gate. We were there in the afternoon and could witness a traditional Japanese wedding.",
          "This shrine is by far the best in Japan I have seen every shrine this country has to offer and this is so different being in the sea and off the beautiful miyajima you have to visit if you are coming to Japan",
          "You would have seen many shrines by the time you reach here so nothing exciting. Water recedes during evening so it is surrounded by people; not a good looking view in evening",
          "This site is claimed to be the third most popular tourist attraction in Japan. It certainly is memorable and photogenic. It can get quite crowded - just like other popular tourist attractions around the world. There are many other sights and experiences to be had in this area.",
          "We were lucky enough to stay on the island at night and the Shrine looks breathtaking when lit up. It is also beautiful in the day time as you take pictures with the wild deer roaming round. Tip - don't leave any paper dangling or on show as the deer will attempt to take it from",
          "I timed it using the tide tables and it was worth seeing at high tide. The view from the ferry is good and then on the island - more photo opportunities.",
          "Most groups roll through during the day trying to time the visit with the tides. However, the best experien\u00e7e is seeing the Gate in both early morning and late evening light when the colours and the atmosphere are at their best. The shrine is spectacular. Lots to see and explore",
          "I purchased the one day tram pass, which included the ferry option, to visit the shrine and the gate. It took about an hour on the tram and then another 15 minute ferry ride before I finally made it onto the island. The Torii gate is a true spectacle from afar and it was",
          "My husband, 14-year-old daughter and I visited the Itsukushima Shinto shrine on our recent visit to Miyajima Island in March and were very impressed. We visited at high tide and the iconic vermillion torii (gates) emerging from the water were quite spectacular, not to mention an",
          "The shrine itself is not very spectacular. Only the tori in the water is famous and interesting to photography, especially during high tide.",
          "Depends on the tide and you can see the gate into the water or over the sand, it's the main entrance of the island and it's unesco world heritage site. With his orange colour you can see this gate from the other coast.",
          "A lot of tourist by the shrine, but a very nice place to sit and enjoy the sunset by the sea. Be aware of the wild deers, be sure to have your bags closed!",
          "We were taken here by our guide as past of the Hiroshima tour - the floating gate is a strong entrance",
          "I came during low tide so I didn't really get the view of floating temple or torii, but the views are decent and I got to walk to the torii. There are deers roaming around the island and in the path to the temple there are a lot of restaurant and stores offering souvenirs.",
          "Fun shrine, the great Torii was a hit with the kids. Nice little town, with smaller crowds -- you can only get here by ferry (leaves every 20 minutes, and maybe a 10 minute ride). The ferry takes you past many oyster aquaculture beds -- try them on the grill when you get to the",
          "The shrine in the centre of the island is for those of the Shinto religion and there is not much to see. The chief attraction is the floating Tori gate which is underwater at high tide and makes a good photograph. Good to walk by as part of a trip to the is Island",
          "Super popular Shrine in Japan. A Must See of course, I took great pictures around 5 pm with the sun setting down and the deers. I chose to get there after 3 pm because you can walk around the shrine (and I think you can take better pics), in the morning the shrine is surrounded",
          "Here is the home of the Isukushima Shrine, which is a Shinto Shrine. It is best known for the \"floating\" torii gate; which is believed to be the boundary between the spirit and the human worlds. The gate is 200 meters offshore and at high tide it looks as if it is floating on",
          "So much to do on this small island - great views, beautiful beach, cable cars and stunning temples as well as natural scenery plus some animals (deer)thrown in to boot. One of our best days on our Japan trip!",
          "My boy enjoyed the following: ship there, deers, praying and flowers. My hubby and I loved the scenery and yummy oysters!!! Not good to bring young children if intend to climb as it's very tiring.",
          "LOCATION: This UNESCO World Heritage Site is located on beautiful & picturesque Miyajima island. It is calm & quiet Shinto shrine where you can feel eternal peace in air. REACHING THERE: The 10minutes (one way) ferry from Miyajimaguchi station to Mijajima island is lovely &",

          "Visited here on a wet morning so a lot of the walking areas were fairly damp and muddy. Not all of the walking route is hard paved but with care you can avoid the worst of the puddles. Ferry from mainland took 10 minutes and we had distend views of the Tori (floating) Gate in",
          "Awesome place, but make sure you come at the high tide, because low tide is just not as stunning. This place is in almost every Japan marketing brochure... Need we say more?",
          "Excellent tour - take a day to spend on the island. The short Ferry ride (free on JR ferry with your Japan Rail Pass) takes a few minutes. The shrine is a 10 - 15 minute walk along a well developed area of local shops, hotels and small attractions. The shrine itself is",
          "Authentic Japanese Shrine. Historical and scenic. One should go in the morning. Great place for photography.",
          "Took a taxi which we shouldn't have. The subway drops you off pretty close to the ferry terminal. It was raining but still a great visit. Saw small deer that we were not expecting. They were very friendly. Got to the shrine and it was breath taking. Take time to walk around and",
          "Great tour of Japan history. Beautiful buildings and nice atmosphere. Awesome views of the bay and surrounding landscapes.",
          "During low tide, you can come nearby the shrine, but if you want to take a good photo, come when high tide, ferry departing to miyajima will take a route that makes you can take great photos of the shrine",
          "While paying the entrance fees ( 300 yen)to this shrine do look at the high and low tide timings displayed at the entrance. And then thank your stars as you walk on the wooden pathways of this vermillion coloured shrine with abundant photo opportunities.Be sure to purchase",
          "We saw this during the day before and after the tide came in. At night it is lit up as is the harbour side.",
          "Very busy from 10-6:30. Recommend viewing after dark as they light it up and in the early morning as very few people are there.",
          "It is hard to believe how really big these gates are. In many books, the color looks red, but it is really an orangish looking color. Some people were down on the beach to touch it...there are several places to get some great pictures.",
          "Do not forget to check the tide schedule before going (the shrin is less photogenic without the water) another tip : take bread with you if you want to convience a deer to be on your picture :-)",
          "I mostly came to Miyajima because a friend couldn't, when she was in Hiroshima a few months ago. I was curious as to the \"hub bub\". The shrine is beautiful. Reading the guide books, I arrived when it was still high tide for the full effect. I have various photos from different",
          "If you had to pick one shrine to see in all of Japan, this might be it. What makes it so special, of course, is the unique setting in the water at the edge of Miyajima, at least when the tide is in. Note that it (1) can be quite crowded on weekends and (2) requires taking a",
          "Getting there requires getting onto the ferry. Then a short walk passing along the shoreline filled with deer (don't keep food on you). Then see the Grand Torii standing out in the water with the main island in the background. Walk thru the shrine built over the water keeping",
          "I don't know what it is about it, but it really keeps your eyes and camera in it's direction. The size and place in the water is part of it, but there's more, I can't explain...",
          "This place is stuffed with tourists during the day as boatloads are ferried over so try to get here early! I would highly recommend, however, to use this island as a resting area (say if you were coming from Tokyo to visit Hiroshima) for a day or two. It's simply amazing",
          "Itsukushima Shrine is well known for it's great floating Torii. This magnificent structure stands in the water, a few meters away from the land and displays some great elegance. During evenings, the water level goes down and people are able to walk near it. The shrine is",
          "The torii and the shrine were spectacular with their vibrant colors even under the dull light of a cloudy day. However I had not checked the tides and coincided with the low tide which rather underwhelmed me. And it was not as low as to walk to the gate, so I think one rather",
          "I arrived at Hiroshima airport at 11am, moved to Hiroshima by express coach, changed to the local train and the ferry...@13 finally I was standing in Miyajima. I wanted to visit as many places as possible for the next 4-5 hours but I had to give up the mountain walk. If you",
          "Having seen this torii in photos, we wanted to see it for ourselves - and we were not disappointed We went there during low tide and could walk right up to the gate. As we were staying over night at Miyajima island, we went to the gate at night when it was illuminated and it",
          "The shrine and the Tori are both very special and beautiful. If you can, stay overnight in Miyajima, so that you can also enjoy it when the day visitors are not there yet / anymore. The Tori js most beautiful before sunset with high tide. The colours are very intense and the",
          "We spent the night at the island. The atmosphere is completely different than during daylight. I recommend it to everyone. Must see in Japan.",
          "If you're on Miyajima, then you can't not help buy keep glancing at this Tori Gate!!!!! It is spectacular!!!!! Check the tides to see if you can plan it so you will be able to walk out to it at some stage of the day, then organise everything else around that time!!!!!",
          "Very impressive. Take the JR ferry for best water view. You can also walk out to it on the beach when the tide is out.",
          "I visited this shrine twice just for the sake of its sheer beauty. The views from this shrine and the shrine itself is pretty amazing.",
          "So called \"Floating shrine\" is a great place to visit if you have time and are somewhere near Hiroshima. There is a partk with deers and a little village next to it so you can spend a few nice hours there. It is however not a must see place.",
          "The great tori of this shrine is the one in the water. The tori itself is quite beautiful amid the water and get spotlights on it at night. The shrine is like other shrines in Japan where you pay a fee to get in and walk through to the other side. You can get a head on view of",
          "My partner actually had to convince me to come here and I am so glad he did! This was easily one of my favourite sights of the whole trip.",

          "Just a short train trip from Hiroshima Station, boarded a ferry (free for JR Pass holder)..another 20 minutes arrived at Miyajima Island.....Wow, such a lovely place. Deer strolling around, admiring the giant torell (gate)....low tide and many people walking on the shore",
          "Miyajima\u2019s \u201cfloating\u201d shrine is one of those things that feel like a necessary box to check off while visiting Japan.

          "Early February-2017 Never thought of doing a day trip to Hiroshima. Do not seem to be able to cover/see much, given time. Probably just Genbaku Dome n Miyajima, Itsukushima Shrine only. Deer feeding is not allowed. Basically for safety reasons. We flew to Iwakuni Airport",
          "Miyajima its a beautiful island and well worth a visit. Unfortunately we got there just as everything closed but just in time to watch the sun go down and the shrine lit up. Your japan rail pass will get you to the station and on the ferry to the islands for free",
          "This was by far the best place, the view of the ocean with the shrine, the shrine itself, the city old building, the great food and all the deers around \u2764 you can play with them but be careful they steal things from your pockets and then eat them, I lost the city map hahaha.",
          "This is one of the most spectacular Shinto shrines in Japan. The tori gate in the harbor alone is worth the trip, but the Shrine buildings are also amazing. It's worth spending a couple of hours wandering around, absorbing its beauty and spirit. Then you can wander off and",
          "While Miyajima has lots to offer this is one of the highlights as far as popularity and photo opportunities. Once the tides reach the proper level then it appears to float on the water if you will.",
          "Not 100% convinced this was worth the effort. We were all shrined out by the time we got to Hiroshima. We went to this island because of the big gate. But that was about all. There's the shrine and alot of deer (but we'd seen that at Nara). Took quite some time to get there and",
          "One of the best islands I have ever seen. It is really awesome. I have visited two times. Shrines and the total view feels me amazed.",
          "Really nice shrine. Its amazing that it keeps standing in the water and the tide and high waves have not taken it down",
          "This is one of the most photographed shrines in Japan, so when we decided to travel there, it was the picture in my head of the place I had to see. It was low tide when we arrived on the island, so we got to walk out to the shine. We'd decided to stay the night on the island",
          "Sunrise, sunset, at night when it's lit, and during the day, high tide, low tide, close, or far, this is beautiful and peaceful and it's an excellent place to take some photos to look back on your trip to Japan and smile.",
          "I haven't been to the Itsukushima shrine for over 10 years, but it is just as beautiful as I remembered it. It looks best during high tide in nice sunny weather, or just when the sun is rising/setting. I was very lucky to have seen it with snow, as our hotel staff told us we",
          "Itsukushima Shrine is the 3rd most photographed place in Japan with fantastic shinto shrine and collections. You can also enjoy the parks, narrow streets of Itsukushima, plus Mount Missen trails. On the top of these we could see traditional wedding ceremony in the shrine - very",

          "This place is a very sacred place. With nice views and the itsukushima island was very quiet small town if your guy arrived early in the morning. Try to visit here at morning to get a full tour on the island. Have a view of shrine when full tide and get closer to the toiri in",
          "Definitely a must-see in Miyajima! But one cannot really miss seeing it as one walks from the ferry docks to the shops and restaurants. At high tide, the giant torii gate looked spectacular as it seemed to float in the midst of the sea. At low tide, one can walk to the torii.",
          "It's a must visit if it's your first time at the island, but you could go there to see sunset or take a walk around. Great opportunity to discover your luck inside with a very interesting ancient japanese game.",
          "Majestic Torii, beautiful island with \"greedy\" deer looming around. Interesting place to visit. Definitely worth going to see before tide and after tide.",
          "This shrine is on the Miyajima island, and all of the places on the island are worth to trip south from Hiroshima and the ferry ride. The floating gate itself is interesting but badly needs a coat of fresh paint. The tame deer, so revered by the locals, are a begging nuisance",
          "The island, the views, the shrine - all magnificent! Easy to get to and spend a day surrounded by beautiful views. A must visit! The deer are friendly too. The hike up the mountain is great and pretty easy too.",
          "We look the tram from Hiroshima, which was a little slower than the JR rail and it wasn't covered by our JR Pass. However, it was great to have a look at how the locals live. The tram passed the back of peoples homes. We used the JR ferry to get across to the island. Such a",

          "The shrine is very well known icon for Miyajima (due to its floating torii gate). The colour is bright yellow-reddish colour. During the day it looks beautiful and in the night it looks even more beautiful with few lights. To enter the shrine you must pay the entry fee. However",
          "The \"floating tori\" are best viewed when the tide is high. The shrine is quite extensive. You can get good views from the ferry, then tour the shrine to get a different perspective looking outward.",
          "This small island with its famous \"floating\" shrine is only a short walk and ferry-trip from the Miyajimaguchi Station. Don't leave Hiroshima and its nuclear terror displays without resetting your mind at this life-celebrating holy location. If you're lucky, as we were, you",

          "Ok. The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen is just like this shrine: you haul yourself all the way out there to see it then realize it isn't that great and there are hordes of tourists all trying to take the same photo. It is very pretty. It signifies Japan. But to get to it you",
          "This is the main attraction in Miyajima. Everybody wants a picture (or 10) of the floating torii. It's incredible how much the tide changes. One minute everything is floating on water, the next (ok, it takes longer than a minute), you are walking on land towards the torii.",
          "This UNESCO World Heritage treasure is a must-see when you are visiting Hiroshima, an easy boat ride from the mainland to the island of Tsukushima. Its giant Torii in the sea is among Japan's most iconic symbols together with Mt. Fuji. The shrine buildings here, sadly rocked by",
          "Certainly a stunning setting, rising out of the bay with the dramatic mountains on the island in the background. Heaps of tourists, but there are plenty of places on the island where you can get a great photo of it. We stayed overnight, so were able to see it in the afternoon,",
          "This is a very relaxing view and once in a lifetime place I would recommend everyone who visit Japan to see. It's also quite easy to get there by boat.",
          "It's hard to describe how amazing this place is - suffice to say that coming here was one of the highlights of my trip to Japan. Be sure to check the tide tides online, so that you get to see the classic view at high tide and also get to walk all the way out to the 'floating'",
          "I quite enjoyed the shrine! An image synonymous with Japan, I had been holding out going for a while (maybe because it's a must stop for all tourists) regardless, the shrine itself is really gorgeous. We got there at high tide on a beautifully clear day and although there were",
          "We visited the shrine both in the day and at night and preferred the latter as it was beautifully illuminated and much less tourists around, so we could just sit and absorb the scenery without the hordes of photo takers.",

          "Shrine is famous for its floating torii gate. When tide is low, visitors could actually get quite close to the torii gate. We reached around 10am plus and there was already a queue for tickets but still not too crowded to walk around. Very scenic place to get good pictures.",
          "On the day of our visit, we had the chance to see a traditional weeding. The visit of the shrine is easy to do. We had the chance of taking very good pictures of the shrine, tori and Japanese in traditional dress.",
          "As you turn left to board the ferry take a look at the green awning on the right hand side. The spelling is an interesting Japanese translation into English. It is a short ferry ride across to the island. On the way you have your first glimpse of the Shrine. As soon as you",
          "This site is of great spiritual and historical significance; however, if you do not know it, and you've been to Fushimi Inari, then it pales. It might be cool to walk out to it in low tide.",
          "The traditional journey here after visiting Hiroshima is a smart plan. Miyajima has a lot to offer and the shrine is only one of the several attractions. It is worth sleeping here as the village gets very quiet after the flow of tourists have left. The shrine at the time of sun",
          "This place is super picturesque and just so well put together! The cost for an adult is 300 yen and we got it with the treasure hall which came out to be 200 yen. The treasure hall is not super impress compare to everything else but still great to see!",
          "Very beautiful site to see! Also conveniently accessible with the JR ferry coming from miyajima station. Better to take the main JR Train as it is faster than the tram, coming from the main city of Hiroshima.",

          "Absolutely beautiful. The Island of Gods, is well known for its floating shrine and Otorii and I wasn't disappointed. I arrived by ferry at low tide and with many people at the iconic torii base could see how large the structure actually is. After exploring the island the",

          "Once you are on the island of Miyajima it is not difficult to spot the shrine. Follow the tourists and deer and stop for some photos. It casts a striking view being set in the water and makes a good back drop for photos. As with any popular tourist spot it is busy but the deers",

          "Many things to see at the shrine and other hidden jems nearby. From the floating gate in the bay to the temple on piers, the temple grounds are beautiful! There was a ceremony in the temple at noon we got to watch (no filming or pictures!). Don't miss the second temple area",

          "Like the rest of Miyajima, the architecture around the shrine is stunning; if it were not for the big grounds, it would also be so peaceful and enjoyable in that regard as well. The first stop when walking from the town centre will likely be the Otorii gate down on the beach. If",

          "The sight along with its history is amazing. There should be street food stalls as well.",

          "Rain or sunshine, it\u2019s a must visit! Although the views aren\u2019t that great in the rain, it was still something I was very happy to have seen in person. \n\nBe mindful of the deer on the island. The whole place is a quaint little town and if you can stay a night I recommend you do.",
          "didn't get to see the iconic structure as it was under reconstruction",

          "I\u2019ve been here many times and it still\nimpresses me. The water resides in the afternoon and you can walk out to the shrine and take pictures directly underneath it. The light at night makes for great pictures as well. Love this shrine!!",

          "Such a beautiful shrine in SUCH a beautiful location!! This shrine is very unique, especially with the unique floating Torii gate. There is so much to see and do all around the shrine as well.",
          "Lovely and graceful, the gate was at high tide. The associated  temple complexes were beautiful. Once the day-trippers were gone we had this beautiful place mostly to ourselves. Meals were a delight and the people and staff were friendly and attentive.",
          "A very beautiful and peaceful place. It's very old but extremely well preserved. The views of the Tori gate are amazing. Well worth the \u00a5300 entrance free. It's a one-way walk through coming from the harbour.",
          "Amazing Place, the shrine was under refurbishment, but the temples around it and the town are really beautiful.",
          "Although it's currently under construction (not sure why or how long) it's an absolute must visit if you're in the Hiroshima region. Been to Miyajima a few times now and it's still breath taking!",
          "Not bad this place.\nAlso very good.",
          "The shrine was beautiful, as was the Island.\n\nFerries are very frequent.\n\nI highly recommend!!",
          "Amazingly beautiful shrine. So much beauty to see in such a small area. Great grounds and architecture, Wonderful goshuin!! The staff was so friendly and helpful. Thank you!! I was lucky to see a wedding while there. A great experience and I would recommend a visit.",
          "Unfortunately the world famous Otori Gate - the main reason for visiting- is under scaffolding for repair until further notice. The works started in June / July and don't seem to have an end date. The rest of Miyajima is pleasant with lots \u2026",
          "Very easy to get to on the ferry and an easy day trip from Hiroshima. Lots to see such as beautiful shrines, temples and pagodas along with wild deer and other wildlife. There are also lots of shops for food, snacks and souvenirs and public facilities.",
          "Sadly the big gate is being renovated at the moment so you cant see it. But nevertheless a magical place in Japan.",
          "It was really great! Beautiful island with these little deer you can pet. The Tori gate was amazing to see the only downside is how make tourist there actually was. We weren't able to get a picture of the gate on it's own when the tide was \u2026",
          "The place is really beautiful. Ample opportunities for photographs. Unfortunately the iconic Tori Gate which is situated on the water in front the shrine was under construction and all covered up. So it was quite disappointing and \u2026",
          "It would have been a great photo opportunity  except that it is being fixed. The local shrines and  temples are now the major attractions.  Do try the roasted oysters to go with the  local beer. They are great.",
          "I loved it the view was amazong. however currently the shrine is under renovation. But still it was amazing to walk around\ud83d\ude01",
          "Beautiful place, i recommend if the weather is good to visit this place.",
          "Wonderful. Lots of people. The Holgate is under renovation, be aware. But still worth going.",
          "When the tide is out you can walk near to the shrine, but not right up to it. There are lots of places you can take pictures of it when the tide is in, without paying to get into the dock area which faces it directly. The JR ferry also gets \u2026",
          "There is an admission fee to this shrine. Don't let that stop you from entering though. Although you can see the famous Toori gate from outside of the shrine, you can get a direct view of the gate from within the shrine. The shrine itself \u2026",
          "Nice , but crowded. Love the free roaming deers",
          "We can enjoy the solemn atmosphere.Photographing spots are always crowded, but they are worth seeing.\nOtorii currently has scaffolding, so you cannot enjoy the beautiful appearance.\nPeople with strong spirit may feel something.\nIt's about 15 minutes from the port.",
          "Itsukushima Shrine  is located at Miyajimacho island near Hiroshima city, Japan. We visited there last week. We reached there by ferry boat. This beautiful Temple was built on the sea (floating temple) and the mountains behind it. View is \u2026",
          "Amazing place lots of people but it was worth it. The shrine is beautiful",
          "Wonderful place. Unfortunately the Shinto gate was being renovated during my visit.",
          "Wonderful area with good walks. Deer a bit irritating and floating shrine covered up.",
          "Nice place but the famous shrine was covered due to maintains work.",
          "It was under construction when I went but it would have looked nice",
          "Great place to see amazing views and enjoy the local vegetation",
          "It is important to check the tide times as it is most impressive when the tide is in.",
          "The sanctuary of Itsukushima is the national treasure of Japan. The ancient Shinto Shinto shrine is located in The Inner Sea Of Japan, surrounded by green mountains and bays on the island of Itsukushima, better known as the island of \u2026",
          "Amazing, unfortunately was under restructuring, the deer are super friendly",
          "Loved this area. Took ferry to it. Unfortnately teh gate in the water was covered over whilst being renovated but other buildings were beautiful to walk through.  Added bonus wild deer walk the streets.",
          "Peaceful place where you can spend hours enjoying temple atmosphere and bay views",
          "Nice island to visit. Lot areas to visit and see.",
          "Currently August 10 2019 - the shrine is in scaffolding.\nStill nice view. But must be much better when construction is finished.\nEnjoy the walk and for sure you see deers !\nMost restaurants are closed at 19.00 !!",
          "Disappointing.  Described as 'floating' shrine but it doesn't float!  The torii gate is in the sea but when we were there was covered for repairs. The tide was out for the main shrine which was dull. The island however has good walks.",
          "Come early when it opens at 6:30. Get to walk around at 5:30 and see only deer and only some crows and small birds and the three monks. That\u2019s the reward for staying overnight: clean shows and peace and quiet. There is also lights at 8:30 \u2026",
          "What a rewarding visit!\nBring a raincoat/umbrella any time of year just in case.\nHiking: my 50 year old mother and I climbed the trail rather than taking the cable car (ropeway). The climb was gruelling with hundreds of stairs and a 530m \u2026",
          "Even out of peak season this place was far too busy. The deer stink and will come up and harass you for food. Plus the oyster barges off the water reek if the wind is blowing towards the island.",
          "Lovely, serene setting. Quiet village style on island. Shame main Tori gate isn't really visible cause of scaffolding",
          "Under construction, unless it's full tide and not full of tourists it might be good",
          "Slightly disappointed as the gate was under repairs while I visited the Shrine. I know this is not a normal occurrence, and it's probably in preparation for the 2020 Olympics, so I don't think it's fair to deduct points for that reason. \u2026",
          "It was under construction, but it barely takes away from the magnitude that this shrine emits. Wonderful island.",
          "Toriis are closed till 2020 but still it's a great place to visit. And beware of deers, they're always trying to rob you, and you must not hurt them",
          "It was under maintenance but the surrounding areas are amazing, as the whole island",
          "One of the must see places in Japan and Hiroshima. Wonderful half day trip, with great scenery..  worth it \nWe went there in the morning, while low tide, I can imagine that in the afternoon , when main shrine and hall is fully surrounded by water, can be even more spectacular",
          "Beautiful place but tori is under maintenance now so can\u2019t see it...",
          "We went there when the tide was low so we could walk between the shrine and the Torii archway. Unfortunately the archway was under repair now but that was kinda rare experience too. Be careful with the deer on the way there!  If they smell any food, they\u2019ll chase you till they get it.",
          "A place of beauty, be sure to catch the floating giant torii gate from the Shrine at sunset, it's a sight to be beheld. The Shrine is also a Unesco World Heritage Site.",
          "Under renovation until summer! You won't be able to see the Gate!",
          "It's an awesome place to visit. It is located in Miyazima island. It's not just beautiful but there are so much things to see in the place... Peoples are very friendly...",
          "Loved this place! We took a ferry here and walked into the shrine. On our way, we managed to see a few deer. \nQuite disappointing for myself as came here and it\u2019s being restored! So can\u2019t get the usual\nTourist shot that I\u2019ve always wanted! \u2026",
          "The great gate was being repainted, so it did not looks so lovely, but it was comfortable to walk around and see the shrine and enjoy the peaceful island.",
          "One of the must-visit places in Japan. The Shrine with the red gate is a blueprint for many other places in Japan. It is touristy and on the beaten path but don t hesitate it is worth the visit.",
          "You will find calm and peace there.",
          "Unless you want to see the torii being refurbished come visit in late 2020. It is being updated to greet the Olympic crowds. The ropeway cable cars likewise are being \u201cmaintained\u201d  I have a feeling that is not the true explanation.",
          "Under construction, you cant see ANYTHING.  The adjacent temple is nice, but the floating Tori gate is a floating construction site.  Come back in 2 years.",
          "very beautiful! go early morning - no people",
          "Beautiful place to visit. The deer are friendly and eat out of your hand!",
          "Really a nice place....but....go early or don\u2019t go at all.  Charming.  The paid temple visit is not worth it.  Nothing to see at all.  Deer roam freely and are quite docile everywhere.",
          "It was very beautiful.  The Torii gate was covered in construction plastics at this time 19 Nov 2019.",
          "Really pretty and unique shrine and overall a great location. We took the ferry over to the island and ended up with some really good photos here. Got a kick out of the deer as they chased after some food and chewed on a photographers shirt.",
          "Always too many people i this very beautiful shrine\n\nSadly, the tori is still under renovation and was hidden from our view",
          "This place is considered one of the three most scenic views in Japan with good reason. Perfect place to escape the crowds in the city. Lots of photo opportunities and if you visit during low tide you can walk up to the giant tori. Don't buy the corn at the food stands because the deer will attack you for it.",
          "I'm coming on Nov 2019 but under construction so I cant see the famous floaring gate  :(",
          "Nice island to get to by ferry. JR pass allows you to take the ferry there for free",
          "It is ok. The main shrine was under repaire.",
          "Wonderful place with spectacular views and nice shops.",
          "Beautiful place, the Tori is under maintenance so we cannot see it.",
          "Nice and important place. Unfortunaly, the tori gate was surrounded by scaffolding (Status November 25th 2019).",
          "We took a ferry from Hiroshima to this island. We went at high tide and it appeared the Torri gate was floating! It was beautiful. Our local guide took us down some side streets to another shrine. This was breathtaking! Along the way were \u2026",
          "Beautiful shrine, especially when looking from outside at night with the lights shining upon it.",
          "Good cold tasty beer after the long walk up and down!",
          "Very calming and accessible centre. People relaxing, eating, sitting and meditating, all ages and all peacefully together..",
          "The shrine is quite nice, it has paid entry but there is very little to no information given. It got crowded very quickly and in the heat of the day was quite uncomfortable. It is still worth the trip just make sure you have plenty of water. There are also wild dear walking around.",
          "Problem: Tori was under maintenance. Not possible to see  Tori as in picture. Maybe another time.\nBut, enjoy local dishes (oister, eel and other foods).\nAnd remember, bee good with deers and never leave any think close to them (they will try to open it)",
          "Came when the shrine was under construction but still a very peaceful and fun area.",
          "Very touristy but nice atmosphere. Lots of different foods. Unfortunately the Torii is covered for renovation till ~2020.",
          "It was a beautiful day to visit Itsukushima Shrine despite of the scaffolded Torii.",
          "A exuberant view of the sea and the old temple. The the tide is low, it is possible to walk to the tori gate.",
          "Simply one of the most stunning places i have ever seen. Highly recomend it.",
          "I've been before but it's turned into a tourist hub. There should be better signage when you enter the shrine. The lady checking tickets for the shrine is also very rude and has no manners. You're better off going to the free areas since \u2026",
          "Go early!! Spend time walking around and going on little hikes. It\u2019s possible to take a nice day trip from Hiroshima and be back by the evening.",
          "Beautiful shrine sitting on the water. Lots of street food but be warned to walk around first as price can be different, especially for the local oysters. They are all good quality though as we tried a couple of shops. Must check tide time to see the floating shrine during high tide.",
          "Nice, touristic place. Based on waves, you can see floating Tori here or a shrine which might be surrounded by water or not (depending on the day time).",
          "Beautiful shrine! The itskushima itself was under construction when I went.. unfortunately. However, the rest of the shrine was beautiful to see! If you\u2019re visiting, I also highly recommend purchasing the Momiji-manju dessert. It was delicious!",
          "Under construction...nice to see the temple",
          "Take the ferry to get to the island.youll need to pay to get into the main shrine.careful of the deers.dont hold any papers out cos they will eat it.",
          "Nice place with succulent oyster!\nTip:Don't eat in front of the deers there as they will snatch your food(but they are friendly and you can touch them!)",
          "Wonderful, amazing, beautiful. Good place for take picture.",
          "Unfortunately the shrine itself is currently under some sort of restoration work, there's plenty else in the area to make it worthwhile visiting Miyajima while this work is being completed.",
          "Currently under construction. But still amazing to see.",
          "This is almost in every tourist's bucket list visiting Japan. One of the most scenic spots. The shrine itself is built in the 12th century and the famous giant  orange colour Tori gate is right before it. If you visit during high tide you \u2026",
          "Beautiful shrine and a lovely little island.",
          "Currently under construction (December 2019), be aware!",
          "The shrine is currently under beautification process, but there's lots to see and do on the island.",
          "Beautiful scenery n lots of deers to take picture wid. But if u wan group photo, beware of photo bomb by the deers. \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23",
          "This is my first experince to visit Japan, especially accross to Itsukushima Shrine a lil bit needs a effort to coming here. I got a new great experince here we can see many animal living among human and tourists, we can see the ancient of \u2026",
          "The place is amazing, but the main attraction (sea Tori), is under mantenance and can't be seen.",
          "I love the Itsukushima Shrine: the view of it, the red Color and the Torii gate. Go at a time when it\u2019s still high tide changing to Low tide. I went at a time when it was Low tide so didn\u2019t get to see the gate in the waters. Note that the torii gate is under renovation and it is not known when it will be completed. Hopefully soon.",
          "Almost no context or signage, maybe because it's undergoing renovations. Great location and history. I recommend seeing the folklore museum first to see how the shrine has been depicted in art and culture for the past 800+ years.",
          "Photos don't do it justice, this Shrine is truly a sight to be seen. We experienced both low and high tide so we're able to walk right out and under the Shrine and also see it later in the day appearing to be floating on water. Keep an eye out for the deer they like to steal your map and eat it.",
          "Wonderful place, so many deer around. Be carefull they will try to eat your bags and steal your food but they are so cute. Wonderful at low tide you can walk out. Highly recommend.",
          "Under construction but still beautiful scenery",
          "We took the Boat over & on the way over it passes the shrine Great photo opp & was a clear fine Day we stayed there all afternoon & went up the gondola (well worth it)",
          "The place was under maintanance but the view is good ans you could walk around the town a spent the afternoon in a cozy cafe or enjoy the local craft beer in a bar",
          "The area is great, although the gate was under renovation, but still worth the trip.",
          "When we visited the famous jinja gate was under refurbishment which was disappointing. But the shrine itself is amazing, lovely red structure that is well taken care of.",
          "Even with the tori gate being refurbished it was still an incredible place to visit. Stay around to see it at both high and low tide.",
          "Oysters superb taste. Suggest to catch the boat from The Memorial Park dowtown. 45 minutes journey straight to the island. No lane for the walk to the shrine. Walk inside the quiet parks instead, up to the Peak of the mountain.",
          "Beautiful temple, one of my favourites in Japan. Advise to get here on one of the first boats while it's still quiet and tranquil, has an amazing atmosphere and can get very busy later on in the morning. A must see",
          "I was very eager to see the floating tori but i was disappointed since it was under renovation. \nThe shrine was amazing",
          "Such a beautiful shrine.. even the walk along the beach to the shrine is beautiful in itself. So simple and effective. Miyajima island is beautiful and full of many activities. A great day trip and relatively easy to get to.",
          "Try to hit either low tide or high tide to get either the full experience of walking out to the gate or seeing water surround the temple. The entire area is beautiful. Also make sure to get there before 5pm as that's when the shrine and temple shops begin closing.",
          "This is a beautiful and special place. However, right now the \"gate of god\" is under maintenance so you will see the frames. The maintenance will last to next year Tokyo Olympic Games.",
          "Currently under construction ! \nOn the bright-side, less people get photos of it looking like this than how it would normally look!",
          "Overall a spot for everyone to visit if you have the JR tourist pass there is a ferry that offers travel across. IMPORTANT Currently the main shrine is covered for earthquakes protection which was very disappointing as it was completely covered and is the main attraction for the area.",
          "Took us awhile to get from Osaka to Hiroshima and then another 30mins to the train station before boarding a ferry to the island. Day trip was well worth it! Visited the shrine and monument as well as the tourist street behind. Plenty of \u2026",
          "Serenity. The native deer. Saying a prayer for those in my life that need it.",
          "Beautiful shrine. Worth exploring to find some of the other cool places on the island. Fun to go out and see it up close during low tide.",
          "Super nice \ud83d\ude4f totally recommend !",
          "Very pretty and solemn place. Come early because it gets crowded later in the day. We arrived at around 0830hrs and it was ok",
          "Beautiful shrine but it needs a good repair and maintenance. Too many people there actually (myself included) that spoils the ambience of the place.",
          "One of my favorite places ! A lot to see!",
          "Famous Tori gate. Maybe not as nice as many shrines in Japan but excellent history. Wild deer will get in your purse if not careful. Charming town for Shopping and gelato.",
          "Under renovation now. Fully covered \ud83d\ude1e",
          "Quite a few stairs but once you get to the top, great views. 1400 years old!",
          "This is one of the most beautiful shrines in Japan. Miyajima island is where the shrine is. Pretty easy to get to from multiple locations and you have to take the ferry to get to the island. Deer can be seen all over and they are used to \u2026",
          "Amazing UNESCO world heritage site. Must see",
          "Beautiful shrine complete with friendly deer and beachfront view. BUT the signature \"floating\" gate was covered up for renovation/construction during peak tourist season. Disappointing.",
          "Nice place in miyajima Island",
          "I loved Miyajima but unfortunately the famous Tori Gate was wrapped up for repairs.  Such a shame.",
          "It's ok .. but on the weekend it's very crowded. When I visited the main Gate (in the water) was being refurbished .. so you couldn't get that iconic shot .. still with all those other people around it wasn't going to be all that great a shot anyway.\nThere are some nice restaurants and even a micro-brewery \"Miyajima Brewery\"",
          "Very beautiful. The views you can see on the way are good too.",
          "Although crowded and \"touristy\" it was beautiful and worth seeing.",
          "The perfect day trip from Hiroshima. There are several temples nearby along with street food, deer, and hiking trails to other peaks. The ferry is free to the island if you are using a JR Pass.",
          "Currently under construction and covered. Can not see the Torii gate at all.",
          "One of the most iconic places in Japan. Unfortunately, as a lot of other places here, the torii and some parts of the temple are undergoing renovations, kind of breaking the unique feeling of the place.\nTake care to check the tides and go very early to avoid having too many tourists with you",
          "It's a beautiful shrine together with Miyajima day visit for different shrines around in this Island..a must when visiting Hiroshima.",
          "Always worth a visit. Also worth doing the monorail during the day and coming back down in the evening to see the shrine lit up at night with the tide coming in around the walkways.",
          "Nice place to chill and relax with the most amazing views of the mountains. The shrine was under maintenance when I went, so beware of that.",
          "UNDER REPAIR UNTIL MID 2020!!! DEEPLY SAD THAT WE WERE UNAWARE THAT THE WHOLE THING IS SCAFFOLDED UP.",
          "The Torii gate is under construction until the end of 2019 (?) So consider if you still want to visit them during this time.",
          "Best place you can go near Hiroshima. Get to know local food and enjoy the great views from top of mountain. 100% recommended",
          "Great night view! The torii gate in the water is under construction though so not much to see there.",
          "Deceiving. It was a pretty cloudy day, and as we approached by ferry this never looked like it was going to live up to its billing as one of the most photographed views in Japan. Somehow, though, once you enter the shrine the perspective \u2026",
          "The ferry ride to the island is quick and at regular intervals, so no need feeling rushed getting there. The shrine itself is really neat and the view surrounding it is beautiful. if you want to eat after sunset you should probably make reservations beforehand. Also, watch your belongings. The deer on the island can be a nusciance.",
          "Lots to see here. The floating Tori is unreal. It is incredible how much it changes with the tide. We saw it from the dock where the water was up to the dock, we went in for lunch and when we came out the tide was so much lower we were able to walk over half of the way out to the Tori.",
          "This place is really amazing",
          "Beautiful Island, but unfortunately the Shrine was covered in scaffolding.",
          "Arrive early so you can go ti te top of the mountains and see the temples",
          "The shrine was under construction. The island was well worth the visit. A fabulous destination.",
          "Very nice view of nature, and a beautiful shine. Nice town for food and souvenirs. The deer are very nice.",
          "Went to the island when the shrine was renovated. Can't be seen at all.",
          "Beautiful in so many ways",
          "I came here for a day trip and loved it. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone coming to Hiroshima as a must go place.",
          "It's under construction at the time I'm writing this, but when I was here last year it was very beautiful.",
          "peacefull.",
          "It's an impressive Shrine on Miyajima Island half an hour from Hiroshima.",
          "Was under construction when we went but still a very cool area",
          "One of the holiest place in Japan where one can find statue of lord Ganesha!!!",
          "So much to see here. Take your time and visit all of the sites. Head up the hill, stop at the cafes and make a full day of it. It\u2019s worth seeing at both high and low tides, so consider staying the night, or making 2 trips. The ferry ride \u2026",
          "I can see how this is a beautiful place but it is currently covered for renovation",
          "Awsome view. Beautifule deers. Charming scenery....",
          "Awesome, just wish it wasn't under construction on our first visit.",
          "Tori is under construction until summer of 2020",
          "Would have been 5 but some parts were under construction. Peaceful place.",
          "While most of the shrine has been restored and a lot of the original material has been replaced the shrine still looks gorgeous also you will get a photo op with the many deer that roam freely the adjacent area (deer are sacred to the shrine).",
          "It is a beautiful place with many souvenir shops. It tends to be crowded though. On the way to the shrine, there are many stands selling interesting types of food and drinks; don't forget to have a go at these. There is no entry fee.",
          "A must see and a great daytrip if you live near. I recommend seeing the shrine in the sunset, as the tide makes it look amazing.",
          "Beautiful spot but it is very, very busy here. It's difficult to get a photo with no one in it. But it's still worth seeing high or low tide.",
          "A very nicely maintained shrine in the miyajima island especially when there is muddy soil from around. You can spend a quiet spiritual time. It is relatively quiet since most people are busy photographing the tori gate. Ideal time would be 12:00 to 1:00 when the tide is high.",
          "Love the feel of the island, unfortunately  the Tori is surrounded by scaffolding now and will be for a couple more years.",
          "A truly magnificent and peaceful view especially at sundown. In addition, if you have the JR pass you can automatically take the JR ferry to the island.",
          "Must see attraction if you go to Hiroshima.\nThe shrine is one train/tram and a ferry away from\nHiroshima station.\nVisited the shrine an early morning on Monday and there was almost no one.",
          "Please read the history of itsukushima shrine to admire this place. If not, you will just see a gate which is surrounded by sea water when high tide.",
          "Beautiful shrine, right next to the sea, one of the coolest things of it its the big Tori in front of it, as the  tide changes it become possible to get really close to it, and also the ilummination at night makes it seem like a gate to another world in the middle of the sea...",
          "Shrine completely covered in scaffolding at present (Oct 2019). Check before you catch the ferry (plenty to do on the island otherwise though)",
          "Right now it's in reparation but still impressive. Better to see with high tide",
          "Currently under maintenance but still a nice area.",
          "Paradise. Attention: the shrine is under maintenance and you can't see it now.",
          "Nice area but shrine being refurbished it seems",
          "Good place to spend half, or full day . Food like oysters, eel, matcha products, beans related, fried seafood n vegetable. Good place to catch autumn leaves and of course the greedy deers",
          "World heritage site, what more can I say? Amazing shrine which is one of its kind. If you are lucky, you get to have a close up shot of the shrine on low tide days. Check with the local the day before to see when the low and high tides will be. It's about 10-15 walk from the JR ferry but there are things to see along the way. Enjoy!",
          "This shrine is knockout... Maybe the highlight of our two and a half weeks in Japan. Make sure to stay overnight though... It's so lovely on the island.",
          "Great place to. Every photograph dream to see the temple. You can walk around. Be aware of animals. They try to steal you food.",
          "Very beautiful tori gate in the ocean. Sunset was amazing. Unfortunately a lot of other people but still enjoyable.",

          "Peaceful, lovely and easy to get to by train from Hiroshima",
          "WARNING - the Torii gate is currently shrouded in scaffolding, so if you've made the journey just to see it you'll be disappointed. However, there are plenty of other things to see and do on the island, so your trip wouldn't be entirely wasted.",
          "This is a great Shrine! Famous world heritage site! The Shrine main building stands on the sea! If the sea level is high, the Shrine looks floating on the water. It the sea level is low the Shrine looks standing on the beach. Either looks \u2026",
          "Island of miyajima was very peaceful but a bit touristy. The ferry to access the island is JR so if you have the pass it's super easy. On the island there are deer walking around. Some people pet them but I wouldn't risk it. The shrine \u2026",
          "Stunning!l, especially at low tide or sunset. Budget at least half a day to enjoy the nearby temple complex and surrounding streets with lots to see and eat.",
          "Beautiful ferry ride. Free for JR pass holder. \nMust see shrine. Only one in the water. \nVery crowded.",
          "It's under construction and everything on the island was closed at 6pm...we saw a baby deer, I guess that was neat, but we'd just come from Nara and the deers there were much cuter and much more baby. Overall this island is janky and closed.",
          "Spectacular island. Give yourself plenty of time. You can use your JR rail pass to catch ferry to island.",
          "Enjoyed natural Beauty in Japanese countryside",
          "Beautiful place to visit, nice and tranquil once away from the tourist trails. The deer are adorable and there's lots of wildlife to see!",
          "A really nice place to visit and is a place where you can gather much spiritual energy from the Gods.",
          "A must visit in Hiroshima area! The shrine was a magical place, located on a shore with beautiful scenery all over the area. It was not as crowded as other touristy places in Japan so it was a very pleasant experience for me. Also there were pack of deers around the shrines. Unbelievably cute.",
          "Beautiful island. Full of deers that you can pet.",
          "Iconic shrine, despite lots of tourists it\u2019s really easy to get a photo there. You may also have your photo taken by a professional for a small price of 500JPY (no tax).\n\nThere will be deer roaming around the area, so try not to carry open food with you. Must see when on the island!",

          "What a wonderful island it was sooo beautiful. The sunset was amazing",
          "Nice island though the some pla es under reconstruction",
          "This place is simply beautiful.  Try to go when it's high tide so you can get a picture of the torii gates floating on the water.  If you go during low tide, it's just tourists in the background of your photo.",
          "It looks very beautiful when taking photo of the torii gate from the shrine. Kind of walking in a palace handcrafted from wood",
          "Shrine was currently under construction when I visited but it was still cool to see.",
          "Beautiful shrine... O-torii in front of the shrine complements the shrine and the shrine amidst the mountains lends further beauty, making the shrine truly one of the three scenic spots of Japan",
          "Fantastic shrine with one of the best settings in Japan. The downside is that as it is world famous it gets unbelievably busy very early in the day. I stayed on Miyajima for 3 days and by 11am each day the island was packed, i had arrived \u2026",
          "We are not that lucky as it was under upgrading or repair but it's surrounding is still beautiful.",
          "A beautiful world heritage site. (My) photos don't do it justice and it's free to see most of the island itself via rail pass. However the temple does have a low admittance fee of 300\u00a5 and the easiest way to top of nearby Mt. Misen is via the air trams for 1800\u00a5 round trip. Well worth it.",
          "Great photo shot of Itsukushima Shrine from the building. Earlier, due to low tide, we could walk to the Torii Gate... Love this place",
          "Extremely beautiful and one of my favorite places in japan. There is a low tide to fet  lose to the gate but the high tide comes in well real high. Super cool to see the change happen. There are a lot of deer who are not afraid to steal \u2026",

          "Beautiful place to see.",
          "Miyajima's torii (shrine gate) was wrapped because of renovation. A lot of people on the island, mostly tourist's attractions, and few disrespectful people giving food to deers or trying to ride them. But it is really easy to access to the \u2026",
          "Beautiful shrine. We went early to miss the crowds.",
          "Nice shrine on Miyajima island, well known for its Torii in the water. Check out the tides as it looks best at high tide. The shrine itself is mostly covered and primarily offers some nice views without much of a history lesson, but it's \u2026",
          "Was there over the golden week. Enormous amount of people. Maybe bring your own food, restaurants are fully booked or wait 1h+.\nCheck the tides, come at high tide.",
          "This is one of the most iconic places in Japan,the tide is usually down before the sunset and you can walk through by feet. The place is filled with coins, please don't take it or the gods will chase you! :)",
          "if you were in hiroshima dont miss this place so beautifully.you can enjoy how way you want....",
          "Absolutely a must if you're coming to Hiroshima. A day trip to remember! Everything from the ferry ride (which is free if you have the Japan Rail Pass) to spending the day waiting for the tide to turn to see the shrine in both low tide and \u2026",
          "Such an amazing place. Lots of areas to buy items if that is what you are into. There are some deer you can see that come up close to you",

          "A wonderful and peaceful place. Do not miss out if you are in Hiroshima area!",

          "It would have been great, except the gate is under repair and is covered.  Bad timing for us, just means we have to go again.",
          "Made a day trip to the island from Hiroshima. One day was enough for us to see most of the sights. Very tourist town compared to other places we visited in Japan. Keep in mind that the famous torii gate is supposed to undergo renovations \u2026",

          "Very iconic place to visit. Wait until the evening to walk up around it though",
          "The shrine and temple are stunning and definitely worth the visit. Once you get there via ferry you will see alot of dear that are used to humans. I recommend going to the to the top of the island because the scenery is stunning and there's alot to see up there too.",

          "Closed for refurbishment, but still a lovely island to visit",

          "Beautiful. The Otorii Gate is being maintained at the moment though",
          "Nice place but lots of tourists. There is also a nice micro brewery on the island.",

          "It was all a mud puddle under the temple when we went, but the torii gate was well in the water, floating and lovely. Then we went up the gondola, $10 one way, $18 round trip. We did the one way and hiked down. Lovely all around. When we \u2026",

          "cool experience, if you stay until 1 or 2 pm the tide will pull out and you can walk up to the torii gate on a good day. Depends on how the ocean is feeling.\n\nClimb Mt. Misen, it's a great walk up.",

Highly recommend a visit here!",

          "It is so worth to see this. The giant torii is on the water. At sometime of the day when the water gone, it allows people to walk close to the torii to see how giant it is. It is so outstanding with the beatiful background. It takes 15 min \u2026",
          "Wow this is awesome so iconic!",
          "Most people go in here as it offers the best direct view of the floating Torii gate in Miyajima island. \nIt's a beautiful temple complex. It's more beautiful when the foundations are covered by sea water during high tide. \nYou do have to pay a fee to enter this shrine.",

        "wiki": "Hiroshima Castle (\u5e83\u5cf6\u57ce, Hiroshima-j\u014d), sometimes called Carp Castle (\u9bc9\u57ce, Rij\u014d), is a castle in Hiroshima, Japan that was the home of the daimy\u014d (feudal lord) of the Hiroshima han (fief). The castle was originally constructed in the 1590s, but was destroyed by the atomic bombing on August 6, 1945. The castle was rebuilt in 1958, a replica of the original that now serves as a museum of Hiroshima's history before World War II.\n\n\n== History ==\nM\u014dri Terumoto, one of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's council of Five Elders, built Hiroshima castle between 1589 and 1599.  It was located on the delta of the Otagawa river. There was no Hiroshima city or town at the time, and the area was called Gokamura, meaning \"five villages\". Beginning in 1591, M\u014dri Terumoto moved from Yoshida-K\u014driyama Castle and governed nine provinces from this castle, including much of what is now Shimane, Yamaguchi, Tottori, Okayama and Hiroshima Prefectures.\nWhen construction on the castle began, Gokamura was renamed Hiroshima, as a more impressive name was called for. \"Hiro\" was taken from \u014ce no Hiromoto, an ancestor of the M\u014dri family, and \"Shima\" was taken from Fukushima Motonaga, who helped M\u014dri Terumoto choose the castle site. Some accounts state that the name \"Hiroshima\", meaning \"wide island\", comes from the existence of several large islands in the delta of the Otagawa, near the castle's site.\nFollowing the battle of Sekigahara in 1600, M\u014dri was forced out of the castle, retreating to Hagi in today's Yamaguchi Prefecture. Fukushima Masanori became the lord of Aki and Bingo Provinces (which today make up Hiroshima Prefecture) and of Hiroshima castle. However, the new Tokugawa shogunate forbade any castle construction without permission from Edo; this was part of how the shogunate kept the daimy\u014ds from gaining power and overthrowing the shogunate. When Fukushima repaired the castle following a flood in 1619, he was dispatched to Kawanakajima in today's Nagano Prefecture. Asano Nagaakira then became lord of the castle.\nFrom 1619 until the abolition of the feudal system during the Meiji Restoration (1869), the Asano family were lords of Aki and Bingo Provinces.\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, the castle came to serve as a military facility, and the Imperial General Headquarters was based there during the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894\u20131895. The foundations of several of the GHQ outbuildings, just a few hundred paces from the castle's main tower, remain today.\nDuring the final months of World War II, the castle served as the headquarters of the 2nd General Army and Fifth Division, stationed there to deter the projected Allied invasion of the Japanese mainland. The castle was destroyed in the atomic bomb blast of August 6, 1945, and for many years, it was believed the castle structure was blown away by the explosion that destroyed Hiroshima, but newly discovered evidence suggests the explosion only destroyed the lower pillars of the castle, and the rest of it collapsed as a result.The present tower, constructed largely of concrete, was completed in 1958.\n\n\n=== Daimy\u014ds of Hiroshima ===\n M\u014dri Terumoto (1591\u20131600)*; 1,120,000 koku\n Fukushima Masanori (1600\u20131619); 498,223 koku\nAsano Nagaakira (1619\u20131632); 426,500 koku**\nAsano Mitsuakira (1632\u20131672)\nAsano Tsunaakira (1672\u20131673)\nAsano Tsunanaga (1673\u20131708)\nAsano Yoshinaga (1708\u20131752)\nAsano Munetsune (1752\u20131763)\nAsano Shigeakira (1763\u20131799)\nAsano Narikata (1799\u20131830)\nAsano Naritaka (1831\u20131858)\nAsano Yoshiteru (1858\u20131858)\nAsano Nagamichi (1858\u20131869)\nAsano Nagakoto (1869\u20131871)*The years listed are those in which the lord occupied Hiroshima castle, not the years of his life.\n**All of the lords after Asano Nagaakira enjoyed the same 426,500 koku.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe castle was originally constructed in wood, pine primarily, and had attached wings to the east and to the south. It was completed sometime between 1592 and 1599, and was designated a National Treasure in 1931. The reconstructed castle features the main tower (tenshu) only, which is made primarily of reinforced concrete. Its five floors stand 26.6 meters (87 ft) above the stone foundation, which, in turn, is 12.4 meters (41 ft) high off the ground. However, in 1994, a gate and a yagura in the ninomaru were re-constructed out of wood using the original methods.\nAn excellent example of a hirajiro or flatlands (plains) castle, Hiroshima castle once had three concentric moats in addition to the Otagawa river to the west (now called the Hongawa), which provided an additional natural barrier. The two outer moats were filled in during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and much of what was once within the castle grounds is now modern urban area, including homes, schools, offices and shops. A number of secondary castle buildings, towers and turrets once stood, and a Shinto shrine called Hiroshima Gokoku Jinja is located within the innermost moat, having been moved there after 1945.\nWithin the castle walls, three trees survived the atomic bombing: a eucalyptus and a willow at approximately 740 m from the hypocenter, and a holly approximately 935 m from the hypocenter. Both specimens are preserved just beyond the Honmaru. Also located inside the Honmaru is the concrete bunker from which the first radio broadcast out of Hiroshima following the atomic bombing was made.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJapanese castle\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHiroshima Castle tourist brochure obtained at the castle.\nJames McMullen, \"The Worship of Confucius in Hiroshima\" Japonica Humboldtiana, vol. 16 (2013) pp. 83-107\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBenesch, Oleg. \"Castles and the Militarisation of Urban Society in Imperial Japan,\" Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Vol. 28 (Dec. 2018), pp. 107-134.\nBenesch, Oleg and Ran Zwigenberg (2019).

        "wiki": "Hiroshima (\u5e83\u5cf6\u5e02, Hiroshima-shi, , also UK: , US: , Japanese: [\u00e7i\u027eo\u0255ima]) is the capital of Hiroshima Prefecture in Japan. As of June 1, 2019, the city had an estimated population of 2.089 million. The gross domestic product (GDP) in Greater Hiroshima, Hiroshima Urban Employment Area, was US$61.3 billion as of 2010. Kazumi Matsui has been the city's mayor since April 2011.\nHiroshima was founded in 1589 as a castle town on the \u014cta River delta. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Hiroshima rapidly transformed into a major urban center and industrial hub. In 1889, Hiroshima officially gained city status. The city was a center of military activities during the imperial era, playing significant roles such as the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the two world wars.\nHiroshima is best remembered as the first city targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" on the city at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945. Most of the city was destroyed, and by the end of the year 90,000\u2013166,000 had died as a result of the blast and its effects. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) serves as a memorial of the bombing.\nSince being rebuilt after the war, Hiroshima has become the largest city in the Ch\u016bgoku region of western Honshu, the largest island of Japan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe region that Hiroshima stands today was originally a small fishing village along the shores of Hiroshima Bay. From the 12th century, the village was rather prosperous and was economically attached to a Zen Buddhist temple called Mitaki-Ji. This new prosperity was partly caused by the increase of trade with the rest of Japan under the auspices of the Taira clan.\n\n\n=== Sengoku and Edo periods (1589\u20131871) ===\nHiroshima was established on the delta coastline of the Seto Inland Sea in 1588 by powerful warlord M\u014dri Terumoto. Hiroshima Castle was quickly built, and in 1593 M\u014dri moved in.  Terumoto was on the losing side at the Battle of Sekigahara. The winner of the battle, Tokugawa Ieyasu, deprived M\u014dri Terumoto of most of his fiefs, including Hiroshima and gave Aki Province to Masanori Fukushima, a daimy\u014d who had supported Tokugawa. From 1619 until 1871, Hiroshima was ruled by the Asano clan.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Imperial period (1871\u20131939) ===\nAfter the Han was abolished in 1871, the city became the capital of Hiroshima Prefecture.  Hiroshima became a major urban center during the imperial period, as the Japanese economy shifted from primarily rural to urban industries. During the 1870s, one of the seven government-sponsored English language schools was established in Hiroshima. Ujina Harbor was constructed through the efforts of Hiroshima Governor Sadaaki Senda in the 1880s, allowing Hiroshima to become an important port city.\nThe San'y\u014d Railway was extended to Hiroshima in 1894, and a rail line from the main station to the harbor was constructed for military transportation during the First Sino-Japanese War. During that war, the Japanese government moved temporarily to Hiroshima, and Emperor Meiji maintained his headquarters at Hiroshima Castle from September 15, 1894, to April 27, 1895. The significance of Hiroshima for the Japanese government can be discerned from the fact that the first round of talks between Chinese and Japanese representatives to end the Sino-Japanese War was held in Hiroshima, from February 1 to February 4, 1895. New industrial plants, including cotton mills, were established in Hiroshima in the late 19th century. Further industrialization in Hiroshima was stimulated during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, which required development and production of military supplies. The Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition Hall was constructed in 1915 as a center for trade and exhibition of new products. Later, its name was changed to Hiroshima Prefectural Product Exhibition Hall, and again to Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall.During World War I, Hiroshima became a focal point of military activity, as the Japanese government entered the war on the Allied side. About 500 German prisoners of war were held in Ninoshima Island in Hiroshima Bay. The growth of Hiroshima as a city continued after the First World War, as the city now attracted the attention of the Catholic Church, and on May 4, 1923, and Apostolic Vicar was appointed for that city.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n=== World War II and the atomic bombing (1939\u20131945) ===\n\nDuring World War II, the Second General Army and Ch\u016bgoku Regional Army was headquartered in Hiroshima, and the Army Marine Headquarters was located at Ujina port. The city also had large depots of military supplies, and was a key center for shipping.The bombing of Tokyo and other cities in Japan during World War II caused widespread destruction and hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths. There were no such air raids on Hiroshima. However, a real threat existed and was recognized. To protect against potential firebombings in Hiroshima, school children aged 11\u201314 years were mobilized to demolish houses and create firebreaks.On Monday, August 6, 1945, at 8:15 a.m., the nuclear weapon \"Little Boy\" was dropped on Hiroshima from an American Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the Enola Gay, flown by Colonel Paul Tibbets, directly killing at least 70,000 people, including thousands of Korean slave laborers. Fewer than 10% of the casualties were military. By the end of the year, injury and radiation brought the total number of deaths to 90,000\u2013166,000. The population before the bombing was around 345,000. About 70% of the city's buildings were destroyed, and another 7% severely damaged.\nThe public release of film footage of the city following the attack, and some of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission research the human effects of the attack, were restricted during the occupation of Japan, and much of this information was censored until the signing of the Treaty of San Francisco in 1951, restoring control to the Japanese.\nAs Ian Buruma observed: News of the terrible consequences of the atom bomb attacks on Japan was deliberately withheld from the Japanese public by US military censors during the Allied occupation\u2014even as they sought to teach the natives the virtues of a free press. Casualty statistics were suppressed. A film shot by Japanese cameramen in Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the bombings were confiscated. \"Hiroshima\", the account was written by John Hersey for The New Yorker, had a huge impact in the US, but was banned in Japan. As [John] Dower says: \"In the localities themselves, suffering was compounded not merely by the unprecedented nature of the catastrophe ... but also by the fact that public struggle with this traumatic experience was not permitted.\" The US occupation authorities maintained a monopoly on scientific and medical information about the effects of the atomic bomb through the work of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission, which treated the data gathered in studies of hibakusha as privileged information rather than making the results available for the treatment of victims or providing financial or medical support to aid victims.The book Hiroshima by John Hersey was originally published in article form in the magazine The New Yorker, on 31 August 1946. It is reported to have reached Tokyo, in English, at least by January 1947 and the translated version was released in Japan in 1949. Although the article was planned to be published over four issues, \"Hiroshima\" made up the entire contents of one issue of the magazine. Hiroshima narrates the stories of six bomb survivors immediately before and four months after the dropping of the Little Boy bomb.Oleander (Nerium) is the official flower of the city of Hiroshima because it was the first to bloom again after the explosion of the atomic bomb in 1945.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Postwar period (1945\u2013present) ===\nOn September 17, 1945, Hiroshima was struck by the Makurazaki Typhoon (Typhoon Ida). Hiroshima Prefecture suffered more than 3,000 deaths and injuries, about half the national total.  More than half the bridges in the city were destroyed, along with heavy damage to roads and railroads, further devastating the city.Hiroshima was rebuilt after the war, with help from the national government through the Hiroshima Peace Memorial City Construction Law passed in 1949. It provided financial assistance for reconstruction, along with land donated that was previously owned by the national government and used by the Imperial military.In 1949, a design was selected for the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the closest surviving building to the location of the bomb's detonation, was designated the Genbaku Dome (\u539f\u7206\u30c9\u30fc\u30e0) or \"Atomic Dome\", a part of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was opened in 1955 in the Peace Park.Hiroshima also contains a Peace Pagoda, built in 1966 by Nipponzan-My\u014dh\u014dji. Uniquely, the pagoda is made of steel, rather than the usual stone.Hiroshima was proclaimed a City of Peace by the Japanese parliament in 1949, at the initiative of its mayor, Shinzo Hamai (1905\u20131968). As a result, the city of Hiroshima received more international attention as a desirable location for holding international conferences on peace as well as social issues. As part of that effort, the Hiroshima Interpreters' and Guide's Association (HIGA) was established in 1992 to facilitate interpretation for conferences, and the Hiroshima Peace Institute was established in 1998 within the Hiroshima University. The city government continues to advocate the abolition of all nuclear weapons and the Mayor of Hiroshima is the president of Mayors for Peace, an international Mayoral organization mobilizing cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.On May 27, 2016, Barack Obama became the first sitting United States president to visit Hiroshima since the atomic bombing.Schedule\nHiroshima is situated on the \u014cta River delta, on Hiroshima Bay, facing the Seto Inland Sea on its south side. The river's six channels divide Hiroshima into several islets.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHiroshima has a humid subtropical climate characterized by cool to mild winters and hot humid summers. Like much of the rest of Japan, Hiroshima experiences a seasonal temperature lag in summer; with August rather than July being the warmest month of the year. Precipitation occurs year-round, although winter is the driest season. Rainfall peaks in June and July, with August experiencing sunnier and drier conditions.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nHiroshima has eight wards (ku):\n\n\n=== Places of interest ===\nThere are many popular tourist destinations near Hiroshima.

Before World War II, Hiroshima's population had grown to 360,000, and peaked at 419,182 in 1942. Following the atomic bombing in 1945, the population dropped to 137,197. By 1955, the city's population had returned to pre-war levels.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\nHiroshima Flower Festival, May 3\u20135, Heiwa Odori, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park\nToukasan, first Friday to Sunday in June, Mikawa-Cho, Chuo Dori\nEbisu Festival, November 18\u201320, Ebisucho, Hacchobori, Chuo Dori\nHiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony, August 6, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park\n1994 Asian Games\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nHiroshima has a professional symphony orchestra, which has performed at Wel City Hiroshima since 1963.  There are also many museums in Hiroshima, including the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, along with several art museums.  The Hiroshima Museum of Art, which has a large collection of French renaissance art, opened in 1978.  The Hiroshima Prefectural Art Museum opened in 1968 and is located near Shukkei-en gardens.

The park also contains a large collection of monuments, including the Children's Peace Monument, the Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims and many others.\nHiroshima's rebuilt castle (nicknamed Rij\u014d, meaning Koi Castle) houses a museum of life in the Edo period. Hiroshima Gokoku Shrine is within the walls of the castle. Other attractions in Hiroshima include Shukkei-en, Fud\u014din, Mitaki-dera, and Hijiyama Park.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHiroshima is known for okonomiyaki, a savory (umami) pancake cooked on an iron plate, usually in front of the customer. It is cooked with various ingredients, which are layered rather than mixed as done with the Osaka version of okonomiyaki. The layers are typically egg, cabbage, bean sprouts (moyashi), sliced pork/bacon with optional items (mayonnaise, fried squid, octopus, cheese, mochi, kimchi, etc.), and noodles (soba, udon) topped with another layer of egg and a generous dollop of okonomiyaki sauce (Carp and Otafuku are two popular brands). The amount of cabbage used is usually 3 to 4 times the amount used in the Osaka style. It starts piled very high and is generally pushed down as the cabbage cooks. The order of the layers may vary slightly depending on the chef's style and preference, and ingredients will vary depending on the preference of the customer.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nHiroshima has several professional sports clubs. The city's main association football club is Sanfrecce Hiroshima, who play at the Hiroshima Big Arch. As Toyo Kogyo Soccer Club, they won the Japan Soccer League five times between 1965 and 1970 and the Emperor's Cup in 1965, 1967 and 1969. After adopting their current name in 1992, the club won the J.League in 2012 and 2013. The city's main women's football club is Angeviolet Hiroshima. Defunct clubs include Rijo Shukyu FC, who won the Emperor's Cup in 1924 and 1925, and \u1ebcfini Hiroshima SC.\nHiroshima Toyo Carp are the city's major baseball club, and play at the Mazda Zoom-Zoom Stadium Hiroshima. Members of the Central League, the club won the Japan Series in 1979, 1980 and 1984. Other sports clubs include Hiroshima Dragonflies (basketball), Hiroshima Maple Reds (handball) and JT Thunders (volleyball).\nThe Woodone Open Hiroshima was part of the Japan Golf Tour between 1973 and 2007. The city also hosted the 1994 Asian Games, using the Big Arch stadium, which is now used for the annual Mikio Oda Memorial International Amateur Athletic Game. The now-called Hiroshima Prefectural Sports Center was one of the host arenas of the 2006 FIBA World Championship (basketball).\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Health care ===\n\n\n==== Hospitals ====\nHiroshima City Hospital\nHiroshima City Asa Hospital\nHiroshima City Funairi Hospital\nHiroshima Prefectural Hospital\nHiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital\nHiroshima University Hospital\nJapan Post Hiroshima Hospital\nJR Hiroshima Hospital\n\n\n=== Media ===\nThe Ch\u016bgoku Shimbun is the local newspaper serving Hiroshima.

Hiroshima is also served by NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, with television and radio broadcasting.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Air ====\nHiroshima is served by Hiroshima Airport (IATA: HIJ, ICAO: RJOA), located 50 kilometres (31 mi) east of the city, with regular flights to Tokyo, Sapporo, Sendai,  Okinawa, and also to China, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea.\n\n\n==== Trains ====\nJR West\nSan'y\u014d Shinkansen, San'y\u014d Main Line, Kure Line, Geibi Line, Kabe Line\nHiroshima New Transit Line 1\nHiroshima Short Distance Transit Seno Line\n\n\n==== Streetcars ====\n\nHiroshima is notable, in Japan, for its light rail system, nicknamed Hiroden, and the \"Moving Streetcar Museum.\" Streetcar service started in 1912, was interrupted by the atomic bomb, and was restored as soon as was practical. (Service between Koi/Nishi Hiroshima and Tenma-cho was started up three days after the bombing.)\nStreetcars and light rail vehicles are still rolling down Hiroshima's streets, including streetcars 651 and 652, which survived the atomic blast and are among the older streetcars in the system. When Kyoto and Fukuoka discontinued their trolley systems, Hiroshima bought them up at discounted prices, and, by 2011, the city had 298 streetcars, more than any other city in Japan.\nHiroden\nMain Line, Ujina Line, Eba Line, Hakushima Line, Hijiyama Line, Yokogawa Line, Miyajima Line\n\n\n==== Automobiles ====\nHiroshima is served by Japan National Route 2, Japan National Route 54, Japan National Route 183, Japan National Route 261 Japan National Route 433, Japan National Route 487, Japan National Route 488,  Hiroshima Prefectural Route 37 (Hiroshima-Miyoshi Route), Hiroshima Prefectural Route 70 (Hiroshima-Nakashima Route), Hiroshima Prefectural Route 84 (Higashi Kaita Hiroshima Route), Hiroshima Prefectural Route 164 (Hiroshima-Kaita Route), and Hiroshima Prefectural Route 264 (Nakayama-Onaga Route).\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nThe Japanese city and the Prefecture of Hiroshima may have been devastated by the atomic bomb over 73 years ago, but today, this site of the destruction is one of the top tourist destinations in the entire country.  Statistics released by the nation's tourist agency revealed that around 363,000 visitors went to the metropolis during 2012, with Americans making up the vast majority of that figure, followed by Australians and Chinese.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nHiroshima University was established in 1949, as part of a national restructuring of the education system. One national university was set up in each prefecture, including Hiroshima University, which combined eight existing institutions (Hiroshima University of Literature and Science, Hiroshima School of Secondary Education, Hiroshima School of Education, Hiroshima Women's School of Secondary Education, Hiroshima School of Education for Youth, Hiroshima Higher School, Hiroshima Higher Technical School, and Hiroshima Municipal Higher Technical School), with the Hiroshima Prefectural Medical College added in 1953. But, in 1972 the relocation of Hiroshima University has decided from urban areas of Hiroshima City to wider campus in Higashihiroshima City. By 1995 almost all campuses were relocated to Higashihiroshima. But, School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Graduate School in these fields in Kasumi Campus and Law School and Center for Research on Regional Economic System in Higashi-Senda Campus are still in Hiroshima City.Notable art institutions include the Elisabeth University of Music and Actor\u2019s School Hiroshima.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nHiroshima has six overseas sister cities:\n Honolulu, Hawaii, United States (1959)\n Volgograd, Russia (1972)\n Hanover, Germany (1983)\n Chongqing, China (1986)\n Daegu, South Korea (1997)\n Montreal, Quebec, Canada (1998)Within Japan, Hiroshima has a similar relationship with Nagasaki.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPacific War Research Society, Japan's Longest Day (Kodansha, 2002, ISBN 4770028873), the internal Japanese account of the surrender and how it was almost thwarted by fanatic soldiers who attempted a coup against the Emperor.\nRichard B.

        "wiki": "The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom, as required by the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.\nIn the final year of World War II, the Allies prepared for a very costly invasion of the Japanese mainland. This undertaking was preceded by a conventional and firebombing campaign which devastated 67 Japanese cities. The war in Europe had concluded when Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8, 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific theater. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945, the alternative being \"prompt and utter destruction\". Japan ignored the ultimatum and the war continued.\nBy August 1945, the Allies' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bombs, and the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) was equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands. The Allies issued orders for atomic bombs to be used on four Japanese cities on July 25. On August 6, one of the modified B-29s dropped a uranium gun-type bomb (\"Little Boy\") on Hiroshima. Another B-29 dropped a plutonium implosion bomb (\"Fat Man\") on Nagasaki three days later. The bombs immediately devastated their targets. Over the next two to four months, the acute effects of the atomic bombings killed between 90,000 and 146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000 and 80,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. Large numbers of people continued to die for months afterward from the effects of burns, radiation sickness, and other injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.\nJapan surrendered to the Allies on August 15, six days after the Soviet Union's declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September 2 in Tokyo Bay, which effectively ended World War II. Scholars have extensively studied the effects of the bombings on the social and political character of subsequent world history and popular culture, and there is still much debate concerning the ethical and legal justification for the bombings.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Pacific War ===\n\nIn 1945, the Pacific War between the Empire of Japan and the Allies entered its fourth year. Most Japanese military units fought fiercely, ensuring that the Allied victory would come at an enormous cost. The 1.25 million battle casualties incurred in total by the United States in World War II included both military personnel killed in action and wounded in action. Nearly one million of the casualties occurred during the last year of the war, from June 1944 to June 1945. In December 1944, American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 as a result of the German Ardennes Offensive. America's reserves of manpower were running out. Deferments for groups such as agricultural workers were tightened, and there was consideration of drafting women. At the same time, the public was becoming war-weary, and demanding that long-serving servicemen be sent home.In the Pacific, the Allies returned to the Philippines, recaptured Burma, and invaded Borneo. Offensives were undertaken to reduce the Japanese forces remaining in Bougainville, New Guinea and the Philippines. In April 1945, American forces landed on Okinawa, where heavy fighting continued until June. Along the way, the ratio of Japanese to American casualties dropped from 5:1 in the Philippines to 2:1 on Okinawa. Although some Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner, most fought until they were killed or committed suicide. Nearly 99% of the 21,000 defenders of Iwo Jima were killed. Of the 117,000 Okinawan and Japanese troops defending Okinawa in April\u2013June 1945, 94% were killed; 7,401 Japanese soldiers surrendered, an unprecedentedly large number.As the Allies advanced towards Japan, conditions became steadily worse for the Japanese people. Japan's merchant fleet declined from 5,250,000 gross tons in 1941 to 1,560,000 tons in March 1945, and 557,000 tons in August 1945. Lack of raw materials forced the Japanese war economy into a steep decline after the middle of 1944. The civilian economy, which had slowly deteriorated throughout the war, reached disastrous levels by the middle of 1945. The loss of shipping also affected the fishing fleet, and the 1945 catch was only 22% of that in 1941. The 1945 rice harvest was the worst since 1909, and hunger and malnutrition became widespread. U.S. industrial production was overwhelmingly superior to Japan's. By 1943, the U.S. produced almost 100,000 aircraft a year, compared to Japan's production of 70,000 for the entire war. By the middle of 1944, the U.S. had almost a hundred aircraft carriers in the Pacific, far more than Japan's twenty-five for the entire war. In February 1945, Prince Fumimaro Konoe advised Emperor Hirohito that defeat was inevitable, and urged him to abdicate.\n\n\n=== Preparations to invade Japan ===\n\nEven before the surrender of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, Operation Downfall, the Allied invasion of Japan. The operation had two parts: Operation Olympic and Operation Coronet. Set to begin in October 1945, Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S. Sixth Army intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Operation Olympic was to be followed in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the Kant\u014d Plain, near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of Honsh\u016b by the U.S. First, Eighth and Tenth Armies, as well as a Commonwealth Corps made up of Australian, British and Canadian divisions. The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete its objectives, for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the Japanese winter to pass.\n\nJapan's geography made this invasion plan obvious to the Japanese; they were able to predict the Allied invasion plans accurately and thus adjust their defensive plan, Operation Ketsug\u014d, accordingly. The Japanese planned an all-out defense of Ky\u016bsh\u016b, with little left in reserve for any subsequent defense operations. Four veteran divisions were withdrawn from the Kwantung Army in Manchuria in March 1945 to strengthen the forces in Japan, and 45 new divisions were activated between February and May 1945. Most were immobile formations for coastal defense, but 16 were high quality mobile divisions. In all, there were 2.3 million Japanese Army troops prepared to defend the home islands, backed by a civilian militia of 28 million men and women. Casualty predictions varied widely, but were extremely high. The Vice Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, Vice Admiral Takijir\u014d \u014cnishi, predicted up to 20 million Japanese deaths.On June 15, 1945, a study by the Joint War Plans Committee, who provided planning information to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that Olympic would result in 130,000 to 220,000 U.S. casualties, with U.S. dead in the range from 25,000 to 46,000. Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses due to the very effective sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign. The Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army George Marshall, and the Army Commander in Chief in the Pacific, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, signed documents agreeing with the Joint War Plans Committee estimate.The Americans were alarmed by the Japanese buildup, which was accurately tracked through Ultra intelligence. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson was sufficiently concerned about high American estimates of probable casualties to commission his own study by Quincy Wright and William Shockley. Wright and Shockley spoke with Colonels James McCormack and Dean Rusk, and examined casualty forecasts by Michael E. DeBakey and Gilbert Beebe. Wright and Shockley estimated the invading Allies would suffer between 1.7 and 4 million casualties in such a scenario, of whom between 400,000 and 800,000 would be dead, while Japanese fatalities would have been around 5 to 10 million.Marshall began contemplating the use of a weapon that was \"readily available and which assuredly can decrease the cost in American lives\": poison gas. Quantities of phosgene, mustard gas, tear gas and cyanogen chloride were moved to Luzon from stockpiles in Australia and New Guinea in preparation for Operation Olympic, and MacArthur ensured that Chemical Warfare Service units were trained in their use. Consideration was also given to using biological weapons against Japan.\n\n\n=== Air raids on Japan ===\n\nWhile the United States had developed plans for an air campaign against Japan prior to the Pacific War, the capture of Allied bases in the western Pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944 when the long-ranged Boeing B-29 Superfortress became ready for use in combat. Operation Matterhorn involved India-based B-29s staging through bases around Chengdu in China to make a series of raids on strategic targets in Japan. This effort failed to achieve the strategic objectives that its planners had intended, largely because of logistical problems, the bomber's mechanical difficulties, the vulnerability of Chinese staging bases, and the extreme range required to reach key Japanese cities.Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell determined that Guam, Tinian, and Saipan in the Mariana Islands would better serve as B-29 bases, but they were in Japanese hands. Strategies were shifted to accommodate the air war, and the islands were captured between June and August 1944. Air bases were developed, and B-29 operations commenced from the Marianas in October 1944. These bases were easily resupplied by cargo ships. The XXI Bomber Command began missions against Japan on November 18, 1944. The early attempts to bomb Japan from the Marianas proved just as ineffective as the China-based B-29s had been. Hansell continued the practice of conducting so-called high-altitude precision bombing, aimed at key industries and transportation networks, even after these tactics had not produced acceptable results. These efforts proved unsuccessful due to logistical difficulties with the remote location, technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft, unfavorable weather conditions, and enemy action.\n\nHansell's successor, Major General Curtis LeMay, assumed command in January 1945 and initially continued to use the same precision bombing tactics, with equally unsatisfactory results. The attacks initially targeted key industrial facilities but much of the Japanese manufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private homes. Under pressure from United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) headquarters in Washington, LeMay changed tactics and decided that low-level incendiary raids against Japanese cities were the only way to destroy their production capabilities, shifting from precision bombing to area bombardment with incendiaries. Like most strategic bombing during World War II, the aim of the air offensive against Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale.Over the next six months, the XXI Bomber Command under LeMay firebombed 67 Japanese cities. The firebombing of Tokyo, codenamed Operation Meetinghouse, on March 9\u201310 killed an estimated 100,000 people and destroyed 16 square miles (41 km2) of the city and 267,000 buildings in a single night. It was the deadliest bombing raid of the war, at a cost of 20 B-29s shot down by flak and fighters. By May, 75% of bombs dropped were incendiaries designed to burn down Japan's \"paper cities\". By mid-June, Japan's six largest cities had been devastated. The end of the fighting on Okinawa that month provided airfields even closer to the Japanese mainland, allowing the bombing campaign to be further escalated. Aircraft flying from Allied aircraft carriers and the Ryukyu Islands also regularly struck targets in Japan during 1945 in preparation for Operation Downfall. Firebombing switched to smaller cities, with populations ranging from 60,000 to 350,000. According to Yuki Tanaka, the U.S. fire-bombed over a hundred Japanese towns and cities. These raids were devastating.The Japanese military was unable to stop the Allied attacks and the country's civil defense preparations proved inadequate. Japanese fighters and anti-aircraft guns had difficulty engaging bombers flying at high altitude. From April 1945, the Japanese interceptors also had to face American fighter escorts based on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. That month, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service stopped attempting to intercept the air raids to preserve fighter aircraft to counter the expected invasion. By mid-1945 the Japanese only occasionally scrambled aircraft to intercept individual B-29s conducting reconnaissance sorties over the country, to conserve supplies of fuel. In July 1945, the Japanese had 1,156,000 US barrels (137,800,000 l) of avgas stockpiled for the invasion of Japan. About 604,000 US barrels (72,000,000 l) had been consumed in the home islands area in April, May and June 1945. While the Japanese military decided to resume attacks on Allied bombers from late June, by this time there were too few operational fighters available for this change of tactics to hinder the Allied air raids.\n\n\n=== Atomic bomb development ===\n\nThe discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, made the development of an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility. Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939. Progress was slow until the arrival of the British MAUD Committee report in late 1941, which indicated that only 5 to 10 kilograms of isotopically enriched uranium-235 were needed for a bomb instead of tons of natural uranium and a neutron moderator like heavy water.The 1943 Quebec Agreement merged the nuclear weapons projects of the United Kingdom and Canada, Tube Alloys and the Montreal Laboratory, with the Manhattan Project, under the direction of Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Groves appointed J. Robert Oppenheimer to organize and head the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where bomb design work was carried out. Two types of bombs were eventually developed, both named by Robert Serber. Little Boy was a gun-type fission weapon that used uranium-235, a rare isotope of uranium separated at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The other, known as a Fat Man device, was a more powerful and efficient, but more complicated, implosion-type nuclear weapon that used plutonium created in nuclear reactors at Hanford, Washington.There was a Japanese nuclear weapon program, but it lacked the human, mineral and financial resources of the Manhattan Project, and never made much progress towards developing an atomic bomb.\n\n\n== Preparations ==\n\n\n=== Organization and training ===\n\nThe 509th Composite Group was constituted on December 9, 1944, and activated on December 17, 1944, at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, commanded by Colonel Paul Tibbets. Tibbets was assigned to organize and command a combat group to develop the means of delivering an atomic weapon against targets in Germany and Japan. Because the flying squadrons of the group consisted of both bomber and transport aircraft, the group was designated as a \"composite\" rather than a \"bombardment\" unit. Working with the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, Tibbets selected Wendover for his training base over Great Bend, Kansas, and Mountain Home, Idaho, because of its remoteness. Each bombardier completed at least 50 practice drops of inert or conventional explosive pumpkin bombs and Tibbets declared his group combat-ready. On April 5, 1945, the code name Operation Centerboard was assigned. The officer responsible for its allocation in the War Department's Operations Division was not cleared to know any details of it. The first bombing was later codenamed Operation Centerboard I, and the second, Operation Centerboard II.\n\nThe 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom eventually deployed to Tinian. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian 51 civilian and military personnel from Project Alberta, known as the 1st Technical Detachment. The 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron was equipped with 15 Silverplate B-29s. These aircraft were specially adapted to carry nuclear weapons, and were equipped with fuel-injected engines, Curtiss Electric reversible-pitch propellers, pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors and other improvements.The ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group moved by rail on April 26, 1945, to its port of embarkation at Seattle, Washington. On May 6 the support elements sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner. The Cape Victory made brief port calls at Honolulu and Eniwetok but the passengers were not permitted to leave the dock area. An advance party of the air echelon, consisting of 29 officers and 61 enlisted men flew by C-54 to North Field on Tinian, between May 15 and May 22. There were also two representatives from Washington, D.C., Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, the deputy commander of the Manhattan Project, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell of the Military Policy Committee, who were on hand to decide higher policy matters on the spot. Along with Captain William S. Parsons, the commander of Project Alberta, they became known as the \"Tinian Joint Chiefs\".\n\n\n=== Choice of targets ===\n\nIn April 1945, Marshall asked Groves to nominate specific targets for bombing for final approval by himself and Stimson. Groves formed a Target Committee, chaired by himself, that included Farrell, Major John A. Derry, Colonel William P. Fisher, Joyce C. Stearns and David M. Dennison from the USAAF; and scientists John von Neumann, Robert R. Wilson and William Penney from the Manhattan Project. The Target Committee met in Washington on April 27; at Los Alamos on May 10, where it was able to talk to the scientists and technicians there; and finally in Washington on May 28, where it was briefed by Tibbets and Commander Frederick Ashworth from Project Alberta, and the Manhattan Project's scientific advisor, Richard C. Tolman.The Target Committee nominated five targets: Kokura (now Kitakyushu), the site of one of Japan's largest munitions plants; Hiroshima, an embarkation port and industrial center that was the site of a major military headquarters; Yokohama, an urban center for aircraft manufacture, machine tools, docks, electrical equipment and oil refineries; Niigata, a port with industrial facilities including steel and aluminum plants and an oil refinery; and Kyoto, a major industrial center. The target selection was subject to the following criteria:\n\nThe target was larger than 3 mi (4.8 km) in diameter and was an important target in a large city.\nThe blast would create effective damage.\nThe target was unlikely to be attacked by August 1945.These cities were largely untouched during the nightly bombing raids, and the Army Air Forces agreed to leave them off the target list so accurate assessment of the damage caused by the atomic bombs could be made. Hiroshima was described as \"an important army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged. There are adjacent hills which are likely to produce a focusing effect which would considerably increase the blast damage. Due to rivers it is not a good incendiary target.\"The Target Committee stated that \"It was agreed that psychological factors in the target selection were of great importance. Two aspects of this are (1) obtaining the greatest psychological effect against Japan and (2) making the initial use sufficiently spectacular for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized when publicity on it is released. ... Kyoto has the advantage of the people being more highly intelligent and hence better able to appreciate the significance of the weapon. Hiroshima has the advantage of being such a size and with possible focussing from nearby mountains that a large fraction of the city may be destroyed. The Emperor's palace in Tokyo has a greater fame than any other target but is of least strategic value.\"Edwin O. Reischauer, a Japan expert for the U.S. Army Intelligence Service, was incorrectly said to have prevented the bombing of Kyoto. In his autobiography, Reischauer specifically refuted this claim:\n\n... the only person deserving credit for saving Kyoto from destruction is Henry L. Stimson, the Secretary of War at the time, who had known and admired Kyoto ever since his honeymoon there several decades earlier. \nOn May 30, Stimson asked Groves to remove Kyoto from the target list due to its historical, religious and cultural significance, but Groves pointed to its military and industrial significance. Stimson then approached President Harry S. Truman about the matter. Truman agreed with Stimson, and Kyoto was temporarily removed from the target list. Groves attempted to restore Kyoto to the target list in July, but Stimson remained adamant. On July 25, Nagasaki was put on the target list in place of Kyoto. It was a major military port, one of Japan's largest shipbuilding and repair centers, and an important producer of naval ordnance.\n\n\n=== Proposed demonstration ===\nIn early May 1945, the Interim Committee was created by Stimson at the urging of leaders of the Manhattan Project and with the approval of Truman to advise on matters pertaining to nuclear energy. During the meetings on May 31 and June 1, scientist Ernest Lawrence had suggested giving the Japanese a non-combat demonstration. Arthur Compton later recalled that:It was evident that everyone would suspect trickery. If a bomb were exploded in Japan with previous notice, the Japanese air power was still adequate to give serious interference. An atomic bomb was an intricate device, still in the developmental stage. Its operation would be far from routine. If during the final adjustments of the bomb the Japanese defenders should attack, a faulty move might easily result in some kind of failure. Such an end to an advertised demonstration of power would be much worse than if the attempt had not been made. It was now evident that when the time came for the bombs to be used we should have only one of them available, followed afterwards by others at all-too-long intervals. We could not afford the chance that one of them might be a dud. If the test were made on some neutral territory, it was hard to believe that Japan's determined and fanatical military men would be impressed. If such an open test were made first and failed to bring surrender, the chance would be gone to give the shock of surprise that proved so effective. On the contrary, it would make the Japanese ready to interfere with an atomic attack if they could. Though the possibility of a demonstration that would not destroy human lives was attractive, no one could suggest a way in which it could be made so convincing that it would be likely to stop the war. \nThe possibility of a demonstration was raised again in the Franck Report issued by physicist James Franck on June 11 and the Scientific Advisory Panel rejected his report on June 16, saying that \"we can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war; we see no acceptable alternative to direct military use.\" Franck then took the report to Washington, D.C., where the Interim Committee met on June 21 to re-examine its earlier conclusions; but it reaffirmed that there was no alternative to the use of the bomb on a military target.Like Compton, many U.S. officials and scientists argued that a demonstration would sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack, and the Japanese could deny the atomic bomb was lethal, making the mission less likely to produce surrender. Allied prisoners of war might be moved to the demonstration site and be killed by the bomb. They also worried that the bomb might be a dud since the Trinity test was of a stationary device, not an air-dropped bomb. In addition, although more bombs were in production, only two would be available at the start of August, and they cost billions of dollars, so using one for a demonstration would be expensive.\n\n\n=== Leaflets ===\n\nFor several months, the U.S. had warned civilians of potential air raids by dropping more than 63 million leaflets across Japan. Many Japanese cities suffered terrible damage from aerial bombings; some were as much as 97% destroyed. LeMay thought that leaflets would increase the psychological impact of bombing, and reduce the international stigma of area-bombing cities. Even with the warnings, Japanese opposition to the war remained ineffective. In general, the Japanese regarded the leaflet messages as truthful, with many Japanese choosing to leave major cities. The leaflets caused such concern that the government ordered the arrest of anyone caught in possession of a leaflet. Leaflet texts were prepared by recent Japanese prisoners of war because they were thought to be the best choice \"to appeal to their compatriots\".In preparation for dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the Oppenheimer-led Scientific Panel of the Interim Committee decided against a demonstration bomb and against a special leaflet warning. Those decisions were implemented because of the uncertainty of a successful detonation and also because of the wish to maximize shock in the leadership. No warning was given to Hiroshima that a new and much more destructive bomb was going to be dropped. Various sources gave conflicting information about when the last leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima prior to the atomic bomb. Robert Jay Lifton wrote that it was July 27, and Theodore H. McNelly wrote that it was July 30. The USAAF history noted that eleven cities were targeted with leaflets on July 27, but Hiroshima was not one of them, and there were no leaflet sorties on July 30. Leaflet sorties were undertaken on August 1 and August 4. Hiroshima may have been leafleted in late July or early August, as survivor accounts talk about a delivery of leaflets a few days before the atomic bomb was dropped. Three versions were printed of a leaflet listing 11 or 12 cities targeted for firebombing; a total of 33 cities listed. With the text of this leaflet reading in Japanese \"...we cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked...\" Hiroshima was not listed.\n\n\n=== Consultation with Britain and Canada ===\n\nIn 1943, The United States and the United Kingdom signed the Quebec Agreement, which stipulated that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. Stimson therefore had to obtain British permission. A meeting of the Combined Policy Committee, which included one Canadian representative, was held at the Pentagon on July 4, 1945. Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson announced that the British government concurred with the use of nuclear weapons against Japan, which would be officially recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee. As the release of information to third parties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion then turned to what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the bombing. The meeting also considered what Truman could reveal to Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, at the upcoming Potsdam Conference, as this also required British concurrence.\nOrders for the attack were issued to General Carl Spaatz on July 25 under the signature of General Thomas T. Handy, the acting Chief of Staff, since Marshall was at the Potsdam Conference with Truman. It read:\nThe 509th Composite Group, 20th Air Force will deliver its first special bomb as soon as weather will permit visual bombing after about 3 August 1945 on one of the targets: Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata and Nagasaki. To carry military and civilian scientific personnel from the War Department to observe and record the effects of the explosion of the bomb, additional aircraft will accompany the airplane carrying the bomb. The observing planes will stay several miles distant from the point of impact of the bomb.\nAdditional bombs will be delivered on the above targets as soon as made ready by the project staff. Further instructions will be issued concerning targets other than those listed above. \nThat day, Truman noted in his diary that:This weapon is to be used against Japan between now and August 10th. I have told the Sec. of War, Mr. Stimson, to use it so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children. Even if the Japs are savages, ruthless, merciless and fanatic, we as the leader of the world for the common welfare cannot drop that terrible bomb on the old capital [Kyoto] or the new [Tokyo]. He and I are in accord. The target will be a purely military one. \n\n\n=== Potsdam Declaration ===\n\nThe July 16 success of the Trinity Test in the New Mexico desert exceeded expectations. On July 26, Allied leaders issued the Potsdam Declaration, which outlined the terms of surrender for Japan. The declaration was presented as an ultimatum and stated that without a surrender, the Allies would attack Japan, resulting in \"the inevitable and complete destruction of the Japanese armed forces and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Japanese homeland\". The atomic bomb was not mentioned in the communiqu\u00e9.On July 28, Japanese papers reported that the declaration had been rejected by the Japanese government. That afternoon, Prime Minister Suzuki Kantar\u014d declared at a press conference that the Potsdam Declaration was no more than a rehash (yakinaoshi) of the Cairo Declaration and that the government intended to ignore it (mokusatsu, \"kill by silence\"). The statement was taken by both Japanese and foreign papers as a clear rejection of the declaration. Emperor Hirohito, who was waiting for a Soviet reply to non-committal Japanese peace feelers, made no move to change the government position. Japan's willingness to surrender remained conditional on the preservation of the kokutai (Imperial institution and national polity), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for disarmament and demobilization, no occupation of the Japanese Home Islands, Korea or Formosa, and delegation of the punishment of war criminals to the Japanese government.At Potsdam, Truman agreed to a request from Winston Churchill that Britain be represented when the atomic bomb was dropped. William Penney and Group Captain Leonard Cheshire were sent to Tinian, but found that LeMay would not let them accompany the mission. All they could do was send a strongly worded signal to Wilson.\n\n\n=== Bombs ===\nThe Little Boy bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. There were two uranium-235 components, a hollow cylindrical projectile and a cylindrical target insert. The projectile was completed on June 15, and the target insert on July 24. The projectile and eight bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the powder charge and fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on July 16 aboard the cruiser USS Indianapolis, and arrived on Tinian on July 26. The target insert followed by air on July 30, accompanied by Commander Francis Birch from Project Alberta. Responding to concerns expressed by the 509th Composite Group about the possibility of a B-29 crashing on takeoff, Birch had modified the Little Boy design to incorporate a removable breech plug that would permit the bomb to be armed in flight.The first plutonium core, along with its polonium-beryllium urchin initiator, was transported in the custody of Project Alberta courier Raemer Schreiber in a magnesium field carrying case designed for the purpose by Philip Morrison. Magnesium was chosen because it does not act as a tamper. The core departed from Kirtland Army Air Field on a C-54 transport aircraft of the 509th Composite Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on July 26, and arrived at North Field July 28. Three Fat Man high-explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, were picked up at Kirtland on July 28 by three B-29s, two from the 393d Bombardment Squadron plus one from the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit, and transported to North Field, arriving on August 2.\n\n\n== Hiroshima ==\n\n\n=== Hiroshima during World War II ===\n\nAt the time of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of industrial and military significance. A number of military units were located nearby, the most important of which was the headquarters of Field Marshal Shunroku Hata's Second General Army, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan, and was located in Hiroshima Castle. Hata's command consisted of some 400,000 men, most of whom were on Kyushu where an Allied invasion was correctly anticipated. Also present in Hiroshima were the headquarters of the 59th Army, the 5th Division and the 224th Division, a recently formed mobile unit. The city was defended by five batteries of 7-cm and 8-cm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) anti-aircraft guns of the 3rd Anti-Aircraft Division, including units from the 121st and 122nd Anti-Aircraft Regiments and the 22nd and 45th Separate Anti-Aircraft Battalions. In total, an estimated 40,000 Japanese military personnel were stationed in the city.Hiroshima was a supply and logistics base for the Japanese military. The city was a communications center, a key port for shipping, and an assembly area for troops. It was a beehive of war industry, manufacturing parts for planes and boats, for bombs, rifles, and handguns. The center of the city contained several reinforced concrete buildings and lighter structures. Outside the center, the area was congested by a dense collection of small timber workshops set among Japanese houses. A few larger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city. The houses were constructed of timber with tile roofs, and many of the industrial buildings were also built around timber frames. The city as a whole was highly susceptible to fire damage. It was the second largest city in Japan after Kyoto that was still undamaged by air raids, primarily because it lacked the aircraft manufacturing industry that was the XXI Bomber Command's priority target. On July 3, the Joint Chiefs of Staff placed it off limits to bombers, along with Kokura, Niigata and Kyoto.The population of Hiroshima had reached a peak of over 381,000 earlier in the war but prior to the atomic bombing, the population had steadily decreased because of a systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese government. At the time of the attack, the population was approximately 340,000\u2013350,000. Residents wondered why Hiroshima had been spared destruction by firebombing. Some speculated that the city was to be saved for U.S. occupation headquarters, others thought perhaps their relatives in Hawaii and California had petitioned the U.S. government to avoid bombing Hiroshima. More realistic city officials had ordered buildings torn down to create long, straight firebreaks. These continued to be expanded and extended up to the morning of August 6, 1945.\n\n\n=== Bombing of Hiroshima ===\nHiroshima was the primary target of the first atomic bombing mission on August 6, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets. The 393d Bombardment Squadron B-29 Enola Gay, named after Tibbets' mother and piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, Tinian, about six hours' flight time from Japan. Enola Gay was accompanied by two other B-29s: The Great Artiste, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, which carried instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt, which served as the photography aircraft.\n\nAfter leaving Tinian, the aircraft made their way separately to Iwo Jima to rendezvous with Sweeney and Marquardt at 05:55 at 9,200 feet (2,800 m), and set course for Japan. The aircraft arrived over the target in clear visibility at 31,060 feet (9,470 m). Parsons, who was in command of the mission, armed the bomb in flight to minimize the risks during takeoff. He had witnessed four B-29s crash and burn at takeoff, and feared that a nuclear explosion would occur if a B-29 crashed with an armed Little Boy on board. His assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, removed the safety devices 30 minutes before reaching the target area.\n\nDuring the night of August 5\u20136, Japanese early warning radar detected the approach of numerous American aircraft headed for the southern part of Japan. Radar detected 65 bombers headed for Saga, 102 bound for Maebashi, 261 en route to Nishinomiya, 111 headed for Ube and 66 bound for Imabari. An alert was given and radio broadcasting stopped in many cities, among them Hiroshima. The all-clear was sounded in Hiroshima at 00:05. About an hour before the bombing, the air raid alert was sounded again, as Straight Flush flew over the city. It broadcast a short message which was picked up by Enola Gay. It read: \"Cloud cover less than 3/10th at all altitudes. Advice: bomb primary.\" The all-clear was sounded over Hiroshima again at 07:09.At 08:09, Tibbets started his bomb run and handed control over to his bombardier, Major Thomas Ferebee. The release at 08:15 (Hiroshima time) went as planned, and the Little Boy containing about 64 kg (141 lb) of uranium-235 took 44.4 seconds to fall from the aircraft flying at about 31,000 feet (9,400 m) to a detonation height of about 1,900 feet (580 m) above the city. Enola Gay traveled 11.5 mi (18.5 km) before it felt the shock waves from the blast.Due to crosswind, the bomb missed the aiming point, the Aioi Bridge, by approximately 800 ft (240 m) and detonated directly over Shima Surgical Clinic. It released the equivalent energy of 16 kilotons of TNT (67 TJ), \u00b1 2 kt. The weapon was considered very inefficient, with only 1.7% of its material fissioning. The radius of total destruction was about 1 mile (1.6 km), with resulting fires across 4.4 square miles (11 km2).Enola Gay stayed over the target area for two minutes and was ten miles away when the bomb detonated. Only Tibbets, Parsons, and Ferebee knew of the nature of the weapon; the others on the bomber were only told to expect a blinding flash and given black goggles. \"It was hard to believe what we saw\", Tibbets told reporters, while Parsons said \"the whole thing was tremendous and awe-inspiring ... the men aboard with me gasped 'My God'\". He and Tibbets compared the shockwave to \"a close burst of ack-ack fire\".\n\n\n=== Events on the ground ===\nPeople on the ground reported a pika (\u30d4\u30ab)\u2014a brilliant flash of light\u2014followed by a don (\u30c9\u30f3)\u2014a loud booming sound. Some 70,000\u201380,000 people, around 30% of the population of Hiroshima at the time, were killed by the blast and resultant firestorm, and another 70,000 were injured. It is estimated that as many as 20,000 Japanese military personnel were killed. U.S. surveys estimated that 4.7 square miles (12 km2) of the city were destroyed. Japanese officials determined that 69% of Hiroshima's buildings were destroyed and another 6\u20137% damaged.Some of the reinforced concrete buildings in Hiroshima had been very strongly constructed because of the earthquake danger in Japan, and their framework did not collapse even though they were fairly close to the blast center. Since the bomb detonated in the air, the blast was directed more downward than sideways, which was largely responsible for the survival of the Prefectural Industrial Promotional Hall, now commonly known as the Genbaku (A-bomb) dome. This building was designed and built by the Czech architect Jan Letzel, and was only 150 m (490 ft) from ground zero (the hypocenter). The ruin was named Hiroshima Peace Memorial and was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 over the objections of the United States and China, which expressed reservations on the grounds that other Asian nations were the ones who suffered the greatest loss of life and property, and a focus on Japan lacked historical perspective. The bombing started intense fires that spread rapidly through timber and paper homes, burning everything in a radius of 2 kilometers (1.2 mi). As in other Japanese cities, the firebreaks proved ineffective.\n\nThe air raid warning had been cleared at 07:31, and many people were outside, going about their activities. Eiz\u014d Nomura was the closest known survivor, being in the basement of a reinforced concrete building (it remained as the Rest House after the war) only 170 meters (560 ft) from ground zero at the time of the attack. He died in 1982, aged 84. Akiko Takakura was among the closest survivors to the hypocenter of the blast. She was in the solidly-built Bank of Hiroshima only 300 meters (980 ft) from ground-zero at the time of the attack.\n\nOver 90% of the doctors and 93% of the nurses in Hiroshima were killed or injured\u2014most had been in the downtown area which received the greatest damage. The hospitals were destroyed or heavily damaged. Only one doctor, Terufumi Sasaki, remained on duty at the Red Cross Hospital. Nonetheless, by early afternoon the police and volunteers had established evacuation centres at hospitals, schools and tram stations, and a morgue was established in the Asano library.Most elements of the Japanese Second General Army headquarters were undergoing physical training on the grounds of Hiroshima Castle, barely 900 yards (820 m) from the hypocenter. The attack killed 3,243 troops on the parade ground. The communications room of Chugoku Military District Headquarters that was responsible for issuing and lifting air raid warnings was located in a semi-basement in the castle. Yoshie Oka, a Hijiyama Girls High School student who had been mobilized to serve as a communications officer, had just sent a message that the alarm had been issued for Hiroshima and neighboring Yamaguchi, when the bomb exploded. She used a special phone to inform Fukuyama Headquarters (some 100 kilometers (62 mi) away) that \"Hiroshima has been attacked by a new type of bomb. The city is in a state of near-total destruction.\"Since Mayor Senkichi Awaya had been killed while eating breakfast with his son and granddaughter at the mayoral residence, Field Marshal Shunroku Hata, who was only slightly wounded, took over the administration of the city, and coordinated relief efforts. Many of his staff had been killed or fatally wounded, including a Korean prince of the Joseon Dynasty, Yi U, who was serving as a lieutenant colonel in the Japanese Army. Hata's senior surviving staff officer was the wounded Colonel Kumao Imoto, who acted as his chief of staff. Soldiers from the undamaged Hiroshima Ujina Harbor used Shinyo-class suicide motorboats, intended to repel the American invasion, to collect the wounded and take them down the rivers to the military hospital at Ujina. Trucks and trains brought in relief supplies and evacuated survivors from the city.Twelve American airmen were imprisoned at the Chugoku Military Police Headquarters, about 1,300 feet (400 m) from the hypocenter of the blast. Most died instantly, although two were reported to have been executed by their captors, and two prisoners badly injured by the bombing were left next to the Aioi Bridge by the Kempei Tai, where they were stoned to death. Eight U.S. prisoners of war killed as part of the medical experiments program at Kyushu University were falsely reported by Japanese authorities as having been killed in the atomic blast as part of an attempted cover up.\n\n\n=== Japanese realization of the bombing ===\n\nThe Tokyo control operator of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation noticed that the Hiroshima station had gone off the air. He tried to re-establish his program by using another telephone line, but it too had failed. About 20 minutes later the Tokyo railroad telegraph center realized that the main line telegraph had stopped working just north of Hiroshima. From some small railway stops within 16 km (10 mi) of the city came unofficial and confused reports of a terrible explosion in Hiroshima. All these reports were transmitted to the headquarters of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff.Military bases repeatedly tried to call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It was felt that nothing serious had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.The staff officer went to the airport and took off for the southwest. After flying for about three hours, while still nearly 160 km (100 mi) from Hiroshima, he and his pilot saw a great cloud of smoke from the bomb. After circling the city to survey the damage they landed south of the city, where the staff officer, after reporting to Tokyo, began to organize relief measures. Tokyo's first indication that the city had been destroyed by a new type of bomb came from President Truman's announcement of the strike, sixteen hours later.\n\n\n== Events of August 7\u20139 ==\n\nAfter the Hiroshima bombing, Truman issued a statement announcing the use of the new weapon. He stated, \"We may be grateful to Providence\" that the German atomic bomb project had failed, and that the United States and its allies had \"spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history\u2014and won\". Truman then warned Japan: \"If they do not now accept our terms, they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth. Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well aware.\" This was a widely broadcast speech picked up by Japanese news agencies.\n\nThe 50,000-watt standard wave station on Saipan, the OWI radio station, broadcast a similar message to Japan every 15 minutes about Hiroshima, stating that more Japanese cities would face a similar fate in the absence of immediate acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration and emphatically urged civilians to evacuate major cities. Radio Japan, which continued to extoll victory for Japan by never surrendering, had informed the Japanese of the destruction of Hiroshima by a single bomb. Prime Minister Suzuki felt compelled to meet the Japanese press, to whom he reiterated his government's commitment to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on.Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov had informed Tokyo of the Soviet Union's unilateral abrogation of the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact on April 5. At two minutes past midnight on August 9, Tokyo time, Soviet infantry, armor, and air forces had launched the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation. Four hours later, word reached Tokyo of the Soviet Union's official declaration of war. The senior leadership of the Japanese Army began preparations to impose martial law on the nation, with the support of Minister of War Korechika Anami, to stop anyone attempting to make peace.On August 7, a day after Hiroshima was destroyed, Dr. Yoshio Nishina and other atomic physicists arrived at the city, and carefully examined the damage. They then went back to Tokyo and told the cabinet that Hiroshima was indeed destroyed by a nuclear weapon. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, estimated that no more than one or two additional bombs could be readied, so they decided to endure the remaining attacks, acknowledging \"there would be more destruction but the war would go on\". American Magic codebreakers intercepted the cabinet's messages.Purnell, Parsons, Tibbets, Spaatz, and LeMay met on Guam that same day to discuss what should be done next. Since there was no indication of Japan surrendering, they decided to proceed with dropping another bomb. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have it ready by August 11, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if the bomb could be readied by August 9. Parsons agreed to try to do so.\n\n\n== Nagasaki ==\n\n\n=== Nagasaki during World War II ===\n\nThe city of Nagasaki had been one of the largest seaports in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of ordnance, ships, military equipment, and other war materials. The four largest companies in the city were Mitsubishi Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90% of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90% of the city's industry. Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate at night with AN/APQ-13 radar.Unlike the other target cities, Nagasaki had not been placed off limits to bombers by the Joint Chiefs of Staff's July 3 directive, and was bombed on a small scale five times. During one of these raids on August 1, a number of conventional high-explosive bombs were dropped on the city. A few hit the shipyards and dock areas in the southwest portion of the city, and several hit the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works. By early August, the city was defended by the 134th Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the 4th Anti-Aircraft Division with four batteries of 7 cm (2.8 in) anti-aircraft guns and two searchlight batteries.\n\nIn contrast to Hiroshima, almost all of the buildings were of old-fashioned Japanese construction, consisting of timber or timber-framed buildings with timber walls (with or without plaster) and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of timber or other materials not designed to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had been permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley. On the day of the bombing, an estimated 263,000 people were in Nagasaki, including 240,000 Japanese residents, 10,000 Korean residents, 2,500 conscripted Korean workers, 9,000 Japanese soldiers, 600 conscripted Chinese workers, and 400 Allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of Nagasaki.\n\n\n=== Bombing of Nagasaki ===\nResponsibility for the timing of the second bombing was delegated to Tibbets. Scheduled for August 11 against Kokura, the raid was moved earlier by two days to avoid a five-day period of bad weather forecast to begin on August 10. Three bomb pre-assemblies had been transported to Tinian, labeled F-31, F-32, and F-33 on their exteriors. On August 8, a dress rehearsal was conducted off Tinian by Sweeney using Bockscar as the drop airplane. Assembly F-33 was expended testing the components and F-31 was designated for the August 9 mission.\n\nAt 03:49 on the morning of August 9, 1945, Bockscar, flown by Sweeney's crew, carried Fat Man, with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the secondary target. The mission plan for the second attack was nearly identical to that of the Hiroshima mission, with two B-29s flying an hour ahead as weather scouts and two additional B-29s in Sweeney's flight for instrumentation and photographic support of the mission. Sweeney took off with his weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged.During pre-flight inspection of Bockscar, the flight engineer notified Sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use 640 US gallons (2,400 l; 530 imp gal) of fuel carried in a reserve tank. This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live. Tibbets and Sweeney therefore elected to have Bockscar continue the mission.This time Penney and Cheshire were allowed to accompany the mission, flying as observers on the third plane, Big Stink, flown by the group's operations officer, Major James I. Hopkins, Jr. Observers aboard the weather planes reported both targets clear. When Sweeney's aircraft arrived at the assembly point for his flight off the coast of Japan, Big Stink failed to make the rendezvous. According to Cheshire, Hopkins was at varying heights including 9,000 feet (2,700 m) higher than he should have been, and was not flying tight circles over Yakushima as previously agreed with Sweeney and Captain Frederick C. Bock, who was piloting the support B-29 The Great Artiste. Instead, Hopkins was flying 40-mile (64 km) dogleg patterns. Though ordered not to circle longer than fifteen minutes, Sweeney continued to wait for Big Stink for forty minutes. Before leaving the rendezvous point, Sweeney consulted Ashworth, who was in charge of the bomb. As commander of the aircraft, Sweeney made the decision to proceed to the primary, the city of Kokura.\n\nAfter exceeding the original departure time limit by nearly a half-hour, Bockscar, accompanied by The Great Artiste, proceeded to Kokura, thirty minutes away. The delay at the rendezvous had resulted in clouds and drifting smoke over Kokura from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. Additionally, the Yahata Steel Works intentionally burned coal tar, to produce black smoke. The clouds and smoke resulted in 70% of the area over Kokura being covered, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and exposing the aircraft repeatedly to the heavy defenses around Kokura, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese anti-aircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.With fuel running low because of the failed fuel pump, Bockscar and The Great Artiste headed for their secondary target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and would be forced to divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth agreed with Sweeney's suggestion that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured. At about 07:50 Japanese time, an air raid alert was sounded in Nagasaki, but the \"all clear\" signal was given at 08:30. When only two B-29 Superfortresses were sighted at 10:53, the Japanese apparently assumed that the planes were only on reconnaissance and no further alarm was given.A few minutes later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped instruments attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, urging him to tell the public about the danger involved with these weapons of mass destruction. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later. In 1949, one of the authors of the letter, Luis Alvarez, met with Sagane and signed the letter.At 11:01, a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed Bockscar's bombardier, Captain Kermit Beahan, to visually sight the target as ordered. The Fat Man weapon, containing a core of about 5 kg (11 lb) of plutonium, was dropped over the city's industrial valley. It exploded 47 seconds later at 1,650 \u00b1 33 ft (503 \u00b1 10 m), above a tennis court, halfway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south and the Nagasaki Arsenal in the north. This was nearly 3 km (1.9 mi) northwest of the planned hypocenter; the blast was confined to the Urakami Valley and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills. The resulting explosion released the equivalent energy of 21 \u00b1 2 kt (87.9 \u00b1 8.4 TJ). Big Stink spotted the explosion from a hundred miles away, and flew over to observe.\n\nBockscar flew on to Okinawa, arriving with only sufficient fuel for a single approach. Sweeney tried repeatedly to contact the control tower for landing clearance, but received no answer. He could see heavy air traffic landing and taking off from Yontan Airfield. Firing off every flare on board to alert the field to his emergency landing, the Bockscar came in fast, landing at 140 miles per hour (230 km/h) instead of the normal 120 miles per hour (190 km/h). The number two engine died from fuel starvation as he began the final approach. Touching down on only three engines midway down the landing strip, Bockscar bounced up into the air again for about 25 feet (7.6 m) before slamming back down hard. The heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control. Its reversible propellers were insufficient to slow the aircraft adequately, and with both pilots standing on the brakes, Bockscar made a swerving 90-degree turn at the end of the runway to avoid running off it. A second engine died from fuel exhaustion before the plane came to a stop.Following the mission, there was confusion over the identification of the plane. The first eyewitness account by war correspondent William L. Laurence of The New York Times, who accompanied the mission aboard the aircraft piloted by Bock, reported that Sweeney was leading the mission in The Great Artiste. He also noted its \"Victor\" number as 77, which was that of Bockscar. Laurence had interviewed Sweeney and his crew, and was aware that they referred to their airplane as The Great Artiste. Except for Enola Gay, none of the 393d's B-29s had yet had names painted on the noses, a fact which Laurence himself noted in his account. Unaware of the switch in aircraft, Laurence assumed Victor 77 was The Great Artiste, which was in fact, Victor 89.\n\n\n=== Events on the ground ===\n\nAlthough the bomb was more powerful than the one used on Hiroshima, its effects were confined by hillsides to the narrow Urakami Valley. Of 7,500 Japanese employees who worked inside the Mitsubishi Munitions plant, including \"mobilized\" students and regular workers, 6,200 were killed. Some 17,000\u201322,000 others who worked in other war plants and factories in the city died as well. Casualty estimates for immediate deaths vary widely, ranging from 22,000 to 75,000. At least 35,000\u201340,000 people were killed and 60,000 others injured. In the days and months following the explosion, more people died from their injuries. Because of the presence of undocumented foreign workers, and a number of military personnel in transit, there are great discrepancies in the estimates of total deaths by the end of 1945; a range of 39,000 to 80,000 can be found in various studies.Unlike Hiroshima's military death toll, only 150 Japanese soldiers were killed instantly, including 36 from the 134th AAA Regiment of the 4th AAA Division. At least eight Allied prisoners of war (POWs) died from the bombing, and as many as thirteen may have died. The eight confirmed deaths included a British POW, Royal Air Force Corporal Ronald Shaw, and seven Dutch POWs. One American POW, Joe Kieyoomia, was in Nagasaki at the time of the bombing but survived, reportedly having been shielded from the effects of the bomb by the concrete walls of his cell. There were 24 Australian POWs in Nagasaki, all of whom survived.\n\nThe radius of total destruction was about 1 mi (1.6 km), followed by fires across the northern portion of the city to 2 mi (3.2 km) south of the bomb. About 58% of the Mitsubishi Arms Plant was damaged, and about 78% of the Mitsubishi Steel Works. The Mitsubishi Electric Works suffered only 10% structural damage as it was on the border of the main destruction zone. The Nagasaki Arsenal was destroyed in the blast. Although many fires likewise burnt following the bombing, in contrast to Hiroshima where sufficient fuel density was available, no firestorm developed in Nagasaki as the damaged areas did not furnish enough fuel to generate the phenomenon. Instead, the ambient wind at the time pushed the fire spread along the valley.As in Hiroshima, the bombing badly dislocated the city's medical facilities. A makeshift hospital was established at the Shinkozen Primary School, which served as the main medical centre. The trains were still running, and evacuated many victims to hospitals in nearby towns. A medical team from a naval hospital reached the city in the evening, and fire-fighting brigades from the neighboring towns assisted in fighting the fires. Takashi Nagai was a doctor working in the radiology department of Nagasaki Medical College Hospital. He received a serious injury that severed his right temporal artery, but joined the rest of the surviving medical staff in treating bombing victims.\n\n\n== Plans for more atomic attacks on Japan ==\n\nGroves expected to have another \"Fat Man\" atomic bomb ready for use on August 19, with three more in September and a further three in October; a second Little Boy bomb (using U-235) would not be available until December 1945. On August 10, he sent a memorandum to Marshall in which he wrote that \"the next bomb ... should be ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after 17 or 18 August.\" Marshall endorsed the memo with the hand-written comment, \"It is not to be released over Japan without express authority from the President\", something Truman had requested that day. This modified the previous order that the target cities were to be attacked with atomic bombs \"as made ready\". There was already discussion in the War Department about conserving the bombs then in production for Operation Downfall, and Marshall suggested to Stimson that the remaining cities on the target list be spared attack with atomic bombs.Two more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on August 11 and 14, and Tibbets was ordered by LeMay to return to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to collect them. At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until August 16. Therefore, it could have been ready for use on August 19. Unable to reach Marshall, Groves ordered on his own authority on August 13 that the core should not be shipped.\n\n\n== Surrender of Japan and subsequent occupation ==\n\nUntil August 9, Japan's war council still insisted on its four conditions for surrender. The full cabinet met on 14:30 on August 9, and spent most of the day debating surrender. Anami conceded that victory was unlikely, but argued in favour of continuing the war nonetheless. The meeting ended at 17:30, with no decision having been reached. Suzuki went to the palace to report on the outcome of meeting, where he met with K\u014dichi Kido, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan. Kido informed him that the emperor had agreed to hold an imperial conference, and gave a strong indication that the emperor would consent to surrender on condition that kokutai be preserved. A second cabinet meeting was held at 18:00. Only four ministers supported Anami's position of adhering to the four conditions, but since cabinet decisions had to be unanimous, no decision was reached before it ended at 22:00.Calling an imperial conference required the signatures of the prime minister and the two service chiefs, but the Chief Cabinet Secretary Hisatsune Sakomizu had already obtained signatures from Toyoda and General Yoshijir\u014d Umezu in advance, and he reneged on his promise to inform them if a meeting was to be held. The meeting commenced at 23:50. No consensus had emerged by 02:00 on August 10, but the emperor gave his \"sacred decision\", authorizing the Foreign Minister, Shigenori T\u014dg\u014d, to notify the Allies that Japan would accept their terms on one condition, that the declaration \"does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign ruler.\"On August 12, the Emperor informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender. One of his uncles, Prince Asaka, then asked whether the war would be continued if the kokutai could not be preserved. Hirohito simply replied, \"Of course.\" As the Allied terms seemed to leave intact the principle of the preservation of the Throne, Hirohito recorded on August 14 his capitulation announcement which was broadcast to the Japanese nation the next day despite a short rebellion by militarists opposed to the surrender.In his declaration, Hirohito referred to the atomic bombings, and did not explicitly mention the Soviets as a factor for surrender:\n\nDespite the best that has been done by every one\u2014the gallant fighting of military and naval forces, the diligence and assiduity of Our servants of the State and the devoted service of Our one hundred million people, the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage, while the general trends of the world have all turned against her interest. Moreover, the enemy now possesses a new and terrible weapon with the power to destroy many innocent lives and do incalculable damage. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.\nSuch being the case, how are we to save the millions of our subjects, or to atone ourselves before the hallowed spirits of our imperial ancestors? This is the reason why we have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the joint declaration of the powers. \nIn his \"Rescript to the Soldiers and Sailors\" delivered on August 17, however, he stressed the impact of the Soviet invasion on his decision to surrender.\n\n\n== Reportage ==\n\nOn August 10, 1945, the day after the Nagasaki bombing, Y\u014dsuke Yamahata, correspondent Higashi, and artist Yamada arrived in the city with orders to record the destruction for maximum propaganda purposes, Yamahata took scores of photographs, and on August 21, they appeared in Mainichi Shimbun, a popular Japanese newspaper. Leslie Nakashima filed the first personal account of the scene to appear in American newspapers. A version of his August 27 UPI article appeared in The New York Times on August 31.Wilfred Burchett was the first western journalist to visit Hiroshima after the bombing, arriving alone by train from Tokyo on September 2. His Morse code dispatch, \"The Atomic Plague\", was printed by the Daily Express newspaper in London on September 5, 1945. Nakashima's and Burchett's reports were the first public reports to mention the effects of radiation and nuclear fallout\u2014radiation burns and radiation poisoning. Burchett's reporting was unpopular with the U.S. military, who accused Burchett of being under the sway of Japanese propaganda, and suppressed a supporting story submitted by George Weller of the Chicago Daily News. Laurence dismissed the reports on radiation sickness as Japanese efforts to undermine American morale, ignoring his own account published one week earlier.A member of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, Lieutenant Daniel McGovern, used a film crew to document the effects of the bombings in early 1946. The film crew shot 90,000 ft (27,000 m) of film, resulting in a three-hour documentary titled The Effects of the Atomic Bombs Against Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The documentary included images from hospitals showing the human effects of the bomb; it showed burned-out buildings and cars, and rows of skulls and bones on the ground. It was classified \"secret\" for the next 22 years.\nMotion picture company Nippon Eigasha started sending cameramen to Nagasaki and Hiroshima in September 1945. On October 24, 1945, a U.S. military policeman stopped a Nippon Eigasha cameraman from continuing to film in Nagasaki. All Nippon Eigasha's reels were confiscated by the American authorities, but they were requested by the Japanese government, and declassified. The public release of film footage of the city post-attack, and some research about the effects of the attack, was restricted during the occupation of Japan, but the Hiroshima-based magazine, Chugoku Bunka, in its first issue published on March 10, 1946, devoted itself to detailing the damage from the bombing.\n\nThe book Hiroshima, written by Pulitzer Prize winner John Hersey, which was originally published in article form in the popular magazine The New Yorker, on August 31, 1946, is reported to have reached Tokyo in English by January 1947, and the translated version was released in Japan in 1949. It narrated the stories of the lives of six bomb survivors from immediately prior to, and months after, the dropping of the Little Boy bomb. Beginning in 1974, a compilation of drawings and artwork made by the survivors of the bombings began to be compiled, with completion in 1977, and under both book and exhibition format, it was titled The Unforgettable Fire.The bombing amazed Otto Hahn and other German atomic scientists, whom the British held at Farm Hall in Operation Epsilon. Hahn stated that he had not believed an atomic weapon \"would be possible for another twenty years\"; Werner Heisenberg did not believe the news at first. Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker said \"I think it's dreadful of the Americans to have done it. I think it is madness on their part\", but Heisenberg replied, \"One could equally well say 'That's the quickest way of ending the war'\". Hahn was grateful that the German project had not succeeded in developing \"such an inhumane weapon\"; Karl Wirtz observed that even if it had, \"we would have obliterated London but would still not have conquered the world, and then they would have dropped them on us\".Hahn told the others, \"Once I wanted to suggest that all uranium should be sunk to the bottom of the ocean\". The Vatican agreed; L'Osservatore Romano expressed regret that the bomb's inventors did not destroy the weapon for the benefit of humanity. Rev. Cuthbert Thicknesse, the Dean of St Albans, prohibited using St Albans Abbey for a thanksgiving service for the war's end, calling the use of atomic weapons \"an act of wholesale, indiscriminate massacre\". Nonetheless, news of the atomic bombing was greeted enthusiastically in the U.S.; a poll in Fortune magazine in late 1945 showed a significant minority of Americans (23%) wishing that more atomic bombs could have been dropped on Japan. The initial positive response was supported by the imagery presented to the public (mainly the powerful images of the mushroom cloud). During this time in America, it was a common practice for editors to keep graphic images of death out of films, magazines, and newspapers.\n\n\n== Post-attack casualties ==\n\nAn estimated 90,000 to 140,000 people in Hiroshima (up to 39% of the population) and 60,000 to 80,000 people in Nagasaki (up to 32% of the population) died in 1945, though the number which died immediately as a result of exposure to the blast, heat, or due to radiation, is unknown. One Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission report discusses 6,882 people examined in Hiroshima, and 6,621 people examined in Nagasaki, who were largely within 2000 meters from the hypocenter, who suffered injuries from the blast and heat but died from complications frequently compounded by acute radiation syndrome (ARS), all within about 20\u201330 days. The most well known of these was Midori Naka, some 650 meters from the hypocenter at Hiroshima, who would travel to Tokyo and then with her death on August 24, 1945 was to be the first death officially certified as a result of radiation poisoning, or as it was referred to by many, \"Atomic bomb disease\". It was unappreciated at the time but the average radiation dose that will kill approximately 50% of adults, the LD50, was approximately halved, that is, smaller doses were made more lethal, when the individual experienced concurrent blast or burn polytraumatic injuries. Conventional skin injuries that cover a large area frequently result in bacterial infection; the risk of sepsis and death is increased when a usually non-lethal radiation dose moderately suppresses the white blood cell count.In the spring of 1948, the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) was established in accordance with a presidential directive from Truman to the National Academy of Sciences\u2013National Research Council to conduct investigations of the late effects of radiation among the survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1956, the ABCC published The Effect of Exposure to the Atomic Bombs on Pregnancy Termination in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The ABCC became the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), on April 1, 1975. A binational organization run by both the United States and Japan, the RERF is still in operation today.\n\n\n=== Cancer increases ===\nCancers do not immediately emerge after exposure to radiation; instead, radiation-induced cancer has a minimum latency period of some 5+ years and Leukemia some 2+ which peaks around 6\u20138 years later. Dr Jarrett Foley published the first major reports on the significant increased incidence of the latter among survivors. Almost all cases of leukemia over the following 50 years were in people exposed to more than 1Gy. In a strictly dependent manner dependent on their distance from the hypocenter, in the 1987 Life Span Study, conducted by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, a statistical excess of 507 cancers, of undefined lethality, were observed in 79,972 hibakusha who had still been living between 1958\u20131987 and who took part in the study. As the epidemiology study continues with time, the RERF estimates that, from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths which may include Sadako Sasaki and 11% of solid cancers of unspecificed lethality were likely due to radiation from the bombs or some other post-attack city effects, with the statistical excess being 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality. Both of these statistics being derived from the observation of approximately half of the total survivors, strictly those who took part in the study.\n\n\n=== Birth defect investigations ===\nWhile during the preimplantation period, that is 1\u201310 days following conception, interuterine radiation exposure of \"at least 0.2 Gy\" can cause complications of implantation and death of the human embryo. The number of miscarriages caused by the radiation from the bombings, during this radiosensitive period, is not known.\nOne of the early studies conducted by the ABCC was on the outcome of pregnancies occurring in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and in a control city, Kure, located 18 mi (29 km) south of Hiroshima, to discern the conditions and outcomes related to radiation exposure. James V. Neel led the study which found that the overall number of birth defects was not significantly higher among the children of survivors who were pregnant at the time of the bombings. He also studied the longevity of the children who survived the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, reporting that between 90 and 95 percent were still living 50 years later.While The National Academy of Sciences raised the possibility that Neel's procedure did not filter the Kure population for possible radiation exposure which could bias the results. Overall, a statistically insignificant increase in birth defects occurred directly after the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima when the cities were taken as wholes, in terms of distance from the hypocenters however, Neel and others noted that in approximately 50 humans who were of an early gestational age at the time of the bombing and who were all within about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) from the hypocenter, an increase in microencephaly and anencephaly was observed upon birth, with the incidence of these two particular malformations being nearly 3 times what was to be expected when compared to the control group in Kure, were approximately 20 cases were observed in a similar sample size.In 1985, Johns Hopkins University geneticist James F. Crow examined Neel's research and confirmed that the number of birth defects was not significantly higher in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Many members of the ABCC and its successor Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) were still looking for possible birth defects among the survivors decades later, but found no evidence that they were significantly common among the survivors, or inherited in the children of survivors.\n\n\n=== Investigations into brain development ===\n\nDespite the small sample size of 1,600 to 1,800 persons who came forth as prenatally exposed at the time of the bombings, that were both within a close proximity to the two hypocenters, to survive the in utero absorption of a substantial dose of radiation and then the malnourished post-attack environment, data from this cohort does support the increased risk of severe mental retardation (SMR), that was observed in some 30 individuals, with SMR being a common outcome of the aforementioned microencephaly. While a lack of statistical data, with just 30 individuals out of 1,800, prevents a definitive determination of a threshold point, the data collected suggests a threshold interuterine or fetal dose for SMR, at the most radiosensitive period of cognitive development, when there is the largest number of undifferentiated neural cells (8 to 15 weeks post-conception) to begin at a threshold dose of approximately \"0.09\" to \"0.15\" Gy, with the risk then linearly increasing to a 43% rate of SMR when exposed to a fetal dose of 1 Gy at any point during these weeks of rapid Neurogenesis.However either side of this radiosensitive age, none of the prenatally exposed to the bombings at an age less than 8 weeks, that is prior to synaptogenesis or at a gestational age more than 26 weeks \"were observed to be mentally retarded\", with the condition therefore being isolated to those solely of 8\u201326 weeks of age and who absorbed more than approximately \"0.09\" to \"0.15\" Gy of prompt radiation energy.Examination of the prenatally exposed in terms of IQ performance and school records, determined the beginning of a statistically significant reduction in both, when exposed to greater than 0.1 to 0.5 Gray, during the same gestational period of 8\u201325 weeks. However outside this period, at less than 8 weeks and greater than 26 after conception, \"there is no evidence of a radiation-related effect on scholastic performance.\"The reporting of doses in terms of absorbed energy in units of (Gy and rad) rather than the use of the biologically significant, biologically weighted Sievert, in both the SMR and cognitive performance data is typical. The reported threshold dose variance between the two cities, is suggested to be a manifestation of the difference between X-ray and neutron absorption, with Little Boy emitting substantially more neutron flux, whereas the Baratol that surrounded the core of Fat Man, filtered or shifted the absorbed neutron-radiation profile, so that the dose of radiation energy received in Nagasaki, is mostly that from exposure to x-rays/gamma rays, in contrast to the environment within 1500 meters of the hypocenter at Hiroshima, were instead the in-utero dose more depended on the absorption of neutrons, which have a higher biological effect per unit of energy absorbed. From the Radiation dose reconstruction work, which were also informed by the 1962 BREN Tower-Japanese city analog, the estimated dosimetry at Hiroshima still has the largest uncertainty as the Little Boy-bomb design was never tested before deployment or afterward, therefore the estimated radiation profile absorbed by individuals at Hiroshima had required greater reliance on calculations than the Japanese soil, concrete and roof-tile measurements which began to reach accurate levels and thereby inform researchers, in the 1990s.Many other investigations into cognitive outcomes, such as Schizophrenia as a result of prenatal exposure, have been conducted with \"no statistically significant linear relationship seen\", there is a suggestion that in the most extremely exposed, those who survived within a kilometer or so of the hypocenters, a trend emerges akin to that seen in SMR, though the sample size is too small to determine with any significance.\n\n\n== Hibakusha ==\n\nThe survivors of the bombings are called hibakusha (\u88ab\u7206\u8005, Japanese pronunciation: [\u00e7ibak\u026f\u0325\u0255a]), a Japanese word that literally translates to \"explosion-affected people\". The Japanese government has recognized about 650,000 people as hibakusha. As of March 31, 2019, 145,844 were still alive, mostly in Japan. The government of Japan recognizes about 1% of these as having illnesses caused by radiation. The memorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki contain lists of the names of the hibakusha who are known to have died since the bombings. Updated annually on the anniversaries of the bombings, as of August 2019, the memorials record the names of more than 500,000 hibakusha; 319,186 in Hiroshima and 182,601 in Nagasaki.If they discuss their background, Hibakusha and their children were (and still are) victims of fear based discrimination and exclusion when it comes to prospects of marriage or work due to public ignorance about the consequences of radiation sickness or that the low doses that the majority received were less than a routine diagnostic x-ray, much of the public however persist with the belief that the Hibakusha carry some hereditary or even contagious disease. This is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects/congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of the nuclear weapons used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or indeed has been found in the later conceived children of cancer survivors who had previously received radiotherapy.\nThe surviving women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that could conceive, who were exposed to substantial amounts of radiation, went on and had children with no higher incidence of abnormalities/birth defects than the rate which is observed in the Japanese average.\nA study of the long-term psychological effects of the bombings on the survivors found that even 17\u201320 years after the bombings had occurred survivors showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and somatization symptoms.\n\n\n=== Double survivors ===\nPerhaps as many as 200 people from Hiroshima sought refuge in Nagasaki. The 2006 documentary Twice Survived: The Doubly Atomic Bombed of Hiroshima and Nagasaki documented 165 nij\u016b hibakusha (lit. double explosion-affected people), nine of whom claimed to be in the blast zone in both cities. On March 24, 2009, the Japanese government officially recognized Tsutomu Yamaguchi as a double hibakusha. He was confirmed to be 3 km (1.9 mi) from ground zero in Hiroshima on a business trip when the bomb was detonated. He was seriously burnt on his left side and spent the night in Hiroshima. He arrived at his home city of Nagasaki on August 8, the day before the bombing, and he was exposed to residual radiation while searching for his relatives. He was the first officially recognized survivor of both bombings. He died on January 4, 2010, at the age of 93, after a battle with stomach cancer.\n\n\n=== Korean survivors ===\n\nDuring the war, Japan brought as many as 670,000 Korean conscripts to Japan to work as forced labor. About 5,000\u20138,000 Koreans were killed in Hiroshima and another 1,500\u20132,000 died in Nagasaki. For many years, Korean survivors had a difficult time fighting for the same recognition as Hibakusha as afforded to all Japanese survivors, a situation which resulted in the denial of the free health benefits to them in Japan. Most issues were eventually addressed in 2008 through lawsuits.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\n\n\n=== Hiroshima ===\nHiroshima was subsequently struck by Typhoon Ida on September 17, 1945. More than half the bridges were destroyed, and the roads and railroads were damaged, further devastating the city. The population increased from 83,000 soon after the bombing to 146,000 in February 1946. The city was rebuilt after the war, with help from the national government through the Hiroshima Peace Memorial City Construction Law passed in 1949. It provided financial assistance for reconstruction, along with land donated that was previously owned by the national government and used for military purposes. In 1949, a design was selected for the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the closest surviving building to the location of the bomb's detonation, was designated the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was opened in 1955 in the Peace Park. Hiroshima also contains a Peace Pagoda, built in 1966 by Nipponzan-My\u014dh\u014dji.\n\n\n=== Nagasaki ===\n\nNagasaki was also rebuilt after the war, but was dramatically changed in the process. The pace of reconstruction was initially slow, and the first simple emergency dwellings were not provided until 1946. The focus on redevelopment was the replacement of war industries with foreign trade, shipbuilding and fishing. This was formally declared when the Nagasaki International Culture City Reconstruction Law was passed in May 1949. New temples were built, as well as new churches owing to an increase in the presence of Christianity. Some of the rubble was left as a memorial, such as a torii at Sann\u014d Shrine, and an arch near ground zero. New structures were also raised as memorials, such as the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, which was opened in the mid-1990s.\n\n\n== Debate over bombings ==\n\nThe role of the bombings in Japan's surrender, and the ethical, legal, and military controversies surrounding the United States' justification for them have been the subject of scholarly and popular debate. On one hand, it has been argued that the bombings caused the Japanese surrender, thereby preventing casualties that an invasion of Japan would have involved. Stimson talked of saving one million casualties. The naval blockade might have starved the Japanese into submission without an invasion, but this would also have resulted in many more Japanese deaths.Japanese historian Tsuyoshi Hasegawa argued that the entry of the Soviet Union into the war against Japan \"played a much greater role than the atomic bombs in inducing Japan to surrender because it dashed any hope that Japan could terminate the war through Moscow's mediation\". A view among critics of the bombings, that was popularized by American historian Gar Alperovitz in 1965, is the idea of atomic diplomacy: that the United States used nuclear weapons to intimidate the Soviet Union in the early stages of the Cold War. Although not accepted by mainstream historians, this became the position in Japanese school history textbooks.Those who oppose the bombings give other reasons for their view, among them: a belief that atomic bombing is fundamentally immoral,  that the bombings counted as war crimes, and that they constituted state terrorism.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nLike the way it began, the manner in which World War II ended cast a long shadow over international relations for decades to come. By June 30, 1946, there were components for only nine atomic bombs in the US arsenal, all Fat Man devices identical to the one used in the bombing of Nagasaki. The nuclear weapons were handmade devices, and a great deal of work remained to improve their ease of assembly, safety, reliability and storage before they were ready for production. There were also many improvements to their performance that had been suggested or recommended, but that had not been possible under the pressure of wartime development. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy had decried the use of the atomic bombs as adopting \"an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages\", but in October 1947, he reported a military requirement for 400 bombs.The American monopoly on nuclear weapons lasted only four years before the Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb in September 1949. The United States responded with the development of the hydrogen bomb, a nuclear weapon a thousand times as powerful as the bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Such ordinary fission bombs would henceforth be regarded as small tactical nuclear weapons. By 1986, the United States had 23,317 nuclear weapons, while the Soviet Union had 40,159. By 2017, nine nations had nuclear weapons, but Japan was not one of them. Japan reluctantly signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in February 1970, but it is still sheltered under the American nuclear umbrella. American nuclear weapons were stored on Okinawa, and sometimes in Japan itself, albeit in contravention of agreements between the two nations. Lacking the resources to fight the Soviet Union using conventional forces, the Western Alliance came to depend on the use of nuclear weapons to defend itself during the Cold War, a policy that became known in the 1950s as the New Look. In the decades after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States would threaten to use its nuclear weapons many times.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPresent dayAre Nagasaki and Hiroshima still radioactive? \u2013 No. Includes explanation.Decision\"Order from General Thomas Handy to General Carl Spaatz authorizing the dropping of the first atomic bomb\".

          "I visited this museum by using the HOHO bus that is free when you have a JR rail pass. The cost to get into this museum is 1,200 yen which is about $15 CAD. I thought that this price was reasonable as the museum had both European art and Japanese art. The museum itself is",
          "We decided to go to a Saki tasting at the Art Museum that we had seen advertised in a local Hiroshima paper. It was a promotion geared towards foreign tourists so I guess it was promoted elsewhere as not many tourists would be reading the local paper. The tasting was in the",

          "This art museum was a real surprise. The collection of works by French impressionists was particularly impressive: Matisse, Monet, Manet, Cezane and Van Gough to name but a few. I also particularly liked the Japanese art screens, which were housed in a room of their own. The",
          "Although the museum is small, the quality of the paintings is excellent and well laid out. The collection include works by van Gogh, Monet, Renoir, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso plus Japanese art. Definitely worth a visit to escape the heat or the rain.",
          "A small but well designed gallery in a circular form contains four main galleries and external galleries for special exhibitions. The permanent collection has a delightful collection of European, mainly french paintings, including a wonderful Van Gogh. A small but comprehensive",
          "There is a good collection of French impressionists but it is limited with inadequate English signage. There is an audio program for rent. We were hoping to also see the Mucha exhibit but that had closed and been replaced with a cat oriented exhibit. Not our cup of tea. The",
          "This museum was not well promoted but it was well worth the stop. When we visited the small galleries were adorned with some lesser-known works of the French impressionists as well as works by Picasso and other European masters. The building is well laid out and a great way",
          "I liked the small rooms radiating from a central atrium containing different exhibits. The museum is quite small but has some intersting works.",
          "This is a lovely museum that is tranquil and a welcome change from the crowds. They have a lovely permanent collection of 19th century paintings. What struck me the most was that for being small, they had a Berthe Morissot and 2 Marie Laurencin paintings. 3 works by women",

          "I was really surprised to see that this gallery had such a wide array of Western art. Currently there is an impressive Mucha exhibit that any lover of art nouveau will enjoy. While a bit pricey at 13000yen, I recommend visiting this gallery. Enjoy the work of Van Gogh, Degas,",
          "This little hidden gem of a museum is a must for fans of classical European art, and its collection clearly shows the Japanese\u2019 love for all things French. It owns a beautiful version of Monet\u2019s Morning on the Seine. Handouts about the artists and displayed works are available",

          "Hiroshima Museum of Art was a wonderful, total surprise. At one stage I wrote home that I'd found all the old European masters' works lost from the west - they're in Japan's museums of art. Even considering the propensity of these works in other Japanese centres, Hiroshima seems",
          "Visited as the start point of our Hiroshima Walk the museum offers some fine examples of European art by Monet, Picasso etc in a fine set of galleries. Another set has a variable exhibition which on our visit was based on a set of children's comic books featuring a black dog.",
          "Here is the message this museum communicated to me: \"Our special exhibit if for Japanese speakers only, now go see some works by French artists whom you already know.\" This was really a missed opportunity for the museum. They have a six-week run showing off some Japanese",
          "This museum is a must for anyone who loves European art, especially Impressionists. They have a variety and great collection of art. It is really an amazing collection. It is walking distance from the peace memorial. Not to be missed!",
          "This is a fairly small museum, but a perfect wrap up prior to departing Hiroshima. An uplift if you will. Many Impressionist and western/European pieces - Picasso, Monet, etc, as well as artists I'd not heard of yet were very beautiful. We saw most of it in just over an hr, but",
          "The museum itself is beautifully designed. The collection though small is nice and deserved a visit. The hidden gem is the cafe jadin inside the museum. Inexpensive and decent food and coffee overlooking the best scene of the museum. You just cant miss it!",
          "I visited here to watch so many the Impressionists works with my family. We could also see 'The Peter Rabbit Exhibition'. You can see te Impressionists works any time you like. You can easily reach here on foot from centere of Hiroshima city.",

          "Permanent collection is dreadful. Some donor gave his stuff. He had collected second rate art from Europe as the art scene was changing a hinders years ago. Thing is./ No masterpieces. Nothing to write home about. But... if there is a travelling exhibition on the go it may be",

          "A little bit of everything, not a museum to spend a lot of time. You see art works from Picasso and even Van Gogh, but also important Japanese artists.",

          "I went here on a rainy day, expecting to see some fresh artwork. However, it was a special exhibit of only artwork from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston... and considering I have been to that museum more than once it was a bit of a let down. Especially since I believe you are",
          "We ended up seeing the special exhibit of art of Venice, which replaced the normal pictures in the main space. Some, but not all, of the pictures normally hanging there were moved to another space in the museum. I did enjoy it anyway, but I think I'd have liked to know ahead",
          "This museum has quite a few paintings of well-known artists, e.g. Van Gogh, Picasso, Chagall.... but also has temporary exhibitions. When we went there was a Venice exhibition, quite interesting.",
          "Who travels to Japan to see European art? While I was there they had a exhibition of European impressionists which was absolutely boring. Not the best works and although they advertised with some big names like Monet and van Gogh they only had one of each great painter.",
          "The advertising promised much but the collection was not that special. It was a collection of European impressionists. However there was only one work from Monet, and some of the paintings were not the best examples of the period.",
          "If you like impressionistic paintings, you will definitely find your enjoyment in this museum. Or if you have plenty of time, it is worth a try.",
          "For the price, not really worth it unless they have a special exhibit that interests you. The permanent collection is tiny and can be seen in under an hour (including watching the not too interesting video displays). The staff is prickly at best, and the out door sculptures",

          "Having seen the Peace Park, we decided to visit the Museum of Art. It was cold and damp so something cultural indoors seemed like a good idea. The museum was quiet and uncrowded. Inside, there are 4 rooms. Wow! We have visited the Musee D'Orsay several times in Paris and enjoyed",
          "I saw the exhibition by Anno and it was very well curated. There are some nice standard pieces. The cafe was also pretty comfortable and the landscaping was pleasing.",
          "On a wet weekday afternoon, this was the perfect place to visit. The permanent collection has a surprising array of masters on display: Picasso, Monet, Toulouse- latreck, Degas, van Gough... Well worth a wander.",
          "The museum has a marvellous collection of French impressionists, but for me the Special Exhibition of Anno was breath taking. This contemporary illustrator blends optical illusions, humour and thought provoking illustrations that delight the soul.",
          "The Prefectural Art Museum is a gem, and well worth the time and the 1,200 \u00a5 admission price. The building and grounds are pretty, and kudos to the museum for using soft carpet in the walking areas, a museum rarity, in my experience. There's an interesting collection of both",
          "If you are looking for an escape from the heat and humidity, stop in here for a couple of hours and enjoy wonderful paintings and other art. Some of the Picasso's were absolutely incredible, from just before his cubism period shows his true talent as a painter. Other artists",
          "This was one of the stops on the sightseeing bus tour. What a treasure it was! There is a permanent display of French impressionists with both paintings and sculptures by Picasso, Matisse, Rodin, Van Gogh and Cezanne to name but a few. It's not a house gallery, but well worth",
          "The Hiroshima Museum of Art is located just across from the Rihga Hotel in the heart of the city - and what a surprise it is. This smallish art gallery / museum has some amazing works by Picasso, Van Gogh, Monet and Boudin amongst others. Some of these works are probably",
          "It's a chilling story of the heart wrenching atomic bomb which was Hiroshimas horror story. The care and detailing which has gone into the preservation of the memory deserves a salute ! One must try folding a paper crane there and there are people ready to help you. Guided tours",
          "The museum isn't that big, but it does harbour some nice pieces of art. A good way to spend some time.",
          "Well I guess you can find other places with many more things... mu suggestion would be if you come to japan, there are many other museums woth visiting.",
          "For lovers of art, of course this place is one place to get inspiration, because here on display a variety of art paintings, both international and Japanese artists artwork. In addition, also available performing arts venues. To enter this arena you have to pay the entrance fee",
          "When we went, the museum had a very nice collection of classical pieces on exhibit - Picasso, Rodin, Monet, etc. the permanent exhibit was nice and light and worth a look - I particularly liked the Japanese art section. We spent about 2-3 hours, including a very decent coffee",
          "The museum has split its collection into 3 sections with plenty of English descriptions shown:- - European painters (incl Degas, Corot, Picasso) - Japanese painters following the impressionist style - Traditional Japanese painting produced during the same period Currently, there",
          "This is well worth a quick scoot around. There are some important pieces in here, and the design of museum allows you to take them all in easily within an hour. Do this rather than go inside the castle.",
          "there may only be 4 rooms but what a joy. works from all the French impressionists,Fauves,Picasso and Van Gogh to boot. when we were there there was an extra exhibition of Normandy inspired paintings including a dozen Raul Dufy.",
          "we are avid museum goers and our visit here came at the end of a long day and day trip. It was almost an afterthought and we had less than an hour to view the collection. The permanent collection is mostly Western, post-impressionist art including work by artists we know and",
          "We visited several art museums while in Hiroshima. I was stunned by the number of works by Picasso, Chagall, Latrec and many of the other well know painters.",
          "The museum has some very good pictures from big names, but unfortunately the main exibition has only around 80 pictures. Compared to european art museums this is rather small and with 1000 Yen quite expensive, but if you are into art it might be worth it.",
          "The Hiroshima art Museum looks very pleasant in the city center, was established by the Hiroshima Bank to celebrate its 100th anniversary of its foundation.The whole collection is divided in to 90 each of modern European painters & Japanese painting in the European style. It",

          "This museum is a collection of both European and Japanese paintings and features famous artists such as Picasso and Monet. I found myself wandering through it with a smile on my face and the English information is well-written and easy to follow. The museum shop is also",
          "After the profound and disturbing visit to the Peace Memorial Park & Museum, a head-clearing walk to and visit in this museum was a welcome change of pace. Small, easy to do, four small adjoining galleries in a circular building packed with French and European impressionist,",
          "I cried when I was there. Great art does that to me. They have an incredible and surprising collection of French impressionists. Surprising because - well, who would have expected it of Hiroshima? The museum itself is beautifully laid out, with gorgeous grounds, a nice cafe that",

          "The three main public museums were having 1 large art sharing this summer. Most people were at the Van Gogh so I had the Monets and Renoirs all to myself. Found the best viewing distance for all the paintings and I never knew what a luxury that is. They also had an exhibit of",

          "The actual space of the museum is what makes it worth a look. It combines a sense of Japanese zen/minimalism with some more European aspects very successfully. The art is OK, a few pictures from some extremely famous artists & then some more mediocre pieces. However the",
          "We went to this gallery and were surprised not just by the works of art, which were plentiful, but also by the building design on the different levels. A really modern design which we thought was innovative as well as a little quirky!",
          "If your time in Hiroshima is limited, I would skip this. If you have plenty of time and emjoy impressionist art, it is worth a visit. The building is interesting and lends itself to displaying art very nicely.",
          "I visited Hiroshima in February 2011. While looking for attractions, I discovered that the Hiroshima Museum of Art had a special exhibition, \"Image of the Seine: Impressionists and Japanese painters\" on Japanese artists working in France. The museum's permanent collection has",
          "So we went, and guess what--all the Japanese art was packed away! What the heck? They have some European pieces, but nothing really memorable.",
          "There are several rooms and a downstairs that are full of beautiful pieces. It's not huge, so you don't spend all day there, but it's a great site, and I would definitely make it a priority."

        "wiki": "Hohensalzburg Fortress (German: Festung Hohensalzburg, lit. 'High Salzburg Fortress') sits atop the Festungsberg, a small hill in the Austrian city of Salzburg. Erected at the behest of the Prince-Archbishops of Salzburg with a length of 250 m (820 ft) and a width of 150 m (490 ft), it is one of the largest medieval castles in Europe. Hohensalzburg Fortress is situated at an altitude of 506 m.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nConstruction of the fortress began in 1077 under Archbishop Gebhard von Helfenstein. The original design was a basic bailey with a wooden wall. In the Holy Roman Empire, the archbishops of Salzburg were already powerful political figures and they expanded the fortress to protect their interests. Helfenstein's conflict with Emperor Henry IV during the Investiture Controversy influenced the expansion of the fortress, with the Archbishop taking the side of Pope Gregory VII and the German anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfelden. The fortress was gradually expanded during the following centuries. The ring walls and towers were built in 1462 under Prince-Archbishop Burkhard II von Wei\u00dfpriach.\nPrince-Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach further expanded the fortress during his term from 1495 until 1519. His coadjutor Matth\u00e4us Lang von Wellenburg, who was later to succeed Leonhard, in 1515 wrote a description of the Reisszug, a very early and primitive funicular railway that provided freight access to the upper courtyard of the fortress. The line still exists, albeit in updated form, and is probably the oldest operational railway in the world. The current external bastions, begun in the 16th century and completed in the 17th, were added as a precaution because of fears of Turkish Invasion.The only time that the fortress actually came under siege was during the German Peasants' War in 1525, when a group of miners, farmers and townspeople tried to oust Prince-Archbishop Matth\u00e4us Lang, but failed to take the fortress. In 1617 the deposed Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau died in the fortress prison. During the Thirty Years' War, Archbishop Count Paris of Lodron strengthened the town's defenses, including Hohensalzburg. He added various parts to the fortress, such as the gunpowder stores and additional gatehouses. The fortress was surrendered without a fight to French troops under General Jean Victor Marie Moreau during the Napoleonic War of the Second Coalition in 1800 and the last Prince-Archbishop Count Hieronymus von Colloredo fled to Vienna. In the 19th century, it was used as barracks, storage depot and dungeon before being abandoned as a military outpost in 1861.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nHohensalzburg Fortress was refurbished from the late 19th century onwards and became a major tourist attraction with the Festungsbahn funicular railway, opened in 1892, leading up from the town to the Hasengrabenbastei. It stands today as one of the best preserved castles in Europe.\nDuring the early 20th century it was used as a prison, holding Italian prisoners of war during World War I and Nazi activists before Germany's annexation of Austria in March 1938.\nGerman ceramicist, sculptor and painter Arno Lehmann lived and created in Hohensalzburg Fortress from 1949 until his death in 1973.Hohensalzburg Fortress was selected as main motif for the Austrian Nonnberg Abbey commemorative coin minted on April 5, 2006. This was the first coin of the series \"Great Abbeys of Austria\".  It shows the Benedictine convent of Nonnberg Abbey. In the hilltop on the background, the  fortress and the Kajetaner church can be seen. Also in 1977 the Austrian Mint issued a coin for the 900th anniversary of Hohensalzburg Fortress.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe fortress consists of various wings and courtyard. The Prince-Bishop's apartments are located in the so-called \"Hoher Stock\" (high floor).\n\n\n=== Salzburg Bull ===\nThe Krautturm houses a large aerophon of more than 200 pipes which is called the \"Salzburg Bull\" (Salzburger Stier). This huge mechanical organ was built in 1502 by Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach. It was renewed by Rochus Egedacher in 1735.\nFrom Palm Sunday to 31 October the \"Salzburg Bull\" is played daily at 7, 11 and 18 o'clock. The aerophone thus initiated the playing of the carillon at the Residenzplatz and ended it again.\nOne of Austria's most famous cabaret groups is named after it.\n\n\n=== Golden Hall ===\nStarting in 1498, Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach had the magnificent state apartments installed on the third floor. The rooms in which the archbishops would normally have lived were one floor below. The state apartments were primarily used for representative purposes and for festivities. The Golden Hall was richly decorated and indicates that the fortress served the archbishops not only as a refuge in times of crisis, but frequently also as a residence up to the 16th century.\nIn order to gain more space, Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach had four massive marble pillars constructed on the right-hand outer wall and had a loggia added on. As in the other rooms the ceiling is coffered, each coffer being adorned with gold buttons symbolising the stars in the sky.\nThe 17-metre-long beam, supporting the ceiling, is particularly worth mentioning. The coat of arms of Leonhard von Keutschach together with those of the Holy Roman Empire, the most powerful German towns and the bishoprics that were connected to Salzburg, are painted on it.\n\n\n=== Chapel of Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach ===\n\nArchbishop Leonhard von Keutschach (1495-1519) had the chapel built at a later time. One of the figure consoles in the beam ceiling had to be removed to make room for it. A richly ornamented star vault decorates the ceiling of the chapel. The inner part of the door at the entrance is covered with stucco. The painted frame shows red columns on a high plinth with grey capitals. The coat of arms of Salzburg and of Leonhard von Keutschach is reproduced in the tympanum beneath the mitre, legate cross and sword. A special feature of the coat of arms is the turnip and in many places in the fortress this can be found as an indication of prince-archbishop Keutschach's building activity. In the north wall of the chapel there are two openings which made it possible to attend the church service from the side room.\n\n\n=== Golden Chamber ===\nThe Golden Chamber is the most magnificently furnished room of the princely chambers. The two long walls are taken up by benches that are richly decorated with vines, grapes, foliage and animals. These benches used to be covered with cloth or leather, but the upholstery has not survived into the modern age. The walls also used to be covered in gold-embossed leather tapestry which adorned the lower part of the wall.\n\n\n=== Bedchamber ===\nThe bedchamber is the most intimate room of the princely chambers. The original furniture and precious textiles, such as tapestry, were in the course of time replaced by more \"modern\" ones. The elaborate wainscoting to keep out the cold still bears witness to the splendour of the past. The upper part of the panels is decorated with gilded buttons and rosettes, whereas the lower part, which is bare today, was probably covered with leather or velvet tapestry. The door conceals a toilet, which is basically a hole in the floor with a wooden frame. Back in the past this was a highly modern sanitary facility and was accessible from each floor.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlte Residenz\nHohenwerfen Castle\nSalzburg Cathedral\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHohensalzburg Fortress\nHohensalzburg Castle 900th anniversary coin\nSalzburg Tourist Office\nEntry about Hohensalzburg  at Burgen-Austria (Castles Austria)\nDigital reconstruction of the castle through time",

          "Great views from the castle and a great climb up, not that interesting if I\u2019m honest though - with it for the views though!",
          "Interesting fortress to visit with some good museums in the complex, very good guide too, great views of the City of Salzburg",
          "The castle is beutiful with many things to visit (You will spend half a day there and do not forget the round tour). We bought the tickets directly on the webpage's castle to have the early vistors discount (3 euros less before 10 am). However, they only sent me 1 ticket, which",
          "We took the funicular to the castle which was interesting but there is not much to see other than the great views which are worth the trip",
          "My wife and I visited the Fortress last week. First tip.... buy a Salzburg Card. When you have this, the initial cost gives you \u201cfree\u201d entrance to the Fortress, including fenuncular train. You also get free access to museums, public buses and other attractions. The Fortress has",
          "This imposing fortress is a must see attraction. To get to the top you can either take the funicular or you can brave the walk. The walk is very very steep. The funicular is very popular and the lines can be very long, at least in the later afternoon on the weekend. The views as",
          "We visited with our small dog, we could not enter to the museums and rooms but we enjoyed the walk around the place, the views are amazing from the city and also the mountains. I recommend!",
          "Our prime reason for going was to climb to the top of the castle keep for the view, which didn\u2019t disappoint. The museum also has a very interesting collection of militaria from the Salzburg regiment. We spent an interested two hours within the castle near sunset. Worth the entry.",
          "We all enjoyed the full experience here- walking up the steps from the city. The turns in the fortress the bar at the top- the various spots to enjoy the view. The line was too long for the funicular (for us) so we walked everywhere. We enjoyed the different doorways and",
          "Founded by Monks in the 9th Century this castle/fortress is steeped in history and has views to drool over! No matter the day or weather this is a must see attraction when visiting Salzburg and is included on the Salzburg Card as well. There are many things to see here and learn",
          "We spent the one sunny day on our trip at the Fortress. The views of the Salzburg valley are simply amazing. You see the mountains in every direction, as well as the relative confinement of this little city. The ancient life is clear here. It was a small city on the hill, with",
          "Great views and a great museum to accompany. You won't be disappointed. Great way to spend a couples hours.",
          "I went here with my parents on Christmas Eve. This is well worth the entrance fee of around 13 euros as the view of Salzburg and surrounding mountains is spectacular. Make sure you climb to the top of the fortress to get the best view. Snacks and Drinks can be bought including",
          "As a whole, experience was nice. The funicular ride up is different, the views of the city are varied and beautiful, the history supurb, the marionette museum, small but interesting-and there was also a small Christmas Market to boot that day. All in all, it is worth visiting,",
          "We bought a ticket includes journey and entry. Stunning place with lots of history ang great views. Great value for money",
          "The ride up in the funicular was great. The views from the fortress were amazing. The museum was very informative.",
          "This is a must do attraction in Salzburg. We visited on Christmas day - yes it was open and very busy. I recommend the all inclusive pass. We spent at least 3 hours there. The views of Salzburg and surrounds were great and we learnt a lot about the history. It is not ideal for",
          "This was definitely worth the effort to make your way up here. Breath taking views across the alps and the city of Salzburg in every direction. I did the walk down, it was quite steep in places but worth the effort. Didn\u2019t walk up due to time constraints of closing time. awesom",
          "One of the most amazing castle i have been in Europe, maybe it is not about fortress that much, it is more about the view of the Alpen.... just magnificent",
          "I found this fortress to be excellent! Such an impressive, imposing structure dominating the landscape over Salzburg. The best way to experience it is to buy the ticket at the Festungsbahn (i.e. the funicular) and ride the funicular up to the fortress - it's included in your",
          "Interesting place to visit with a lot of history, the museum is quite extensive. However the signage on the museum exhibits could be better, at least in the English translation. It appears as if they are all written for young children. Views from the top are also excellent",
          "A great view of the surrounding areas. Provides an interesting history of Salzburg. It has a panorama restaurant but opted to dine at St Peters restaurant (claims to be the oldest in Europe).",
          "Lovely that ticket price includes the funicular in one direction. Lots of things to explore, all really well and access-ably presented, we loved our day here!",

          "This is a must do when in Salzburg. On a fine day, the views from the top are amazing. The museums however are also well worth visiting (most are accessible as part of the basic ticket however there are a couple that you have to pay extra for). Depending on how much time you",
          "We took the \u2018lift\u2019 as it\u2019s a rather steep climb. Very interesting place which gave a good insight into how they lived in the past. Great views over the city.",
          "The fortress was the first place we visited during our trip to Salzburg and what a great way to start. Whilst there isn\u2019t a whole lot to see within the fortress walls, the view the fortress provides overlooking the city of Salzburg on one side and the mountains on the other was",
          "Salzburg is a small city , so Salzburg Castle is must seen if you are visiting. Beautiful castle with nice restaurant and cafe if you want a break. I really enjoyed visiting",
          "Getting around is strange. All other visitors all felt the same. There's very little to see besides the view.",
          "I was expecting this to be four walls with maybe some placards or signs explaining some of the history but this is a full on museum. Well worth the \u20ac10 entry (which includes the funicular rail in one direction). You can also get a ticket that includes a puppet show and and",
          "Short concise history about the castle. Very imposing views from the top. A must do when in Salzburg. Salzburg card is very useful for these and other tours.",
          "This fortress is very unique because it is in such great condition. Well worth a visit! We have visited numerous castles and this is the best. It also has an extensive collection of military history.",
          "The your explains the history of Salzburg. It is quite challenging to walk up but you cannot take the lift. Beautiful views from the fortress.",
          "It is worth going up to the fortress simply for the amazing 360 degree views of both the city and the countryside around Salzburg.",
          "This was a great experience and the views were amazing! We spent a long time on the top viewing the panoramic scenes. The ticket we got included the funicular (tram) up but they didn't explain we had to pay extra to view the state rooms - however, they were worth a visit!",
          "This was a great experience. The audio tour is a must. It helped us navigate the sites with ease and provided valuable info. Paid the extra 3.60 to see the private chambers of the nobility and was well worth it. The view was picturesque. Could not ask for a better day.",
          "We took the funicular both ways as a time saver. I wish we'd had more time but managed to see most of it. Be sure to get an orientation plan brochure as it will be a big help. We chose the Basic Ticket which allows access to most of the fortress. As it was late, we opted for",
          "It is a hike up to this spot and we only looked at it from the distance but this fortress makes for a wonderful backdrop for photos when in Salzburg.",
          "We left our group behind and hiked the hills to the Fortress and then logged in on line to get fast passes. We explored the fortress with stunning views of the Alps, historic information dating back centuries and met many of the locals as well as a few Americans. Coming in",
          "Set high above the city is this imposing fortress, which was the home of the Archbishop. The funicular railway will take you to the top and plan to spend at least a couple of hours here. The Christmas stalls don\u2019t open till about 3pm but there\u2019s lots to see and great views of",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed touring the fortress! We walked up the from east side of town after visiting the Nonnberg Abbey and that was a mistake...should have taken the funicular to the fortress first and then walked down to Nonnberg instead. The included audio tour was interesting",
          "We visited Hohensalzburg fortress during autumn and it was totally worth it.I suggest taking the funicular up and down if you have limited time.The view from the fortress is absolutely SPECTACULAR!This is a majestic castle having numerous rooms which exhibit historical",
          "Our main problem was poor signs so we found ourselves walking a long way to find what we were looking for. There were not many people around to ask either. The two cafes/ restaurants had very poor menus; surely most people want hearty quick meals - soup, sandwiches, pies, not",
          "recommend to go up by train see the fortress exhibitions and buildings, enjoy the 360 view over Salzburg and surroundings and walk down the hill in a nice nature park setting. entrance required only for the exhibition",
          "Definitely worth going up to see the fortress to see the city from up above! Also we took the funicular up to the Fortress so that was a lot of fun, there is a ticket for the funicular.",
          "The museum tour and state rooms tour is a bit of a rip off in my opinion. The funicular ride is fun and the view from the fortress is amazing. But that\u2019s about all really, I spent an hour here and it really was 60 minutes of my life I can\u2019t get back.",
          "Came here nice and early right when they opened and got the first funicular up which I recommend as we were coming down it was very busy. Buy the all inclusive ticket which includes entrance via funicular and entrance to all museums. They had Christmas markets however I don\u2019t",
          "A lovely old fortress with excellent explanatory displays, rooms to see and terrific views. It can be reached by a funicular but this isn't essential as the climb from the town isn't as bad as it looks.",
          "Hohensalzburg Fortress sits atop the Festungsberg, a small hill in the Austrian city of Salzburg. Whether you walk up the road to get to the fortress or take the funicular, visiting Fortress Hohensalzburg is a must-do/see .",
          "We took the funicular up. On a clear day views are amazing. We ate in the restaurant, really great selection, the staff were really friendly and helpful. They have installed a lift and ramp, really helpful for my sister-in-law. A definite place to go visit",
          "Really can't do without taking a tour of the fortress at least to enjoy a full 360 overview of the city and the surrounding mountains. Audio-guide is a nice opportunity to enjoy the visit without being stuck with a big group... you can take your time and appreciate what you",
          "This fairly quick yet very informative and well-done tour is a great way to learn about the Salzburg history. The fortress has had many inhabitants and seen so much in its hundreds of years. It sits atop a hill overlooking the city and overs amazing views of the area.",
          "Definitely worth doing, especially if the views are clear--panoramic views all around. Take the rail unless you have marathon-running fitness. There are some places to eat in the fortress, although we did not try them. The museum exhibits are amongst the best presented that",
          "Oh I do love a castle and this is a good one. You can see it for miles around and really, when you visit Salzburg, you should not miss it. Great view of course over the entire city and just walking around it is to immerse yourself in history. Check out my photos of the castle",
          "Whether you walk up the road to get to the fortress or take the funicular, visiting Fortress Hohensalzburg is a must-do/see in Salzburg. It's well worth the 13 euro or so (which includes a one-way ride on the funicular as well and a free audio tour). The fortress is very",
          "We visited during the Christmas market. There were several locations which served mulled wine and snacks. The views were amazing. The museum in the fortress is interesting and provides the history of the fortress - took about an hour to get through. We took the funicular both",
          "Our grils loved the train to the top and back down. Expansive free area to walk around, not sure we ever found the museum. Awesome views at sunset and of the whole of Salzburg.",
          "Clearly it is a beautiful place with some spectacular views. You get there with a funicular which is included in the ticket price so it\u2019s great. If you have height issues you should go to the right side after you exit from the funicular, on the left path it\u2019s a bit more scary.",
          "Beautiful views! Still remember visiting 35 years ago and just took my own kids. They loved it. We didn\u2019t tour inside.",
          "Great historical site with many information about history of region and fortress progress and living there. Advent weekend with nice market inside!",
          "Well worth a visit. Views amazing.Nice market up there too and refreshments. Musuem and shop too. Lots of interesting facts, the funicular reaches the top in one minute. Don't forget to visit the graveyard on ground level.",
          "Strongest advise if doing a few museums is to get the Salzburg museum card. We got the two day card and saved over \u20ac40 each on what we did in that time thanks to the card As others have said there are several compartments ,for want of a better description ,to the fortress.",
          "Beautiful views of Salzburg. You could see the whole city from here and there was a lot of history too. You can do an audio tour to the best viewing point which I definitely recommend.",
          "We went with our young son\u2019s and we all left loving the experience. The Fortress is amazing and incredibly rich in history which we got to experience with an audio tour. Furthermore, the views of Salzburg are absolutely breathtaking...you can also take the trolley from the",
          "Didn\u2019t get to tour the Fortress last time I was in Salzburg. It was definitely the best sight and I highly recommend it. It only takes about 2 hours and the funicular trip was nice and quick. The top of the fortress offers spectacular view and the audio guide tour and the",
          "Interesting history in this fortress. The views from on top were pretty awesome. We ate at there restaurant and it was kinda dark and quite. I guess it was common of that time but they had good strudel.",
          "You can explore the Hohensalzburg Fortress with the help of 14 storytelling spots, where a part of the castle's history completes the view. The museum provides headphone guides in many languages also sharing interesting stories from the past. The panoramic view from the fortress",
          "This amazing 1,000 year old fortress is best enjoyed on a clear day to allow for a leisurely view of the Austrian Alps and a stunning view of the ancient city. There aren't a lot of interesting buildings to see inside, but the views are amazing. TIP: Stop for a cappuccino and",
          "I visited the place during winter season and really enjoyed the view of city and christmas markets. There are lot of christmas market in front of the Salzburg cathedral and it's a nice experience.",
          "Go on the vernicular railway to the Fortress. Various different tours on offer, we only did the basic one, the tour was brilliant and we had an excellent view of the city.",
          "What an outstanding view of Salzburg from the top!!! While the fortress itself was a historical delight, we enjoyed the beautiful sights of God\u2019s creation!!! If you visit Salzburg, be sure to take the \u2018FUN\u2019icular up the mountain.",
          "This fortress is very interesting and one could easily spend the day there, walking, taking in the sights and eating.",
          "Nice place to visit and spent a day in this tour. Beautiful scenery from fortress. Clean toilets. Visited in October 2019.",
          "Not wanting to do much else in Salzburg, I found it very difficult to get near it by car - parking nearby is impossible. No signs really point towards it, you have to get into the heart of the inner city on foot to finally get near the funicular, though my guess is that a climb,",
          "Food: 3/5 Service: 5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Decor & Style: 5/5 Atop the Fortress Hohensalzburg is a restaurant where you can sit and look...at...this...view (see my pictures). I sat here for 4 hours. Yes, I said 4 (four, cuatro, quatre, \u56db s\u00ec) . We snacked the whole time, drank",
          "Loved the trip up and down in the funicular. Queues for tickets were long so we were pleased to have purchased previously from our tour guide. Views from the castle are amazing. We visited the areas of the castle that could be viewed at no extra cost and felt we saw plenty",
          "We spent a few hours here and found a bench to eat our packed lunch. This is the oldest castle in Europe never to have been conquered and is well worth a visit. It has been around since 1077 and can be reached by the funicular railway (in place for 120 years). We had limited",
          "I have a bad knee so I was grafeful that there is an elevator for gaining access to the fortress' museum. There is a automted puppetrt performance to tell the history of the fortress.It is very amazing to see decorated wood paneling from the Middle Ages! The museum is very",
          "The fortress is very imposing and impressive. The views from the top are fantastic, you can see the whole city of Salzburg below. Once you are up there, by the funicular railway if you don't want to walk up the steps, there is a delightful cafe with stunning views in the other",
          "Relax - look around and have tea or drinks and snack at one of the restaurants [outdoor] overlooking the mountains.",
          "The day we visited, the sky was thick with cloud, so we weren\u2019t sure if the view would be worth it by the time we got to the top. We walked up the hill to the fortress. Seeing the rooftops of the city from different heights was well worth the trek, if you can handle stretches",
          "This castle site atop the whole of the city, so worth viewing to take some beautiful photos. Its worth seeing and the history is interesting. Plus the train up if a bit of fun.",
          "difficult to reach i porpose to you but deserve it wonderful view of the valley nice photos medieval arcitcture and culture",
          "Very popular place, many tourists Round trip in funicular costs 12.90 euro Great views of the city and mountains",
          "We had hemmt the Salzburg card (worth getting it) and skipped the q to go up with the railway. A steep ascent but the view from above was stunning. The castle is well preserved and there are few rooms available to visit. Make sure to go early as it got really crowded on the way",
          "Easy to reach with the funicular (Hohensalzburg Bahn). We went here with our Salzburg card (also includes the funicular). The museum exhibits several rooms used by the rulers that used to live there, which are still in the original state. Easy to understand information about",
          "It is the axis of Salzburg, on top of the hill. The audioguide , despite only having 6 points of information, was very carefully planned and laid out. The view of Salzburg from up there was very breathtaking.",
          "Looking for something to do to enhance our education of the area. Great choice! We had done a walking tour the day before and this day solidified the information learned then. Lots of walking but the extraordinary views are worth it. Cafes and gift shops and museums all part of",
          "This historic castle holds a commanding position overlooking the old town and the river below. Access is either a very steep walk or take the funicular railway cutting out the steepest incline. The fortress contains museums and fabulous views of the city and surrounding area.",
          "The visit was interesting and a lot od things to see. Also for the kids. But ince you see a castle, there is really nothing much to see. Still it is a must in Salzburg. If not for the rest, surely for the spectacular view.",
          "Firstly, if you walk from the town it's a steep hike, so allow yourself 20 minutes to do it, but it is free. I arrived an hour before closing, so they only allowed me entry into the outside grounds and the observation tower, but they only charged me a few Euros instead of the",
          "Take the funicular--it's easy and you see great views on the way up and down. Once up there, there is a tour with an audioguide for you to go at your own pace thru a portion of the fortress. The wealth of these rooms are incredible! The museum and arsenal were also",
          "Go. They require a 100 word answer, but just go. Views are amazing. The extra expensivr ticket is not necessarily worth it. Take the fununcilar (sp?). The look of the ppl walking up was not healthy.",

          "Good views and a nice day. Cable car up to the top or you can walk. Lovely when its sunny too see the views of Salzburg",
          "Great views of Salzburg. Worth even you go with Salzburg card and see only one museum inside. Go with the funicular and protect your legs",
          "It's lovely castle were you can climb up or go by funicular railway. The place is renovated and makes impression. We took a audio tour which was good enough to know the story of the place. The weather sucked, but views were amazing anyway! It's must be point on the map of",
          "but there's a fee to get in; we were content to walk up to it and walk around it although I hear from other travelers that it is well worth visiting.",
          "Here is an attraction that combines history and panoramic beauty in one. The trip on funicular is best way to enjoy the touring of the fortress. The history was in English so was very easy to understand and but the tour with audio is best so as not to miss anything.allow plenty",
          "It was the last touristy thing I did, and I left so angry and frustrated...and I still have yet to receive an email responding to my complaint. They obviously don\u2019t care because they got your money and now they don\u2019t have to answer to you. I bought the cheapest ticket for the",
          "Interesting history, good amount of info without being too much and not super crowded! It\u2019s a hike to get up there, wear sneakers and grab a bottle of water to share.",
          "Nice place and worth the visit while you are in Salzburg specially for teenagers if they are interested in castles. Otherwise like any other castles in Europe.",
          "We visited here on a day trip to Salzburg. We took the funicular to the top and also back down as we had somewhat limited time. We toured the various buildings and rooms and really enjoyed the history that came to life during the visit. I would recommend coming if you are in",
          "Lots of interesting information nicely presented, about this fortress, and how it developed, some inter-active displays, video and models showing the growth of this important site.",
          "We were in Salzburg in wonderful autumn weather so decided to climb up to the Fortress rather than taking the cable car. Fabulous views and a decidedly impressive building. We didn't tour inside as time was short.....but walked across to the Modern Art Museum which was a",
          "Beautiful views of Salzburg. Pricy, but one of those kind of things you have to do. Take the funicular. It\u2019s worth the money.",
          "We purchased these tickets as a last minute fill in activity and have deep regrets that we did not allow more time. We took the funicular up and down. I sadly injured my ankle a few days prior and couldn't handle the walk up or down. Do get at least the funicular up, and the",
          "We spent most of a day here after the short funicular ride up. Unrivalled views over Salzburg and surrounding area, and very interesting museums to discover along with a few of the Royal rooms. Great caf\u00e9 to sit and enjoy the views also.",
          "We wanted to see a castle while in the Salzburg area and had to decide between Hohenwerfen and Hohensalzburg. Both being designed by the same architects in the same time period, we chose Hohenwerfen because of its rural location near the Alps. We were very happy with our",
          "Was very nice touring the fortress and walking the grounds and stairs. Fantastic view of Salzburg from numerous locations. A must see attraction for Salzburg",
          "Unfortunately i had been there by night, it was marvellous. Definitely want to see there again in the daytime",
          "Largest fully preserved castle in central Europe - fascinating to see and offers incredible views of Salzburg and surrounding mountains.",
          "Stunning views from the castle and couldn\u2019t get over how big the whole complex was. Bit windy for a beer at 4\u20ac.",
          "Bought the early bird package on line. Clear and easy enough. Early bird package is for arrival before 1000am. Not only saves a bit of money but getting there earlier avoids the crowds. There are several exhibit areas with pretty good explanations that can be visited. You can",
          "the place is very nice you can see the whole town from the fortress. The view is lovely. Lots of thing to see with history around it.",
          "Fortress is seen from almost anywhere in Salzburg. Well worthwhile tour through this massive fortress that is well over a 1000 years old. Awesome view of Salzburg from the towers.",
          "We were fortunate to have lunch at the open air restaurant on to of the fortress with fantastic views. The food and service was good and quick. The fortress is one of the highlights of Salzburg with lots of history well presented. Allow several hours for the tour.",
          "This excursion makes for a wonderful evening. We booked the VIP package (dinner + concert). This was worth every penny!!! The cable car brings you to the fortress & is free when you show your printed ticket. I do recommend arriving at the ticket office 45/30 min before the",
          "We paid 12 euros for the funicular. The line was not long maybe 10 minutes wait. Once on top the views are incredible on a clear day, but nothing else about it. We didn\u2019t go inside, I don\u2019t think that the 15 dollars included going inside, but anyway there is so many things to do",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the visit. After a ride up the funicular and a walk around the castle and its various nooks and crannies we finished with the museum where we found the regimental area and its WW1 exhibits very interesting.",
          "I headed past the giant Mozart Ball [the golden one with the man on top] and headed up a narrow path towards the funicular sign hanging outside the entrance. For a basic ticket not including a tour of the museum it was E12.90, for the full tour it was about E16. For a great view",
          "The reason that this is not 5 stars is because the chop the castle up in sections to be able to charge more. The real burn here is that the Salzburg Tourism Card will not get you into the more ornate residential section even though it covers the funicular ride and the rest of",
          "I wish the castle was more open for just wandering through the inside areas, but the castle and the museum inside was very cool",
          "You have to ensure that the furnicular ticket option of all inclusive is taken when going here. It costs around 16EUR. The view from the top is marvelous, if the sun is out.",
          "We enjoyed our visit - great exercise when you walk up to the fortress. It's well worth it to get the ticket that includes the prince's chamber, we found this the most interesting part of our visit. The all-in ticket includes the price of the funicular which we took to get",
          "Families will love this. A must see if you visit Salzburg. a perfect view all over Salzburg till the mountains!",
          "It is a lot of walking and a lot of stairs but very well worth the efforts. Very interesting history",
          "We did this on our last day in the city, and were not disappointed! We took the funicular, and mostly just took advantage of the beautiful, sunny weather, did not fully explore the fortress. We enjoyed the restaurant (lunch & drinks), and was a relaxing place to spend our final",
          "This is definitely something you need to see if you ever come and visit Salzburg. There is a castle a lot of beautiful buildings and places you will definitely enjoy.",
          "Museum was fun to walk through - loved the audio guide. You can go at whatever pace you want. Wandering around the fortress was wonderful too - loved all the views! It's the best place to really see all of Salzburg. My favorite may have been the marionette museum though - don't",
          "You see how large it is when you are in the city, but when you actually go up there and walk around, the scale of the place really impacted me greatly. It feels like walking around in a past age. Definitely go if you can!",

          "I tend to seek out the highest spots in every place that I visit, so the Fortress was a given. I hiked up twice before actually visiting the fortress. The funicular is much easier, especially if you're not used to steep climbs. Once you arrive, you take a directed path through",

          "We walked up. It\u2019s not that hard! A fair few things to see, particularly the countryside the other side. The grand view over the city is worth the admission price by itself.",

          "Went up to the Fortress by the funicular, very efficient service, ticket lasts all day, but entry to some parts of the fortress is an extra cost. There are 3 restaurants/cafes with views across Salzburg.",
          "We enjoyed the fortress but honestly didn\u2019t find the museum portion very appealing. I\u2019ve done the tower look-out portion before and I would say that\u2019s really the only exciting thing.",

          "We decided to come here just after breakfast. This ensures you avoid the big tour guide groups who start appearing in Salzburg around mid-morning. So we had no delay in getting in the cable car and woosh, you're up there in a flash. The state rooms are still in a wonderful",
          "Lots of history high above Salzburg. Great views and enjoyed all of the different exhibits about history. Marionettes were fun as well!",
          "Took the 1-minute finicular ride up and back - no big deal. Unfortunately for us, on this trip we had visited a number of castles, so by comparison, this was very plain. It's basically a bare museum, no furnishings, but a lot of display equipment and cases. My favorite one was",
          "Great 360\u00b0 view of the Town and surrounding mountains. Audioguide of tower only. Well organized. State rooms exhibits curated well. Only problem is there are not enough WC for women.",
          "We visited today, the ride up and down was spectacular. The view ostentatious. That\u2019s where it ended, hot and muggy. No service at restaurants, walked out as we could not get a beer. If u want a 100% view then go there.",
          "If you only do one thing in Salzburg this is the top one! The view from the top of the castle is fantastic plus there are lots of exhibits within. It is worth the 10 Euro entry. Walk to the top yourself unless you have a medical problem!",
          "Great view from the fortress and very interesting to walk through . Many displays are there to look at but I would like to have seen more rooms set up as they would have been it that era . Worth the effort to get up there for sure. .",

          "The castle was okay, but after visiting the amazing castle in Ljubliana, Slovenia last year we found this castle a bit of a disappointment, particularly the puppet museum, which was quite small and not as interactive in Salzburg.",
          "We visited this place on a rainy day in September. Luckily it stopped raining by early afternoon The audio assists one to understand the place v well and there is an audio for children as well. The views are magnificent!!! However the signage is poor and we kept going round in",
          "I honestly expected a lot more from the visit. The fortress is a mediocre structure, poorly presented and shoddy maintenance. Once again something that could've been so much better ruined by commercialism and way too many tourists.",
          "The view from the fortress is amazing and the tour and historical presentations are informative. However, the order in which you go through the fortress is not clear and the audio tour is only for a small section. The displays are mostly in English as well as German so that",
          "Wherever you go in Salzburg you see the fortress. Go up and see the place for yourself. No visit to the city is complete without a visit here. At night you can then enjoy looking up at it in the evening light. A very special place.",
          "Great view, but lots of restoration work going on in the internal areas and it wasn't clear if there was a direction to walk in, what to learn from the origins of the fortress. Kind of stumbled upon that. This is also true of the religious depictions, but this may be me",
          "I didn't think I'd initially visit the fortress; I usually have a long list of churches or palaces or gardens to see and photograph... but my friend suggested it and I went along on a rainy morning. We took the funicular up and did \"the whole tour\" ticket. It is a large",
          "The \"funicular\" makes it easy to visit the fortress from the old town. Walking up to it looks a daunting prospect. It's a big old place, and checking out every nook and cranny could take a while. It feels old, despite a good deal of conservation (ongoing) but pedestrian",
          "The fortress is fabulous. Salzburg is a fantastic city, way above what I expected, and the fortress is plain fantastic.",
          "This is definitely worth a visit. I wouldn\u2019t automatically recommend the \u2018all inclusive\u2019 ticket, as quite frankly I wasn\u2019t all impressed with the history rooms. It was a little all over the place with history and didn\u2019t seem to tell a smooth story. This being said, we loved the",
          "Access via a funicular which had disabled access to it, however when up in the fortress the access was more of a challenge - but made it to the top! The views of Saltzburh were amazing and well worth the effort, we loved the marionette exhibition. There are places to eat,",
          "Fabulous place and a must see when visiting the beautiful city of Salzburg. Follow the fortress\u2019s evolution through the ages and the subsequent additions made necessary by advances in military technology. Although the gates were opened to the French during the Napoleonic wars,",
          "The fortress dominates the city of Salzburg and is accessible by foot or fanicula. We chose the later. The is a lot of history up there, but the most impressive experience is the view. We had a pretzel and a drink in the outdoor seating area of the restaurant and had good",
          "This is worth a visit but recommend in cooler weather! It\u2019s a bit of a trek. Views are incredible and great photo opportunities. Get the Salzburg Card to ensure you get value for money!! 25 bus gets you there from train station if you are that way out.",
          "We had a wonderful experience at the Fortress. Meal was fantastic, music was also. Views from the walls of the Fortress wr amazing. Maybe one suggestion- better signage for people attending this event.",
          "Dominating Salzburg, this historic Schloss is well worth a visit. A four minute ride on the funicular will deliver you to the main castle site. The whole edifice has been sympathetically restored over the years and offers amazing views over Salzburg and the surrounding area.",

          "We bought tickets for the castle and the train which brings you up there. There was almost no queue and the ride is really short. The castle is quite large and for a part you can rent audio guide which is really worth it. Unfortunately at the point when we wanted to enter the",
          "Interesting enough but even with the all inclusive ticket a visit doesn't take more than 1.5 hours, it is cheaper to walk up to the castle , the full ticket including state rooms is only 12.40 instead of 16 , and you get to take the funicular down , very easy walk, about 10",
          "We toured the fortress and also did dinner and a concert. A must when visiting Salzburg. The views of the city are amazing. The dinner in the patio was a real treat",

          "It was quite a hike, though it was manageable. There's a tram but it was more breathtaking -pun intended- to see the view while walking. Amazing view from the fortress! Interesting architecture with humungous doors maybe designed for dragons..? It had a rich history with visual",
          "Fantastic views of Salzburg and the surrounding area but a bit pricey for what is on offer. The funicular is less than a minute and the audio tour is over in 30 mins",
          "The views from the fortress were beyond anything that I was expecting. So much to see and absorb while being able to sit back quietly and absorb the history.",
          "Been there in early September. Took the funicular up and walked down. The walk was quite pleasant, around 10-15mins and with shades. The view from the fortress is amazing. The state room is average. Overall still worth a visit if not just to see the city from a high point.",
          "Great place to visit, a must in fact! really good history and you can overlook the lovely house and lake used in the sound of music (well one of them). You can have lunch up there too! It's great!",

          "My friends and I took a tour of the Hohensalzburg fortress recently and it was quite enjoyable. There is a very efficient lift that whisks you up to the castle from the old city. Once there you will enjoy spectacular views of Salzburg. The castle itself is quite interesting",
          "It was good to look from outside. We did not go inside but it's pretty visible from the center and bridge of love.",
          "The fortress is a hodgepodge of Byzantine passageways and opulent rooms. This is how Salzburg was ruled for hundreds of years. A must see sight here.",
          "Love the nice view from the top . Worth the visit and should not miss it. Will visit again if I was to go to Salzburg again.",
          "A great place to visit, especially if you would like to burn some fat walking to the top. The history, engineering and views ticked my boxes.",
          "Visited the fortress in September 2019. Took the funicular railway to the fortress and walked around. The view from the fortress was spectacular. On one end, a view of the river and entire city, and on the other end, the view of the valley and mountains. There was a also an",

          "This is the type of place you would want to visit if you like history. It is an important landmark in the heart of Mozart's city. It was built in the 11th century and it's a must see in Salzburg. Buy tickets online for better deals.",
          "My girlfriend and I enjoyed a few steins at the restaurant halfway up the castle. I don\u2019t remember the name of the place but the view is fantastic. I have included a few pictures of the view. Salzburg is a beautiful city and well worth a day trip.",
          "The fortress is like the most recomended place to visit, but I actually think it's not that worth it! Most of the place is empty! They have no explanation of the exposition in english, so unless you use your audioguide there is no way you will understand it!",
          "Great place to visit. The views over the city are stunning, the exhibits are really interesting. Easy to spend a few hours here.",
          "Seeing fortress from far bottom and seeing fat bottom from fortress top both amazing. The fortress is in old city with nearly every popular destination nearby. There is funicular to take to fortress which is included in Salzburg card.",
          "Worth the price of admission for sure! Did not pay to see the sleeping chambers as we were short on time. Plan a decent amount of time though. There is a lot to see in all the nooks of the fortress. Take your time and enjoy the view and the history.",
          "Even if you don\u2019t care about all the history associated with this fortress the tour is worth it just for the views. Salzburg is a lovely city to visit and this should be one of the things to do and see. Get the early bird special to save money and avoid the crowds. Also the",
          "Wow! The views from the top of the fortress are amazing - certainly worth the 16 euros we paid for the funicular to get us up there (which also included a tour of the state rooms). It's like a small town once you get to the top, lots of rooms and interesting things to see. While",
          "Views from the top are well worth it. I had the Salzburg card so got the funicular up and walked down. If I didn\u2019t have the card, I think walking up is fine. Inside the fortress I didn\u2019t find too interesting but it\u2019s worth it for the views. Puppet museum is ok.",
          "We visited the fortress / castle on a flying visit. So glad we made time. We decided to get there nice and early and got a discounted early bird ticket. This is certainly the way to go. It was cheaper and it was quieter. So we didn\u2019t have to queue for th funicular which I hear",
          "Fortress Hohensalzburg is a huge site and the story is not as well told as some smaller forts we visited. Its sheer size makes it a bit daunting to cover. That said, the views of Salzburg are unbeatable and it's fun to ride the funicular up to the location. Go for the views and",

          "This is definitely a must do in Salzburg and should be on the top of your list of things to do in Salzburg. The museums are well done and in several languages. I would have given it 4 and half stars. Only reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars is the signs for getting around to each",

          "After having spent around forty-five minutes queuing up for the all-inclusive ticket for the Castle, we took the funicular up to the top, looking forward our visit. Once at the top, there didn't seem to be much happening at all, other than restaurants. Many of the smaller rooms",

          "I really enjoyed this visit and especially how the museum was laid out. It had a little bit of history in each room, with lots to see, so it wasn\u2019t too overwhelming with reading facts and dates. The views from up there are gorgeous and show you the whole city. We hadn\u2019t done",

          "It was a hot day in Salzburg and we decided to go to the fortress for the views. Little did we know that it was also cooler up there. The views were spectacular and there was lots of history of the fortress and surrounding area.",
          "I am a castle fan and medieval stuff person, so I couldn't miss this one. One reason of many is that everyone talking about it when it comes to castles in Austria. But I must say, it's nothing more that one of those overhyped castles. As I was reading a reviews here, people",
          "You can't help but see this impressive fortress from far away when in Salzburg. We had a all inclusive ticket and there is a lot to see inside but the views from up here looking down to Salzburg really do take your breath away. Amazing views and photo opportunities. Easy way up",
          "A must see when in Salzburg. It\u2019s an incredible structure. It\u2019s a great walk from the city up to the fortress and there\u2019s a funicular to do the last stage for you.

          "The castle is very well preserved and has excellent information. For the best information and nicest experience it is better to get an all inclusive pass. The tower, state rooms, and museum are well worth the extra euros. Prepare for walking and stairs. The view of Salzburg was",

          "Even if your not into history the views of the old city and mountains alone are breathtaking, and worth the trip. Visited in August on a very hot day. It is advisable to book tickets online and to go early in the day so to avoid long lines and heat. Audio tour was",
          "As with other attractions in August, try and arrive early. The queue for the funicular train gets long. You can walk up the hill though. The audio guide is informative. There\u2019s a screen which has an illustrated history of how the fortress was built which is interesting and",

          "It's more of a tourist trap than an old fortress. There are cafes, construction work and trash everywhere. You can't enter a lot of the buildings, and some of the few you can enter has an addition charge to the already expensive entrance ticket. Furthermore there wasn't much",
          "You will get a good overview over the history of the castle. We had an audio guide which was sufficient for us. The location offers stunning views over Salzburg and the hinterland till the Alps. You should walk - taking the lift means long queues. Your reward can be be a cold",
          "We enjoyed our ride up on the Funicular. There was a long line for tickets down the street but my husband went in the ticket office to the left and easily purchase tickets. There were restaurants up there, one with spectacular views! It was fun walking around the fortress and",
          "Great day out & worth a visit. we didn't do the full tour, just the castle & grounds which was reasonably priced. Great views to the Alps & over Salzburg itself.",
          "Gorgeous castle high above Salzburg, amazing views, lovely walk up the mountain or, alternatively, a quick funicular ride. The queues for the museums can get pretty long, so my advice is to get there early",
          "I always dreamed of seeing something like this. A castle on top of a mountain. From the city it looks amazing, there are two ways of going up, either walking or talking the tram, the did the second one, being tired from all the walking in Europe. It is such a beautiful place",
          "Not to be confused with the Hohen-Salzburg Castle, this is Hohenwerfen which is around 43 km away so you cannot see Salzburg from here, however the Hohen-Salzburg castle does provide excellent views of Salzburg, see photos... excellent access by funicular which was quite bereft",
          "We bought a family package that included a round-trip funicular ride, entrance to the castle, and audio guide. Could not find the audio guide rental window till the end. Exhibits were okay - a lot about archdukes, archbishops, and WWI. I preferred the museum of modern art.",
          "Family trip from Munich, loved the view from the top and the room with all the wood paneling. So much to see and experience history. My 13 year old loved it, especially a stop at the cafe for a fresh pretzel.",
          "It is always listed as one of the top 10 sights in Salzburg, and the history of the fortress is interesting, but truly there isn't much to see. I would recommend the funicular, and the ticket allows you into the museum within the fortress. If possible, I would either combine",
          "Got the basic ticket which gets the funnicular and entry to the castle. Best to get their early to avoid the crowds. Views from the top are stunning and the history is easy to understand and not too overwhelming. Get a map as the wayfinding signs are a bit hit and miss.",
          "As some of the other lower reviews have said, there's not much to see. There are tremendous views and some rooms with things in them, but many rooms are blocked off, you end up walking around empty rooms and long hallways where battlements were in the distant past. I was a bit",

We only rode the fenicular, we skipped the \u201dall inclusive\u201d with entrance to museums etc. Note that the \u201dbasic ticket\u201d, the cheapest does give you entrance to the lookout tower with amazing views. The ride was expensive but in the heat it was worth it. Only",
          "Well worth a visit as the views over Salzburg are simply stunning. There is not as much to see inside the castle as expected, but it is very well presented.",
          "This fort is nicely maintained. One can visit with friends & family. However, it is not a 'must see' attraction in Salzburg, if you are not keen about visiting historical places.",
          "The funicular ride was short but fun with great views. The views from the op were spectacular. We walked all around the fortress and visited the marionette museum which was very interesting. It had marionettes and parts, and also very old dioramas. We loved being outside taking",
          "You wouldnt want to come down from the fortress. best weather, best food, and people never stop smiling . could spend hours just sitting at different corners to admire the view",
          "Wonderful views, great little restaurant with a cute outdoor patio with that amazing view and super friendly staff and the castle and the history are quite fascinating. We bought the Salzburg card which included the funicular ride and admission - total money saver!",
          "Touring the Fortress is amazing. You get headphones so you learn about the history and can go at your own pace. A must visit for sure.",
          "We decided to go to visit the fort as it was early and we luckily did not have to wait for the rail car to take us up, if you were late I think it could get busy, awesome views from the fort. It was ok inside but we have seen better.",
          "Incredible quartet joined by an expert pianist for a while. Lead violinist was the best, but the other 2 were wonderful too, but my personal favorite was the cellist as he seemed to be beyond passionite with his cello and the music. A+++ experience!",
          "It\u2019s a very fascinating castle both in it\u2019s history and it\u2019s architecture and is of course one of those things you have to do if you are in Salzburg. The tip is to walk up to the castle and then take the tramline down. There was no que at the ticket office at the entrance when",
          "We took the M\u00f6nchsberg lift (less than \u20ac5 for 5 of us). This took us up the hill where we had a lovely walk along to the Hohensalzburg. We had lots of great views of the city and walked all the way to the Nonnberg Abbey. Well worth it. From there an easy walk right into the",
          "It was a cool place to explore for a few hours. Can\u2019t turn a good fortress down with a great view! It had your typical winding staircase to the top, and cavern filled with creepy marionettes, but all in all, a well spent few hours!",
          "Commanding views of the city and lots to explore. You could wander around and spend the better part of a day here taking everything in. We suggest taking the cable car up and walking around at the top. To see even more, walk to Monchsberg on your way out and take the elevator",
          "Arrive by a James Bond style lift you then have the opportunity to walk through most of the rooms in the castle. Outside the views are stunning and there a number of eateries where you can dine. Once you have visited all the rooms in the castle you have the opportunity to walk",
          "We decided to walk up to the Fortress which sits majestically above the Old Town, it was a very hot day so slightly challenging and we are relatively fit couple. It is a fascinating tour of the many rooms and you gain an interesting insight into the history.",
          "Reason this is #1 on the must do there list. The line to get in goes really quick! Don\u2019t be turned off by the line at all. Each pods that goes up holds 60 people and it only takes 1 min to get you up there. Getting back down is quick and the same thing. Bathrooms are single",
          "Concert and dinner in the Fortress were a highlight of a very enjoyable stay in Salzburg. Dinner was enjoyable, with tasty pike as one of the main courses. Lovely views over the valley below from the Dining room and the castle in general. Most enjoyable Chamber Music concert.",
          "We actually hiked up to the Fortress instead of taking the train. It is of course gorgeous there , but the best part for us was the gentle hike/walk around the fortress to the Modern Art Museum, and then down back into town .",
          "I loved beeing up here. The fortress in nice and there are nice cafes just to relax and enjoy the amazing view of Salzburg. Salzburg is a great city. I would definitely want to come back.",
          "It is absolutely stunning. A little crowded during the day. Also dont miss out on the brewery in the fortress. Greta views.",
          "We visited the castle yesterday and opted for the basic ticket rather than the All inclusive ticket based on the information in the brochure. All we were interested in were the views from the top of the castle, and a visit to the Golden Hall and the Golden Chamber. The all",
          "Take the cable car up and then the historical audio tour. The \"torture chamber\" is a little eerie. Fantastic 360 views of the area. The construction history is more interesting than its military significance.",
          "Lots to see both inside and outside. We missed the sign on the floor that pointed one to the State Rooms. By the time we had gone through the museum rooms, and realised we had possibly missed the State rooms, teenage sons were rather weary and not keen to queue to go back in",
          "This is one of the places in Salzburg you should see. I enjoyed the visit, but I\u2019d like to provide a couple of opinions and a feedback: - the tickets: if you buy your tickets online, and you\u2019re from North America, make sure your QR code is not cut. The ticket PDF file is made",
          "Apart from the view, which is spectacular, there nothing to see in the museum. Even though audioguides are available, the information along the walls is not all informative and adds nothing to the exhibition. In addition, the rooms have no medieval environment reminding us of a",
          "Take the funicular up to Hohen Salzburg and be prepared for a magnificent view and fortress full of centuries of history",
          "The best place to view Salzburg is from the Fortress. You can enjoy the furnicular train up to the fortress or hike up the mountain on a series of narrow roads and stairs. The basic ticket gets you access to most of what you would need to see in the museum and on the fortress.",
          "Visited the fortress with no real expectations but thought it was excellent. \u20ac12.90 to enter but that included a very informative audio guide, access to the tower which provided stunning views across the Salzburg basin and access to the museum. Definitely worth the money, an",
          "Good value for money with all the museums to see. Fortress is spectacular and worth it for views alone.",
          "Definately worth a visit :) Impressive fortress buildings, interesting museums and great views over Salzburg. We enjoyed this visit very much!",
          "We did the pass that included the funicular up and down. The walk up the hill is very long, steep and potentially dangerous as there is loose gravel. If possible take the lift, especially if you are with older family members and children. It's worth the extra few euro. There is",

          "Unless you are with one of the many larger groups and travelling independently, you will need to check for the funicular railway entrance to take you up to the castle as its unobtrusively tucked away. The castle looks majestic dominating the city skyline on top of the hill. And",
          "We visited the Fortress in June 2019 and the walking in the cobbled streets was just spectacular, we took a tram up to the castle and the sight, the views from every angle was spectacular, the air at the top was cool amid a scorcher of a day, walking around such history and",

          "This was fantastic introduction to the city and well laid out experience. The views are amazing. Ordered our tickets online while standing outside the funcular and immediately afterwards we rode up to the top. Would recommend to anyone seeing the city.",
          "Amazing views of Salzburg and surroundings mountains, forests and rivers. The fortress is OK, not among the best (Hohenwerfen was much better). Audio tour is quite short, we bought the full ticket and visited also the prince chambers which are pretty impressive and interesting",
          "We did the pass that included the funicular up and down. The walk up is brutal and treacherous (slippery loose gravel), so take advantage of the lift! We paid the extra fee for the regency rooms. I personally found them a little overrated but my partner enjoyed them. Some of the",

          "The fortress dominates the Salzburg skyline and the views over the city and surrounding countryside from the ramparts are spectacular. We took the furnicular up to the top and simply wandered around on our own which in my book is much better than an organised tour as you can go",
          "Overlooks the city and gives spectacular views of the city. Use the stairs if you dare otherwise use the lift. Worth a visit",
          "The fortress sits formidably overlooking Salzburg, and contains many separate attractions. It struck me that most of the low star reviews were confused by part of the trip so I thought I\u2019d lay out how I approached it. If you wanted to do the trip for free you\u2019d need an hour or",
          "Unending staircases, magnificent view overlooking Salzburg! Either you take the staircase or you ride a cable car to get to the top. You\u2019ll have a 360 degree view of the city. If you choose to take the steps, don\u2019t worry cause there will be drinks and refreshments at the top!",
          "It has very great view of Salzburg, optional audio guides to tour the many rooms of the fortress, and cannons that you can look at, but a large amount of stairs. Very exhausting, but worth it for the view that comes at the end. Notice: I do not know how much it costs, because",

          "Visited the Fortress as a part of our holiday in Abtenau and the landmark of Salzburg. Only give this experience 3 stars because the audio tour only had 6 tracks in the first part of the visit. We have visited a number of other castles around Europe that actually had a lot more",
          "We walked up through the old town, that way the views emerge as you\u2019re climbing. The views from the fortress are wonderful and the history of the fortress fascinating. It\u2019s well curated and seems to be developing further.",
          "My wife and I visited here for our anniversary trip, and we were not disappointed! The fortress sits up there just waiting for you to come visit! You can walk up if you feel the need for some great exercise or you can take the funicular up for easier leg work \ud83d\ude0a. The views",

          "I very much enjoyed the walk around the castle and the views were outstanding. I would certainly come back. We saw a restaurant at the bottom of the steps to the terrace viewpoint which looked out. We thought, what a lovely place to have lunch. My friend and I ordered a salad",
          "The museum and artifacts of war are interesting for sure, but it's all about the views of Salzburg and the Alps. You can take many postcard-worthy photos from the fortress, or just stand there and take it in. The bonus is that the funicular ride is a fast and fun way to get to",
          "Definitely a must when in Salzburg. It\u2019s worth the entrance fee to pay for the funicular ride to thus fortress to take in the incredible views from the top. The fee also gets you into the museum.",

          "I don\u2019t think there is a better view of the city or the region. Once you get to the top (40 seconds via tram or 2 hours walk) the panoramic view is worth it. You can see the entire valley, the river, all of the buildings and the old walls. Just stunning.",

          "This fortress is really old and is preserved in that way. Tip: They urge you to pay more to visit the staterooms. They are not that great unless you are an avid history buff. The fortress interior, tower, and long walk are really awesome. This is definitely worth seeing.",
          "We accidentally hiked all the way to the top (my poor navigational skills) as opposed to taking the funicular with a stroller. It was a difficult walk but well worth it, the views were amazing and I highly recommend the visit!",
          "If you want to good view of the Salzburg and surrounding areas, it's the castle from where it can be achieved. Instead of taking cable car, we hiked up the castle and on route we found an amazing view point(photogenic).. Castle was also good..I specifically liked the puppet",

          "The funicular ride up to the fort was really fun for the kids. The views from the top incredible from all around. Great puppet exhibitions on top. All in all well worth a visit if you\u2019re in Salzburg.",
          "We had a mostly clear day, and you could see forever! The view of the city and countryside was wonderful. The funicular ride was fun -- half of my party had been before and had hiked up! The fortress tour was interesting -- to learn what was built when and by whom! The tour",

          "The castle tour includes an audiovisual presentation about the development of the castle site over the centuries, and the exhibits are definitely worth seeing. The views from the castle are spectacular. The funicular railway from the old town to the castle makes the trip up",

          "The setting is lovely; perched high on a cliff. The tour with audio, for languages other than German, was very informative about the castles 1000 year history. There is also an amazing falconry show included. A very entertaining and informative stop. The views from the castle",
          "The view from the top was amazing. We haven\u2019t had the chance to get in since we only have few hours left prior to our flight. The walk is too amazing but wouldn\u2019t recommend for people who had difficulty in walking.",
          "Loveliest sunset views of the city, and really interesting history. We rode the funicular up (kids loved how fast it was) and bought the ticket for the extra tour of the regency rooms. The information is presented in innovative displays both in person and on the Fortress",
          "This was my primary destination upon visiting Salzburg and it did not disappoint. I got the Salzburg City card, and that was worth free admission to Fortress Hohensalzburg, and worth it. I took the funicular up, and am glad. I'm sure the walk up is great, but also very steep.",
          "We decided we didn't want to spend the money on the funicular and glad we did the walk. It was VERY steep (need to work off the beer and food anyways) but we saw parts of the fortress we probably would have missed had we gone on the funicular. The views of the town were",

Also watch out some slippery paths inside the fortress, while doing the tour. The whole experience will take you back to the medieval era!",
          "The city is more beautiful seen from above.",
          "We toured this fortress on our own and it had beautiful views of the city. A little difficult to navigate but worth checking out. I was pregnant at the time and I was pretty exhausted from exploring on foot- took the funicular down to the ground-and it was worth it.",
          "A magnificent view over Salzburg. We had all inclusive tickets but I think that it is just enough to see part A with the tower which is a Salzburg panorama spot. Prepare yourself for numerous stairs, though they are not exhausting. The castle itself is easily reached by cable car.",
          "Been there twice and one of the best places to visit in Salzburg. The history of the fortress is fun to know. The tour is worth the price and the restaurants inside are nice place to eat and spend time. Would recommend anyone who is visiting Salzburg not to skip this",

You must remember to see everything before the closing time because the rooms are closed immediately.  The staff don't wait until you see everything.",

One side it covers scenic beauty of Alps mountains and other side it give you the panoramic view of the whole city and mountain river flowing through it.",
          "The basic ticket includes the funicular ride up and down, and then going up a tower, a museum about the fortress and the arsenal. To be honest, the arsenal and museum were quite normal, they did not have anything quite surprising or so. What was most spectacular were the views from the courtyard and from the top of the tower.",
          "Really enjoyed it even though we didn't do the audio tour.  Every piece had a written  explanation in english displayed beside it, in the museums and state rooms,  so we could go as fast or as slow as we could read. Beautiful views all around the fortress and the sunny day really added to the visit. Definitely worth the money.",

I loved some medieval chambers, my husband all the soldier and knight stuff. The view from there is amazing, even on a rainy and snowy day, as the day I went there.",

          "Beautiful to go...there are 2 entry fees one with guide but without guide is fine as well. Its beautiful fortress and takes about an hour to see...the hike is a little steep to get there but it's worth the view. Has a great view on the city...great view on the Saint Peter's church all along the way too",

          "Fantastic fortress on top of a hill. There's excellent views on the top and the museum and audio tour is short and sweet. Buy your tickets online to save time and money, and it includes a funicular (1-2 minutes only) up a steep hill. You \u2026",
          "I was amazed how such a big building was created on the hill top. So good architecture, proven with the centuries - it has been never conquered by enemy army. On the other hand it gave the chance to feel and see how the daily life look like \u2026",
          "Nice place, must to visit, better to buy all inclusive to visit all museums uphill, it is part of Austrian history. Nice materials - boards with fast history observations - animations are really nice thanks for that",
          "We took the cable car up as we were with older parents, the walk up does not look difficult. We did the group all inclusive pass and have to say being able to do the audio tour and see the state rooms was worth it. It was raining and a few snow flurries when we were up and there were plenty of places for people to rest and warm up.",
          "The history in this place was overwhelming. You can stand in a room with a nearly 2000 year old temple in it. The museum is really well done and a lot of the artifacts are fascinating. I thought it was a little heavy on the 1800's stuff, I \u2026",

          "Very cool castle on top of the hill above Salzburg. Well worth the short hike. The museum is really only worth it to see the viewing platform, everything else is just ok.",
          "An excellent and unmissable spot in Salzburg. Walk up (if you can) as it's a much better experience. I'd also recommend the all access ticket for 11 Euro. It's certainly worth it.",
          "Well maintained and easy to reach with the cable car. I would rate it higher but the lack of signs with information is really annoying (only info available is through audio tour).",
          "U can see gorgeous city view. I recommend it",
          "A required stop for any visitor. Lots of people in the line for the funicular. You can skip the ride (it's really really short as funiculars go) but be warned that the path up is very steep. Like how in hell do they deal with winter steep. \u2026",
          "Great place.  Good views all over\n Interesting exhibitions. History of Salzburg at the place",
          "A wonderful place to visit, and se all the history that it has to tell. Definitely a place worth going to.",
          "The size and architecture is incredible given the year it was built, steep incline to get to there but they do have a funicular you can purchase tickets for. You would do well to buy the Salzburg Pass as many things are included and you get \u2026",

The entry to the terrace is free but if you plan to visit the interiors of the castle, you may have to pay entry fees.",
          "Tram is quick and nice. Takes you up and down. Fairly inexpensive to be able to quickly tour the castle grounds. Prepare for weak knees. Short railings so hold on to your kids! It was a beautiful view. Well worth the trip up!",

          "Super impressive castle up in the Austrian Alps. Great views of all sides. Nice tour",

          "What a wonderful part of the world. The views are amazing and the cultural and historical significance is awesome",
          "Got stuck in the restricted driving area after google maps gave me bad driving directions into that area. I had to pay \u20ac100 fine to get out. This set up seems designed to ensnare unwary tourists. The castle wasn\u2019t worth the hassle.",

Who would have known that it would be so memorable.",

          "Suggest providing layout of fortress at the entrance, however, the fortess is very well intact, information is vast on each topic and spectacular panoramic view of Salzburg from the top. A definite must see. Put out half a day to truly appreciate the history of the fortress.",
          "Beautiful fortress, the lift up to the top was quite expensive (around 10 euro) and if you wanted to go right to the top you have to pay to visit the museum. Great views",
          "After a year of living in Salzburg, I've finally had an opportunity to visit the fortress while a friend was in town and my husband watched our baby. Walking through, the tour was very well done, with every room described in its history, and various items that were used displayed. Definitely worth a trip up!",

          "Amazing experience.  The ride up was fantastic. The views of Salzburg spectacular. The museum's gave such insight to the history of the fortress and the city. It is so well organised and runs perfectly. An assume day or as a family,  followed by the beautiful Christmas markets in St Peter's square.",
          "Very simple fort, nothing really complex. It wasn't a place that needed to be seen. Be careful of the restaurants within the fort.. specifically the one that overlooks the city. They bring out food, as in bread or pretzels, when you sit \u2026",

          "Absolutely gorgeous castle. Fun to walk around and amazing views of the city.",
          "Absolutely worth seeing. It is best to visit the fortress in the early morning. For a particularly rich experience a guided tour is recommended. But even the view of the old town and the surrounding area worth a visit.",
          "Wonderful place to visit. Set aside at least 3 hours to explore as much as you can. Before going up, when at the cable car at the bottom, be sure to purchase the all-inclusive ticket",
          "Loved the castle tower. Friendly and helpful staff. Mesmerising views of mountains and the city from the tower.",
          "A perfect way to see the whole of Salzburg. I would highly recommend getting the tram to the top and if fully accessible with a pram. Walking down is then a great way to see all of the old building",
          "Fantastic view.. there are sometimes long queues for entering the exhibits which aren\u2019t all that good! It\u2019s not possible to visit this place without a ticket (at least a basic ticket is needed to get inside)",
          "Had a great experience visiting Fortress Hohensalzburg, we bought tickets when we arrived and opted for the all inclusive package.  This was my favorite fortress that I visited during my two week stint in Europe.  Stopped at their biergarten to enjoy the views.  Very lovely.",
          "The funicular ride to the fortress was super fun, and you can't beat the view from the top. The museums are fascinating and the architecture is really cool. The best part is the marionette exhibit with marionettes from Sound of Music.",

          "Great place with lots of things to see.",
          "Tram was down. Had to climb up steep hills to get to top. Didnt see much even with audio tour. Just a nice view of the city. Going down realized there are steep steps going up/down. Not great signs.\nNot worth it.",

          "The fortress on top of the mountain that looms over Salzburg. It's accessed by a funicular railway (cost included in the Salzburg card) which is a really fun ride in its own right. There is a restaurant inside the fortress - unsurprisingly \u2026",
          "I wish we had more time to explore this. My wife and I stopped in the day we were leaving Salzburg so we didn't have much time. The view toward the mountains is incredible and worth the quick ride up the hill.  The fortress was cool inside \u2026",
          "Loved it. It's everything a medieval castle should be -- the ones you read about and see in films and TV series. Beautifully maintained. It's history starts in 180 AD and traces it's way to the middles ages.",
          "Fortress with interesting history and great view of city and surrounding mountains",
          "The view from inside of the castle fortress Was magnificent overlooking the beautiful clean city. They charged \u20ac12.99 as an entry fee per person inclusive of cable car also it's kind of a tram very safe and very fast takes around 1 minute to reach the top.",
          "a very interesting and beautiful castle with lots of information and a beautiful museum that tells the history of the castle and the surrounding area. The cable car gives an exceptional view over Salzburg and the area. It's pricey, but for enthusiasts really value for the money! Take at least a few hours for this visit.",
          "If you come to Salzburg you must visit this fortress. Unfortunately during my visit there was some construction but nonetheless the visit is worth it. You need to plan for a few hours if you want a complete visit. The view from the fortress \u2026",

          "Worth a visit!! The view is just spectacular",
          "Pretty impressive. Inside well sorted. Caf\u00e9s good. It is the exterior that actually nails it. Worth the trek upwards. Walking is easy enough but most get the funicular railway.",
          "Another great place to visit take the funicular to the top unless you like walking up we enjoyed the walk",
          "This place is probably great if you are into medieval history, but otherwise (as in my case) it's just a pleasant hallmark in Salzburg. Most people take the funicular up the hill, but I actually enjoyed the walk up and down a lot. You get to see beautiful views.",
          "The fortress is high up but pictures taken below are great. One will enjoy a panoramic view of Salzburg. What a pleasant sight in summer! It just causes me to think about the land of Shire in LOTR.",
          "Great historical location with lots to see for people of all ages. Children will likely enjoy the puppet museum. The main museum was good as well, and I recommend paying the extra for the all inclusive ticket. Section C is worth the extra view euros. The old royal rooms are some of the best in Europe.",
          "A very nice castle. It gives a birds eye view of entire city. Worth seeing.",
          "Take the walking path. It is very rewarding. Christmas market was wonderful at that time of the year, with very traditional music",
          "Good place to walk around and interesting museum.",
          "Kids love it; and the view over Salzburg is beautiful.",
          "Excellent place to visit and learn more about the city and the country! Fair price. You can go up walking or by tram (paid). There is a museum and gift shop inside.",
          "Love it, a wonderful view and some History at the same time!",
          "Some amazing views from the fortress walls, perfect way to start the day before it gets busy. And the walk up is great too",
          "Pretty view, the question for the ride down where over 30 min so we walked.",
          "Was a good place to come to on such a rainy day. But did need to use an umbrella to go from 1 building to another. Interesting castle.",
          "What an amazing place.  Great history, and the views!!!",
          "Great views. Make sure to buy the all inclusive tram ticket. \nLifts can be used to get back to the city at the Modern Art Museum. \nThe very top of the fortress had a bunch of flying ants and was very unpleasant.",
          "Great but the queue for the guided tour was so long, we waited for more than half an hour to get inside. It's a very well-preserved fortress unlike the one in Graz.",
          "Very well preserved castle with great views of Salzburg and the area.",
          "A decade old fort with lot of history and values. Well maintained and easy access through funicular. View from the top was amazing. Must do during your visit in Salzburg",
          "Beautiful setting and historic architecture accompanied by great food and beer.",
          "Fabulous funicular railway ride, spectacular views from a lovey cafe at the top of the castle. Many interesting items and relics to look at, audio tour.",
          "For any person who is interested in history, it is a wonderful and interesting place. But be careful- the walk up to the castle is steep and takes a good constitution!",
          "For about $20 USD we were provided transport up via the funicular and entry into the fortress and museums. There are several restaurants in the fort that provide a gorgeous view of the city below. Be prepared to walk a significant amount on uneven ground and stairs. Overall, it was thoroughly enjoyable!",
          "Worth it just for the view of this beautiful town. Didnt feel the need to go up in the observation tower as there was a bit of a line but otherwise everything else was pretty cool seeing some old historic stuff.",
          "Fantastic photo opportunities in the beautiful of locations. Will definitely be returning",
          "Great views of Salzburg and a great way to find out the history of the city! The view is unbeatable",
          "Majestic place! It is really worth it to go uphill and enjoy a visit and view that you will never forget! The entrance tickets cost 10\u20ac Basic and 12,5\u20ac all inclusive. The all inclusive allows you to get audio guides for free and visits to \u2026",
          "Wonderful views from the battlements and towers. Well worth paying a little extra to see the state apartments. The signposting for various entrances was seriously lacking and staff were curt and rather offhand. Apart from that I enjoyed my visit.",
          "Interesting visit and also nice view! There are also some events up there if you are there during Christmas.",
          "First of all, the funicular taking you to the castle was a nice addition to the whole experience. The castle offered some nice views over the city and the castle itself was interesting. On the other hand, unfortunately, the princes' \u2026",
          "Awesome historic castle, great tours!",
          "Worth the time and money. I got the basic tour and thought it was 13 euros well spent. Everything was in 3-4 languages and we'll thought out.",
          "Big place to see. There are museums, scenery, restaurants, and shops to explore. Walking up is good exercise, or take the tramp if health is not permissible. Gotta see such a huge medieval fortress of you are at Salzburg.",
          "My favourite fortress! This place is picturesque, as is most of Austria. Very well kept. \n\nI reccomend taking the \"M\u00f6nchsbergAufzug\" up(cost 2.5 euros 1 way) and taking in the view of the fortress, and enjoying the walk through the grounds \u2026",
          "The Funicular train pass (Basic) is definitely worth it. You get to see a lot of rooms and exhibitions. It's a big castle. Make your way to the top of the tower for amazing views. Wear comfortable walking shoes as there's a lot of walking and stairs.",
          "Not totally accessible with a wheel chair, loads of the mediaeval fortress IS. The exhibits are interesting, food good, views great. Bonus points for using Easy Language throughout. Inclusion can be this simple.",
          "Great place. The old city of salzburg   go there. The view is great. City view. And mountain view",
          "The castle is one of greatest attractions of Salzburg, it's a great place to visit. In addition, you can have the best view of the city and the land around it. I especially recommend to watch the sunset from there.",
          "We didn't get to go inside the fortress because it was closed but we went up the funicular to get to it and saw the view of the city which were beautiful",
          "This is one of the better Fortress', we have visited in europe. \nEntrance was 7.70 Euro for basic at time of review. This included an audio tour and entry into various museums within the fortress. Its one of the more maintained sites we have been too. \nId reccomend visiting. It was very enjoyable and great views of salzburh city.",
          "Great place to learn about the history of Salzburg. Fun fact, the Hohensalzburg fortress had never been taken by force. I would recommend to avoid the funicular, take the pedestrian path and climb all the way to the top. The view is much more regarding.",
          "Perfect place to visit! Excellent view of the town!",
          "Worth a visit, the views are amazing and the funicular train makes it easy to get to the top.",
          "Make sure you take the funicular up, otherwise you're in for a long, steep uphill walk! (Inside the fortress is also all uphill walks and stairs.) The fortress is massive, imposing, looming over Salzburg. Inside are some exhibits about the \u2026",
          "A 3 minute Funicular ride takes you to the fortress.You will have the nice panoramic view of the Salzburg city from here. Amazing scenes of snow capped alps on one side and the Salzburg city view on the other side.",
          "Great experience. Excellent audio tour, amazing views over the city. History museums of the fortress plus a marionette museum! So something for everyone.",
          "Easily accessible and very interesting exhibits. Loved learning more about the history, and the fortress does a great job of making you feel immersed in the tour. Definitely check out the restaurant while you're there!",
          "The best thing are the views of the city. Only a tiny bit of the whole fortress is open to the public. Furthermore, one of the four visitable spots (the arsenal) is under renovation. I'd recommend to go for the basic ticket, the all-inclusive one is not worth the money!",
          "Beautiful place to visit. Charming streets with tons of options for souvenirs or for having a lunch/dinner. Visit Mozart museum, have a ride in horse_cart or just chill out with a beer with a wonderful view of the city. Parking can be a challenge if arriving at pick hours.",
          "Love this place, perfect view from the tower.",
          "Very impressive, with info in German and English. Huge castle in remarkable condition.",
          "A worth visiting place in Salzburg and nice eateries after landing by funicular at the top of fortress.",
          "Amazing views from this fortress. A must if you come to Salzburg.",
          "One of the must-visit place in Salzburg. \nYou will need to spend approx 15 euro per pax to go to the top of the hill by train. But all paid off, the view was superb! \n\nEnjoy chilling in the middle of the fort with bean bag and a glass of cold colas.",
          "Hohensalzburg Fortress sits atop the Festungsberg, a small hill in the Austrian city of Salzburg. It is one of the largest medieval castles in Europe. Fortress Hohensalzburg is a real eye-catcher, high above the Baroque towers of the city. \u2026",
          "A funicular train ride of less than a minute takes you to the top. Views of the city are fabulous from these points. Restaurants are there to nourish yourself. One can spend around 2 hours and take wonderful pictures of the city.",
          "Definitely the highlight of this trip!!! The view of Alpes is just breathtaking!!! I could have stayed there for hours just enjoying the view and a couple of beers!!! Worth the ride up!!!!",
          "European best preserved \u201ccastle\u201d. Amazing view from the fortress, so much history.",
          "Buy your ticket early on their website, you get another discount if arriving before 10am. Audio guide was great and the tour provides awesome views of Salzburg",
          "Unfortunately the cable car was not working. Awesome scenario",
          "The fortress provides a great view of most Salzburg and you can get up to the top for free if you're willing to climb up the steep road, otherwise the funicular is the next best option which of course you have to pay for but it looks quite \u2026",
          "Needs more curation to really show itself off. Interesting things are left unexplained. A steep but very doable walk, so don't get sucked in to getting the funicular if you are able to tackle the walk, the road is longer but easier than the steps for going up.",
          "Beautifully presented. Easy to follow the history. My 10 year old grandson was thoroughly entertained for more than 2 hours",
          "Historical place! The view of Salzburg city from top is amazing!",
          "Best sunset in my life. There is also at least 2 restaurants and lift car from old city. Around all fortress is beautiful scenery.",
          "Nice fortresses. Nice tour with audio guide well worth it. Get the Salzburg card.",
          "The views across Salzburg were absolutely fabulous. The Fortress also has interesting exhibits and stories to tell so the entrance price, which includes the journey down by Funicular, is excellent value. I would definitely recommend.",
          "Very interesting. Liked walking around in the fortress more than the museum itself. Would recommend walking up rather than taking the cart. One suddenly understands how hard it must have been to take over this place in full body armor. \ud83d\ude05",
          "One time visitable place also add some knowledge to your history knowledge and must watch is Golden Hall.....also give a nice view of the Salzburg",
          "Amazing fortress which allows a glimpse into the history of Salzburg. The tickets for the tram up are valid for the rich historical museum. Additional Audioguide Tours can be attended with an all-in or additional ticket. The castle has sufficient infrastructure in restaurants.",
          "Great view of Salzburg. Great museums inside. Instead to climb over 300 steps go with funicular. Worth every cent!",
          "This place is something else. One goes up to the top of the turret tower and the views are 360 degrees of heaven. All the beauty of the fabled Swiss-Austrian hills and meadows in a neat capsule. On a clear and sunny day one can just sit \u2026",
          "Almost empty during 2020",
          "Such a great way to experience Salzburg. The Christmas markets here are unique.",
          "Absolute must see if you come to Salzburg. The museum and tour are interesting but not over loaded with detail, and then the views are the best in the city!",
          "Amazing view from there. A must see if you go to Salzburg. If you get the Salzburg card it is free and you don\u2019t have to wait up in the line which is very long so I highly recommend you to get it ! The panorama restaurant is also amazing. \u2026",
          "Beautiful fortress which came through a long history.",
          "Tip, find the tram car up to the castle! The hike can really suck. Once you make it up the views of the city are pretty awesome. The audio tour is pretty neat, we had to rush through it but I enjoyed it still. I would say that it is definitely worth a visit.",
          "Quite nice view, but minus for no information about payment half way up...",
          "An incredible piece of history, well preserved and with programs. The restaurant has a fantastic view!",
          "Nice Birds Eye view of the twin from the top. Some good museums inside. Funicular Ride was fun",
          "It's a castle fortress. We were there before 10 am and there was only a short wait. When we left at 11:30 there was a long line.  Cool string puppets. Great views looking down on Salzburg. The funicular was fun. Hot tip: going down, linger \u2026",
          "Nice castle. Offers the view of whole Salzburg.",
          "View is amazing .. especially Alps and the city view is breathtaking",
          "Worth visit for that breath taking view",
          "If you are a tourist in Salzburg, this is a must see destination. Rich history since it was built in 1077, ruled by 100s of archbishops. Can easily get to the top with lift service which also includes the museum tickets.\n\nIf that doesn't interest you, the view from up top is simply breath taking.",
          "its fantastic.  castle is near other abstractions. there are 3 main views, fortress, forest and the old city. spending an hour for lunch is good with views. and dom underneath is another wonderful church. And donation only,  no admission \u2026",
          "Wonderful history captured and preserved here.  Highly recommend getting the \"all inclusive\" pass with access to mobile app for info and comic scenes, museum, and ride down on the funicular!  Great panoramic views.",
          "This castle is worth a visit. For the 12.50 euro you get to ride the funicular up plus you get access to most of the castle and an audio tour, well worth it. We are two adults and we still enjoyed this place, not just for families.",
          "If in Salzburg - it's a must! Exceptionally well presented site, with very thoughtful displays and a couple of eating and drinking spots with breathtaking views. The cable car ride up is not really necessary, as it's not a very long walk up or down. Cabling up and walking down is also a good compromise. Easily spent 3-4 hours up there.",
          "in advance we booked the delicacy tour with Ms. Muhr. We have already done delicacies in other cities, but the tour with Ms. Muhr has surpassed all others. She told us a lot about Salzburg. We got delicious delicacies to try e.g. B. \u2026",
          "A must if youre in salzburg. one of the oldest castles/fortress in europe",
          "So amazing. You should challenge yourself by walking up. So cool to be up there.\ud83d\ude0e\u2764\ufe0f",
          "Loved the Audioguide tour of the tower, the views from the top were breathtaking. Also thought the Marionette museum was nice. I spent some time walking around but was ultimately confused. I had the Salzburg card so I could just skip the \u2026",
          "Take the walk up to the fortress and not only will you feel like you've made an achievement, you'll be rewarded with some of the most beautiful views of the local skyline.",
          "A good exercice climbing to the top with a cable car option for those who cant. The View at the peak is breath taking.",
          "Perched on top of a hill, the Salzburg Fortress is probably the highlight of the Salzburg attractions. It offers a beautiful view of surrounding Salzburg and gives a history to the place. You can access the place via the funicular and there \u2026",
          "It was a good visit and the views around are spectacular. Worth taking the cable car as the hike will get you sweating. When we were  here a lot of the best exhibits were being renovated so there actually wasn't too much to see. Still worth going though in my opinion.",
          "Got my \"Game of Thrones\" fix here! After visiting Mozart's place, with my longtime German friends.",
          "Take the early bird ticket to avoid the crowd. Amazing place!",
          "This castle is phenomenal. Inside and outside. Getting up to the top from one side, though, includes some scary unpaved ascents even within the walls. I mean historic is cool, but this approach is quite un-Austrian...",
          "A beautiful Fortress, offering not only the medieval history of Salzburg, but also amazing panoramic views of the city and surrounding mountains. Bought the tickets online, had little difficulty to recieve the online ticket it took \u2026",
          "There is so much to see here, and you can walk to the top for a great workout. Amazing views of the city from a couple different lookout platforms up there too.",
          "This place is amazing. One has to take the Bahn up the mountain to Fortress Hohensalzburg. The views when you are up there are amazing. One can see the mountain side and the city side from above and it's extremely beautiful. The entrance fee is very affordable.",
          "Great formidable fortress in Europe. Worth visiting and doing the tour guide. Also boasts GREAT views of the city. Go experience the fortress and enjoy being in Salzburg!",
          "My boys loved this fortress so much! It's been 2 months and they still bring it up.",
          "Quite informative and is being well maintained. The gondola ride up makes it easy to get to.",
          "Amazing! Great place to see neat sights and history",
          "Beautiful place to have a coffee and listen some musics",
          "Incredible views of the countryside with tons of history within it. Highly recommend the cafe on the south side for amazing views! Quick and not terribly expensive.",
          "Tasty Salzburger nockerl",
          "The view from the sight seeing balcony was more spectacular than the castle itself",
          "Fantastic Fortress - go to the top for the best views of Salzburg!",
          "Great views over Salzberg.  Castle more impressive outside than inside and the museum is minimal.  Worth a visit for 2 hours",
          "Lots to do. Give yourself enough time",
          "Learnt a lot of history about this country. Beautiful place with rich history.",
          "When visiting Salzburg, don't miss this place. In the greater scheme of things to see in Austria, it is definitely up there - mostly because of the history connected to it. The view of the city is breathtaking, and going there is made easy \u2026",
          "Not worth paying for the inside, luckily I had the Saltzburg pass. The state room didn't really add much to the experience. If you have the Saltzburg card, it's free only before 11am. I would say the only good thing about this fortress was the view. You get an amazing 360 degree view of Salzburg.",
          "The most beautiful castle I have been to. The view is phenomenal in all directions. You can wonder in the castle courts for hours without losing interest. There is a cable car that you can take up but it's no much nicer to walk up and explore the area.",
          "If you dont go to the Fortress why did you come to Salzburg. It is magnificent. Allow all day so you can enjoy a drink or two at both of the terrace bars/cafes. Views are really really wonderful.",
          "Huge fortress, amazing views from above. It's a good idea to get audio guide. And they shoot a cannon at 5 pm so be at the main square at this time!",
          "Very interesting historical story. Beautiful castle and  amazing landscapes. Must to go and visit.",
          "Nice castle to visit while you are at Neuschwanstein.",
          "Very nice castle, interesting history! the views from the castle is really good.",
          "It's a huge fort with multiple exhibitions about life in Salzburg under the prince archbishops, the armoury, state rooms, paintings, watch tower etc. Included in Salzburg card. Must visit. There's a train ride if you can't climb the steps \u2026",
          "Amazing views and great sightseeing tour. The staff were so lovely.",
          "This castle sits on a big rock above the city of salzburg. It is a wonderful place to visit with the family that has children. The views up on the cliff are amazing. There are amazing views of the city the river and the surrounding area if \u2026",
          "Interesting castle with detailed information in the form of audio exhibits. Weapons, uniforms, and artifacts are on display. There\u2019s even a tower that you can use your ticket for a superb, top of the hill viewing experience.",
          "Beautiful landscape and nice people",
          "Unbelievable. Just ensure you allow for a whole day to ensure you get enough time to explore this fully.",
          "Fortress Hohensalzburg is a beautiful fortress and a really must-do when one visits Salzburg. The views are amazing and try to plan your trip for a cloudy day which tends to draw away crowds and gives you more space for pictures. I also \u2026",
          "Must visit place in Salzburg, Austria. If you love knowing about ancient history you will really love this place, as it provides all the information about this wonderful city. The sceneric view of the city from the fort is breathtaking.",

          "Amazing views of the city and mountains, exhibits are excellent.",
          "It's beautiful. Stunning. The castle itself is a sight to behold and the views of the surrounding Alps and Salzburg are glorious. The restaurant in the castle is very disappointing however. I would recommend a picnic or going to one of the eateries in town instead.",
          "Lots of history and real artifacts in this never damaged fortress!  Good look at the opulent lifestyles of bishops and princes in 1670",
          "Good to visit, a bit of a walk though, step hill",
          "Lovely place with nice views. Although the insides were not as interesting as I imagined.",
          "Don't take the tram. Take the stair, well worth the effort.",
          "Beautiful, the views are spectacular.\n\nThe walk up can get steep in places but nothing to strenuous.\n\nThe toilets are very clean.\n\nThe museums and tours are done wonderfully, with fairly free access to the grounds.\n\nA must see in Salzburg.",
          "Back for the second time 20 years aprt. This time with kids. Salzburg is magical, especially around Christmas time",
          "Amazing view at dusk in january",
          "the castle is just great.  although we were in not very good weather and the cafe was not working yet.  excellent views are opened in both directions, the safety of the old walls is amazing, there are modern elements perfectly integrated into the ancient surroundings.",
          "Beautiful and big castle, interesting stuff to see but a bit expensive especially if you dont rly care about Cannons and armories. A bit Hard to go up there bcs of the tiring uphill.. Beautiful view you can see the whole  Salzburg from up \u2026",
          "Beautiful place. Full of history. The tour and the exhibits are so engrossing. There is a wealth of knowledge & history. The facility also has free Wifi.",
          "Nice place to walk around and watch the city from the clouds. Never go for dinner and concert here - disaster!",
          "Pretty views, informative",
          "Amazing how beautiful this piece of \u201eArt\u201c is and how old ! you need to see this in your life !",
          "The views from the fortress are great and it's not too difficult to walk up to the fortress as my 5 year old daughter managed to do it.",
          "Worth to pay a visit here....full of history and many attractions to visit as well.... very suitable for museum lovers.... with \"Salzburg Card\"..... you can using the cable car to go on top of the hill and the view from the fortress is \u2026",
          "Get the Salzburg card, it will get you into both of the Mozart museums, the tram up to the castle and most of the castle itself.  There are a few exhibits that you'll need to pay a couple of extra euros to see but the pass gets you into most things.  The Fortress is awesome and well worth it.",
          "For the cities main tourist attraction it's not the most entertaining experience. Rather expensive for what's on offer and I was dissapointed by the lack of information available. With so much wall space they have the opportunity to share \u2026",
          "Beautiful view of Salzburg and Salzsach river. Buying the Salzburg Card is a great option. You can get into the fortress, Mozart's birthplace, Untersberg trip and unlimited City transport in bus, omnibus and S ban, and more. Great cost/benefit.",
          "Site with an interesting history and great views of the city! Even though it was a cloudy day, we still got some good pictures. We went there early to beat the crowds - the first cable car leaves just after 9am but you can actually get on \u2026",
          "Wonderful fortress with amazing views of Salzburg!",
          "Absolutely enormous and still medieval inside. For \u20ac10 we spent over two hours touring and exploring this fortress. The views from the top are second to none. I love Neuschwanstein,  but this is a real castle and one you can walk much more freely.",
          "A great place to have a view of the entire city.",
          "Interesting enought and great views , but a bit expensive considering whats on offer, one short audio guided tour up to the roof and then a museum,  \n\nTip; Walk up the footway it is nether long nor strenuous (10 minutes max), and you are \u2026",
          "An absolute must  to visit the fortress n check out the beauty , technology n history so well kept together",
          "Fantastic!! Walk, take the cable car... It does not matter. This place is a great place to visit. Had thunderstorms roll in throughout the afternoon which made for the best photo opportunities and views of the Austrian Alps I could ever \u2026",

          "Outstanding place & I will definitely go back.",

          "Displays and views well worth the fee",
          "A beautiful castle to visit when you're in Saltzburg with interesting history.  From the tower you will get a spectacular view over the city.",

          "Great walk up to the fortress! Views from above are the best in town. Salzburg has a ton of charm and old world experience.",
          "I enjoyed the place very much. I could smell the history in the air. The castle smelled just like old castles are supposed to smell. Could live there :) . There was an interesting exhibition about war as a bonus. A minus for that they want extra cash for \u201ceverything\u201d.",

          "Complete with museum and full history. You should go (must take a train to the top) to get a view of the city, if nothing else. The sights are amazing on the outside and inside. It can cost \u20ac10-18 depending on how much you want to see or \u2026",

          "One of the exhibitions, \"the Arsenal\" is not avaliable. They don't tell you. In fact, they sell tickets and show maps with that exhibition. There should be at least a proper discount in the price of the tickets. :(",
          "Where you can see whole city of Salzburg, the Alps and those are breath-taking. \nThe fortress can be reached by a funnicular cable or walking. I recommend to take the cable because the road uphill to the fortess is very steep, although it is short. We were almost out-of-breath, but finally the view was so nice, worth it!",
          "Nice historic Place. to much tourist (sorry guys).",
          "The visit has amazing views of the city. The interior is also nice, although more impressive from the outside. Overall worth it.",

          "Epic sunset in every way, while sitting down for a nice Austrian dinner. Hard to ask for much more to wnd a lovely day and start a peaceful evening exploring Salzburg. Worth the trip ip the funicular, especially near sundown!",

          "The views are stunning from the Fortress! It may be a bit pricey to use the railway - may seem worth it for the quirk but even at half 9 in the morning the cabins were filled to capacity and we were all squeezed in. At the Fortress there is plenty to see and lots to learn about - would recommend a visit for sure.",
          "Loved the Fortress, great view from the top.  A must stop while visiting Salzburg!",
          "If you are going to Salzburg just for 3-4 hours stop this is the best place to visit, to get general overview about the city. Also my suggestion is to take audio guide. This will introduce you much better the great history of Salzburg. From the tower you will see not only the old town, but all the mountains and areas around the town.",
          "This is quite a spectacular fortress. What it lacks in beauty it gains in sheet awe.",
          "Good value for money with the basic ticket, excellent views and choice of food/beer outlets along with the exhibition's. Funicular can be pretty packed so try to get on when it arrives to avoid sniffing armpit.",
          "Best place to visit in Salzburg. There is no entry fees now to access this beautiful castle for sight seeing and a panaromic view of Salzburg and nearby places.",
          "Landmark in Salzburg. Short distance ride using the cable car is very enjoyable, the scenery was beautiful. Day trip to Salzburg may not sufficient to tour the site thoroughly unless you want to skip the old town and Mozart's musuem and Residence. You need at least 1 hour to check out the fortress.",
          "Beautiful experience, you can take a funicular all the way up. The fortress is amazing, with lots of things on exhibit and a few voice overs. It's the view that kills it. The whole of Salzburg and beyond. Be sure to catch a coffee or a beer at the cafes on top. Book online to avoid queues.",
          "Definitely worth the money, \u20ac11 tickets included The funicular to top of the hill, administration to the museum, and to the tower.\nCastle is beautifully preserved and the views of Salzburg are stunning.",

          "What to say about this stunning fortress overlooking the incredibly beautiful Salzburg... so much history, such an amazing view and so well kept artefacts wow... hats down Austrians! You could also have some food up there if you got the munchies like I do often and if you have kids crying like me when I'm hungry..",
          "Great place for a wander. Take the funicular railway up and down. There are many historic rooms to bistro, great views over Sakzberg and great cafes.",
          "Found this castle a little under whelming. The views are amazing From the top however the lack of information and directions was a bit disappointing. I realise we probably missed this as we stumbled around but a good map on reaching the top would have been really helpful.",
          "Best part of Salzburg! This is a must do. You can spend hours here. The funicular takes you up in under 60 seconds. Everything has been pretty much said about the Fortress so I won't repeat. But know you can buy an \"all inclusive\" ticket or \u2026",
          "Amazing views. Only 4 stars as some of it not open. Map could have been better.",
          "I recommend to buy Salzburg card.",

          "Worth visiting in any weather. Spectacular views of course. Make sure you see the state rooms which are magnificent. Buy your tickets online to save a couple of euro. Allow 2 to 4 hours depending on your enthusiasm for all of the sights. \u2026",
          "You can skip the line to the funicular with the Salzburg card. The place is crowded all the time, so make sure you go early to get a good photo spot. The museum inside was alright. The view is just breath taking.",
          "After visiting, please take care of your legs properly",
          "One of the Salzburg highest monument witnessing it's history over the top of the city. View from above is really beautiful with river view and mountains.

          "Incredible breathtaking views, interesting history and lovely restaurants/cafes - well worth the visit!",
          "Visited during the day and at night. \n\nRecommend the day if you can only pick one. At night most of the tour parts are closed but you can still access most vistas. At night however your plans for a nice picture of the town will be ruined by \u2026",

          "Very cool. It is beautiful. The guide was very knowledgeable and made it a great experience despites the very windy and cold weather. One of the highlights.",
          "It is amazing. It needs at least 4 hours and if you are not really interested in historical places do not go and just go direct to the mountain for better pictures. It is not a real cable car and it is not really a mountain. If you are \u2026",
          "Well maintained place and has few museums inside. Worth a visit. Plus you can see all of Salzburg from the top of the viewing tower",
          "Should feel of kings and queen life",
          "Definitely worth visiting, as one gets the chance to see the castle up close and in addition - enjoy the spectacular view of Salzburg. I'd suggest using the funicular (Festungsbahn), as climbing all the way up might be challenging.",

        "wiki": "Mirabell Palace (German: Schloss Mirabell) is a historic building in the city of Salzburg, Austria. The palace with its gardens is a listed cultural heritage monument and part of the Historic Centre of the City of Salzburg UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe palace was built about 1606 on the shore of the Salzach river north of the medieval city walls, at the behest of Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau. The Archbishop suffered from gout and had a stroke the year before; to evade the narrow streets of the city, he decided to erect a pleasure palace for him and his mistress Salome Alt. Allegedly built within six months according to Italian and French models, it was initially named Altenau Castle. \nWhen Raitenau was deposed and arrested at Hohensalzburg Castle in 1612, his successor Mark Sittich von Hohenems expelled Salome Alt and her family from the premises. Mark Sittich gave the palace its current name from Italian: mirabile, bella: \"amazing\", \"wonderful\". It was rebuilt in a lavish Baroque style from 1721 to 1727, according to plans designed by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. \nOn 1 June 1815 the later King Otto of Greece was born here, while his father, the Wittelsbach crown prince Ludwig I of Bavaria served as stadtholder in the former Electorate of Salzburg. The current Neoclassical appearance dates from about 1818, when the place was restored after a blaze. Archbishop Maximilian Joseph von Tarn\u00f3czy resided here from 1851 to 1863. The father of Hans Makart worked here as a chamberlain. Joachim Haspinger (1776-1858), Capuchin priest and a leader of the Tyrolean Rebellion, spent his last year in a small flat.\nThe palace was purchased by the City of Salzburg in 1866. After World War II it was temporarily used for the mayor's office and housed several departments of the municipal administration.\n\n\n== Marble Hall ==\n\nThe Marble Hall of Mirabell Palace is the venue of the \"Salzburg Palace Concerts\" (German: Salzburger Schlosskonzerte), directed by Luz Leskowitz. It is also a popular location for weddings.\nOn 3 June 1944 Gretl Braun, the sister of Eva Braun (later to marry Adolf Hitler), married SS-Gruppenf\u00fchrer Hermann Fegelein, who served as Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler's liaison officer on Hitler's staff. Their wedding took place at Mirabell Palace with Hitler, Himmler, and Martin Bormann as witnesses. Her sister Eva made all the wedding arrangements. \n\n\n== Gardens ==\n\nThe Mirabellgarten was laid out under Prince-Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun from 1687 according to plans designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. In its geometrically-arranged gardens are mythology-themed statues dating from 1730 and four groups of sculpture (Aeneas, Hercules, Paris and Pluto), created by Italian sculptor Ottavio Mosto from 1690. It is noted for its boxwood layouts, including a sylvan theater (Heckentheater) designed between 1704 and 1718. An orangery was added in 1725.\nThe gardens were made accessible to the public under Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Up to today, it is one of the most popular tourists' attraction in Salzburg. Several scenes from The Sound of Music were filmed here. Maria and the children sing 'Do-Re-Mi' while dancing around the horse fountain and using the steps as a musical scale.\n\n\n== External links ==\nSchloss Mirabell in salzburg.at\nSalzburg Tourist Office \u2013  salzburg city tourist board website.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Of course it would be best in springtime when everything is a bloom, but I have been there at three different times of the year and never disappointed. Whenever you go, take your time to enjoy all the details of this gem and don't judge it by its size. I especially like hanging",

          "We managed to see the concert hall in gold which was an amazing venue. However again the full gardens were closed and fountains off due to weather. The Mirabell was disappointing in the building now is more of an office complex than palace. There was nobody around to give info",
          "Probably not the best place to see during winter because most of it is closed of for winter. However you do get to see the filming locations were the Sound of Music was filmed Great experience",
          "It\u2019s worth a visit however, we visited during December (winter season) so were not allowed to enter in some parts of the garden. They close it every winter season to preserve it. You can still walk through the sides though.",
          "Visited Salzburg for NYE so experienced everything including the gardens in winter time when maybe not so colourful. Like everyone else searching out the scenes from Sound of Music. Look out for a crowd and there\u2019s sure to be a picture opportunity. Would be more colourful spring",

          "As palaces go, Mirabelle is fairly modest. We did not tour the inside chambers so in fairness, there may have been indoor attractions that would warrant a higher score. The gardens contained modest plantings of pansies that brought little color and the layout of the beds around",

          "During my free time on my tour from Vienna, I returned to spend more time in the gardens. It was a sunny July afternoon and it was very busy. The gardens were in full bloom. It was used in the production of the Sound of Music and that most likely is the foremost reason there",

          "As a huge fan of the Sound of Music, I looked forward to returning to the Mirabell Gardens. I visited once before, some 35 years ago. Honestly, I was a little disappointed with the level to which the gardens were maintained. There were weeds everywhere and many sections were",
          "Recreate your doh ray me memories at the gardens. They are open to the public for free day and night. The palace hosts nightly classical concerts which are pricey but very good. Maybe not ideal for non-classical music lovers Also hotel Bristol where Christophe Plummer stayed and",

          "On a dark and rainy Saturday in early September, one should be able to expect that the electric lights would be turned on. I was also disappointed to find that only a vaulted hallway, a roped off concert room, and staircase were open for viewing. The Mirabell Gardens were",

          "Lovely formal gardens and 1600s statues and palace. You can enter the palace and view the marble room located upstairs, free of charge. The fountain appeared apparently un ye film Sound Of Music. Be prepared for a lot of tourists though!",

          "We came here as part of a day tour from Munich. It was a shame that we only had time to visit the gardens. No entry fee for the gardens. Must not miss if you are a fan of \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d. It is quite popular so you have to be patient at the popular photo spots e.g. the",

          "Visited in July 2019 - lovely to walk around the gardens & visit the marble hall. evenings offered free recitals in the gardens.",
          "We didn't go inside the palace, but the gardens are very pretty and well maintained, with lovely views across the city from the palace end and of the palace from the city end! A nice place to wander, with some shaded parts at the side.",
          "I expected to be amazed by the gardens. place is pretty but not as wow as expected + bush needed trimming and flower beds weeding.",
          "So you know that scene from THE SOUND OF MUSIC where they race bikes through an incredibly pretty garden? Well, this is it. It\u2019s on the tourist trail, so if you miss it, you\u2019ve probably not been to Salzburg. Definitely one of the most photo-worthy places in all of Austria.",
          "I took a nice stroll here upon arriving in Salzburg. It was beautiful, calm, and reminded me of course of the sound of music (hehe). It was a stunning little garden to walk through and secret other gardens all around. Beautiful afternoon stroll here \ud83d\ude03",
          "We visited Mirabell Gardens with our 3 little kids. It is a nice place, not too big and you can spend approximately one hour (tops). There isn\u2019t much to do there...",
          "If you like the movie it\u2019s a must stop! We didn\u2019t like the movie but we took the photo ok anyway and it\u2019s a good social media talker. The garden is good not not overly impressive.",
          "Perhaps rather over hyped by its Sound of Music associations, the gardens are worth a brief visit but are no horticultural gem. Very busy when we visited, mid day.",
          "the mirabell palace and gardens are really the natural beauty of salzburg.To start with the palace is a well preserved and beautiful structure with many beautiful rooms and melodic motzart concerts played there.The gardens are a quaint and peaceful place where you can stroll",

          "We had a pleasant walk thru the well maintained gardens. Then we found that the castle was open in some areas to walk thru. Paintings, woodwork, everything was impressive and beautiful",
          "Very nice garden, however there it is just average compared to some of the other palaces or parks we visited in Europe. Also not very large. It is all about the movie experience to say \"I been there\" . The palace only has one room open an it is neat. Could do everything in",
          "but in Winter, there really was nothing to see. I'd have expected to see a little bit more in the way of garden. I think they're relying on the movie rather too much. Pretty disappointed really.",
          "It was free to drop into the palace but the gardens are the best. I stopped in frequently as I touristed around Salzburg for a bit of a respite, sitting and admiring the flowers or reading on a bench. The fountains were beautiful. A little busy but a must-see in the city. And",
          "We went to the Mirabell gardens whilst we were staying in Salzburg. This is a must for us each time we have stayed in the city...it's quite a short walk from the hotel where we were staying. People familiar with the film 'The Sound of Music ' will be familiar with the short",

          "This is my favorite place in Salzburg. A place that associates with the Salzburg the most- beautiful and romantic. Pleasant walk in the gardens on a hot day of July in this beautiful city.",
          "Having never seen The Sound of Music, I can't honestly say what bearing it has on Mirabell Palace or where the appeal comes from relating to the movie, but what I ccan confirm is that there is definitely appeal in the rather lovely gardens of this small but charming city centre",
          "Even if you have little knowledge or interest in the Sound of Music, the Mirabell gardens are charming. They are very well maintained and offer many great photo opportunities. We did notice while we were there the first time (around 1pm) that there were many tour groups and it",
          "The first thing my host told me when I arrived to Salzburg, was to go and see Mirabell garden (among other things). Crowded during daytime, so again if you get a chance go there early in the morning as I did. Didn`t go inside the palace on both occasions, but the garden was",
          "A very well maintained and picturesque garden Colourful flower beds, statues and fountains and plenty of benches to sit and rest and soak up the scenery. There is no charge for visiting the gardens and it is a must see in Salzburg",

The gardens were beautiful, the crowds were about what you\u2019d expect, and",
          "I haven't seen the Sound of Music movie in years. Coming to the Mirabell Gardens brought back memories in that, I really liked it when I was young. We just had to watch it when we came home. The stairs where the kids sing \"Do Re Me\" along with the famous Fountan are here, along",
          "Another great location to take various photos from the movie! Beautiful gardens and very close to shops/restaurants etc.",

          "It\u2019s a huge park and if the weather is good you\u2019ll enjoy it. Unfortunately for us, we were there during the worst heatwave in Europe and though the garden looked pretty enough, it was too hot a day to enjoy the view. I had read that there\u2019s a kid\u2019s playground at the park, but no",

          "Beautiful gardens easily walkable from old town. Gets very crowded during the day. Suggest early morning walk here before the crowds descend.",
          "Is a must thing that you should visit at Salzburg even not many flowers at the garden, compare with many people taking a picture with all the group.",
          "The gardens are well worth a visit for the peaceful oasis they provide in this bustling city. There are a lot of tourists, so it can be quite crowded. The gardens include a lovely rose garden (north of the palace) and an interesting dwarf garden (statues of dwarfs - about 15 of",
          "Just beautiful. It\u2019s on the way to everything, take a few minutes to walk through. It\u2019s not a big attraction, it\u2019s just a nice place.",

          "When I stood in this garden, it flashed my mind to the well-loved musical film, The Sound of Music\" which I had seen several times in my younger days. Though nothing that attractive as we expected, especially under the hot sun, we had quick photo shots around - the fountains,",
          "Billed as the scene of Sound Of Music and such, much of it was closed to visitors. So besides the Marble Hall which was nice but not fantastic, it was just ordinary. In fact all places billed as palaces were ordinary. The gardens in Melk Abbey were much better in comparison.",
          "Not as impressive as some other gardens we have seen, but has nice features. Several large statues. Nice fountain. The flowers arranged in arcs was a lovely display.",
          "Four of us had a return visit here and saw more this time around, despite it being very busy that day. A local Band were playing in the gardens which added a little more to the atmosphere.",

          "This is the garden where Maria and the Von-Trapp children sang Do-Re-Me. The flowers were beautiful and the roses were blooming too. I could also smell the scent of the roses. It was awesome! A very nice place to walk around and chill too. It is located in the city and it is",
          "I agree with others that these gardens are small compared to so many other European options, including of course a half dozen in Vienna. However, they are intimate and have a feeling of accessibility the others might not have. Our hotel happened to be on the far end of these",
          "The gardens are very strategically located. The story behind the renaming of the gardens is equally fascinating.",
          "The concert was lovely, lots of people gather in the park to hear the bands/performers. We did have hard time finding the place of the performance. No signs or indications of where it will take place. We arrived an hour early to walk around and explore the park and almost gave",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the evening concert at the beautiful Marble Hall in the Mirabell Palace. Perhaps the fact that an arch-bishop built this grand place for his mistress makes it even more appealing. We heard a fine concert of Mozart, Haydn, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. A high",
          "The garden were pretty, but I actually walked through it earlier that day without even realizing it... thus meaning it didn't make a big impression on me",

          "What I really like about Mirabell was its size. Having visited many European palaces and gardens, Mirabell is lavish and opulent, but not overwhelming. We really enjoyed sitting outside in the garden on an Austrian summer evening .",
          "Surprisingly small in size but perfectly presented, a must do is to take a stroll through the gardens. Popped into the palace but not much to see, hoping to return for a concert.",
          "The flowers, specially the roses were in full bloom. It is one place we will go back to visit again.",
          "Very lovely gardens right in middle of Salzburg. For SOM people, it is where the kids run through vine tunnel and do the doe ray me song on steps. But overall, it is just beautiful as a garden and FREE",

          "Mirabell Gardens are simply beautiful and the views of the castle and old town spires in the distance are amazing. you have beautiful flowers, landscaping, statues and splendid views wherever you look - and IT IS FREE. We came later in the day as the crowds were slimming down",

          "The gardens are NOT spectacular, but they are pretty, and some scenes from the Sound of Music were filmed there. River cruise tourists are as thick as locusts, and it is hard to move around. The Palace has bee restored, and the concert hall is worth seeing from the outside",

          "After looking at photos of these gardens online I envisioned they would be truly spectacular. On arrival I was very surprised by their small size, and how centrally located they were. I imagined them to be an entire complex on their own, maybe outside of the city altogether",
          "We were there for about 1 hour. Huge gardens, it's very nice. We were able to enter the castle. It's very impressive as you have various statues and paitings towords first and second floor. On the first floor (if I am not wrong), there is a room, even though it's private (for",

          "This was an afterthought upon completing a bus tour. So happy we did! The grounds are lovely and would be even better a little later in the spring so the flowers have had a chance to bloom. Many scenes from the Sound of Music were filmed in the palace and gardens a. This",
          "My wife and I were in Salzburg recently with a tour group. On our first visit to Mirabell Gardens, it was raining so we did not see it at its best. Even in the rain we could see the beauty of the Gardens. Thankfully, we did go back the next day to better appreciate all they had",

          "This is a great place to go if you are a Sound of Music fan and if that is not your interest then it is just a pretty place to go. Be prepared for it to be busy with a lot of tourists. The palace itself if pretty in the marble hall but was not as exciting (to me) as the gardens.",

          "Mirabell Palace is worth a quick visit and the gardens, especially the Sound of Music fountain, are worth a visit but my favorite part is the oldest Dwarf Garden (1695) is the world. The statues are all quirky and cool. Some of them have some great faces. I highly recommend",
          "We just spent around 30 min here. It was a labor day holiday and all offices in the Mirabell Palace were closed. We could see the concert hall though which was real good. It was buzzing with activity with a team getting ready for their concert in another hour. Garden is good bit",
          "A place that definately worth to visit. Nice gardens and impressive pallace centrally located in town",
          "Unfortunately we were there early spring and there wasn't much blooming other than pansies. The pop of purple and yellow color was nice but outside at least it was very underwhelming. I think when in full bloom, this place would be a must see but I think if you're there in",

          "The gardens are certainly worth a visit , however do not expect to be overwhelmed. I guess maybe coming from Australia I expected too much compared to our gardens. It is a nice tranquil place though",

          "We visited the Mirabell Palace Gardens during our brief visit to Saltzburg during the Easter week. The flowers were just starting to bloom, and it was absolutely beautiful. Even though there were a lot of people there, it did not feel as crowded mainly because the garden is so",

          "Garden is very beautiful and what\u2019s more entrance is free. Well maintained and good for children, only gripe is we cannot find a restroom. Another must see when you\u2019re in Salzburg, very near old town love bridge and city center",
          "The beautiful gardens surrounding the palace are worth a stroll The gardens are featured in the sound of music. We heard opera practice on the north end near the marionette theater. Best place to visit sough of the river.",

          "I could\u2019ve spent hours just relaxing in the Gardens. I visited over Easter weekend and had perfect weather - bright sun and 73 degrees. Beyond the relation to Sound of Music which is pretty neat, even more impressive is how immaculately maintained the gardens are. I highly",
          "We visited mid march on a rainy day and there were hardly any flowers in the large garden. As a result the garden area was not what is advertised. Most of the large building is taken up by municipal offices leaving only one room to view showing the grandeur of its former life",

          "There is not much to see at this palace. The exterior architecture is simple and not very impressive. Can be visited only The Marble Hall (which is really impressive) and where you get via a magnificent staircase. Also you can visit the castle garden and The Orangery , a not",
          "A must-see on the New Town area of Salzburg. Regardless if you are or are not a \"Sound Of Music\" fan, this garden offers a wonderful view of the Hohensalzburg Fortress in the backdrop when you enter through the entrance gate where Julie Andrews and VonTrapp children sang",

          "The gardens are beautiful, it can be a quick stroll through, we only spent about 15 minutes here. Our 10-year-old would have spent an hour playing on the nearby playground if we had let him. The play ground is just off the Mirabell grounds near Schwarzstrasse.",
          "I had a hotel room near here so I walked this garden often and loved it. Some, points in the park were in the movie Sound of Music, but you may want to take that tour for all info. I easily walked from here to the bridge over the river to old town. Put on your walking shoes.",
          "We visited in end of March which is not really the peak season, so the trees were still leaf less. But the gardens were in full bloom. Word of warning there are too many tourists so if you want a peaceful walk and pictures I recommend going earlier in the morning.",

          "We have been here once before and loved walking thru the lovely gardens. Parts are closed of in the winter but still worth a stroll. When the weather is nicer, go up the hill between the Sheraton and the Mirabell Palace to the part of the garden that computations the fabulous",

          "All fenced off and at this time of year not much to see. Wasn't impressed at all. Take a walk along the river to the iron footbridge instead as a beautiful shot of the city awaits.",

          "Yes I know the Austrians aren\u2019t that keen on the Sound of Music but it seems the rest of the world is with 350,000 visitors coming for that reason as a main one. However this is a beautiful venue whatever your reason and we attended a wonderful Mozart recital which was terrific.",
          "This SOM classic stage setting seems to be glorious once before but now its showing its age. Some parts are closed as its the maintenance season. Flowers around the garden were not in full bloom accounting the fact we arrived in late autumn. Lots of tour groups of different",
          "We came here because my daughters are SOM fans. We were not expecting a garden in full bloom of course but there were some colourful small flowers in the garden. Sadly not all of the parts of the garden were opened - some areas were chained up & out of bounds - areas that were",

          "Very pretty, but mostly closed during winter, and can be covered in snow, and therefore unable to see very much.",
          "Our tour group lucked out as it snowed the two days in Salzburg. We only went up to the marble staircase to one of the rooms. The big WOW was walking through the garden with a fresh coat of snow. Simply stunning and magical. We really lucked out.",
          "I only visited the gardens of the Mirabell Palace, but thought it to be lovely. If you are a fan of The Sound of Music, then get ready to spot numerous movie scenes within the gardens. You don\u2019t need long to have a nice stroll through the gardens, 20 minutes would do. Make it",
          "Very large garden with play area in the centre of Salzburg. Scene from the Sound of Music movie shot here. Flowers were in full blume making the walk through the gardens even more pleasant.",

          "Totally in awe at the size of this place and the magnificence of the gardens. Beautiful place to stroll and to spend the afternoon",
          "Very easily approachable as most of the buses stop here. We had the opportunity of visiting the Christmas market also. Backdrop of the fortress is fantastic and makes up for a good location to click photographs",
          "It was cold and snowy when I was there but even so you could tell this would be a nice, brightly colored garden at the right time of year.",
          "We called into, these majestic gardens steeped in history from The Sound of Music. Beautiful statues of unicorns line the grand stairs leading down to the gardens and the main building. The gardens even though we visited in Winter time were still lovely albeit cold. There were",

          "Mirabell Palace and Gardens was truly magical! Hopping down the steps, posing with unicorn statues, walking through beautiful flowers arranged in great patterns to get to fountains and a large tunnel with plants covering it! MUST-SEE if you are in Austria!",
          "Winter garden not much to view. Nothing in the palace for access. Just here to see the garden but quite a disappointment.",

          "It is a smaller garden before getting into old town. The areas areas marked off so you do not trample the flowers. The music university is near by. Also this is a central location for many tours.",
          "Stunning gardens. Such a beautiful place. Must see when you come to Salzburg. Lots of history and very central to town",
          "I went here with a tour guide on a day trip from Vienna, and as such did not have time to venture inside the palace. The grounds themselves were worth it though. The colorful flower arrangements and designs were very impressive, and even though the place was crowded, it still",
          "It is great fun to act out the Sound of Music and song on the step is the plaza. We loved the views of the castle, especially at night.",
          "Very pretty place to stroll, also a marvelous concert venue. Tickets can be ordered on line. Pay extra for the premium seats. You'll be seated in the front row which is definitely the best place for the concert hall as the seats are not elevated and the rest of the seats are",
          "Everyone goes here. The gardens are beautifully laid out but I could have done without the parties recreating the Sound of Music in a less than tuneful fashion! Not sure when you would browse in peace as it seemed as packed at night as during the day. The interior is worth",
          "The Mirabell Gardens are certainly not the largest, nor the most elaborate gardens you can see in Europe. However, if you are a fan of The Sound of Music, its hard to walk through the gardens, the trellises, and past the fountain without starting \"do, re, mi ....\" Darn, there it",
          "I must admit, I had a check list of places I wanted to see in Salzburg, where scenes from \"The Sound of Music\" were filmed. These gardens were used during the scene where Maria was teaching the children to sing, \"Do-Re-Me.\" It was beautiful and peaceful here. It's hard to",
          "These were such beautiful gardens and so tranquil. We took a Sunday stroll around them and it was very busy at 10:00 that morning. There was an old man playing the accordion and was great fun. The gardens are so clean and the statutes are amazing. Defo recommend a visit.",
          "Beautiful gardens to wander around and relax in. Roses were in full bloom which added to the ambiance. Lovely fountain in the centre of the gardens and benches where you can sit. To the right of gardens opp Palace there are quite unique statues very gnome like which were fun",
          "We were here on a gloomy November day. The park is well maintained and there are a few flowers, but here were way too many tourists and it's quite a small park, so we didn't enjoy it very much. I can see why lots of people like it in the spring and summer though.",

          "At the time of our visit, the gardens were past their floral splendour but nevertheless very nice to visit with plenty of benches to allow quiet contemplation. The Palace is a fine building open for free limited exploration and paid classical recitals. The highlight for me",

          "We were only in Vienna for 2 days so time was at a premium. This is the one thing we both said we could have skipped. The grounds were nice but the castle was just another castle and we have seen plenty over years of travel. On top of it, the day was extremely hot and there was",
          "We walked around these beautiful gardens. Some of the flowers were still in bloom, but inthe summer this place must be amazing with all the colour and fragrance. The weather was wonderful which helped, lots of places to sit and watch the world go by. Its free to go to and has",

          "Shame I tripadvisor groups these two completely together as I would have given the gardens 5 out of 5. They are beautiful and offer great photo opportunities! The palace though free is not worth looking around as you can\u2019t see much and the marble Hall gets closed every time a",
          "The gardens alone are a major attraction of this place, stretching across what must be a couple city blocks and full of fountains and statues and interesting plants and flowers. The palace is a fascinating look at life for the very wealthy in the early 1600s.",
          "Beautifully maintained grounds, there were a few scenes from the sound of music movie filmed on the grounds here. The gardens with a popular attraction but we didn't have a problem taking some nice pictures with a bit of patience.",
          "Came here because of my wife and her love for the Sound of Music, She had a great time talking about the different places from the movie. I thought it was a very nice garden and palace set-up, we just walked around the gardens and enjoyed the fountains. Even if you aren't a",
          "A beautiful garden. Flower displays,statutes,fountain etc. Go into palace well worth the visit. Park is the one used in the Sound of Music. Nice place to eat your lunch.",

          "For those old enough to have watched & loved the \"Sound of Music\" movie, this place is an experience not to be missed. It is a beautiful big garden with beautiful flowers & landscapes. And a nice palace to match. One can recollect the scenes \" Live\" of this show right here!",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Hellbrunn Palace (German: Schloss Hellbrunn) is an early Baroque villa of palatial size, near Morzg, a southern district of the city of Salzburg, Austria. It was built in 1613\u201319 by Markus Sittikus von Hohenems, Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, and named for the \"clear spring\" that supplied it. Hellbrunn was only meant for use as a day residence in summer, as the Archbishop usually returned to Salzburg in the evening; therefore, there is no bedroom in Hellbrunn.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe schloss is also famous for its jeux d'eau (watergames) in the grounds, which are a popular tourist attraction in the summer months. These games were conceived by Markus Sittikus, a man with a keen sense of humour, as a series of practical jokes to be performed on guests. Notable features include stone seats around a stone dining table through which a water conduit sprays water into the seat of the guests when the mechanism is activated, and hidden fountains that surprise and spray guests while they partake in the tour. Other features are a mechanical, water-operated and music-playing theatre built in 1750 including some 200 automata showing various professions at work, a grotto and a crown being pushed up and down by a jet of water, symbolising the rise and fall of power. At all of these games there is always a spot which is never wet: that was where the Archbishop stood or sat, to which there is no water conduit and which is today occupied by the tour guide.\n\nHellbrunn stands in a large park with a neighboring zoo, a stone theater and a small building known as the Monatschl\u00f6ssl, or the \"little month-palace\", as it was built during the period of one month after a visitor commented to Sittikus that a building on the hill would improve the view from one of the schloss' windows. The archbishop took heed of his advice, and when the visitor returned a month later the Monatschl\u00f6ssl was built.

          "We visited here back in January 2018 as part of our Sound of Music. Was given very interesting historical details of the Palace itself. We also saw where that famous scene in the movie was filmed...the one within the gazebo during while it was raining!",
          "Lovely place; the fountain tour was good and fun. The Sound of Music gazebo is in the gardens too. We didn\u2019t get chance to go inside the palace, but a relaxing place to spend a couple of hours in the gardens.",
          "Unfortunately the day we went the Schoss wasn't open (doesn't open until end of March. It is about a 20 minute bus ride out of salzburg on the number 25 bus. We walked around the gardens, saw the Gazebo there which was used as a setting for the Sound Of Music.",
          "The location of the Gazebo \" you 26 are going on 17\" atmospheric house with great history well described by Peter our guide from panorama tours",
          "Visited in February but was too early as the open season is not until March however walked around the grounds and it was very nice and took many photos. And if your a fan of the Sound of music film you will see the road Maria went down when she got off the bus making her way to",
          "The Schloss and gardens are gorgeous! I did a tour inside the Schloss a few years ago and it was quite nice, but the real gem of this place is the Christmas market. It's so beautiful and unique! Even if you just come for a wander round at night, it's so magical. Sound of Music",
          "An absolutely fun and beautiful Christmas market and fair--really can't say enough about the scope and size of it all. We took a taxi there and had no problems getting one back to city center. An enjoyable adventure with very few tourists present.",
          "Good place to go to relax and have a walk round the gardens Quiet due to time of the year but a very nice area",
          "Was on a hop on/off bus tour and stopped here. The palace was not open but the christmas markets more than made up for that disappointment. Really beautiful marketws away from the city area. Quite a number of different displays.",
          "We walked from Gabler Br\u00e4u, a restaurant in Old City Salzburg, to the Hellbrunner Adventzauber and back. That's 5.2 km one way. It was cold and raining, and we really didn't think much about making that walk, since we tend to walk a ton on our vacations. But still. It was 5.2",
          "we came hear to see this place as we were told that at Christmas they put on a market and we said next Christmas we will come hear and see for ourselves but today we had a very nice time visit at Schloss Hellbrunn and it was a delight worth the visit",
          "We went to the Christmas market here - was very nice - one of our favourites. There are unique things here that we didn't see anywhere else - so if you love it, buy it!!",
          "We went to see the grounds and the palace. However we did not read the info right and only gardens open. The walks were great but certainly a summer visit not winter",
          "We visited there when the Christmas Market was on going, so there were additional things to see and do. We really enjoyed the afternoon, but to be fair, I am sure we didn't see nearly as much as we might have when the market wasn't there. It IS a lovely property.",
          "Try to get there BEFORE the market opens in the morning, and see the place by yourself. Then go back when the market is in full swing and enjoy the atmosphere and all the goodies the stall holders offer. The Advent Calendar house is like a big Xmas card, gorgeous!",
          "The gardens are very pretty and pleasant. You can talk a walk up the mountainside for a great view of the city. They also had the gazebo used from the movie sound of music on the scene of I am sixteen going on seventeen located in the garden",
          "We were recommended the Christmas market at Hellbrunn. We took a bus from the town centre and actually missed the stop for Hellbrunn, sailed on past the zoo, then got off and we were happy to walk through the lovely scenery on the path past the zoo to Hellbrunn, which helped to",
          "Ideal markets for young and adult. Animals, dwarves, devils, good food and punch. Great patisserie.Large parking. Do not walk on the weekend!",
          "Go on treat yourself - Buy a 24 hour bus pass for 4 euro and take a 25 bus at about 13.45 - the market doesn't open weekdays until 14.00 and its free to get in - at weekends they charge....it is a wonderful place for a winter market, busy but with out the crowds (when we",
          "Bus 25 from Salzburg. Hellbrunn at Advent is magical, the trees are lit up and the whole gardens are decorated. The Christmas market has a huge range of handicrafts and food and drink. Amazing.",
          "The castle is not open during the winter period, but they do have in replacement an absolutely gorgeous Christmas market. Located outside of the heart of Salzburg, you need to take the public bus 25 for about 30 minutes to reach here, the Hellbrunn Christmas market is probably",
          "When we went there, there was a Weinachtsmarkt. The E5 entry got you access to the market, garden, a free Gluhwein and entry to the Salzburg zoo. If a Gluhwein is E3.70 that means that the zoo was just E1.30. Incredible value. It was also a more interesting market than the one",
          "Hellbrunn Palace is an early Baroque villa of palatial size, near Morzg, a southern district of the city of Salzburg, Austria.",
          "We took bus #25 from Old Town & the Palace was a short walk down a steep hill. The Palace itself was filled with all the weird & wonderful things for a day of fun in 1620. The gardens are interesting.",
          "Although the castle is not open to visitors, the Christmas markets and surroundings are beautiful. Make sure you go when it\u2019s dark in order to maximise your visit because the whole place lights up and becomes a magical experience. There is a small \u2018petting\u2019 zoo and railway rides",
          "Beautiful gardens and grounds around the main house. The fountains were off as seasonal but the main lake had a lovely Christmas angel there We spent three hours here , they also had a children\u2019s petting area for the Christmas market. Free entry except the weekends, so great",
          "Schloss Hellbrunn is located about 20 minutes outside central Salzburg. The castle and gardens are very beautiful and interesting. The water features in the garden are fun to see, but be aware you may get wet! The house is more like a museum than a decorated mansion, but still",
          "A short bus ride from the old town. Really good place to visit over the festive season. Nice market, excellent farmyard presentation, very child friendly. Probably best to visit in late afternoon / early evening to see the lights and \u2018hell\u2019 show.",
          "What a beautiful place. So many interesting and whimsical trick fountains. statues and buildings to see and the garden was in full bloom mid September when we were there. We were there in the morning and found it was not very crowded,",
          "The palace was built around 1613 by the Prince Archbishop (although, he was only in power 7 years). Whimsical, humorous fountains are only accessible by tours (which move along at a nice pace). The palace, itself, is extremely interesting and is well explained on the audio",
          "The Schlosspark Hellbrun was my happy place during our Sound of Music Tour! The garden was a-bloom with the most incredible flowers and the lovely gazebo where the Sixteen Going on Seventeen scene was filmed brought back romantic reminiscences of that decades-ago blockbuster",
          "This park year round is my absolute favorite! Since I moved to Salzburg this place has been a dream. It has it all for our family - a wonderful playground, dog park, beautiful walking paths all around the property, the zoo is next door and the christmas market is spectacular! I",
          "Actually we stopped only for a short pause and we didnt visit the palace, but only the gardens and nearby place. All is very nice and I am sure the palace is also.",
          "Nice garden with fountain, built over 400 years ago. All tricked, be careful to get wet during the tour.",

          "We took the water tour. Quite an experience. We saw nothing like this before. How everything works beautifully with natural water and pressure. Strongly reccomend.",
          "Families with kids will love this. It has interesting features such as interactive water fountain. Travelers who prefer more peace can rest in its nearby garden for free. Lots of residents leisure there as well. Sound of Music pavilion is also displayed nicely on the garden for",
          "A great place for kids. Take the time, although a bit pricey you won\u2019t want to miss this place. \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05dc\u05db\u05dc \u05d5\u05d2\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd",
          "What a wonderful attraction with beautiful gardens and palace. The trick fountains tour we had with Maria was a lot of fun and most people got wet. Markus the arch bishop sure knew how to entertain. Maria warned us at the beginning of the tour to keep cameras close by as they",
          "We visited as part of the Sound of Music Tour. Huge Garden in side and the entrance is massive. Even today these remind the old era.",
          "You don\u2019t realize how big is the place till you start wandering around the maze or the gardens. one actually needs to spend more than 3-4hours here to completely see its beauty. we did the grand tour inside the palace and it was very good and relatively quick",
          "If you take the yellow line for the Hop on and off Bus - it pretty much drops you off where the water feature is and not far from the ticket office. Cost for the tickets into the Schloss and water feature / fountains are in total E12.50. I suggest to do the water feature first",
          "Amazing palace! Very unique, I have never seen anything similar! Entry with the Salzburg Pass. It was a rainy day, but everyone seemed to enjoy the experience, including myself! Whoever was behind the design, just great art!",
          "So much fun! The palace itself was a bit confusing but anyway you go, whichever rooms, it's fascinating. We did the trick fountain tour first then the palace, which worked out well. The trick fountains were one of my favorite parts of the whole trip - so fun!! The palace had a",
          "We arrived at the palace around 1:30 pm by bus 25. There was no line to buy tickets. We had 15 minutes before our tour started so we went through the palace using the audio guides. Our tour guide for the fountains was very good. Amazing to think they were built 400 years ago and",
          "Went there just after college. Amazing display of the ingenuity of using water pressure and a sense of humor. Fascinating place. Don't miss",
          "Enjoy the trick fountains and the tour of the house. My only complaint was that I signed up for an english tour - it was rainy - so they combined a German and English group which meant we had to stand in the rain for a ridiculous amount of time while everything was explained in",
          "Apart from the trick fountains, which are fun, if a little damp (!), there's plenty to see: the schloss itself, the beautiful grounds and the walk up to the viewpoint plus the folklore museum. Easy to spend at least half a day",
          "The beautiful grounds and palace were lovely, but we were astounded by the trick fountains and details of the statues and mechanical theater powered by water.",
          "Great stop and highly recommended for your Salzburg stay. Take the tricky fountains tour, very entertaining, but be prepared for unexpected events to happen during the tour, all in fun. If asked, only sit at the head of the table with your back to the group. Amazing what a",
          "We used the Salzburg Card to visit Schloss Hellbrunn and the ticket office gave us a time for the trick fountain tour which we enjoyed. The exterior of the palace is lovely as well as the grounds. We skimmed through the interior of the palace and walked to see the Sound of",
          "This is a wonderful place to viist. Great art work, tour and entertaining tour staff. Loved the paintings. Nice funny fountains through out the court yards.",
          "Not much to see here. Compared to all else a foreigner will see in Europe, this is one Schloss to skip. The \u201ctrick fountain\u201d tour, on the other hand is worth a visit. What fun!",
          "I loved this palace, the trick water gardens are a must with a few added surprises as you walk around. The Pavillion from The Sound of Music is located here and is lovely to see for anyone who loves the film. Overall, a lovely place to visit.",
          "This is a beautiful Baroque villa of palatial size was built in 1613\u201319. Originla features included stone seats and table with water seat sprays and hidden fountains throughout.",
          "We took a city bus out to see this palace and were very glad we did. It's a wonderful experience and not far from the city. If you have children in your party it's a must. The grounds are beautiful. the building unique and the fountain surprises unmatched.",
          "Sound of Music must see, the gazebo is here now permanently. Great photo opportunities. Nice toilets as well! Especially the one for little children and the little wash hand basin - cute idea.",
          "Schloss Hellbrunn is situated in a rural setting about a mile from the old town of Salzburg. On the property, you will find the original gazebo used to film the song \u201csixteen going on seventeen \u201c from the Sound of Music. The castle itself is also worth touring. An audio guide",
          "The trick fountains are the real feature here. The guides do their best to ensure that everybody gets a wetting.. grand on a hot sunny day but not so great on a cold damp day ! The gardens are beautiful and well maintained. Funnily enough, the item that many come to see...the",
          "An interesting place with all sorts of things to do - museums, water and normal gardens, expandes of lawn intercepted by paths to stroll, play or just relax.",
          "Lovely to walk around. I was not too interested inside the palace but I did the tour around the trick fountains and was not disappointed. They are so hidden even if you try to see them in advance you won\u2019t. Tour only takes about 30 mins and the time flies by. I will warn that",
          "The Trick Fountains are worth a visit on their own. The grounds are gorgeous and we enjoyed a leisurely stroll in the sun. The gazebo from the Sound of Music is also within the grounds and worth a look, if you are a fan - it's a must!!! Easy to reach on the No 25 bus which also",
          "This palace is a bit removed from the city center, but still very easy to get to. The Sound of Music tour bus stops here and there is also a city bus option, but I actually just walked. It's about 3.5km from the city center, but a mostly flat walk on a very peaceful",
          "We took Bus Number 27 from the Hauptbahnof/Main Rail Station at Salzburg to reach the palace. It is slightly away from the main city center and old town. But we loved our visit to the Palace. It was beautiful and different as it was built with lush green English style gardens.",
          "A short bus ride away from the City centre, walking around the Gardens is free (other parts are paid for). The gardens are pleasant, being a mix of the Italian Baroque and English Garden styles, there are aldo some places to eat. You can talk a walk up the mountain side for a",
          "Since the gazebo that was used in the movie \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d is now located at Schloss Hellbrunn, we made a short stop here to see it. Unfortunately there was no time to explore the actual castle and grounds which I would have found to me more interesting.",
          "The trick fountains are truly unique and delightful! Wonderful tour! We also enjoyed the Palace exhibit and the gardens. And we event went to the Zoo (separate review). Of course, it helps to visit the trick fountains on a warm, sunny day, and to be ready for a little water",
          "We stopped here during our tour of \"Sound of Music\". Unfortunately we were given only 20 minutes to see this beautiful spot. Everybody in the group was busy clicking pictures in front of a gazebo where the some scenes of the film were shot. There was no time at all to see the",
          "I really cant explain how wonderful is the palace. Tricks are in every were and you differently will be wet. Inside the palace there are some statues and painting owned by the king. To add more, a garden is nearby the palace if you would go for a walk",
          "I had heard about this from my daughter who saw it but the trick fountains were not running when she was there. I had a hard time finding anyone to offer a tour from Salzburg so we took a cab from Salzburg and bought the tickets on site. (There is also a bus that goes there)",
          "It\u2019s an okay place with a palace and some gardens, and a gazebo used in the Sound of Music movie. Not a big deal at all.",
          "Palace set in huge, beautiful gardens and water features, the gardens themselves being free to enter and are worth a visit on their own. You can get round the palace itself in about 30-40 minutes with audio guide. It is truly beautiful inside, and has some top-class",
          "The stroll through the gardens alone is worth the trip. It's mostly quiet and not crowded, except at the gazebo from the Sound of Music where everyone was taking pictures. I highly recommend a visit to Hellbrunn, if you're in Salzburg.",
          "was a bit confused if this was part of the sounds of music locale. but either way, loved it. Salzburg and all its sounds of Music has been on my wish list since my childhood. did not take any guide, but walked thru the whole city and i started from here.",
          "Entrance fee included an informative self guided tour, and a fun guided tour of the water fountains, which were cutting edge when they were built.",
          "Visiting many fortress and palaces, I highly recommend the trick fountain in Schloss Hellbrunn. We laughed a lot though we get wet a bit and always got surprised. The technology and design in the fountain is amazing. We believe the owner should have strong sense of humor and his",
          "This place was in my list but it wasn\u2019t crucial....so glad I ended up going! It was beautiful! Lots of cool water tricks / fountains, the ground were stunning! The inside upstairs in the main house was eh, but everything else was gorgeous!",
          "Amazing to think it was mostly all built about 400 years ago. It was fascinating and lots of fun for the kids. The schloss was interesting too. Didn't have time to visit the folklore museum unfortunately. Of course the gazebo from the Sound of Music is a must see there too.",
          "This was a fairly average palace to go see considering everything else Salzburg has to offer, but the allure was to see the trick fountains. Being fairly well travelled, we were expecting something along the lines of the Bellagio in Vegas, but got the equivalent of teenagers",
          "We did the Wasserspiele tour, and it was amazing! So many hidden fountains and deceptive water tricks. We thought we were going to get off lightly but by the end we got soaked through. It was so fun and even though my friend had been before, she still got caught out a couple of",
          "This is definitely worth a visit. The 'surprise' sprinklers on a hot day are a delight. There's also a huge play park for kids and The Sound of Music's pavilion.",
          "def worth visiting. for us was part of a tour which said they'd take us there but they didn't. go on the bus or by bike.",
          "You will have to take the city bus here (be sure to get off at the correct stop) if you don't have a car. My wife and I simply came to enjoy the gardens on a cool, sunny day. They are beautiful.",
          "One of the few tourist attractions in Salzburg that actually entails using public transport to leave the city centre, Hellbrunn Palace is a short bus journey from the main train station, and was my last stop in my short visit to the Austrian city. The bus journey lasted about",
          "We enjoyed coming here to see the pagoda from the Sound of Music. It seemed to be free to visit the gardens which is lovely. The pagoda is hidden away a bit but it was fun to see it. Good parking. Looked like there was more to do if we had had more time. It is worth noting",
          "We spent the day here and had a great time. We started with a walk through the stunning palace and then got wet in the trick fountains, followed by the folklore museum and finish of at the zoo. Everyone had great time, filled with lots of laughter.",
          "This \"Summer Palace\" is a fun place to visit. The star attraction is the trick fountains and the energetic tour guide will keep you on your toes.",
          "We did not visit the inner palace, we only took the trick fountain tour. Our guide was enthusiastic and friendly, and made the tour a very pleasant experience. You will learn about a historical outdoor area made to surprise guests, with water that could spurt from anywhere at",
          "Yes these are touristy. Yes there are a lot of kids there. Yes it is sort of corny, but it is really fun to see. These were made hundreds of years ago and are still quite clever today. It's a fun way to spend a hot afternoon, while getting out of the crowded tourist old town.",
          "S was our favourite Salzburg attraction. The Schloss is very interesting to visit but the star is the trick fountains. The grounds are extensive and nice for a picnic and the cultural museum on the hi,l has some interesting displays. It was easy to take the bus to Hellbrunn.",
          "We took the bus 25 and went to Schloss Hellbrunn with Salzburg card, free entry. Please also exchange the ticket for the trick fountain tour, the tour is fun but you surely will get wet. The tour guide speaks German and English.",
          "I was there for an official dinner. This old castle is a nice place to stroll and take in the tranquility and peace.",
          "The park of this castle is very nice. Unfortunately the weather was not very good the time we were at Salzburg. Of course the park suffered of this and culd not be seen with its complete beauty. It is anyway worth a visit. pore",
          "We loved this place. We drove on the Austrian leg of our trip and parked on the premises very easily. The approach was beautiful and entering the courtyard was a step back in time. I was the only one in our group (2 moms and 2 older teen girls) who knew about the trick fountains",
          "Very interesting and lively tour to the Trick Fountains and then wander around the lakes etc. Re the catering - another matter. The Park Cafe was ideal for an ice/snack. The other (main?) restaurant, stay clear - my rating would be a 'Poor' for this. We were there on Thursday",
          "We visited here on a very hot day so the tour we took of the trick fountains fitted the day! We didn\u2019t mind getting wet from the water jets it was good to cool off a little. We found the palace visit a bit unnecessary and could be missed",
          "We really enjoyed our visit here. Easy to get to on the #25 bus from town, and free admission if you get the Salzburg Card. The palace is interesting to walk around in, and the tour of the fountains and water tricks is really fun! Be prepared to get slightly wet... and if it\u2019s a",
          "I took the 2pm excursion from Salzburg by boat, connecting to bus, including the water fountain tour. I actually enjoyed the water fountains it was fun and being a hot day happy to get pranked with water. It is really clever when you think of the age attached and the guided tour",
          "We definitely enjoyed our visit to Schloss Hellbrunn but in our opinion it was not a must see. It was fun, interesting and worth our time but something we would skip if time were tight. The palace is interesting but not over the top, the trick fountains were cool and the",
          "Palace and grounds are so beautiful, we came here because we wanted to view the famous gazebo. We skipped out on the trick fountains.",
          "Interesting History of the palace. The Gazebo from Sound Of Music is located on the grounds. Clean restrooms and a quaint gift shop.",
          "I visited Schloss Hellbrunn predominantly because I was tracking down Sound of Music locations, and the pavilion used in the '16 going on 17' song is located here. I used my Salzburg card to get free entrance, and at that point you are assigned to a timed tour of the trick",
          "The palace itself is beautiful but nothing extraordinary. What makes it unique are the many trick fountains in the gardens. Everything is hydraulically powered including a mechanical theatre. There are many other trick fountains and grottos which spout water when you least",
          "I spent just over 3 hours at this delightful place and thoroughly enjoyed it. It helped that it was a beautiful sunny day, making it possible to walk around the large expanse of lush, peaceful gardens and the castle grounds. The trick water garden was so special to see and made",
          "The Schloss itself was interesting to tour around, with a particularly amusing animated cartoon story telling of the carnival in the 17th and 18th centuries. They put the room numbers in a random order so following the audio tour arouns we weren't quite sure we had seen them",
          "Bought a 48hr Salzburg card which entitled us to enter the palace and trick fountains. No charge to visit the grounds. We were told that we had to be guided through the trick fountains before we were allowed to enter the palace and gardens - which was totally wrong. The ancient",
          "The trick fountains, the moving figurines, the grottos and other parts operated only by water power were really quite impressive. Our guide had fun with the trick fountains and there were many good laughs. A shout-out to Douglas at the front desk from New York, who made a",
          "This former palace is a gorgeous park, with nature, beautiful plantings, and lots of walking trails. Fantastic souvenir shop!",
          "The exposition in the palace in short but pretty interesting, and the animation is a masterpiece and you learn meanwhile get entretained. The Fountains are wonderful, the owner had a very good sense of humor. The people of the place is very kind and makes your visitan excelent",
          "The trick water fountains at Schloss Hellbrunn are spectacular. The museum in the main building and the folk museum are also great plus you can see the regular gardens, the gazebo from The Sound of Music, and Hellbrunn Allee - the tunnel of trees from The Sound of Music. Walk",
          "Highly recommend the short bus ride to Hellbrunn. The gardens are enjoyable and beautiful to visit and it\u2019s worth while to hike the short trip up the hill for the stunning views. The trick fountains really are a must and are the highlight of the visit.",
          "Trick fountains were alot of fun. The guide did the tour in both German and English. He had alot of fun with an unsuspecting group",
          "The castle by itself is not much interesting but the gardens one must see. The tricky fountains and dancing figures were very interesting.",
          "The trick fountains were interesting; it was good to get a glimpse of house the fountains were envisioned and built centuries ago. The tour was informative, and entertaining. I felt the tour was a little overpriced, though.",
          "Really interesting place, with nice gardens. There were two eateries the one we went to was good, and the other looked pretty reasonable. Beware the trick fountains!",
          "Highlights for me is the tricky fountain which my kids really enjoy, ticket cost can be bought as a package which include museum tour which is very informative and staff are gentle and kid friendly. For me this is the main attraction of Salzburg, there\u2019s also a park adjacent",
          "Schloss Hellbrunn is a \"not to be missed\" attraction in Salzburg. The buildings and gardens are magnificent and was fortunate to have a great guide to explain everything to me.",
          "The gardens, the buildings, the little hidden secrets, these are the things that make Salzburg such an irresistible destination. Add food to die for and friendly people and there is not much this chalming city doesn't have to offer the tourist",

          "Traveling to Europe for the first time, this stop at the most intact castle was definitely a win! We took the tram up the huge hill and it was super easy even with a baby stroller. The castle was gorgeous was what a view! Best pictures of Strazburg.",
          "This was very different castle experience and tour, really enjoyed it! Been to many castles and the trick fountains are very cool and still operating after so many years. Go see the Sound of Music pavilion on the grounds (I'm a big SOM fan!)",
          "You can go inside the castle which doesnt have a lot open to see. Then we took the guided tour of the fountains.The guides really get a kick out of this, because they are the ones controlling the fountains. You will get wet, not terribly though, and it was a warm day so we dried",
          "We stopped here quickly while on the Sound of Music tour to see the Sixteen Going on Seventeen pavilion. It was locked up so we could only take pictures from the outside so that was a little disappointing. But the gardens/park looked beautiful. Too bad we didn't have time to",
          "We visited here in a beautiful sunny day. The castle was very interesting and the audio guide was essential but it comes with the ticket. Tip: the ticket for the trick fountain gives you entry to the castle also although it only mentions the fountains. Some of the exhibits were",
          "While the grounds and park are open to the public it\u2019s worth it to go through the water park (at a price). The guided tour is interesting in that you learn the amazing things that the engineers of that day could do with water and water pressure. There are numerous surprises;",
          "Most people will rightly enjoy the water garden with its tricks there is a good museum to visit which is well laid out and intersting about the innovator.",
          "Hellbrun is well worth visiting, the trick fountains are a delight, but the guides can be mischievous at times when they turn on fountains that will spray guests (not soaking though). Inside the palace is also interesting but the trick fountains are the star attraction.",
          "Caught the bus from Salzburg centre to Hellbrun, water features which were excellent especially on a hot day it would be great especially for kids. There is Sound of Music pavillion and also a small zoo. Along with a small museum. Some of the water and fountain exhibits were",
          "From Salzburg, Bus No 25 from Mirabell platz will go to hellbrunn castle. Bus frequency is every 20 minutes. Need to ask bus driver about the bus stop to get down. It takes about 20 minutes to reach there. Trick Fountain tour is the best out of all. It's worth visiting. N there",
          "We went by bus from Salzburg centre to Schloss Hellbrun mainly to see the water features which were excellent - very funny on a warm dry day to watch all the children running around trying to get soaked. There is also the tiny pavilion from Sound of Music and a very good",
          "Glad it was a very hot day as the tour of the water gardens was very wet for some. Even tried to evade the water jets but they are cleverly concealed. Great day.",
          "A palace and grounds built for pleasure. We visited in the morning using our Salzburg card. Ample parking at 2 Euro for two hours. Landscaped grounds were attractive, but the highlight was a tour of the trick-fountains which seem to take place half-hourly but require a timed",
          "We had a little free time before returning to the airport to go home, so we called in at the park to let the children run off some steam and to visit the Sound of Music pavilion (\"Sixteen Going On Seventeen\"). After the obligatory photos, the girls ran riot on the fantastic",
          "The only time we stopped laughing during our tour was when we were admiring the beauty! This castle is as interesting and beautiful as it is mischievous. Recommend it for everyone with a sense of humor especially families.",
          "Trick fountains are great! Our tour was fantastic! Trick fountains itself is 5 stars as are the gardens! We found the rest of hellbrunn palace a little boring though.",
          "This is a little out of the way if you are staying in central Salzburg but is a definite \"must see\" The way we did it was with a Salzburg Card...cost 28 euro for 24 hours and you get free entry to Hellbrunn (and other attractions) as well as free bus travel....so....get the",
          "Great place and beautiful grounds. Salzburg card gets you in for free. Cost of card is about \u20ac33 for 48 hours. The park holds the famous glass house in the sound of music. Inside the palace is very grand. But rooms are not period. Then have not kept the look with furniture. The",
          "I am not saying \u201cdon\u2019t go\u201d, but just a couple of things to be aware of. Firstly, if you are using a Salzburg card you still need to queue for tickets to gain entrance. Once you have these you can only gain entrance on a guided tour, so we waited an extra 15 minutes to get in.",
          "What a beautiful stroll around the ponds and gardens. We came here to look at the gazebo from the Sound of Music and certainly enjoyed the rest of the grounds as well. Apparently the water activities here are a great place to take kids during the summer--warning....you WILL",
          "We took the trick fountain tour included on the Salzburg card. Very amusing and a fun way to spend the morning. Our guide had a great sense of humor and we enjoyed the occasional splash. We did this on the way back from Untersburg by bus 25.",
          "The guided tour of the trick fountains is a must-do! It was easy to walk through the castle self-guided within 30-45 minutes.",
          "Our visit to Hellbrunn Castle was fantastic! The trick fountains hidden on the tour are so fun to experience! I definitely recommend the tour, especially if you are interested in Hellbrunn\u2019s history and the fun fountains. Also, keep in mind that the playgrounds here are great",
          "The Trick Fountains are definitely the highlight of Hellbrunn Castle.Young or Old, you will surely enjoy it. Beautiful gardens too.",
          "We took a river trip down to the castle and the visit to the gardens and the trick fountains was amazing! Very disappointed that we didn\u2019t have more time to explore inside but the garden tour was well worth it. Loved how the guide took great pleasure in turning the fountains on",
          "Leave the zillions of tourists in Salzburg behind and take the time to leisurely visit Hellbrunn Castle. This place was built 1613-1615 by the ruling Prince Archbishop as a getaway from the stress of courtly life. The palace was never lived in, nor was it intended to ever be a",
          "Perfect for a nice short adventure tour out of the city. Exploring the edges of Salzburg. Here is laying this beautiful castle with a nice park to relax a bit. Many public busses offer trip to here",
          "I had time to visit only the Trick fountains in the Hellgrun palace gardens and they were amazing! The guide was really good, demonstrating how the trick fountains worked and surprising us with unexpected displays of water shooting up from the floor. Amazing technology used by",
          "We went here specifically to see the gazebo from The Sound of Music, but there is so much more here. I wish we had had time to wander the grounds.",
          "An easy trip on city bus #25 takes you there in about15 minutes from Mirabellplatz. The Castle is unusual and interesting with an excellent audio guide- worth about a half hour. Trick fountains are wonderful and really great fun ! We live not far from Orlando and my wife",
          "Highly recommend the Trick Fountains, I will not give it away - its a must!!! The Caf\u00e9 on site it lovely too.",
          "We love it. It is a nice place to go with kids. They have the fountains and a big space to walk. You can spend easyly a day here.",
          "Loved our tour to Heilbrunn Castle. We saw the famous gazebo and strolled around the gardens, very beautiful. Unfortunately we didn't have time for the trick fountains...will have to return!",
          "It is just 10-mins from town on bus 25. We loved both the trick fountains (Kids will have an amazing time, just take a change of clothes tho) and the palace. The grounds are outstanding and if we could have stayed longer just sitting by the lake, we would have. The palace",
          "We took a boat ride down river and then transferred by old London bus to the castle. The tour is a must of the water gardens and the tour very well done. It is a brilliant experience well worth the cost . Afterwards the grounds and cafe lovely. Then had tour bus back. You can",
          "The child in me was so happy when we had this tour. It's a very interesting palace. The lady tour guide was so enthusiastic. Get ready to be wet anytime as there will be surprises at the end of each fountain. A must see when in Salzburg!",
          "I had no expectations of this place and only visited it to see the glass pavilion used in 'Sound of Music.' The house had a music room, natural history room and another room with painted ceilings. The tour of the gardens with its trick fountains and grottoes was a real treat. I",
          "While the grounds and the palace are quite nice, it\u2019s the water trick tour that made this so much fun. What a great sense of humor and creativity the archbishop must have had. Our tour had a classroom of about 30 pre-teens in it and they, undoubtedly enjoyed the water features",
          "We had a great time at the castle. The trick fountains are worth the price of admission on their own. The castle and its displays are fantastic and the grounds are magnificent",
          "Visiting the castle was worthwhile but the tour we did of the trick fountains was awesome. It was not like anything we have seen anywhere before.",
          "Hellbrunn Palace is a baroque villa with extensive grounds that lies just outside Salzburg city centre but is easily reached by bus (No. 25 I believe). There is much to see and do here as not only is there the palace itself but also the grounds which include the \u2018Trick",
          "We went through this magnificent 17th century palace this morning. There is a Markus Sittikus exhibition inside the Palace which is an interesting step back in time. We also saw the sound of music pavilion which is housed here in the grounds. There is also the trick fountain",
          "What a wonderful place. With lots of hidden treasures. If you go on the garden tour be prepared to be wet. This is well worth a visit just for the beauty we brought a Salzburg card so the cost of the and other major attractions and bus was free.",
          "We were brought here as part of two different tours. We enjoyed strolling through the gardens and seeing two of the spots where the Sound of Music scenes were filmed. Just entry to the gardens alone, although peaceful and enjoyable on a sunny day, there isn't much else if you",
          "we had a few hours free so we took a taxi to the Hellbrunn castle, park and the water attractions. It was so exiting to see the history and the wonderful castle inside and than we went to the water attraction with a guide. Wonderful and one of the best things to do in Salzburg",
          "Unfortunately, we only had a drive-by and a brief walk through the Hellbrun Gardens. In the bright spring light, it was utterly refreshing. Without a ticket, you have to look through the bars to see the pools and grotto, and you are confined to the courtyards and gardens.",
          "After a visit to Untersberg I stopped on the way back. It was worth it, in fact I preferred the view from that of Untersberg, yes I know totally different. It was perfect weather and a quick trip up the museum is worth it as you get this view. It's also easy to get to via bus",
          "We came out here since it was listed as one of the attractions on the Salzburg Card. The Park was open, however the palace was not and the fountains were inoperable as well. Apparently the palace and fountains closed in the winter with a rescheduled opening date for 29 March. We",
          "Wonderful historic palace, beautiful gardens and an Alpine Zoo. Don't come at this time if you want a meal as the restaurant is closed until after Easter, which really annoyed us, as it did the Gift Shop too.",
          "A very unique castle with lots of trick fountains through out the property. All the fountains operate without electricity and are in good working condition even after these many years. A must visit place in Salzburg.",
          "The castle and museum itself were rather a let down. The kiosk was over priced. The sound of music pavilion made for a fun photo op but thats it. The main fun comes from the Trick fountains. Tour was great and all the kids around is were having a ball. Best be aware you will get",
          "First place we visited during our stay in Salzburg. We would love to see the place where they filmed the movie Sound of Music. Lovely place to walk & explore. Picturesque sceneries. Would love to come back here with the rest of my family from the US.",
          "It is a combact and interesting castle. Its most interesting point is \"the State rooms\".You must not miss it because it offers spectacular city and Alpes views. In a sunny day is a MUST for a tourist.",
          "Tis was such a lovely trip. I walked all over the park. Everything was covered in snow and the air was wonderfully crisp. The fountains were not on, although still so beautiful.",
          "We took the bus to Hellbrunn Castle from downtown Salzburg. The Castle had a beautiful interior and the grounds were very nice. We enjoyed our time outside, taking several pictures of the beautiful architecture. We also took the tour of the trick fountains. The first part of the",
          "The trick fountains are the main attraction at the palace. The guides definitely enjoy giving tours of the fountains and gardens, all the while explaining how the centuries old fountains work and taking pleasure in surprising the visitors with a splash or two. Very informative",
          "170 bus from town takes you there, see the pagoda from The sound of music and recall the song, I am 16 going on 17.... In winter the castle is closed but the ponds and gardens are open and free.",
          "Lovely place for a walk. Was covered in snow during our visit but still a nice walk. Location of xmas markets in season. If you are a SOM fan this is a must do visit to view the rotunda that features in the movie (16 going on 17). Not the original location but still interesting",
          "Great weekend walk. Castle was closed due to winter break but just walking around was nice experience. Check the small ponds as there is fish \ud83d\udc1f \ud83d\udc20 there",
          "Here all too briefly, to see the gazebo which is easily accessible just in inside the main gates, but would love a more lingering look at the castle itself.",
          "We visited out of season so could only visit the grounds. The trick fountains were not open but we did walk around the gardens. Also a must for Sound of Music fans is a short walk to see the gazebo that was used in the film.",
          "The deceptive fountains are a must to experience. May be they look obvious in the modern time, but one must admire the ingenuity of the architects during that era. I did also enjoy walking around the castle: the park is quite beautiful.",
          "We've seen many schloss in Germany and Austria, but only Hellbrunn has the wonderful trick fountains. We visited on a rainy day in July, and our guide explained that she could not operate some of the water fountain due to weather. Nevertheless, we really enjoyed the guided tour",
          "we stopped here just to look at the gazebo from the sound of music. you can't go in it because too many people have hurt themselves trying to recreate the scene! those benches are further apart than they look on screen! if you're in the neighborhood, it is a good little store if",
          "Another stunning and amazing place with their historic water feature and gardens. Well worth the time we spent there.",
          "Although we did not go inside the Castle, there was plenty to see as we walked round the Christmas market located in the grounds. There was a popular area set aside for children with numerous animals to see. The grounds were worth a visit with several trees decked with Christmas",
          "We visited Hellbrunn primarily for the Christmas Market, and found some unexpected surprises along the way. We did not go inside the castle/palace, but it's especially famous for its role in the movie, The Sound of Music. The grounds are beautiful, and the Christmas Market was",
          "Only visited here as part of the sound of music tour to see the gardens and the gazebo that was used in the film. Just outside the wall is a lovely avenue of trees that was also used in the film.. Our guide told us a little of the history of the place and why it was built and",
          "It was snowing so looked absolutely beautiful and the views of the mountains and surrounding countryside was absolutely lovely.",
          "I visited the castle on Christmas Day. I didn't know if it's possible to explore the place in the winter and after Christmas market was off, that's why I mailed the property and received an answer immediately. Everyday the garden is opened and free of charge. We walked around",
          "The place was fun, quirky and peaceful! We took the trick fountain tour and it was okay- I think people traveling with their kids enjoyed this more. It was still pretty fun and fascinating to see the fountains. But we enjoyed strolling around the park even more after the tour",
          "A winter wonderland with the festive Advent market and the giant Advent calendar. The grounds are beautiful and are festively lite at night with thousands of tiny white lights and red Christmas baubles. Worth a visit",
          "Well worth the 25 Bus from Salzburg City Centre which took around 15mins. \u20ac3 entry person provided a token for a hot drink (which bizarrely cost without the token \u20ac3.50!). Usual Christmas market experience but on a much bigger scale and in a very safe environment, traffic free",
          "The Schloss and Trick Water Gardens are closed at this time of the year but instead, the grounds play host to an incredibly beautiful and magical advent market. Not as big as the main advent market in the center of Salzburg, this stunning and festive location has everything one",
          "This was 1 of the many Christmas markets we went to it was fantastic with an exhibition of Saint Nicholas & the Krampusse at the end of the tour. Worth researching the Krampusse if you go",
          "This place is about 25 minutes on a local bus from Salzburg centre. One of the best Christmas markets I\u2019ve been too, small but good. I would really recommend. It\u2019s 3 Euros to get in but show your ticket and you get a free glue wine.",
          "I will start with giving this a 4/5. Its not that it wasnt to my full pleasure but there are other markets in the area that really are 5/5. So in respect for them Hellbrunn gets a 4. The castle and its market was really nice to visit. We where there in Daylight but it still",
          "Though too old but its still very well maintained. Good for photographers. Nice museum inside the palace with a guided tour.",
          "The Christmas market, children's zoo, and of course the Krampus display! Wow! What a sight to behold. I really enjoyed going to the Palace. We have been there in the early summer & now in December. We would love to go back and experience the magic! Enjoy the delights with a hot",
          "We were there only to see the Gazebo from the Sound of Music. It's nice that the city moved it to such a beautiful location. We didn't really have time to stay for a tour of the Palace, though it would have been fun to see the water spurting area of the gardens.",
          "There is a unique Christmas Market on the grounds of the castle. Quite a different feel from the urban markets. Well maintained grounds with lots of Christmas trees, lights and decorations. There is an interesting small zoo and a Krampus display. Crowded, but still had a laid",
          "This is one of the nicest christmas markets I know. They prepare a very lovely ambient for walking around, with lots of christmas trees and lights. Best time to visit is after it becomes dark. Good place to park is the zoo, you can walk short distance to the market. I love it",
          "I have been to this castle twice now and both of the times I had equal fun, thanks to the trick water fountains. The park around the caste is also really nice to spend some time. However, the highlight for me was the trick water fountains. If you have kids with you or even just",
          "Here for the Christmas market as recommended by a local. Bus ride from Salzburg about 20 mins well worth it. Starts at ten and by twelve when we left was really busy.loads of trees decorated with red balls and loads to see and buy at what we later found out to be good prices.",
          "A nice sunny day was the perfect background for visiting the palace and the adjoining park. Of course, Hellbrunn is best known for the trick fountains (listed as a separate attraction on TripAdvisor), but the palace and the grounds have much to offer, too. The palace itself has",
          "Just made a short visit to this castle's lovely grounds and was very impressed. Wonderful change of colour in the trees. Lots of ponds with various statues and lots of large fish. Perfect place for the children to have a run around. There are also some nice birds near the ponds.",
          "We stopped here on the way to Salzburg and sang a song from The Sound of Music in front of the gazebo that was used during the filming of the movie. Luscious gardens. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit.",
          "Good palace and amazing trick fountains. In palace you get audio guide to visir various rooms. There is unicorn as well Trick fountains you\u2019ll not find anywhere in the world. Amazing. That also desgiened in that time is surprising. There are only 45 min guided tours. Both",
          "We used our Salzburg card to catch the bus & gain free entrance to this lovely palace. We arrived just in time to go straight on a tour of the water fountain gardens. Our guide who took us round was very entertaining & funny. We spent a good few hours walking around the palace &",

          "Hellbrunn Palace was an excellent place to visit. We cycled there from the centre of Salzburg and had a lovely day. This is where the gazebo from The Sound of Music is kept so is a great photo opportunity. The cafe on site also has a great selection of food and drink.",
          "My wife and I were on a Viking River Cruise and one of the stops on our tour was stopping by to see the Hellbrunn Castle. It was an interesting place to visit. It had these trick fountains that were cute. It also had the Gazebo from the Sound of Music here.",
          "We took public transport which was fast and easy for us to get us a little bit outside of town. But the castle was beautiful and had a great time in the trick gardens. Great history and enjoyable time. Walk the grounds! The pavilion from the sound of music is located here!",
          "We added this sightseeing stop in only because we were nearby and had some time. Turns out it was very worth it - mostly to experience the trick fountains. The fountain tour is a separate ticket that meets outside the main castle and tours the grounds. It starts off kind of slow",
          "The Trick Fountains did not disappoint! And our guide had a great sense of humor. Since it was raining outside it didn't matter too much that we got a little wet from the show. There's a nice museum display inside the castle as well. We got the Salzburg card and it was worth",
          "This Castle is outside of Salzburg. It can be reached by bus (line 170) but we chose to go by car as they have a large parking area which is pretty cheap. The grounds and the gardens are really beautiful and carefully maintained, the staff is funny and helpful. The guided tour",
          "Ideal to visit with children. This is a real funny experience. Very pretty castle and garden. It s a nice excursion for a half day visit.",
          "Had to visit this area because the gazebo from The Sound of Music is in the public park. We took a city bus to the palace.You can pay for a tour of the palace and trick fountains, but we didn't do that. We were happy to walk around the gardens. We also visited the gift shop",
          "This gem of a palace was built way back in 1613, over a short six-year program, at the behest of the Prince-Archbishop Markus Sittikus von Hohenaus, a hedonistic noble of Salzburg, to entertain his wide circle of friends and acolytes. The attractive structure was never planned",
          "Spent half a day at the castle and could picture myself spending an entire afternoon in summer eating at the cafe and reading on the grass. Place is quite large and is connected to the zoo as well as a general park area. Lots of benches to sit and enjoy the pond or take a",
          "I visited Hellbrunn in 1990 as a teenager, and I remember loving it. So when my husband and I visited Salzburg, I knew we had to go. The trick fountains were so much fun and definitely tricky! I won't spoil the fun, but do be prepared to get a little wet. Also a bonus - the",
          "A lovely way to spend an afternoon. I particularly enjoyed the tour of the outside (so fun!), the history presented inside the palace, and if you enjoy Art History, you will enjoy the frescoes (towards the back of the palace) that are reminiscent of the House of Gozaga in",

          "The place better to visit during the sunny and summer time. The naughty host set up a lot of trick to please the visitors.",
          "This place exceeded expectations. I expected the house tour to be a pleasant view of patrician high life. This was much more interesting. The wonderful audio guide told of life and influence of Cardinal Archbishop Markus Setticus. A man of parts. One part being his water tricks.",
          "The park is free and should not be missed. A great way to spend a few hours away from the city. A short muni bus ride, a quick self-guided tour of the castle, and then the Wasserspiele. It is a fun tour, you might get wet, but that's part of the fun. Great for families. The tour",
          "Described as trick fountains, this basically means that you will be unexpectedly squirted with water at times during your tour, we found it fun, but others may not agree. What IS worth seeing is the water powered miniature theatre, which was the highlight of the tour for us.",
          "I LOVE this castle especially the \"trick fountain\". It is the most beautiful and funny tour ever. I love how the guide let us participate in his tour. DO NOT MISS IT.THIS IS A MUST IN SALZBURG",

          "Very easy to get there by bus, the Hellbrunn palace itself is not something out of this world, but the whole nature it lies in is totally magical, its gardens are perfect palce to spend some calm time with beautiful nature around you... and MOST importantly, outside the",

          "Visited as part of sound of music tours. Only saw from the outside but plenty of the gardens. Saw the pagoda from the film.",
          "We had Salzburg card for the 24hrs. As a treat to the kids we took them to the trick fountains. Its a bit outside the city. And we wasted a bit of our time while waiting for the bus. While returning the bus did not turn up at the scheduled time. By the time next bus came the bus",
          "Sound of Music fans will want to visit the famous glass gazebo that is housed in the gardens, but the entire property is lovely and definitely worth a visit.",
          "With its large park house and the water gardens this is a great place to while away the afternoon. The water garden is well worth the admission charge but go into it with two things in mind, firstly it was built a long time ago so adopt a mental age of an early teen. Second you",
          "The place is nice when the weather is good. Travel by public transport is cheap and easy. Garden is very nice and vaste. Water fountains are commercialized",
          "Easy to do on your own, just catch the bus from town. The Palace is ok, but not a must, however the gardens are outstanding & beautifully maintained. Lucky locals get to use it for free. The trick fountains, even for oldies was fun, had a marvellous guide, explain everything,",
          "The garden tour is a must. The water features are fun and a wonder of the world. All the amazing features were built to entertain and are great fun. They are all driven by water under gravity only. The engineering was astonishing for its time. Moving figures, a whole",
          "The castle and grounds are beautiful but the adjoining Trick Fountains are really much more interesting. This was a stop on the Hop on Hop off tour out of Salzburg.",
          "A lovely surprise - kids and fun loving adults will love this but prepared to get wet and if its not very warm may be a bit uncomfortable. Wear sensible shoes you will scream with laughter!",
          "We visited the palace but decided not to tour the palace as our 3 year old son would have been very bored. So we just stayed in the huge and beautiful gardens. I couldn't believe that access was free and it's like a public park for the locals! Clean, brilliant children's park,",
          "The tour of the trick fountains was fun - be prepared to get wet and enjoy your time visiting the gardens as well as the palace.",
          "This out of town fun palace of the Salzburg Bishops' is a 20 minute bus ride from the old town. Free using your Salzburg card the water play park is a fun visit, but be prepared to get sprayed from unexoected places. The gardens and fish lakes are worth visiting. The folklore",
          "Our \"Sound of Music\" tour stopped at Hellbrunn Castle briefly, primarily to see the glass gazebo which featured in scenes in the movie. Therefore, we did not have a great deal of time to view the other features of the castle. However we did get the opportunity to have a quick",

          "Fortunately, we went to Hellbrunn on a hot and sunny day. . On the tour of the grounds, be prepared to get wet, multiple times. But don't let this knowledge spoil your experience. . Get wet and enjoy! Given the age, the technical achievement of each station is impressive, and",
          "Well - just beautiful !!! Try to spend whole day here : visit the palace , fountain garden , park , Sound of Music pavilion and Stone theater. There 2 restaurants to have lunch so you won't be hungry . The fountain garden is just a masterpiece- absolutely unique water pumps",
          "Palace The palace was the vacation residence of archbishop Markus Sittikus and is well worth a visit. The exhibitions are very well laid out and signposted. You receive a device with a recorded commentary that is excellent. Trick Fountains The trick fountains are fascinating and",
          "This is a great addition to any visit of Salzburg. It's a must as the gazebo from the sound of music movie was originally at Mirabell gardens and then moved to here. It was reconstructed piece by piece as too many visitors at Mirabell gardens were going inside and fears of being",
          "If u want to move away from castles and palaces which are largely there in all key cities of Europe, this is a place to check out esp for families with kids as there is a trick fountain tour which kids esp would enjoy. If you like kind of picnic spots it's a place to go, you may",
          "This was my 3rd visit (my first was in 1987!) Always good fun, take a coat and maybe leave some spare clothes in the car for the kids. Go early, leave the car there and get the bus into Salzburg from just up the road. It costs about 3-4 euros to leave the car all day!",
          "I wanted to visit Hellbrun Palace specifically to see the sound of Music Pavillion but my teenage sons really enjoyed the water fountain tour and got thoroughly soaked taking on the challenges of the fountains! We took the bus 25 after visiting Untersburg and stopped off here.",
          "The trick fountains have to be seen to be believed we had a great laugh and got a little wet (there's plenty of warning if you'd rather not get wet). The castle was also interesting with plenty of interesting facts to learn. The gazebo from the sound of music is also here.",
          "We popped in here briefly to see the pavilion from The Sound of Music. There was a wedding going on here too - what a beautiful place to get married! Make sure you check out the map of where everything is - especially if you're looking for the pavilion as the grounds are quite",
          "good for light relief after the more heavy historical touring visits to the 'bigger' castles and cathedrals in the city. When one take into account the surprise water fountains were all designed so long ago it surely adds another level of appreciation of the ingenuity",
          "Hellbrunn is a Renaissance castle and gardens/park on the outskirts of Salzburg, easily reached with bus 25 (more frequent than bus 170) from the centre of town (Mirabellplatz). The stop to get off at is Alpenstrasse. The castle was built in the early 17th century, and is",
          "This is the best castle to visit in Salzburg - excellent history and beautiful gardens with fun fountains",
          "To get to this Castle, you need to take the bus 170. You can take it from the Old Town, bus stops Theatergasse or Mozartsteg, for example. Google can help you or ask at some shops as I did. The ticket price one way cost me 2.5 euro by bus. Then, you get out at Alpernstrasse and",
          "Went here as part of a guided tour. I think it was our tour guide that made this a disappointing attraction, as she was very rushed. We didn't see the castle, just walked straight through the gardens to the rotunda, used in the film The Sound of Music, and then straight to the",
          "This place is an absolutely fun. The entry fee is included with your Salzburg card. Kids will certainly love this places because of the huge park and ponds (3 of them) next to Schloss Hellbrunn. You and your kids can go picnic there. Do not forget to go to tricky fountain tour.",
          "The castle is situated in the outskirts of Salzburg. There's a parking just outside the castle that is not expensive at all. Buying a 12.50 ticket (adults) you get to visit the trick fountains and the palace, while the park of the castle is free. The trick fountains re the",
          "Hellbrunn has a lot to offer. The fountains, a zoo, the palace, a great leave to walk, sit and enjoy the gardens and best attraction, the Sound of Music Gazebo. Hellbrunn is an amazing place, can be reached by bus, tour or if you are adventurous and rent a car you are able to",
          "It;s a nice castle to visit with kids and family, full of water surprises. Take additional clothes just in case....",
          "Hellbrunn Schloss is well worth a visit if you have time when visiting Salzburg. It's a short bus ride from town on route 25 with a stop right out the front. The gardens are immaculate but the real reason to visit is the trick fountain garden. Without giving much away YOU WILL",
          "A little way out of town but worth the visit. The gardens are impressive especially the trick fountains which are good fun. The summer house from the film of The Sound of Music has also been relocated here and you can get right up close to it.",
          "The Hellbrunn Castle and grounds is worth the visit. The castle was one of the location shoots for The Sound of Music and the gardens is well worth the visit. There is also the Salzburg zoo which was a lot of fun, lots of people , locals and tourists goes here to unwind, relax",
          "We overheard an old couple praising Hellbrunn Palace while we were in the cable car! Took the same bus 25 to the palace. Went to get the tickets ... Salzburg city cards are great value for money, btw. We had a guided your around the trick fountain ... wasserspiele. It was",
          "It rained while we were there but that didn't matter because you can't avoid getting wet amongst the tricky fountains.",
          "Much better than I have imagined. The water games (wasserspiele) is only accessible via tour, which you book when purchasing tickets. Takes about 40min and it is really interesting and fun and you will get wet, so be there on a sunny day. I thought my 5 year old would be really",
          "I was amazed to see the ingenuity and engineering of the trick fountains in the garden. It was delightful and surprising! While the castle is okay the gardens make this stand out.",
          "We decided to pop by but didn't enter the castle to watch the famous watershow; nonetheless, even just from the outside you can view the gazebo used whilst filming The Sound of Music and sit peacefully by the pond.",
          "A lovely hot day, so this was something we did using our Salzburg card as entrance to both the house and gardens are covered by the card. The gardens are nice to walk around and the water features fun and interesting for all ages. Be prepared to get wet! The tour guide spoke",
          "This is a nice place to visit. Still you only need about half an hour to visit it. The \"wasserspiele\" is included in de the ticket and is absolutely a recommendation. We paid as a family (2 kids 7 and 9) 29 euro in total.",
          "If you really need to see the gazebo that was in the Sound of Music, then you should visit. You can't go inside but you can dance in front and take photos. The fountains were okay, the palace alright.",
          "Schloss Hellbrunn itself is quite boring if I am honest. You can take an audio tour through the house, and it gives you information about Marcus Sittikus (an Archbishop). Nice if you are into the history of Salzburg, but the house itself on the inside is not very special. The",
          "This is a great site for tourists. One ticket buys the guided fountain tour (you can't see it any other way) as well as a self-guided tour through the house. The house is not very special, but they have done a really good job with the audio interpretation--it was quite",
          "If you are a fan of the Sound of Music, you will know the Gazebo that Rolf and Liesl dance in for Sixteen Going On Seventeen. At Schloss Hellbrun, you can visit the gazebo for free, as it is in the outside gardens. While I dont think you can go inside, it offers great picture",
          "Highly enjoyable. The trick fountains is a paid for tour- but well worth it. Lots of fun throughout. Water features and fountains beautiful and get you wet! The castle itself is the most disappointing aspect- but still some great art in there. The gardens provide a good walk.",
          "Hellbrunn palace is easily accessible with the bus (No. 25) via Salzburg city center and its totally worth the trip! The area is amazing and the water fountain games are incomparable! It's unbelievable to think that these complicated water games can still operate, even though",
          "If you visit Salzburg then you must fit in time to see Hellbrunn Castle. The gardens and trick fountains are a real joy. I visited years ago and enjoyed visiting again.",
          "Hellbrunn castle was definetely exciting place to see and important place in Salzburg's history. We spend there 2-3 hours and participated also the fountain tour which was good way to learn about the place (guide spoke both english & german).",
          "Nice castle to visit in Salzburg, take the tram up to the castle. Not stroller friendly so take another type of carrier if you can. If you have time, the restaurant at the top is wonderful with the best views.",
          "The fountains are amazing - mechanisms older than 300 years are still functional! The castle itself and gardens, as well as the view from the hill next to them are worth the visit.",
          "Hellbrunn Castle is located at one end of the city but is accessible easily by bus. It has a beautiful Fountain show which is a Must Visit! The castle itself has a great display!",
          "After visiting Untersberg, we jumped off the 25 bus to visit Schloss Hellbrun. The best thing here is the trick fountains tour. As you go through the tour, water will shoot out from all different directions. If you hate getting wet, avoid this part of the palace. However, for",
          "It was a beautiful bike ride to this place to see the gazebo. We ended up renting city bikes for cheap and then rode them here. Beautiful experience. Recommend it over taking a tour bus. We also rode to Leopoldskrom and all the other sites in Salzburg. Get there before the tour",
          "I cycled out to the site from Salzburg and it was a lovely ride. The trick fountains were very cool and the grounds were very relaxing. The museum told quite a bit about the life of the archbishop.",
          "I went to visit the Hellbrunn Palace as I had a free afternoon. The Palace itself is nice to look at from the outside but inside you don't get to see much, and quite frankly I found it rather boring. To me it was mostly the gardens that I found lovely and pleasant to sit in.",
          "We combined this with a trip up the cable car on the Untersberg- using the Salzburg card to the max. Really easy on the #25 bus, goes right to both. Picnic at the top of the mountain (supplemented by a portion of chips to go from the cafe at the top - reasonably priced),",
          "We arrived at the palace around midday and waited for the 12:15pm tour of the Trick Fountains. I would recommend song the tour if the fountains as I believe it is one of a kind and kids will love it as much as the adults. The tour was in both English and German, our guide was",
          "The highlight of visiting Hellbrunn Castle would definately be the guided tour of the trick fountains",

          "We took a bus ( Bus 25) from central Salzburg and reached Hellbrunn Castle on an unusually warm June morning. The Castle is an easy walk from the bus stop - though signage could be better. To experience the trick fountains , you need to join a guided tour. Each tour lasts about",
          "We travelled to Hellbrunn by bus and didn't really know what to expect. We were booked onto a trick fountain tour when we arrived and only had to wait a short time. The tour really was excellent - I've never been anywhere like this before. We got wet but not too soaked and had a",
          "Not just another Schloss...my teens were not thrilled to go to another one. Took a private tour of the magic water-fountains...so much fun and worth the extra price.",
          "The water gardens were the best part of this visit, as it was a hot day nobody minded getting a little wet. Good fun, quite interesting and different too.",
          "One should visit this place, the Castle is very good to go around, the Gardens are nice and the most interesting part are the trick fountains. The tour of the fountains is interesting and a novel experience, Must visit place",

          "The castle itself is pretty and the tour is ok but what you really have to tour is the gardens and the trick fountains! Make sure you wear something you don't mind getting a little wet in and prepare to be surprised!",
          "Very nice place , with really beautiful gardens . I disagree that this place and this whole town tries to market itself based on the Sound of Music , and Mozart",
          "Beautiful grounds and the trick fountains were great. The guide was very entertaining and since it was a really hot day we didn't mind getting wet!",
          "Sound Of Music....this place is so Julie Andrews. One is taken right into the scenes of this epic movie.",
          "We went to the castle to escape the heat (we prefer nature trails but you couldn't be outside on a day like this). It was a great visit, especially for the kids. The trick fountains and water-powered displays are lots of fun and very interesting to watch. The guide was very good",
          "Best to approach the Hellbrun on foot by walking down the Hellbrunner alley; this gives you the flavor of the surrounding countryside. You must take a guided tour of the water gardens which are alot of fun. Inside the palace gives you an idea of how the archbishops lived.",
          "We were able to visit the Sound of Music Pavilion which is located near the Schloss Helburnn. Worth a look.",
          "This Castle has the most whimisical gardens. I have been here before but enjoyed it so much I returned on this trip. You go in timed groups and you are amused and surprised at the same time. Really this is not to be missed",
          "Schloss Hellbrunn is in my opinion the best attraction of Salzburg. Located outside the city the spacious parks and gardens of Hellbrunn Palace are a wonderful place to unwind, take a walk and enjoy a bit of outdoor sport. And here you will find the famous Pavilion of The Sound",

          "We wish we could have had more time there but sadly if was a short visit and most of it was not open yet. If you can, try and plan a real visit there but even the gardens are great",

          "Had the pleasure of walking around the grounds and enjoyed the tour immensely. In both English and German it is also on the No.25 bus route (Salzberg Card crucial if you're a tourist). You will easily spend 2hrs here so allow yourself that as you will just want to take as many",
          "I dragged by kids to this on the ride back from Untersberg and they LOVE IT!! This was a please surprise, you have to do the tour of the fountains. If you don't there is no reason to stop. The tour guide speaks in German and English. Its great for kids. They show you all",
          "we saw it from outside in the sound of music tours we took. as it was one of the locations in the movie. good for the pictures there",

          "This sight is easy and cheap to access by using public transportation (bus no.25 from the city center / railway station). Totally worth of visiting. The garden is amazing and the castles are beautiful. The cute gazebo from Sound of Music is located here as well.",
          "Built to use as a day summer residence by Markus Sittikus.. the palace has large grounds and a zoo near by. The famous Gazebo of Sound of Music movie is also nearby. The audio guide was very informative and rightly timed.. In about 30 minutes one can finish the tour.",
          "The highlight of a visit to Hellbrunn Castle has to be the guided tour around the Trick Fountains - hence the title of my review. Situated a short distance outside Salzburg, the castle is set in beautiful, large grounds. There is not too much to see in the castle itself but",
          "Very enjoyable day out in the country, only about 6km out of the city - we drove there - plenty free parking. Fantastic grounds with trees and gardens. We also visited the castle interior which was very interesting - that visit is in a package along with the fountain displays -",
          "A pleasure about 10 minutes from the centre of Salzburg. Go by bus ( 25A ). Hellbrunn has a brilliant collection of 400 year old surprise water features - young children will adore the place. There main mansion has interesting paintings and frescoes. Grounds are beautiful with",
          "The castle ground is huge but there's no clear signage leading to the castle from the car park. We had already visited quite a few castles before arriving in Salzburg so our main focus was the trick fountain. It is definitely worth a visit and the guide made it more fun with",

          "Unfortunately the trick fountains were not working when we visited because it was winter. But there was something truly magical, ethereal even about this place. I loved it. Worth the visit and if you are there around Christmas, they have lovely little Christmas markets!",

          "The best part of this visit is the unique and fascinating water gardens on the property. But prepare to be wet! The kids will love the surprise showers, and the adults will marvel at the engineering genius from the 17th century. The house itself was (to me) unremarkable, and",

          "It is true to its name of trick fountains! The guide for my tour was hilarious and definitely had a sense of humour! The trick fountains are amazing and worth the ticket to visit! The rest of the castle is also very pretty, I did not venture very far on the property but the",

          "This was a bit outside of Salzburg, but it was very easy to get to. You take bus number 25 in front of Mirabell Palace. One of the things I particularly like about this tour was the absence of English-speaking tourist. Most of them here were German-speaking. It was the kind of",
          "This is the place I loved the most in Salzburg. This place has divine beauty in itself. I was and am still amazed with the tricky fountains. Tricky fountain tour is worth watching . It was a whole new experience for me. And the great thing about this is everything is natural.",
          "We took the funicular or Bergbahn to reach the castle. We walled around and took fanyadtic pictures from Heidelberg. There, you can find a wine testing pub. The wines are really good! You will find several gift shops as well to buy memorabilia of the castle.",

          "Hellbrunn is an excellent tourist destination for multiple reasons. First their is the history preserved in the main palace rooms and in the nearby museum. Then there is the surprise-filled tour through the wasserspiele (play fountains that I enjoyed although some of my party",
          "The guide showing us the water fountain was very much disinterested. It was supposed to be in German and English but the time for English given was just 20%. It was a drizzle but he did not invite us to participate in the tricks and just showed us disinterested. We visited on",

It is outside so although it has a lot of visitors, it is a bit off the beaten path for many.

        "wiki": "Salzburg (Austrian: [\u02c8saltsb\u028a\u0281k]; German: [\u02c8zaltsb\u028a\u0281k] (listen);  literally \"Salt Fortress\"; Bavarian: Soizburg) is the capital city of the State of Salzburg and with 155,031 inhabitants, it is the fourth-largest city in Austria.\nThe town is located on the site of the former Roman settlement of Iuvavum. Salzburg was founded as an episcopal see in 696 and became a seat of the archbishop in 798. Its main sources of income were salt extraction and trade and, at times, gold mining. The fortress of Hohensalzburg, one of the largest medieval fortresses in Europe, dates from the 11th century. In the 17th century, Salzburg became a centre of the Counter-Reformation, where monasteries and numerous Baroque churches were built.\nSalzburg's historic centre (German: Altstadt) is thus renowned for its Baroque architecture and is one of the best-preserved city centres north of the Alps, with 27 churches. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The city has three universities and a large population of students. Tourists also visit Salzburg to tour the historic centre and the scenic Alpine surroundings. Salzburg was the birthplace of the 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Because of its history, culture, and attractions, Salzburg has been labeled Austria's \"most inspiring city.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity to the High Middle Ages ===\nTraces of human settlements have been found in the area, dating to the Neolithic Age. The first settlements in Salzburg continuous with the present were apparently by the Celts around the 5th century BC.\nAround 15 BC the Roman Empire merged the settlements into one city. At this time, the city was called \"Juvavum\" and was awarded the status of a Roman municipium in 45 AD. Juvavum developed into an important town of the Roman province of Noricum. After the Norican frontier's collapse, Juvavum declined so sharply that by the late 7th century it nearly became a ruin.The Life of Saint Rupert credits the 8th-century saint with the city's rebirth. When Theodo of Bavaria asked Rupert to become bishop c. 700, Rupert reconnoitered the river for the site of his basilica. Rupert chose Juvavum, ordained priests, and annexed the manor of Piding. Rupert named the city \"Salzburg\". He travelled to evangelise among pagans.\nThe name Salzburg means \"Salt Castle\" (Latin: Salis Burgium). The name derives from the barges carrying salt on the River Salzach, which were subject to a toll in the 8th century as was customary for many communities and cities on European rivers. Hohensalzburg Fortress, the city's fortress, was built in 1077 by Archbishop Gebhard, who made it his residence. It was greatly expanded during the following centuries.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\nIndependence from Bavaria was secured in the late 14th century. Salzburg was the seat of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, a prince-bishopric of the Holy Roman Empire. As the Reformation movement gained steam, riots broke out among peasants in the areas in and around Salzburg. The city was occupied during the German Peasants' War, and the Archbishop had to flee to the safety of the fortress. It was besieged for three months in 1525.\nEventually, tensions were quelled, and the city's independence led to an increase in wealth and prosperity, culminating in the late 16th to 18th centuries under the Prince Archbishops Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau, Markus Sittikus, and Paris Lodron. It was in the 17th century that Italian architects (and Austrians who had studied the Baroque style) rebuilt the city centre as it is today along with many palaces.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\n\n==== Religious conflict ====\n\nOn 31 October 1731, the 214th anniversary of the 95 Theses, Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian signed an Edict of Expulsion, the Emigrationspatent, directing all Protestant citizens to recant their non-Catholic beliefs. 21,475 citizens refused to recant their beliefs and were expelled from Salzburg. Most of them accepted an offer by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, travelling the length and breadth of Germany to their new homes in East Prussia. The rest settled in other Protestant states in Europe and the British colonies in America.\n\n\n==== Illuminism ====\nIn 1772\u20131803, under archbishop Hieronymus Graf von Colloredo, Salzburg was a centre of late Illuminism. Colloredo is known for being one of the main employers of Mozart. He often had several arguments with Mozart he dismissed him by  saying, \u201cSoll er doch gehen, ich brauche ihn night!\u201d (He should just go then; I don\u2019t need him!)  Mozart would leave Salzburg for Vienna in 1781 with his family including his father Leopold staying back as he and Colloredo had a close relationship.\n\n\n=== Electorate of Salzburg ===\nIn 1803, the archbishopric was secularised by Emperor Napoleon; he transferred the territory to Ferdinando III of Tuscany, former Grand Duke of Tuscany, as the Electorate of Salzburg.\n\n\n=== Austrian annexation of Salzburg ===\nIn 1805, Salzburg was annexed to the Austrian Empire, along with the Berchtesgaden Provostry.\n\n\n=== Salzburg under Bavarian rule ===\nIn 1809, the territory of Salzburg was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria after Austria's defeat at Wagram.\n\n\n=== Division of Salzburg and annexation by Austria and Bavaria ===\nAfter the Congress of Vienna with the Treaty of Munich (1816), Salzburg was definitively returned to Austria, but without Rupertigau and Berchtesgaden, which remained with Bavaria. Salzburg was integrated into the Province of Salzach and Salzburgerland was ruled from Linz.In 1850, Salzburg's status was restored as the capital of the Duchy of Salzburg, a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The city became part of Austria-Hungary in 1866 as the capital of a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The nostalgia of the Romantic Era led to increased tourism. In 1892, a funicular was installed to facilitate tourism to Hohensalzburg Fortress\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n\n==== First Republic ====\nFollowing World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Salzburg, as the capital of one of the Austro-Hungarian territories, became part of the new German Austria. In 1918, it represented the residual German-speaking territories of the Austrian heartlands. This was replaced by the First Austrian Republic in 1919, after the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919).\n\n\n==== Annexation by the Third Reich ====\n\nThe Anschluss (the occupation and annexation of Austria, including Salzburg, into the Third Reich) took place on 12 March 1938, one day before a scheduled referendum on Austria's independence. German troops moved into the city. Political opponents, Jewish citizens and other minorities were subsequently arrested and deported to concentration camps. The synagogue was destroyed. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union, several POW camps for prisoners from the Soviet Union and other enemy nations were organized in the city.\nDuring the Nazi occupation, a Romani camp was built in Salzburg-Maxglan. It was an Arbeitserziehungslager (work 'education' camp), which provided slave labour to local industry. It also operated as a Zwischenlager (transit camp), holding Roma before their deportation to German camps or ghettos in German-occupied territories in eastern Europe.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nAllied bombing destroyed 7,600 houses and killed 550 inhabitants. Fifteen air strikes destroyed 46 percent of the city's buildings, especially those around Salzburg railway station. Although the town's bridges and the dome of the cathedral were destroyed, much of its Baroque architecture remained intact. As a result, Salzburg is one of the few remaining examples of a town of its style. American troops entered the city on 5 May 1945 and it became the centre of the American-occupied area in Austria.  Several displaced persons camps were established in Salzburg\u2014among them Riedenburg, Camp Herzl (Franz-Josefs-Kaserne), Camp M\u00fclln, Bet Bialik, Bet Trumpeldor, and New Palestine.\n\n\n==== Present day ====\nAfter World War II, Salzburg became the capital city of the Federal State of Salzburg (Land Salzburg). On 27 January 2006, the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all 35 churches of Salzburg rang their bells after 8:00 p.m. (local time) to celebrate the occasion. Major celebrations took place throughout the year.\nAs of 2017 Salzburg had a GDP per capita of \u20ac46,100, which was greater than the average for Austria and for most European countries.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSalzburg is on the banks of the River Salzach, at the northern boundary of the Alps. The mountains to Salzburg's south contrast with the rolling plains to the north. The closest alpine peak, the 1,972\u2011metre-high Untersberg, is less than 16 kilometres (10 miles) from the city centre. The Altstadt, or \"old town\", is dominated by its baroque towers and churches and the massive Hohensalzburg Fortress. This area is flanked by two smaller hills, the M\u00f6nchsberg and Kapuzinerberg, which offer green relief within the city.  Salzburg is approximately 150 km (93 mi) east of Munich, 281 km (175 mi) northwest of Ljubljana, Slovenia, and 300 km (186 mi) west of Vienna. Salzburg has about the same latitude of Seattle.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSalzburg is part of the temperate zone. The K\u00f6ppen climate classification specifies the climate as a humid continental climate (Dfb), however, with the \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm for the coldest month, Salzburg can be classified as having four-season oceanic climate with significant temperature differences between seasons. Due to the location at the northern rim of the Alps, the amount of precipitation is comparatively high, mainly in the summer months. The specific drizzle is called Schn\u00fcrlregen in the local dialect. In winter and spring, pronounced foehn winds regularly occur.\n\n\n== Population ==\nIn 2018, 31% of the total population is foreign born according to Statistik Austria.\nSalzburg's official population significantly increased in 1935 when the city absorbed adjacent municipalities. After World War II, numerous refugees found a new home in the city. New residential space was constructed for American soldiers of the postwar occupation, and could be used for refugees when they left. Around 1950, Salzburg passed the mark of 100,000 citizens, and in 2016, it reached the mark of 150,000 citizens.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Romanesque and Gothic ===\nThe Romanesque and Gothic churches, the monasteries and the early carcass houses dominated the medieval city for a long time. The Cathedral of Archbishop Conrad of Wittelsbach was the largest basilica north of the Alps. The choir of the Franciscan Church, construction was begun by Hans von Burghausen and completed by Stephan Krumenauer, is one of the most prestigious religious gothic constructions of southern Germany. At the end of the Gothic era the Collegiate church \"Nonnberg\", Margaret Chapel in St. Peter's Cemetery, the St. George's Chapel and the stately halls of the \"Hoher Stock\" in Hohensalzburg Fortress were constructed.\n\n\n=== Renaissance and baroque ===\nInspired by Vincenzo Scamozzi, Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau began to transform the medieval town to the architectural ideals of the late Renaissance. Plans for a massive cathedral by Scamozzi failed to materialize upon the fall of the archbishop. A second cathedral planned by Santino Solari rose as the first early Baroque church in Salzburg. It served as an example for many other churches in Southern Germany and Austria. Markus Sittikus and Paris von Lodron continued to rebuild the city with major projects such as Hellbrunn Palace, the prince archbishop's residence, the university buildings, fortifications, and many other buildings. Giovanni Antonio Daria managed by order of Prince Archbishop Guido von Thun the construction of the residential well. Giovanni Gaspare Zuccalli, by order of the same archbishop, created the Erhard and the Kajetan church in the south of the town. The city's redesign was completed with buildings designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, donated by Prince Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun.\nAfter the era of Ernst von Thun, the city's expansion came to a halt, which is the reason why there are no churches built in the Rococo style. Sigismund von Schrattenbach continued with the construction of \"Sigmundstor\" and the statue of holy Maria on the cathedral square. With the fall and division of the former \"F\u00fcrsterzbistum Salzburg\" (Archbishopric) to Upper Austria, Bavaria (Rupertigau) and Tyrol (Zillertal Matrei) began a long period of urban stagnancy. This era didn't end before the period of promoterism (Gr\u00fcnderzeit) brought new life into urban development. The builder dynasty Jakob Ceconi and Carl Freiherr von Schwarz filled major positions in shaping the city in this era.\n\n\n=== Classical modernism and post-war modernism ===\nBuildings of classical modernism and in particular the post-war modernism are frequently encountered in Salzburg. Examples are the Zahnwurzen house (a house in the Linzergasse 22 in the right center of the old town), the \"Lepi\" (a public baths in Leopoldskron) (built 1964) and the original 1957 constructed congress centre of Salzburg, which was replaced by a new building in 2001. An important and famous example of architecture of this era is the 1960 opening of the Gro\u00dfes Festspielhaus by Clemens Holzmeister.\n\n\n=== Contemporary architecture ===\nAdding contemporary architecture to Salzburg's old town without risking its UNESCO World Heritage status is problematic. Nevertheless, some new structures have been added: the Mozarteum at the Baroque Mirabell Garden (Architecture Robert Rechenauer), the 2001 Congress House (Architecture: Freemasons), the 2011 Unipark Nonntal (Architecture: Storch Ehlers Partners), the 2001 \"Makartsteg\" bridge (Architecture: HALLE1), and the \"Residential and Studio House\" of the architects Christine and Horst Lechner in the middle of Salzburg's old town (winner of the architecture award of Salzburg 2010). Other examples of contemporary architecture lie outside the old town: the Faculty of Science building (Universit\u00e4t Salzburg \u2013 Architecture Willhelm Holzbauer) built on the edge of free green space, the blob architecture of Red Bull Hangar\u20117 (Architecture: Volkmar Burgstaller) at Salzburg Airport, home to Dietrich Mateschitz's Flying Bulls and the Europark Shopping Centre. (Architecture: Massimiliano Fuksas)\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nSalzburg has twenty-four urban districts and three extra-urban populations.\nUrban districts (Stadtteile):\n\nExtra-urban populations (Landschaftsr\u00e4ume):\n\nGaisberg\nHellbrunn\nHeuberg\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nSalzburg is a tourist favourite, with the number of visitors outnumbering locals by a large margin in peak times.

          "You can see the dome of the cathedral from almost everywhere. Free entrance though they kindly ask for a donation of your own choice. A must visit in Salzburg. A bit touristy around the cathedral so we tried to get away from there after the visit.",
          "The Cathedral is an inspiring building with tastily decorated ceilings and walls. The Biblical paintings are brightly colored and Church the trim is in silver and white, a change from the usual gold and red. The domed ceiling above the main altar and the wall behind the altar",
          "The facade is stunning. Once inside however, I did not feel as awed as in other cathedrals. Perhaps this is due to extensive restorations, but the interior just felt a bit too sterile for me. I found much more delight in certain details. First, the floor. Marble?",
          "We recommend this Cathedral on a visit to Salzburg. It captures the essence of the city and the imagination runs riot at the thought of this in Mozart's day. The interior is ornate but in keeping with buildings of the time. We could not stay for a concert but it is worth",
          "A disappointment - an unremarkable and dark church not living up to the Sound of Music reputation. The best thing about the building is the facade - worth a photo.",
          "The Salzburg Cathedral doesn\u2019t rate against the big ones, but that is part of its charm. The bells on the hour and on Sundays are very pretty.",
          "A must see in Salzburg. Spectacular inside and out. Come in through the arches facing the statue of Mary and see the crown line up on her head.",
          "I bought a Dom Quartier ticket which included entry and audio guided tour of the Residenz State rooms and parts of the Salzburg cathedral such as up in the grand organ loft and museum. It took over 2 hours to see everything but it was so engrossing and so much to see. The state",

          "Historic Cathedral with an amazing story of importance to Salzburg and it's destiny to survive through fires, and those who were determined to see that destiny take place through the evolving years. It shows how these Cathedrals are the people and the representation of a city",
          "This is a gorgeous baroque Cathedral. The paintings on the walls and ceilings are really magnificent as are the organs. It is well worth a short stop to walk around the cathedral.",
          "Visited here with my wife today. Been to a lot of Cathedrals in Europe so it\u2019s become an obligatory thing we do when visiting European cities. It\u2019s very pretty inside and has cool crypts. Free to entry but a donation is very much appreciated. Worth a visit",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral right in the center of town. The architecture is stunning. I loved the organs perched on these massive concrete slabs, one on each side in front of the pews. This is a church you need to see. It was among the prettiest we have seen.",
          "I am a devout Hindu but respect other religions and not opposed to visiting their religious places. As a result I ended up visiting this cathedral during my stay in Salzburg. Its a great architecture and one of the beautiful cathedrals I have seen. The area around it is very",

          "one of the most amazing cathedrals that can easily rival with those in italy. not to be missed while in salzburg.",
          "We were very impressed with this very large cathedral. It is quite a spectacular building well worth going to see, located in the centre of the old town",
          "We dropped in quickly to see the Cathedral on Easter Sunday. It is a beautiful place, made even more so by the fact that the joyous Easter Sunday Mass being celebrated included equally joyous music and voice. The crowds made us reluctant to remain for the service but we were",
          "Not the most impressive cathedral I've ever seen (there are many more beautiful ones, such as the Dome of Milan, the Dome of Cologne, the Basilica of San Pietro in the Vatican, the St. John's Co-Cathedral from Valletta if we talk about the inside part, Onze Lieve Vrouve",
          "This cathedral is simply breathtaking.The walls were some sort of white stone, I think, an were carved with such intricate floral details. It didn\u2019t really look like stone though but rather like bone. And there were 5 organs! I can\u2019t even imagine what it must be like to hear all",
          "As you tour the Salzburg Cathedral, you are in awe of the history of this city and this part of Austria. The Cathedral is loaded with moments in time, preserved and cared for with such reverence. Just look skyward to the frescoes and you will be inspired.",
          "It\u2019s much larger than expected, and all around there you can find other smaller churches. The painting a te great and they have chairs to facilitate you looking at the ceilings.",

          "The Salzburg Cathedral is the most stunning cathedral I have seen. It is gloriously white inside with incredible painted and sculptured ceilings. Huge bonus - no line-ups! And it is free to get in. We had recently left Italy and there are always very long line-ups to get into",
          "It won't take a terribly long time to explore on your own, so definitely make time to visit the cathedral if you're in Salzburg. It is so different from the Gothic churches that you see in much of Italy and Spain. Admission is free, but a donation is appreciated upon arrival. My",
          "Also called Salzburger Dom. It was founded in 774 over a Roman town. It burned in a fire in the 1100\u2019s and then it was re-built in the Baroque style in the 1600\u2019s. It still contains the baptismal font where Mozart was baptized. It is Free with Salzburg Card. You can also view",
          "Very beautiful and impressive. And it was so successfully reconstructed after World war 2. It makes Salzburg more attractive for tourists.",

          "This is worth seeing and is breath taking. You do not need to more than an hour here but the ceilings are so high and art so detailed.",
          "This Cathedral is absolutely stunning and was Mozart\u2019s childhood church. Mozart was baptized here as well. This church is full of history. It is free to get in, but we had a guided tour which explained the importance of this building for the city and the rich history that",
          "This is a must stop in Slazburg. It is free. It is a beautiful cathedral in a very European way. It should be on that must-do list",

          "Spent quite a while here nosing round. Ceilings are highly ornate with painted panels. Fun trying to work out the biblical story they relate to. Very moved by the prayer candles at various points. The crypt was probably best - with an art installation making use of shadows. The",
          "I would absolutely recommend visiting the Salzburg Cathedral. Entry is free of charge, however, no tourists are allowed during the service, so do look up the schedule when planning your visit. There is also a crypt under the church that you can visit. It is very nicely",
          "The architecture, paintings, decorative features are well worth seeing. It is easy to locate in the heart of Salzburg and seems to be the gathering place for families and tour groups.",
          "Beautiful and easy to find. Worth a stroll around and kids found the time / exhibits interesting enough. No charge just optional contribution on departure.",
          "Old buildings are a favourite visiting spot for me and the dom did not disappoint.. a lovely visit and would come back",
          "located in the central area of the city ... an incredible interior, balconies, organs, paintings and stained glass are exceptionally made ... unique in Europe!",
          "Great cathedral and freezing cold . Was an amazing beautiful structure. All white marble inside. Cute market and stalls outside.",
          "Wow! This is beautiful! Was lucky to be there while a service was taking place. The detail in the architecture is out of this world..",
          "Really nice cathedral, just a donation at the most to get in, very calm in there, with so many paintings & the like to see.",
          "No matter the time of year this Cathedral is worth a visit. Although the outside isn't as architecturally pleasing as some other buildings in Salzburg, the Baroque exterior is still imposing & the interior is beautiful, with the stunning high domed ceilings & beautiful art",
          "This is a mammoth overly elegant cathedral with its own art collection and 5 pipe organs. It seems outsized for such a small town.",
          "Beautiful building in the heart of Salzburg. The architecture is impressive and the ceiling decor pretty special. We\u2019ve been before but enjoyed a second visit. This time we took in the crypt and spent a little time in the silent prayer room.",
          "The cathedral may not impress you so much from the outside, but the art inside is gorgeous. Located in the old town, it is easily accessible and there is no fee for visiting. You can take photos as long as you don't disturb the others and don't use flash. Enjoy a quite moment in",
          "No visit to Salzburg is complete with a visit to this magnificent cathedral. After a good wander and dozens of photos we headed down to the crypt which is quite lovely. Also there is a spooky art installation Vanitas by Christian Boltansky. A little hard to describe, but it is a",
          "When travelling to Salzburg, you must visit the \"Domplatz\". Placed directly in the old town of Salzburg, it's the \"heart\" of the city. The peaks are for sure the \"Jedermann\" during Salzburg Festival in summer, \"Rupertikirtag\" in autumn and \"christkindlmarkt\" just before",
          "It\u2019s very near to the fortress. Definitely a must visit site with such beautiful interior design and structure.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral, well worth a visit even to just check out the ceilings! There is no charge but a donation is expected",
          "Get to this site early to avoid the crowds of large parties trudging round and spoiling the atmosphere. There is a one way system with areas roped off. The scruffy state of the seats is a disgrace to this historic religious building.",
          "So many things to see honestly you could spend the whole day. I wish we would have had more time to explore.",
          "Thought this was an absolutely beautiful spot: it is one of the larger cathedrals I have personally been inside of, but was blown away by the details of the carvings and interior design everywhere, as well as the paintings. The service was hauntingly beautiful, though if you go",
          "The cathedral was dark but displayed many wonderful artifacts. The walk through was easy. A nice view of the altar. The view from outside is nice because you can get the entire cathedral in a photo since it is at one end of the square,",
          "One of the most impressive churches I ever visited, in Baroc style, it is massive, it is huge, but it is also full of light... seems to be... elastic, in the good sens.",
          "A great place to visit with excellent acces to most parts of the Cathedral. Architecture is incredible with beautiful ceilings.",
          "The cathedral wasn't one of our 'must-sees' in Salzburg but as the fantastic Christmas Market was right by the cathedral we thought we might as well pop in. It's worth a walk around but we didn't stay long. It's incredibly dark inside...",
          "Spectacular inside and out and easy to understand how it was possible for the church to have such power. Make sure you go downstairs and enjoy the newer areas of the building.",
          "The cathedral is one of Salzburg\u2019s most important sacred buildings dominating the city's skyline , this cathedral contains many relics and other ecclesiastical treasures.",
          "What can I say about this beautiful place besides it\u2019s amazing and if your in Salzburg then go. The Dom itself is free but a small donation can be made to the attendant at the entrance.",
          "Beautiful both outside as well as inside. Very calm and impressive interior with good seating. Especially liked the numerous old organs. Unfoubtedly worth a visit.",
          "If you visit this city you have to see the cathedral from inside. (It\u2019s for free!) It\u2018s the epicenter of Salzburg. Don\u2018t miss the stairs to the catacombs!",
          "No photography allowed which is a shame but it should be respected. It\u2019s a beautiful cathedral, as one might expect, and is free entry, although they ask for a donation upon exit.",
          "But this is a spectacular example of the Catholic Faith and worth taking the time to quietly admire. A donation is asked for entry. Candles are available (for a fee) to light and there is a crypt. The stunning organs and decorations are breathtaking. But there is also a museum",
          "The Salzburg Cathedral dates back to the 700s when one of its patrons, Virgil, consecrated the first building on the site. After destruction by fire, it was rebuilt in baroque style. It was also restored extensively after WWII. The present structure was completed in 1959.",
          "Very impressive, as with all monuments and buildings off the period we were impressed by the details and amount of work put into the building.",
          "Made a quick visit to Dome and the cathedral is absolutely stunning, inside and out. Would highly recommend one visit while in Salzburg.",
          "Our boys are not big fans of ecclesiastical architecture so we didn\u2019t have long here, but if you\u2019re an aficionado of such buildings this is a wonderful example. Built off the wealth created by the Archbishop rulers of Salzburg it\u2019s an immense testament to the conjunction of",
          "A lifetime memory. Have been to gorgeous churches/ cathedrals in Italy, Russia, London, as well as US....none are more impressive. Went to midnight Christmas Eve mass. Packed and overflowing. The music was incredible, aided so by acustics that are second to none. A must visit.",

          "A highlight of the beautiful city of Salzburg- we visited during the Advent or Christmas market. The cathedral is beautiful and if your lucky (like us) you can experience the majestic organ during practice or even during a mass. We sat in a pew just to soak it all in. Very",
          "The cathedral on the outside looked very nice , but the inside was amazing and you could get up close to take some great pictures. They had lots of literature to purchase that explains a lot about the Cathedral. But the best I thought was the singing by the small choir just",
          "A very big and quite warm church that is a pleasure to visit. People are guided to go around in a circle and it helped with all that were present as everyone was quiet and could look and see the magnificent wall hangings. Very easy to visit.",
          "We attended the service on Christmas Day. It was very encouraging to see that the cathedral was completely full. We don\u2019t speak German, but the music was beautiful. It was a special day and I recommend going to visit.",

          "We went in after the sun had set and it made it even more magical. Beautiful. We loved the architecture and the art.",
          "I always enjoy walking in this enormous inspiring church. At Christmas you can enjoy choral programs in its wonderful surroundings. They crypt is also worth a visit. In addition to housing various archbishops it is done so that you see the original construction of the church,",
          "We attended Mass and heard phenomenal music...the sights and sounds are incomparable! Had a chance to practice my German understanding as well. We were in and out of the cathedral all week, for church, for music, and just for a rest. It's the most beautiful church, and each",

          "...but it is worth a visit nevertheless, as there are many interesting areas that do not become apparent until you are actually inside and walking around. Not the most \"showy\" of places, but quite interesting. The exterior is wonderful, and possibly the best bit of the",
          "The interior of the Salzburg cathedral is incredibly beautiful. The paintings on the walls and ceilings took me quite a bit of time to really examine. I find all the churches in Germany and Austria to be quite beautiful and serene. Although I\u2019m not Catholic I enjoy sitting in",
          "The Cathedral is stunning and different to the churches, as it is Roman in style and less Baroque. Very imposing inside and out. Once inside follow the route inside the building and don't miss the crypt. The nativity scene was one of the best I have seen - Mary and Joseph were",
          "The cathedral of Salzburg is as ornate as it is a wonder to behold. It is free entrance, though you are recommended to pay a donation which I would recommend. Photos are allowed inside, but no flash. I loved this experience and felt the spirituality flow through it. You don\u2019t",
          "A beautiful Cathedral and we were so lucky that the organ was being played while we were there. Wonderful",
          "This was where the winter market was held. The market was pretty good and this location is close to the spot where you get on the trolley to go to the mountain. The church is nice to look at, but a lot of it I'd blocked off walking wise.",

          "If you love going to see churches, then this is another fine example. Great building to sit in and admire.",
          "Other reviewers may have a better insight to this religious site as I had very little time here. I can say for certain if you like older buildings in the baroque style, you should at least pass inside for a few minutes. The architecture and history here are both amazing.",
          "Although founded in 774 AD, the Cathedral of Saints Rupert and Vergilius seen today is a Baroque Roman Catholic Catherdral built betwwen 1614-1628 AD. It's fresh appearance, especially the west facade, is the result of a 1959 restoration effort.",
          "I am not a fan of the Baroque: it gives me the horrors. However, if this is your thing then it has all the features you would expect. The highlight was the font where both Mozart and the Silent Night composer were baptised.",

          "I was very impressed with the Cathedral - it's a huge place but doesn't seem to project the aloofness quite common in such buildings. I'm not a religious person but I did feel very comfortable here in this splendid, but not ostentatious edifice. I visited two or three times",
          "Beautiful cathedral. The ceiling was impressive. Lots to see. Very busy, many tourists as you would expect.",

          "This was the first Cathedral we visited in our tour. It is very beautiful with its stunning & unique decors. Interior is very bright & has an airy nice feel - unlike the many other Cathedrals that we visited after this - in the other cities. The rest are all very dark inside,",
          "Unmissable! Extremely cared for, the images seem to have \"life\". Despite its (large) dimension, attention to detail is notorious for making this space a reference",
          "This is a gorgeous, ornate Cathedral. We attended high Mass at 10:00, but there are other types of worship services to choose from. We had also wandered around it the day before. Worth a stop in, and if you can fit a service into your time schedule, you won\u2019t be disappointed.",
          "The cathedral is gorgeous! The ceilings are stunning, as are all the carvings. Truly felt like I stepped back in time. No pictures allowed, which is fine by me since it\u2019s a holy place. All they ask for is a small donation when exiting. Just beautiful.",

          "After hitting almost all the churches and cathedrals I see when in Europe, I was not expecting to be impressed by the Salzburg Cathedral, but... you guessed it! It was beautiful, and very large. Prayed for awhile, asked God to bring a revival of Faith to Europe, and enjoyed",
          "I never tire of cathedrals, each one is different and beautiful, and this one has stunning architecture and art. Of special interest here are the 4 organs mounted on the wall. Surround sound in the 1700s! We also liked seeing Mozart's baptismal fount (on the left as you",
          "I love visiting all the cathedrals in Europe. This one was not disappointing. There is so much beauty within.",
          "We went here as a must do during the day in Saltzburg. As churches go I have seen better York Minster , Westminster Abbey, St Peters at Rome etc, this is not to say it is not an impressive building. It isn't over large so doesn't need a long time to look around. If your only in",
          "The church is being beautifully renovated with the church interior being white. The mouldings, sculptures were beautiful.",

          "Salzburg has several beautiful churches and this is one of the better ones - if you like beautiful churches this one is well worth a visit.",
          "My mantra when in Europe- never let a cathedral go by. You just never know what you'll find inside any cathedral, or church for that matter. Sometimes the less the grandeur on the outside, the more startling inside. This cathedral I only saw from the front entrance- the black",
          "The inside is much more impressive that the exterior. Beautiful artwork covers the ceiling and walls. The organ was very impressive. The plaza was a nice place the sit and have lunch and watch the people passing by.",
          "If you only have time to visit a Cathedral in Salzburg, you may want to consider visiting this. However, as it is a popular site for tourist, hence it is almost always crowded at all time. The Cathedral is very near the Mozart Square where you can go for an ice skating (in",

          "There is so much history about this location. This is a nice visit to learn the effects of war onto it and its people.",
          "Entrance was included on our Salzburg card. Our family walked in, walked around the entire cathedral and we stopped at the front alter to read the details out of a guide book. Very impressive!",
          "The interior is worth seeing, but don't plan on sitting since nearly all the chairs are roped off. Usually we sit for a while in European churches to absorb the ambiance, but this cathedral is not conducive to doing that.",
          "No pictures allowed but peeps were snapping away. I believe this is the church featured in TSOM wedding scene. Some small renovation going on but did not detract from our experience. Gorgeous place.",
          "visited for two days in august and the cathedral was one of our first stop off points, wonderful architecture and well worth a visit both inside and out",
          "Visited many times and will always go back. Beautiful, grandiose architecture with a cooling mood in summer. Lunchtime concerts by the New English Orchestra were the highlights. Also worth going to the Residenz where you can access the upper levels through an amazing balcony",
          "Usual impressive religious building lot of money has been spent over the years but if like me you tour a lot, then one impressive building is much like another",
          "It is a dominant building except the castle. Interesting interior. Good to have a look inside. Nice to visit.",
          "Made even more amazing by being able to attend Sunday Mass at the Dom. Not to be missed whether or not you look to attend Mass. That said, please be respectful of the rule not to visit (tour and photograph) while Mass is being celebrated.",
          "I visited here on a recent trip around Austria.From outside it is a large imposing building with copper? domes. It is well preserved and super impressive on the inside. There was a choir singing inside when I visited and the sound from the high domed ceilings is awesome. Entry",

          "We stopped at the Salzburg Cathedral on our way to Hohensalzburg. This Cathedral was built around the 17th century and has a beautiful Baroque style. Seems like this is Serge's idea of most beautiful church he's visited in Europe. You will find the Cathedral in the Old Town",

          "After visiting Rome a few years ago I thought I was done with cathedrals and churches but this was a fabulous space to visit. The burial place of many archbishop princes and a fine example of neoclassical architecture. The white marble is Preston\u2019s and the frescos are",

          "Stumbled across this site after attending a 5pm concert, the Dom Residence stays open til 8. Beautifully prepared self guided",
          "The entire Dom square is worth exploring. The Catedral itself is grand and very lovely. Art fans will enjoy the detail!",
          "Another beautifully made cathedral but there was very little light in there and it would have been lovely to see the light shine through the windows, however we did visit after 5pm so maybe the sun wasn\u2019t in the right place anymore. Very quiet and peaceful.",
          "Amazing interior. There were organs in each corner and the artwork was outstanding. You could almost imagine the history that was represented and the historical figures who walked the corridors and played the organs. Well worth visiting.",
          "Five organs! Beautiful decorations! A historical home-base for the work of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. When the bells ring, I recommend you stand still in one of the platz and take in the sound and vibration. It's an other-worldly experience. If you're lucky enough to be inside the",

          "The simple beauty of the exterior of the Salzburg Cathedral didn't quite prepare us for the magnificence and exquisiteness inside. We visited it on our own in the free hour of a guided tour. Astonishing! Such spaciousness and proportion truly fit for the King of Kings, for",
          "What a building full of character and spirituality right in heart of old city area. Wonderful building worth a visit",
          "The early 1600s cathedral is beautiful, so light and bright inside. Make sure to see all five of the organs and note the dome, which was destroyed by a bomb in WWII and subsequently rebuilt. Photos near the entrance show the damage.",

          "The Salzburg Cathedral is a must see in Salzburg. Absolutely beautiful place to see and should not be missed while in the city. While it was extremely crowded during our visit (as it is a popular place to see) part of the reason was because it was pouring rain outside. Don't",
          "Yes the Architecture inside is stunning. Nice to sit in a Pew and slowly take it all in. It was a rainy day for us, but this brighten up our day. Would have loved to hear the Organs playing, a choir as well would have been the icing on the Cake. Many Photo's in other Reviews, so",
          "Be sure and take some time to visit the Salzburg Cathedral. It is a large, lovely structure, the current Baroque-style building dates from 17th century. Among many claims to fame, the composer Mozart was baptized here in 1756.",

          "We decided to attend the 10am mass while we were there. the service was in German so didn't understand a lot. But the choir was outstanding and just being able to attend a mass in Salzburg was worth the visit.",

          "The cathedral itself is beautiful (be sure to see the crypts below), but for the full experience use your visitor\u2019s card or pay for the museum tours. I say tours because there are actually 5 museums in the complex with an excellent audio accompaniment. They provide an",

          "While many of the cathedrals of Europe are spectacular, this one is truly in a class all its own. I wandered in here late in the evening and it was very dark...which made it all the more otherworldly and atmospheric. Although I am certain it is equally...if not more...majestic",
          "This was my first time in Austria. Salzburg is an incredible city where history and culture is ever present for all to see. The Salzburg Cathedral is amazing. I have never seen anything like it before. Multiple alters that are breath taking, the ceilings are amazingly adorned",

          "We gazed at the magnificant cathederal in awe. It certainly makes you feel humble and think of the important things in life.How did they build it?",
          "Largest Cathedral in Salzburg I believe. It would have been great to have seen a service there and listen to the Organ being played. Even though it was raining there was a fair amount of people there. Salzburg is a city of only 150,000 and with fantastic places to see and visit.",
          "Visited in midwinter when this the cathedral is central to the square of Christmas Markets. Didn't see as much as would have liked as a service going on when visited but worth a look inside if you like cathedrals.",

          "We only went to the cathedral to get out of the rain. We had avoided it because it was always so busy but once inside it is easy to understand why it is so popular. The building and the artwork is to be marveled at. Reflect on how old it all is and how it was done without",

        "wiki": "Mozart's birthplace (German: Mozarts Geburtshaus or Hagenauerhaus) was the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at No. 9 Getreidegasse in Salzburg, Austria. The Mozart family resided on the third floor from 1747 to 1773. Mozart himself was born here on 27 January 1756. He was the seventh child of Leopold Mozart, who was a musician of the Salzburg Royal Chamber.Now a museum, Mozart's birthplace introduces visitors to the early life of the composer, his first musical instruments, his friends, and his passionate interest in opera. The third floor exhibits Mozart's childhood violin as well as portraits, documents, and early editions of his music, and the second floor is devoted to Mozart's interest in opera and includes the clavichord on which he composed The Magic Flute. The structure is owned by the Mozart Foundation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe house was built in the 12th century on ground which had been part of the garden belonging to the Benedictine monks of St Peter's, Salzburg. Otto Keutzel, a merchant, is mentioned as the owner in 1408 while Chunrad Fr\u00f6schmoser, the court apothecary, purchased the property in 1585. On the doorway, the coiled serpent in the lion's mouth, the symbol of Asclepius, still testifies to his ownership. In 1703, the house came into the ownership of the Hagenauer family who had arrived in Salzburg around 1670. Specifically they included Joseph Matin Hagenauer and Johann Laurenz Hagenauer who became Mozart's landlord.After marrying Anna Maria Pertl on 21 November 1747, Leopold Mozart rented the apartment on the third floor which consisted of a kitchen, a small cabinet, a living-room, a bedroom and an office. It was their residence until 1773 and their seven children were born here; only two, Maria Anna and Wolfgang Amadeus, survived. Leopold Mozart was in constant touch through letters with his landlord during the Mozart family grand tour between 1763 and 1766; he moved out of the premises in 1773.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nA museum since 1880, Mozart's birthplace introduces visitors to the early life of the composer, his first musical instruments, his friends and his passionate interest in opera. The third floor exhibits Mozart's childhood violin, harpsichord, as well as portraits, documents, family letters, and early editions of his music. There are also records of his life in Vienna and of his wife and family. The second floor is devoted to Mozart's interest in opera and includes the clavichord on which he composed The Magic Flute. The first floor replicates living conditions in Mozart's day with period furniture. Original documents and paintings illustrate his life in Salzburg. Other items in the museum are an incomplete portrait of Mozart painted by Joseph Lange, his brother-in-law in 1789 (one of Mozart's striking portraits), pictures of his childhood, and his childhood violin.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of music museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliographyConte, Joseph J.

          "It was just a humbling experience to see the birthplace of such an historic composure. It's a good place to see once you in Salzburg",
          "The throngs of tourists brandishing iPhones outside the building was enough to put us off. Not worth the scrum. Amusing though that there is a small Spar supermarket on the ground floor. Mozart would have been amused. I would avoid this and other heaving tourist sights as",
          "This is one of the most visited place in Salzburg for the obvious reason. They have made it as a museum for people who want to know more and the tickets can be purchased right at the entrance. The yellow color building is hard to miss and is very easy to spot.",
          "Was a nice visit with many items used and owned by Mozart and his family. Great collection with lots of historic information. Showed the instrument used by Mozart in creating some of his most popular works. Was much better than the Mozart Residence museum which had no personal",
          "Nice to visit and read the history of Mozart and his family and growing up. Well worth and it doesnt take long time to walk around in the house.",
          "As an admirer of Mozart's compositions, this place enchanted me. I definitely want to be there again",
          "I really enjoyed this place - but I also love Mozart. It was well thought-out with good information and flow. If you're not a huge Mozart fan, it's probably not worthwhile. However, you can go through it quickly or slowly - I probably spent 45min in there and got a lot out of it.",
          "Unless you are really into Mozart, this would take 10 minutes of your time. And just like any museum, you see a few artifacts and then you will be out.",
          "Beware that the apartment where he lived was several flights up stairs. Did not see an elevator. It is worth a visit just for the historic value.",
          "Very nice small museum filled with alot of information on Mozart and his family. Nicely located. In the Old Towne area.",
          "This is a must do attraction in Salzburg. It's interesting but over rated. There are no audio guides but instead you're invited to download a tour guide on your smart phone. Once you've done that you discover there is still no audio guide and the content is no different from",
          "The home Mozart was born in is located on one of the prettiest streets in Salzburg. It\u2019s a nice home even by today\u2019s standards. There are numerous Mozart music sheets, some instruments and personal items. Definitely worth the visit",
          "Great history on his family . No furniture but interesting facts . Very warm inside . If you are studying Mozart this is a good start . You need tickets and there is a clean wc inside .",
          "So you are in Salzburg, you know that place that Mozart is from. So this is the house he was born in, so you go. Tick it off the list. But really there simply isn\u2019t much there. Limited artifacts of questionable providence. Looks like a lot of copies of Mozart things. And",
          "Fascinating museum dedicated to the life of one of the greatest composers ever. A child genius born into a musical family who was able to play the piano and violin at an age when most modern children would\u2019ve just started school. In later life he was nothing short of a",
          "I knew very little about Mozart before we went to the birthplace but this tour fixed that. The actual Mozart apartment is small but the museum uses the whole building for displays. All of the displays are in English as well as German. The museum is very well done and worth the",
          "Mozart's dad was evidently well heeled. It is a big third-floor apartment in the heart of the old town. Plenty of Mozart memorabilia and - I hate to say this - a pretty good gift shop on the way out. Not the most remarkable historic monument but worth dropping by if you have",
          "This was a walk-by visit for us. A yellow building on a busy, touristy street with a plaque on it is about all there is from the street. But, it's an important place in cultural history and it's nice to say, \"I've been there.\"",
          "This is situated in the old Town , pedestrianised,hence we walked from our hotel Imlauer and Brau,in Rainerstasse and after a short walk we reached The Mozart Geburtshaus. The composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born here in Salzburg in 1756 and now his birthplace has been",
          "Been visiting this place hoping to see some funny day to day story of Mozart or the backstories of his works. This museum turns out to be more about the stuffs owned by Mozart. The personal letters are a nice touch but overall not very attractive to me. Maybe someone who likes",
          "I did not go inside. Just visited from outside. Very close to other attraction so you can squeeze in if you don't want to go inside.",
          "Very interesting house and displays. It shows a lot about his family. Learn about his dotting mother, the strict father and his loving and brilliant sister. Great exhibits, especially his starter violin. And of course the strands of his hair! On my next visit I want to filch a",
          "I was disappointed with the fact many of the exhibits were not the real deal, why can\u2019t you take a picture of the print of Mozart? I feel it was a bit of a rip off considering how little there is actually to see about Mozart. Surprisingly there was little information about his",
          "This place will attract those who love music and history behind it. It is very much inside old city market area so need no special preparation to go there.",
          "A lot of Japanise & Chinese tourists, but really an interesting place to visit in Salzburg. My advice: don't choose the North See fast-food restaurant nearby. The staff is not friendly, the place is dirty and there is too much crowd!",
          "People traveling to Salzburg must see this; it's super iconic. Period. There is an entrance fee involved to see the house where the genius lived and spent his life. The whole house with all its rooms and artifacts has been converted into a museum. It might get hot and stuffy",
          "Mozart was born in Salzburg and moved when he was 9 years old. The house is seen from the street. I didn't go to the museum as it was expensive.",
          "The performers were excellent. The food was surprisingly very good (I had not expected that). It was a lovely, very pleasant evening. And a nice way to incorporate some Mozart into our trip.",
          "I expected more than a few paintings and very quiet music (in one room only). For the entrance fee I expected far more but very, very disappointed. I'd have been better with a short guidebook and a cd or download.",
          "got the salzburg card so the entry was included. good place to visit if you want to know more about mozart. interesting place to see and there's a lot of information on how he grew up and the people he grew up around. great place to learn more about mozart's life. it is a little",
          "Lots to see and read about the history of Mozart and his family, their time in Salzburg, Vienna and on their tours of Europe. The house is a fine structure but has a SPAR store in it for some reason. The experience is massively ruined by a totally nonsensical and pathetic no",
          "A typical tourist trap. Crowded, warm and lots of kids running around. The most interesting was to read the original letters. The paintings could have been of anyone since everyone was painted in the same way at that time. Costs 11 euro, not worth the money or the time.",
          "The museum has original items from Mozart\u2019s time. It tells you a lot about the Mozart family, how they lived and how his widow lived after Mozart\u2019s death. There is an app which you can download with descriptions. We spent about 20mins trying to get it to work on both an android",
          "Sorry but it's really nothing special, Diane & I visited as part of an excellent walking tour organised by National Holidays. Our Guide Naomi proved witty & knowledgeable but this wasn't sufficient to convince us of a return visit. If in Salzburg I guess you simply have to visit",
          "I am not musically inclined and rarely listen to classical music, but I do enjoy history. There was a good amount of that in this museum, which did focus on Mozart, and his parents and sister. The only room air-conditioned was the gift shop and it was pretty crowded with some",
          "If you're a fan of Mozart you should definitely visit his birthplace.The exhibits in this museum are an informative overview of Mozart's life with a combination of authentic artifacts and replicas. You'll need to spend time reading carefully to get all of the details. It was",
          "Let\u2019s face it: there\u2019s something inherently cool about visiting the homes of creative geniuses. Mozart was obviously such a person but you also learn here that his father Leopold had much to do with promoting his son\u2019s abilities and getting him recognized. You cannot visit",
          "Good, well-rounded exhibit of Mozart's upbringing, family and personal life. Interesting and informative, although not loads of original artifacts. If you're seeing a few things in Salzburg, definitely get a 'Salzburg card'... It pays for itself in a short time and is really",
          "Must say we have been many times to Salzburg and never tire of such a beautiful city...the stuff dreams are made of.Worth visiting his haus but the whole street is full of major shops worth looking into.Also walk to the end.......because the cafe Tomacelli is just superb. Try to",
          "We had heard a lot about Mozart and we were looking forward to visit this place but unfortunately we could not see it. First time when we went, it was closed being Sunday. Next day when we tried again it was very crowded and there was a big queue to go go upstairs so we decided",
          "Awful place. Rammed full and pretty dull. More interest in the cafe. The building is basically a trap but there is a Spar underneath. Classy.",
          "Good for die hard Mozart fans but very repetitive from the other Mozart residence in Austria. Still nice to see.",
          "Wanted to learn more about the musical genius, but quite a lot of the museum artefacts were either copies of original letters/scores that are kept elsewhere, or were a bit 'generic' and although of Mozart's time, were but necessarily objects owned by him. Enjoyable, but could",
          "A little crowded in spots. Lots of information about the Mozart family. Interesting letters and original pictures. Great history of the time period until he moved to Vienna.",
          "It\u2019s a interesting place located in the Salzburg Old town. Yellow color building. It\u2019s easy to find it. If you got Salzburg card, you may free to entry. If your budget is limited, you may skip this site because there was much genuine Mozart items inside this place.",
          "Nicely done audio guided tour. However talks most abt Leopold Mozart than w Mozart. But must visit if you in Salzburg",
          "This museum was offered as a combo ticket with the Mozart residence across the river. We visited this museum second. When we arrived at around 11am the museum was very busy and filled with people on a tour (we assumed they were on a day trip from another city). It definitely",
          "Give it a break guys this is the birthplace of a genius and was his modest home ... a first floor one-bed flat ... not a full blown museum. OK there wasn't masses of stuff to see but all of it was quality like his first violin/lock of hair/musical scores etc. Give it a go",
          "You come all the way to Salzburg and you wouldn`t go up the stairs to see where Mozart was born? afterall Salzburg is all about Mozart and Sound of Music. I stayed 4 doors up from the building, and the first thing I did when I arrived was to go and see his house, I can see lots",
          "Among the beautiful cobbled streets and endless shops, lies a beautiful yellow building, it may not have been this colour back in the day, but someone who wrote and composed such music was to be born there and boy, he was a gifted composer. Mozart, with his white wig.",
          "Overcrowded hot and humid. Not worth the money even if you are a fan of Mozart. Should be better maintenance.",
          "Really poor exhibition and not treated as a professional exhibition. Money that you pay is not worth it at all. I don't recommend to go here unless you have the Salzbury City Card because it includes this attraction, otherwise please do not pay to go here.",
          "We visited this museum on our honeymoon. It was a perfect amount of information, and we completed it in about one hour. Everything was very informative, and it was very neat to be in the place where Mozart was born.",
          "Always crowded any time you pass by it. It's a must though if a fan of Mozart. If not, then I guess just go to the grocery store in the ground floor!",
          "The same is placed in a small sqaure , nothing much facinating except its historical values . You can see the same while strolling around the shopping area",
          "We liked this place, our daughter plays the violin and she wanted to visit here. The museum is nice but personally I think it's a little silent - I would welcome at least some of Mozart's music playing silently in each room.",
          "Oh dear, so sad to see Mozart's birth place is now a Spar shop! There is also a museum to the side that we didn't visit today.",
          "I have been to Salzburg three times, the first time 23 years ago and last time 10 years ago. I have always ignored Mozart\u2019s Birthplace before and, after today\u2019s visit, I regret not having been here before. It is terrific. A great display of Mozart\u2019s life and interesting facts",
          "Wolfgang was born here, but the museum is much more about his father Leopold. Amazing man since he taught both Wolfgang and his sister equally in becoming musicians. Remarkable since women were not considered as worthy talent in those days. He was also instrumental in",
          "Every art lover should have this experience to breath the same smell of this 18th Century house that is full of memories of a genius... All building is preserved almost as it is and even though there are not fully the exact furnitures that Mozart family had used in that place,",
          "In our recent Balkans trip, Salzburg was one of the several cities to visit in the itinerary and so it was good to be back here again after 3 years! (please check out my other reviews about Salzburg here too) And for visitors to Salzburg, regardless if you are a fan of Mozart",
          "This may be a 4 star attraction for fans of Mozart but for others I give you permission to skip this if you aren't feeling it. I will admit that we went at the end of the long day so we could check the box so perhaps not in the right frame of mind to enjoy. It was hot and",
          "Let\u2019s face the truth, TMHO this place is a big missing... it is important to pay homage to the genius composer and visit the place. You can even read some interesting info there. But, I would expect more from. Place like this. At least some music...",
          "We visited Mozart's Birthplace in April 2019. The museum does a nice job with their displays and information was in English which helped.",
          "The place is located in the middle of the old city and its actual an apartment. Very few items of the great classical music composer donations of his relatives A place you can skip if you are not in to classic music",
          "We didn\u2019t think this was too interesting. A little expensive for admission considering what we saw. It\u2019s skippable.",
          "This short visit to Mozart's birthplace and his statue, remind me of this great musician. During this visit, we learned more about Mozart early life and his family. We willingly paid our respect to this great musician as he had contributed so much to the world of music.",
          "During a day trip to Salzburg we just had to visit the birthplace of Mozart and discover the facts surrounding this amazing Musician. We were not disappointed as the place was steeped in memorabilia and details of his great works. It is definitely worth a visit for music lovers.",
          "I like classical music but not a huge fan of Mozart. But being on a tour we received his story and it was worth visiting. What a music genius and at a very young age.",
          "I am a huge Mozart fan, so I had to pay my respects. We got there too late to go in, but enjoyed watching all the other Mozart admirers look at the front of the house and take selfies, etc. It was in the process of watching tourists from all over the world, that I realized the",
          "For Mozart's fans (I'm one of the fans), this is a MUST place to visit. So many an interesting stories, ideas, documents, artifacts etc that you could see. Mozart's family actually lived here for 26 years, from 1747 on, occupying an apartment on the third floor. The famous",
          "The whole experience was surreal to me. I am not a classical music lover but it was interesting to know about Mozart's family and his life. It was a self-guided tour and I had to download the app and I could read all the information about him. Good thing that the write-up are in",
          "If you bought a Salzburg Pass you must stop here to get some background on the most famous son of this city. I liked the fact that the tour was self guided and the exhibits were in english as well as german. There are a lot of steps here and the place was not air conditioned",
          "The entry tickets were reasonably priced and the display was well kept and easy to follow. Really enjoyed learning about Mozart and his family. Worth a visit.",
          "An interesting stop with lots of facts about him I didn't know. If you're downtown this is well worth your time. Genius doesn't say it all. The only drawback is lots and lots of stairs.",
          "An outrageously expensive place, that offers basically nothing. A really old-fashioned kind of a museum only for the people who are really into mozart and his history.",
          "if you are a mozart lover or even if you are new to mozart this is the place to start from...a lovely birth house of mozart turned museum. very well organized. as you go on this walk tour you really get into mozart's life. so much to know. it is a very friendly tour you can do",
          "This is where Wolfgang Mozart was born and spent some of his early childhood with his family. The house or rather what we'd now call an apartment is a a small museum and to be honest there really much to see. Even though I paid the combined \u20ac18 tickert for this and the Mozart",
          "It is a very nice city to visit. You can go by from Vienna. You can visit his birthplace place. Also the principal plaza has lots of good stores and restaurant that you can have a really good lunch.Also I found very cute places to stop for a glass of champagne and continue",
          "I enjoyed the visit to Mozart's birthplace, but certainly understand why it is not worthy the visit for people with less interest in classical music. It is a very small place and a quick walk-by and photograph will be enough for many visitors. The 11 euro entrance fee is not",
          "The house where Mozart was born has a special atmosphere. You will visit the room in the third floor of this building, the exact room where he was born.The house is localized in a pedestrian street in the Old Town of Salzburg.",
          "I went in using my Salzburg pass, and glad that I didn\u2019t pay the individual ticket. Like most parts of Salzburg, it\u2019s highly commercialized to take advantage of tourists. This place was poorly maintained, super humid and hot, and you cannot take pictures or videos\u2014probably so",
          "Very interesting place to visit and see the place where Mozart grew up. The house is well taken care of but be prepared for a self tour as the staff are very unprofessional and didn't want to help at all. There are no elevators with lots of stairs so this is not",
          "This museum showcases the life of Mozart, from his childhood to his death. The entire house in general is beautiful and each individual room has information and lots of artifacts from Mozart's time. This museum has enough information to keep even clueless people interested. For",
          "Story of Mozart, musical composer genius who died poor, but best known composer in Vienna. He died at age 35, but most productive composer. We saw his birthplace and all the places where mozart was being use, especially his chocolate and his statue. Salzburg is famous because of",
          "Peace of artwork. So beautiful \ud83d\ude0d you can see inside it all the rooms and there is museum inside it and souvenir shop and you can have the information about the life of Mozart . I highly recommend this place to visit",
          "Mozarts Birthplace Museum is right smack in the middle of the Old Town of Salzburg. You cant miss it for 2 reasons. 1. It is the most brightly painted building once you enter the Town. Bright cheery yellow. 2. You will not be alone as there will be many tourists and visitors",
          "The other Mozart Museum which was his apartment, is not as interesting as the museum where he was born. There's a lot more to see hear and all very interesting and worthwhile. I enjoyed the small room where you can experience the amazing sound with two small speakers pointed",
          "A must do when in Salzburg. The exhibits were well done and we saw a lot in the 45 minutes we were there.",
          "Informative landmark site with a number of genuine artifacts. Visitors will learn details of his life while exploring the original family home. It's a pretty short visit, maybe 45 minutes. If you are visiting the area, definitely make a pilgrimage over. They are pretty",
          "Used our Salzburg Card and found this very interesting although I knew very little of Mozart before. We are glad that we took the time to visit.",
          "Not the biggest ever exhibition I have seen, but why have you visited Salzburg? Because of Mozart. Therefore birthplace and residence are must for you. Buy a combine ticket or Salzburg card.",
          "We went here for a short time before our visit of a classic concert in the Mirabell Palace. You really get a good impression of Mozart, his life and the life during this period of time. Great place for a short visit.",
          "There is so much information crammed into 2 levels. Quite interesting but not sure I would have paid 11 euro if I didn't have a Salzburg card. There is so much written information, you need heaps of time if you want to read the lot...I can only read and take in so much before",
          "Small but interesting museum. I learnt a lot about Mozart and his family. Wouldn\u2019t recommend for young children.",
          "We viewed the birthplace of Mozart from the outside quite awed by the thought such musical talent was born at this place.",
          "What a beautiful place. Pity for Spar below. However even Spar tried to blend in. You cannot go to Salzburg and not see this historic site.",
          "This is an excellent museum on Mozart which also talks about his parents, siblings, wife, and children. There were a number of paintings of Mozart and his sister. Next to the museum shop there was a whole section of miniature stage sets for his operas that were really",
          "The house is located along a beautiful street in Salzburg, just outside the Mirabelle Palace Gardens. For 11\u20ac a piece you expect more than looking at some books and pictures, mostly about the father, Leopold. There is a piano and Wolfgang\u2019s first violin but most disappointing",
          "Tons of info on M\u2019s family and background probably too much. Some nice pics worth doing if you get in free.",
          "Just nice to see and feels historic attaching Mozart, his home and the City of Salzburg all together, Everywhere in every souvenir store the presence of pride having this Great Man represent Salzburg is what you see. I loved the inexpensive little candy tins with reminders of",
          "Went here today with my wife. Very good value \u20ac11 for and adult. Interesting exhibits. Learnt a lot about Mozart\u2019s life. Died when he was only 35! And he spent 1/3 of his life travelling! Wouldn\u2019t be the biggest classical music fan but this is definitely a must if in Salzburg.",
          "I am a huge Mozart fan and it was great for me to be able to stand where he was born and where he lived. I enjoyed seeing his personal items and seeing original scores of music. The only reasons that I didn't rate it higher is because there is a lot more items that are",
          "I am glad we got to see the building. It was very busy with people taking photos. Our guide did not tell us we could go inside and none of us asked. It is on a lovely street that is open to pedestrians. From the review about the staff being rude maybe our guide knew",
          "Salzburg is all about Mozart and the birthplace visit was so informative and interesting and also one more chance to enjoy the genius's music.",
          "Although we were not able to access the building, it was still great to just absorb the feel of Salzburg and the surrounding area.",
          "The staff here was far and away the rudest and most unhelpful of any we had interacted with during our two week vacation to this region. (Particularly, the older woman at the ticket box office.) The Museum itself was just ok, there just wasn\u2019t enough of interest to look at or",
          "Mozart's birthplace building and and museum take up 3 floors of this building with an original score. Right in the heart of Old Town and shopping district. Very good!",
          "Visited while my wife shopped. It is a dreary old building with some artefacts and old pianos. You could learn as much from the internet and avoid a very poor quality museum. To become anything worth being called a tourist attraction is an insult \u2014 if you have missed this don\u2019t",
          "A good attraction with lots of information. It doesn't take too long to walk around, so a good one to fit in after an early morning flight or before an afternoon flight. Not too expensive to get in. Approx. 1-2hrs to walk around and read all the information. I wouldn't go again",
          "As a Mozart-fan it's interesting to see the room where he was born etc. In the museum you can also see his first violin, a lock of his hair, his wallet and other possesions.",
          "Right in the town center got a musical feel to the place and surrounding. Good musical souvenir tiny working model. Good attraction nearby walk-able or by bus, tram.",
          "Have to say, it took me and my daughter quite a while to find this place. When asking the locals only 1 out of 5 knew where it was?? Anyway, when we finally found it we couldn't get in, granted it was 6pm. But a local guide told me that they keep Mozarts music room window open",
          "A must see.....to imagine his life. Lines to get in were not bad in March..not sure in summer time. Can read about his family, see pictures and is quite interesting. Stirs may be difficult for some. Nice gift shop and in heart of old town. Loved it.",
          "there was lots of history here about Mozart including various letters , memorabilia and family history - if you have an interest in Mozarts classical music then you should definetely visit",
          "Beautiful old four storey building in one of the squares in the old city part. Below there are only shops left and tourists gather to sit and gaze at the yellow building.",
          "This was a nice surprise to see Motzart's house. When you see it, make sure you go to the market near by and and get the candy \" Motzart Balls \".",
          "This was just something we stumbled across. I actually would have walked right past without noticing it if it wasnt for a group of tourists pointing at it. Nothing special.",
          "It's one of Salzburg's biggest attractions, for sure. The more you are interested in history or about historic Salzburg, the more you'll enjoy it. Kids won't really take too much interest.",
          "It was really nice experience. Family history and some artifices from his life were well placed throughout the rooms. I especially liked the room where he was born. I cannot imagine not visiting this piece of history when in Salzburg. And although the house is not big there is a",
          "Interesting place to learn about Mozart. This is the place where he was born, there are other places to visit but we did not see them",
          "There are actually 2 Mozart\u2019s house. This is the house where he was born and there is another house where he lived later on as an adult. Salzburg is Mozart\u2019s birthplace so we felt we should at least visit one of his houses.",
          "Mozart ... a great artist, a lot of excitement to visit the place where he was born ... old furniture, pictures, memories of the childhood artist ... beautiful and very well maintained location ....",
          "One of the most important places is Mozart\u2019s birthplace . It\u2019s the kind of visit you can\u2019t miss. As everything in Wien , the house provides you an amazing \u201c visit to the past \u201c without being boring or massively long.",
          "It\u2019s not all bad as it was very interesting however the descriptions were very small typeface and hard to read. You would never know you were in the birth room other than it painted on the wall and that\u2019s it. It could be much better but worth the visit.",
          "Very worth a visit if you are a fan of Mozart but would be a little dull if you are not. Of the two Mozart museums I preferred this one.",
          "Can easily be missed if you're walking around enjoying the ambience, so thank you google maps. We didn't tour inside but if you know how significant the man was, then that'll be enough. Oh, and the yellowness will stay in your mind just in case you need to find it again without",
          "I don't know if this is something Mozart would appreciate but I guess his father and mother would. Mozart did not have a good experience living in Salzburg but the locals currentlyprofit from 21st century citizens loving his music. We are curious creatures for sure.",
          "Enjoyed every bit of the visit. Learned loads of its background and history. No pictures are allowed but worth the visit.",
          "A lovely maintained very old house in the middle of beautiful Salzburg. We love Mozart and his story is amazing, such an amazingly gifted composer who started at such a young age. I loved seeing his early handwritten notes and his little piano. It takes you back to his time when",
          "We went to Moazart\u2019s birthplace on our visit to Salzburg. This is a historical place which can be visited in Salzburg.",
          "Mozart was born on 27/1/1756 at No. 9 Getreidegasse in Salzburg, Austria. This is known as the \u201cHagenauer Haus\u201d. His family occupied a third floor apartment there from 1747 \u2013 1773. He was the 7th child of Leopold Mozart, a violinist with Salzburg\u2019s Royal Chamber Orchestra.",
          "There are no words that can describe this place. If you are a classical music fan, you will love it more. Go see it!",
          "That was so many Asian people there in a Sunday afternoon that was very difficult to make a picture ! But I got some ! Nothing special",
          "Walk the streets of old town. You cant miss the plaque with the information on. Then move on and enjoy tge rest of what this magical city has to offer",
          "Quite a small museum however has enough information about Mozart's life in Salzburg. The great help for me was the mobile application-guide \"Textguide Geburtshaus\", where information is provided about items in museum. It allowed me to get the better understanding about Mozart as",
          "So there we were walking around and all of a sudden I was like did that say what I though it said. Amazing that the birthplace of Wolfgang Mozart was before my country of origin.",
          "Thought the information and exhibits were well put together, concise yet descriptive, of Mozart\u2019s time in Salzburg and life in general. Loved seeing some of the items, instruments, and letters preserved from his time. Favorite part had to be where you could sit and listen to his",
          "As our reviewers note, this site is limited in what it offers. You are visiting the home in which Mozart was born. There are no roller coasters and no imax theater inside. Instead, you get to see the actual home of a legend. It is filled with interesting artifacts from his life,",
          "Coming to Mozart's hometown, it seemed almost obligatory to visit his birth house and his former residence. But be prepared to be disappointed. Both venues (which could be entered on a single slightly discounted ticket) are small and have little to show a casual visitor. There",
          "This museum tells you the history of the Mozart family and the history of the family name and then the legacy of the music. It has a good gift shop with themed chocolates and music boxes",
          "Great visit to see all the history really interesting visit and lots to see and experience. You can miss it as your looking at all the lovely buildings around it. Some great cafes behind this. Free entry with Salzburg card.",
          "Transports you to an era of Mozart. The passion and the talent can be seen born here. A must visit for all those keen on music and history too.",
          "Walked past here many times before we realised what it was! Lots of tourists outside taking pictures , there is a museum inside but we did not go in",
          "Expensive entrance fee but interesting place, even for us who are not Mozart or classical music fans. We were offered the two house combo but decided to do the birthplace only. Enjoyed the experience and interesting read learning the history of Mozart and his family. Recommend",
          "I really wanted to enjoy this more. It just seemed a bit dull and tired. Rather than a celebration of his life, it was flat and needed revamping.",
          "The museum was worth it to me. It provided a history of his life. One will have to read along the displays to appreciate the family history. I found the rooms to be well spaced and focused. NO Photos allowed. Too bad there were some nice displays that would have been nice to get",
          "Nice house in Salzburg. This is where Mozart was born. And grew up. Our guide said he was glad to c the back of Salzburg. It looks like Mozart lived above the tree at Spar.",
          "We found this to be really overrated and dull. Some interesting individual pieces and I did learn some things, however, the staff were incredibly rude and I felt like there were big gaps in the information provided. Wouldn't bother going unless you have some time to kill and",
          "Very interesting indeed, do recommend the family ticket to save some euros. It\u2019s a very interesting insight into Mozart\u2019s birthplace and his family history and some of the objects that remain from his days. It is always extremely crowded however it\u2019s worth the visit. They are",
          "My goodness.....Surely the dullest, most unimaginative museum I've ever visited. It's almost as if they don't have to do anything to encourage visitors as they will come anyway. Very empty inside, lots and lots and lots to read in cabinets of you're interested, many paintings &",
          "Great for Mozart fans! The Museum has wonderful exhibits.Guides are there to provide more information.",
          "This makes more sense than the other house (where Mozart\u2019s family lived): the exhibition has more of a chronological trajectory and it just felt clearer. But they are both well worth a visit - get the combined ticket.",
          "We visited here along with Mozart\u2019s house for free with the Salzburg card. Interesting exhibits including locks of Mozart\u2019s hair and a reconstruction of a kitchen of the time, lots of detail about the whole Mozart family. Was quite crowded and queues to get in, but well worth a",
          "Nicely preserved and organized structure and museum of Mozart's family home at the time of his birth. Interesting history and artifacts. I especially enjoyed learning about Mozart's mother, who played a significant role in his life (and who was left out of the film \"Amadeus\").",
          "They have turned his birthplace into a museum. It is done well. If you are not interested in Mozart, you will probably not find this interesting. The pass also allows you into the Mozart residence which is a larger museum, but I actually liked this one better.",
          "We did the combined tour of his birthplace and house audio tour. We went towards the end of the day so there wasn't that big of a crowd and we could go at our own speed. It was very informative but there was quite a bit of repetitive information in doing both.",
          "We visited this museum using the Salzburg Card (our admission was included) Very cool to see his birthplace and many of his toys/initial instruments. Also enjoyed learning about his talented sister who likely was just as talented but born before her time. Really enjoyed the",
          "When we were there I expected more, but maybe that is the problem. Expect little and you may be astounded.",
          "We really enjoyed visiting this museum. The information was good and well presented. It is a very casual museum with things from Mozart\u2019s family that are interesting. I recommend the visit.",
          "This apartment is where Mozart was born. It has no furniture and is all the history of his family, with various documents and trinkets from his life. It is a lot of reading but very interesting.",
          "The museum isn't as much of a \"Mozart's birth\" experience as it is an analysis of his parents and his life. I have always loved his music but getting a deeper look into his life has helped me look at it from a new perspective.",
          "I did not enter this sightseeing.A bit pricy. Lot of pictures outside. Shamefull that there is a Spar Super market at the Ground floor.",
          "So I wasn't expecting much but was oh so pleasantly surprized. Found out lots of interesting information about this complex man and his overlooked but talented family.",
          "I visited here with great anticipation and excitement. Standing outside Mozart\u2019s birthplace was a surreal moment. A lovely building steeped in history and our guide was very informative and gave us a lot of knowledge. It\u2019s a must see and do.",
          "Having bought the amazing value Salzburg Card, a visit to Mozart\u2019s birthplace was free entry. The story of arguably the most loved composer of all time and his family are literally written on the walls of the modest house he was born in. One or two pieces of furniture and",
          "Also known as Mozart Geburtshaus. Beginning life of Mozart was spent here. Free audio guide with English. Narrow house and walkway. You can go to Mozart Wohnhaus for information on the later years of Mozart' short life.",
          "I could have skipped it but my husband loved it cause he is a Mozart, music person. Mozarts house where he was born is worth a stop if you have the Salzburg card otherwise i would skip it. It was great information but nothing i haven\u2019t read online or in a history book about",
          "This a must see. Some great photos and stories. Well worth spending an hour here to learn about the great man and his family.",
          "I understand that it is \"a must\" for everybody visiting Salzburg (including myself) and - as it is located in the centre of the Old Town - the place is crowded, all the time. Therefore, it is good to be there, however I am not sure if it is necessary to visit the museum itself.",
          "This is in the heart of the old town. There is a lot to see, by way of portraits, scores and even photographs (Mrs Mozart lasted well into the age of photography as did the sons). There was lots of useful information and even features about operatic productions. I would",
          "Very nice museum. Can see everything is less than an hour. Best to do a little research before hand to get the most out of a visit. Mozart's sister was also a talented musician and neither of his two sons that survived infancy had any children. Museum is in the heart of the",
          "We stopped by the Mozart Birthplace while stolling along the tourist area in Salburg. Many people coming and going but nice to see while in the area.",
          "This place is amazing. It preserved beautifully all the memories of Mozart. Small kitchen, shoes, distinguished ear of Mozart. Family photograph, journey of Mozart through out Europe. One can listen Mozart music there. A small shop inside also sells Mozart music CDs. Tickets for",
          "Stairs to climb but worth the visit - right in the center of town with lots of exhibits of life during the time of Mozart",
          "We enjoyed seeing and reading about Mozart, his upbringing, musical genius, and family. The history and place is incredibly well looked after and well documented. Recommend!",
          "As a Mozart fan this is a must see! Right in the heart of the old town, lovely exhibition well thought out and focusing on the wider family",
          "I stopped at the birthplace of Mozart - a rather simple house from the outside as well as inside - the inside was rather plain - but the crowds are overwhelming, people from all around the word gather in front to take a picture - I took a picture from the first floor looking",
          "Weren't allowed inside...so had a look from the outside... Admisty a seemingly bustling marketplace...with huge variety of products...a simple place ...must see if you know how great mozart was..",
          "The Mozart Birthplace is in Salzburg's old town on Getreidegasse. This museum is on multiple floors and has a mix of static and audio / visual displays that address the Mozart family: WA Mozart, his parents, and wife Constanz. It is very informative and well worth the visit.",
          "I can see why they don't allow photos inside, they don't want people to know in advance how little is on display. The rooms are empty with information in cabinets that you can read online. A number of items were replicas which is a shame. I wouldn't recommend entry inside,",
          "Mozart\u2019s birthplace turned into a museum. Mozart (supposedly) was born in this third floor apartment back in the day. It\u2019s been turned into a museum that is nicely done and worth the time to walk through.",
          "Inside of the house you can back into history of one of the biggest Musicians that world knows. There are variety of theme that describes different parts of his life. The old pianos are remarkable. The living room was with well preserved furniture. In front of the house there is",
          "Very expensive, crowded, and mostly posters to read. The most interesting item was a small violin made especially for him. Skip it.",
          "Free to get in with the Salzburg card. If you are a Mozart lover lots of interesting exhibits and to imagine what is was like in his time.",
          "It was a quick review on mozarts life.i have learnt some things for the mozart family.i believe it can be better and bigger.i suggest though.",
          "All very good just misses out on the final point as I don\u2019t have the biggest interest in Mozart. Don\u2019t miss this when in Salzburg",
          "We only had 2 days in Salzburg but we thoroughly enjoyed this museum. Learned a lot, good atmosphere and a quick stop if you don\u2019t have a lot of time.",
          "If you love the music of Mozart you must visit Salzburg. Mozart was born there, marked by a yellow building in the shopping district. No one really knows what he looked like but was known for making unfiltered, candid remarks and not being very punctual. In fortunately he was",
          "Lovely stone paved roads and narrow streets. Pretty shops and restaurants. This door looks quaint. Old town Salzburg.",
          "This is a very interesting place to visit with tons posted to read about Mozart. There is an audio tour available if you want.",
          "Mozart's Birthplace is a heritage attraction in the heart of Salzburg. A \"must visit\" to learn about the life of one of the greatest musicians of all time.",
          "I am disappointed from it, nothing inside to visit to be honest it doesn\u2019t deserve the entrance ticket. Avoid it better",
          "Very interesting museum with loads of history on not just Mozart but his family as well. You'll find his sheet music and letters he wrote, all types of memorabilia. Good choice for an hour or so!",
          "Mozart's birthplace with detailed and accessible interpretation. The displays are attractive, but most important are the quality, depth and breadth of information about the composer's life and work. In addition to displays, there is a room where visitors are given access to",
          "You\u2019ll walk by Mozart\u2019s birthplace at least a few times in your stay. Check it out that way you\u2019ll see how people lived at that time and place. It\u2019s touristy but most people who go to Salzburg are tourist. I enjoyed the visit",
          "This place is worth a visit if you are fond of Mozart. Real Prodigy ..lots of items related to his life on exhibit. The app you can download for the tour is not worth it, it\u2019s just reading material for each item that allready has info regarding it posted. Kind of touristy.",
          "This is a house where Mozart was born in 1756. Today this is the most popular Mozart sight in town - for fans, it's almost a pilgrimage. Shuffling through with the crowds, you'll peruse three floors of rooms with exhibits displaying paintings, letters, personal items as well as",
          "For those who wish to learn more about this famous composer, this place gives an in-depth insight. Alot about this famous Mozart are here. Educational, inspiring.",
          "It was interesting but largely static exhibition. General lack of pieces of music. Oddly arranged. The stage designs saved it from a worse review. Amazed that they didn't make more of his music in each of the rooms- a basic chronological path would have helped. No Mozart music",
          "A major tourist experience in visiting this city. Its a simple structure but the culture and stories behind this attracts so many tourist from all over the world to this old town. Music transcend language and culture. We experience so many Chinese tourist during the visit. The",

          "His birthplace is now a museum consisting of several floors and you climb stairs. There is a bathroom on each floor. Interesting items abound including his tiny childhood violin, his pianoforte, and his wallet given to him. I find personal items are meaningful, not the period",
          "The Museum is really well done! We had the Salzburg Card (which is totally worth it!) and it made going a no brainer. The museum itself is very well laid out and very interesting. I learned a lot about Mozart and his family. Very cool to be standing in the very room he was",
          "We entered for free with our Salzburg Card and walked through the exhibition. There was a free app to download for a guided tour, but we couldn\u2019t make ours work.....so we ended up reading our way through the exhibition (ugh).... Interesting information even if you are not a",

          "I love Mozart, but I was sorely disappointed in this place. Feels like a tourist trap. Definitely overpriced. The only interesting thing is to see Mozart\u2019s pianos, but they will hunt you down if you even try to take a picture of it. Picture or not, this place is a must Not do.",

          "I had imagined that it would have been preserved more like a residence with furniture from Mozart\u2019s time but it was much more of a museum with pictures, writings, music pieces. But it was still interesting and transported me back in time. Actually I enjoyed the aura of the",

          "It\u2019s ok and gives a good history of the Mozart family but strangely there was no music to be heard. Entry was part of the Salzburg Card deal so in that respect it was reasonable value for money.",

          "Went there in the morning on a weekday. So did not have to side shuffle through out the place. It is more of a museum of Mozart\u2019s life than about the house and history or his belongings. It really is meant to tell his story and the inspiration that drove his talent. Something",
          "It was very cool to see where Mozart grew up and information about his family in early years. His childhood instrument was inside which was very nice to see. Would definitely recommend.",

          "This was a nice tour, right in Salzburg. We parked our rental car by the river & walked to the site. Be aware there\u2019s limited parking in the area! Nice set-guided tour with downloadable app to guide you. Enjoyed by our children (12, 16 & 21 yrs old) & my husband & I.",
          "Our family visited in August. It is remarkable that the original building and rooms are still there. Lots of stairs, 3 floors, small rooms, crowded, no air-conditioning. It's a must for a Mozart fan. The rest of us went through it quickly as each room has a few plaques to read",
          "I visited here 13 years ago. The audio tour is not necessary because everything voiced is printed along the way. What a genius. As a musician I learned a great deal. Bathroom on each floor. Stairs-no elevator. Three floors. Excellent gift shop.",
          "Despite the fact that we had our 5 year old daughter with us, who really wasnt that interested in Mozart's history, I still thoroughly enjoyed the visit to Mozart's house/museum. A lot of interesting information, portraits, artifacts and more. Well worth spending a few hours in",

          "Prepare yourself...there is a mini-mart on the ground floor of the Mozart birth place and an ice cream shop in the back. But the museum is worth the walk through, because you will learn more than a few things about the composer.",
          "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is probably Salzburg's most famous person so any visit to Salzburg surely cannot pass without a visit the house of his birth. I'd last visited 30 years ago but wanted another \"butchers\". Not a lot has changed in 30 years - maybe some minor alterations",

          "I love Mozart and his music so for me this was a highlight. The brightly painted muti storeyed house where Mozart was born is situated on No 9 Getreidegasse on Makartplatz Square. A tour through the original authenticated rooms gives you an fascinating and insightful peek",

          "This is one of the places you 'must' see when you are in Salzburg. Personally, I would have wanted to learn more about Mozart himself and his music, the museum focusses on the family, they way of living, the habits instead.",

          "Very interesting to see the room he was born in and the musical instruments. Fascinating museum with lots of information about the talented Mozart. It was around 5 euros for a child up to 14, and about 10-15 euros for an adult.",
          "This museum represents the birthplace of the famous Mozart. It\u2019s filled with interesting information and artifacts that anyone interested in music will find compelling. It\u2019s located in the middle of the old town and is very reasonable in terms of cost. Any visit to Saulsburg",
          "We enjoyed thi svisit to Mozart's birthplace. That said, if you can only do one of the Mozart museums, do the other one....his residence. In any event, we enjoyed walking through the rooms and seeing how people in his time lived.",
          "Being a rainy day in Salzburg we stopped by Mozart's birth place. It was an fascinating museum, with a number of interesting objects on display, and information texts on the wall. However, it was busy and this meant that the texts were sometimes hard to read, an audio guide may",
          "It is highly recommended to visit as it is the birthplace of our greatest musician Mozart. The building is properly maintained to keep Mozart\u2019s chronology of his life and family. Educational as well.",
          "Good insight into his family and how lived. Well organised and worth the entrance better than his residence which was very poor",
          "We are not big classical music fans but while in Salzburg you have to visit anything Mozart. Small museum with lots of artifacts from his life. Great history of his life also.",
          "Know what you are looking for. It may seem obvious but to some of us, it might not be. I had been shopping the day before on Getreidegasse and had noticed the grocery (Spar) store at street level and purchase some items but it never registered that this was Mozart\u2019s",
          "Number 9 Getreidegasse is a beautiful shopping street with old decorative hanging signs. We thoroughly enjoyed seeing the Mozart family\u2019s third story walk up. Personal portraits and locks of hair on display. Informative and fun.",
          "This museum was a great 1.5 hour stop for us in Salzburg. We went right at opening time in the morning and it was not very crowded yet. It provides a great overview- almost all is labeled well in English- of Mozart's early life and family history. You can see his little violin",
          "We are not particularly Mozart enthusiast but it would just be wrong to spend time in Salzburg and not visit the place he was born. Very interesting exhibits about his life and some fascinating facts on display about the general social demographics of the time, Good way to",
          "This is where the famed composer was born. Fans of classical music will find this very fascinating. For the rest of us, it's another place on your walk down the wonderful Linzergasse. You stop, take the picture and keep walking. :)",
          "Mozart\u2019s Birthplace is a famous sight in Austria, so of course I had to visit. During the exhibition you see for example things that belonged to Mozart. The house itself wasn\u2019t too big, I think that children/teens will also make it through without getting bored. I visited during",
          "Somehow we felt like we should see IT. We arent Mozart enthusiasts, so we probably didnt fully appreciate the exhibit. We came late and it was rather empty, walking through the small rooms full of people in the summer heat must be awful. We decided not to download any app guide,",
          "Birthplace and after 17 y/o home. Great visuals and descriptions, more original materials than one could imagine. Birthplace had no war damage, second home partially rebuilt. The Mozarteum has done a superb job in presenting the composer and his family as real people",
          "The house shows where Mozart, Salzburg\u2019s most famous son, was born. It gives a bit of his family\u2019s background. It was a nice display but my kids were a bit bored. The entrance price was included with the Salzburg Pass so that was ok. I don\u2019t know that I would have enjoyed it as",
          "If you expect something extraordinary here, you will be much disappointed. Empty rooms, with a few pictures and explanatory notes (you can say labels0. Nothing worth remembering, if you can see it from outside it is good enough.",
          "It is interesting to understand how the live was during that time. But I think to give more information about the music could be added on the museum.",
          "If you like his music you must see how was his life. The place is nice, it has a beautiful garden as well.",
          "The museum is curated rather well and gives you not only a narration of Mozart's life and family, but also a context of the period and some quirky facts about the composer. You can't take photographs which is a good thing - keeps distractions away and encourages you to absorb",
          "This was as advertised - a museum about Mozart\u2019s life from cradle to the grave. Some of the displays were very interesting. Took us about an hour and a half to go through. The cost of 11 Euro seemed ok though we were expecting 10. The only downside to this museum was that",
          "We learn that young Mozart live in a small apartment in Salzburg and compose songs with small piano that lighter and two octaves shorter than modern piano. It is a small house-museum with some original furnitures and letters, also Mozart tour route. Around is a long street with",
          "We enjoyed our visit to Mozart's birthplace. We found the brief video interesting, although many just walked \"through\" it. The walkway goes through the presentation and seats for it...which is a bit strange. We liked it better than Mozart's boyhood home, but with the Salzburg",
          "Interesting place to learn about Mozart's family and his relationships with them, with a wealth of primary sources on display. Note that some parts of the site are unavailable as closing hour approaches.",
          "This is a great place to go if you like big crowds.....however it\u2019s probably a nightmare if you\u2019re short and hate big crowds! My wife and I hired a taxi to take us around and waited for us while we looked around! Ultimately a good place to check out!!",
          "It was fascinating to see the home of the prodigy, where the Mozart family lived for more than a couple of decades. On the third floor, with only a kitchen, bedroom, living room, study and small cabinet, seven children were born. Only Wolfgang and his sister Nannerl lived to",
          "If you are on the walking tour, than one will easily notice the building where the famous music composer Mozart had born. The nice place to visit and to know more about the legendary Mozart.",
          "This is a definite must see in Salzburg. The history here is undeniable and very interesting even if you are not into classical music. Mozart was born in this upstairs apartment. There are artifacts and interesting explanations throughout the several rooms. It doesn't take long",
          "Definitely worth the trip if you're in Salzburg. To stand in the room where Mozart was born is a very cool thing to do!",
          "This is an extensive collection of documents and personal items from the Mozart family early in Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart's life. Yes, you will learn that he changed his name from the one he was given!",
          "If you walk the streets of Salzburg you cannot help but notice Mozart everywhere. This museum is informative, but not too much so and includes letters, paintings and possessions of Mozart. The museum itself is his birthplace, which is very authentic",
          "If you have the salzburg card as we did then its ok as absolutely loads of things are included, but if not this feels a bit expensive. You get to see the room he was born in and there is some historic exhibits but not much else. I wouldn't recommend doing anything in Salzburg",
          "We only seen the outside as we decided not to go inside but I'd say is definitely a must see if you're in Salzburg.",
          "The focus is on his beginning years. It is a modest apartment. You will find artifacts and stories from the early years. You get a sense of what his parents were like. No AC in this place.I f you have a Salzburg card, admission is free.",
          "Our hotel was about 30 yards from this so we decided to visit this with our Salzburg card. It is must visit if you love Mozart and classical music. There were different exhibits highlighting what life was like for the young Mozart. For the casual person, like myself, it was",
          "This will be a fun visit for anyone who either knows quite a bit about Mozart or if interested in learning more. There is a app you can download but it is text only and the text is written on the walls, too. Extensive, related gift shop. A short but interesting stop while in",
          "Naturally because of the importance of Mozart and his connection with Salzburg, his birthplace is extremely popular and therefore crowded, more so as the staircases are narrow and the rooms relatively small although larger than you would expect for a building of such an age.",
          "The area is out of this world wonderful buildings cobble stone paths the building is stricking with beautiful colours. The museum is very interesting and of course historical",
          "It is the house where Mozart was born and that was really significant for me. Great atmosphere, tons of information about Mozart and his family. Family rate available: we paid 23\u20ac for a family of 3 as opposed to 11\u20ac per adult",
          "We viewed Mozart birth place during a walking tour of Salisbury we did not go inside you can go in the building",
          "This was a very nice place of Mozart's Birthplace many places of info and music! We would recommend seeing this!",
          "This is clearly a stop off for most if not all tourists to Salzburg. It is very busy and can get very crowded at certain times.",
          "Free with the SalzburgCard. No photos are allowed. Lots of city tours stop here for a quick photo-stop but don't let this put you off as these don\u2019t have the time to go inside. The Birthplace (Gerthaus) is is one of three Mozart houses which are now museums - the others being",
          "Enjoy the birthplace of Mozart and enjoy the feeling of being taken back into the time when he was born . The house is simple and maintained in the same way.",
          "You can experience exactly where Mozart was born and get see rooms as they were during the time of his birth. Very interesting.",
          "You can\u2019t miss the place, because plenty of many Asian and American tourists are hustling around the place to take photos. We didn\u2019t dare to go in, because the Asian crowd of people seemed to occupy the place. Maybe a visit in winter is more quite.",
          "on Danube River Cruise spent a day here. Beautiful with a great deal of history. Loved the restaurant and fine wine.",
          "Mozart was born in this small house in 1756 and lived there until 1773. As a big fan of his music, I was interested in touring the building and pleased to stand in the room where he was supposedly born. In the very nicely done displays in each room, there is a lot of information",
          "Interesting place to learn about Mozart! if you are a music lover, just visit the place without a thought. It is located quite centrally, so you won't need transportation to reach the place.",
          "If you love music this is a must see. My daughter is a music lover and really enjoyed seeing Mozart\u2019s house.",
          "Centrally located and free with Salzburg card. Very steep steps take you up to the first floor and you see the room where Mozart was born, instruments that they used and lots of paintings",
          "Very nice place to visit, full of personal things and life stories of Mozart, his family and work. Must see!",
          "If you are in Salzburg you must visit the birth place of Mozart\u2019s.Mozart died at the young age of 35 but composed beautiful symphonies in this short period.The house is painted in yellow and located in the market place",
          "If you are a Mozart fan it's well worth seeing.You can buy two tickets (for two different houses),I'm sure if you do it this way there's a bit of a discount compared to paying separately .",
          "The dude is everywhere in Austria. There seems to be a Mozart museum everywhere you look. But pay attention to the cables running up the front of this house. They are old time doorbells. Super cool. This is something you just don't see everywhere.",
          "The dwelling is modest, the rooms compact, security is tight- NO PHOTOS! Every part of Mozart is described including detailed family info, many artifacts displayed. An honour to visit the home of one of history\u2019s most talented musician and writer. Any trip to beautiful Salzburg",
          "I think you really have to be into classical music to really appreciate this place but at least its better than the \"Mozart Residence\" across the river.",
          "The building is yellow and has a plaque indicating it is Mozart's birthplace, but it is crowded and we opted out of going inside. The street and Old Town seemed more interesting and worth our time. It was fun to wander the many interesting streets nearby.",
          "All the tour buses stop here, so avoid this area if you don't want to run into the tour groups. There is a market next door that is open on Sundays",
          "This was an interesting place but it was very busy. You had to be patient and let people move on so you could see everything. All exhibits were in several languages including English. We visited on a wet day and the entrance was used by people to shelter making it a little",
          "My wife and I were strolling through the lanes when we asked people what they were staring at. Lo and Behold....it was Mozart's birthplace. We did not go inside, but we did also get to view the rear of the building. Taking photos of both sides gave us a \"conversation piece\" when",
          "We were visiting Salzburg as part of an excursion from a riverboat cruise and stopped in front of Mozart\u2019s birthplace. You really can\u2019t visit Salzburg without visiting Mozart\u2019s birthplace since the city is famous because it is Mozart\u2019s birthplace (oh and the Sound of Music).",
          "If you have interest in history, music, or Mozart you\u2019ll enjoy this museum. Be warned, he was born on the third floor so expect to walk some stairs. The various exhibits are in German and English and very well laid out. Interesting family history as well as details on Amadeus\u2019s",
          "This visit came as part of a city tour so we went in w station by station headsets. I found it to be very boring and long winded. It seemed like there was a lot of info on tour but I couldn\u2019t take listening to it. Would avoid",
          "The bright yellow facade of Mozart's house is hard to miss, it is great for a photo. I didn't bother going inside as I went in many years ago, but I was surprised that now there is a Spar on the ground floor of the building! (A much nicer Spar than the normal ones, but still",
          "I like how this museum is run in portraying both Mozart\u2019s personal and professional life. One bad thing is that there is no elevator and we need to carry our 2-year old and pram up the stairs.",
          "This amazingly historical important place has been some what ruined by the fact that a SPAR SHOP has been allowed into the street level. The sign cleverly cut out off all photo's....... how could they allow that???",
          "Such an iconic building in Salzburg. Fantastic to see where the great composer was born. A must visit.",
          "Had a lovely time visiting here. Loads of information throughout the museum in many languages. Authentic belongings that Mozart once owned are all located here, even his hair and the first piano he practised on. Ticket prices are reasonable. There is a restaurant and cafe",
          "I was here 14 years ago and on my recent Danube River Cruise I returned while doing a guided city walking tour. So many people were in front of the house it was difficult to get a good photo. We did not have time to go inside. Even with all the tourists I would still put it",
          "Lots to cherish the memory of a prodigy. Visit Salzburg just to visit the Mozart birthplace and Mozart museum.",
          "Very simple intro to the life of WAM. Lots of period pieces and reproductions with few truly personal or family items. 45 minutes and out unless you're one of those folks that reads every word... 15 and 12 yo did well but enjoyed the Mozart residence more with the audio guide.",
          "I was so excited to visit this Historical Site... the buzz in the town was great amongst Christmas Markets and the crisp Winter morning. Site generates interest but if you get there early you can get a photo no problem. A must see and do",
          "While walking through the various rooms in the house where Mozart was born you get to see lots of interesting memorabilia from his childhood, including letters written by him, instruments he played, musical scores, etc.",
          "Of course when in Salzburg you need to see some of the Mozart history. It is awesome to stand in the same room as where this one-time genius was born. There is not that much to see, it is mainly the feeling you have when you are there. A must for any music lover.",
          "The attraction is well maintained and the audio guides were very informative. The entry to this attraction was included in the Salzburg card which was a bonus. Definitely enjoyed listening to the history of Mozart's apartment. Overall, a neat little attraction.",
          "This is a must visit museum in Salzburg. You get a good idea, how Mozart's family lived and you can also see instruments, books and paintings. I really enjoyed the visit and I can recommend Mozart's Birthplace for anyone, who is interested in classical music and history.",
          "We enjoyed our visit with our little girls (5 & 2) and as we\u2019d used our Salzburg Card* to gain entry we didn\u2019t mind that we weren\u2019t there too long.  The girls liked seeing the old furniture and particularly liked the models of the opera sets, (as well as the shop \u2013 where our",
          "Any lover of Mozart\u2019s music must visit this museum. My love of music increased exponentially walking through this exhibit! Just GO!",
          "Not my cup of tea at all but he is after all Salzburg's number one son. We had purchased a Salzburg pass which gave us free entry to this museum. As with a lot of people in history who later are revered, not a lot of their past has been saved to a large degree. So saying that",
          "One certain house in the Getreidegasse always draws particular attention: No. 9, the house in which Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born.",
          "For the price, you would expect to learn more. While the audio guide told the story, it barely scratches the surface. There were enjoyable shorts movies which were nice, but it focused on the trips and tours of Mozart rather than the time spent in Salzburg.",
          "Big attraction but not much else. Pretty much take a photo if you want or just buy a postcard. However, lots of tourist seem to love it. It doesn\u2019t take much time so if it\u2019s your thing do it otherwise just move along.",
          "We had already visited Mozarthaus in Vienna and at the same price here and even with our audio guide we felt this place was not as informative.",
          "If you\u2019re in Austria and want to have a Mozart experience, the Mozarthaus in Vienna is a better bet for all sorts of reasons, but the Birthplace only suffers by comparison. On its own, it\u2019s a very good museum and very much worth your time. The two museums take a slightly",
          "Take the tour only if you have Salzburg card. If you find any information in the house which u didn\u2019t know already about Mozart, u might not be a Mozart fan at the first place in which case it is worthless to visit the house. It\u2019s right in the centre of old town so u can\u2019t miss",
          "To be in the birthplace of one of the greatest composers of all times was breathtaking. A good deal to read allowed a deeper sense of his background and way life.",
          "Easily found in the heart of the city, there is always a crowd outside. If you appreciate music or history, it is worth a visit. Many original pieces still remain and it's a very authentic experience. You would only need up to an hour to do this justice.",
          "Between this and Mozart House, I would perhaps recommend you only do 1. The display was nice with clear information on each piece. However, no photos are allowed. Perhaps I had too high an expectation but i was a little disappointed there wasn't more to this.",
          "Not much to see in a 3 room flat, but took alot of pictures of the house and the street he lived on.",
          "Very interesting place. You can see where Mozarts families lived and achieved. You need just maximum 2 hours in order to visit this place. It in in the center",
          "The bright yellow building in the old town is the house where the famous composer was born. It now houses a museum about his life. The building is nothing special and its only claim to fame is its association with Mozart. You can go in if you are a fan of Mozart of just watch",
          "This is the heart of the old town and always has a crowd outside taking photos. It was very authentic still inside with lots of artifacts on display. Worth doing but you only need about an hour to see it at the most.",
          "This attraction is a must although it\u2019s a bit strange being above the Spar supermarket. It a great attraction and interesting. Takes about 30 mins.",
          "To see Mozart 's Birthplace there is an entrance fee. Many were taken away by the interesting and long shopping street along which the Birthplace was situated. You can find all the big names, like LV, there. Food and supermarket are available with many selling Mozart's souvenir.",
          "Don't miss this place. Busy historical site. Lots of branded show room around this. A Rolex shop just close to this building.",
          "This was an interesting visit, I learnt a lot about not only Mozart but his family history as well. The rooms were small but gave you an idea of how life was back in his day. Worth the visit and also on the Salzburg card too.",
          "Initially this seems like a quick stop on the Salzburg card but actually this is much larger than anticipated and a very interesting tour of life at the time. Enthusiasts can spend hours here I am sure but for us 20 interesting minutes provided a good sense of it. Nice",
          "Unless you are a real Mozert fan, I'd skip the steep entrance fee and just snap your photo of the exterior. There's a small SPAR grocery right in the ground floor amidst the Getreidegasse shopping street stores. Kind of detracts from the experience, in my view.",
          "It should be part of any visit to Salzburg. On display are instruments used by Mozart in his early life, as well as by other members of the family. I personally found the Mozart Geburtshaus more interesting than the Mozart Wohnhaus, both both are worth a visit.",
          "It's just an old century house with some pictures and instruments of Mozart. I felt it's just an overpriced home that doesn't offer anything worth cherishing.",
          "It is hardly surprising after all these years that the true context of the town has changed, modernized or has been renovated as has the house where Mozart was born. However, it comes as a surprise that a SPAR shop has occupied the ground floor. I am glad I have seen the",
          "If you like Mozart then this is a must :) Otherwise just take some photos outside and move on. We visited the interior too and did not feel it was worth the money for us. It is a bit overpriced despite the info inside is complete and interesting.",
          "Only need an hour hear to give you a good insight into the life of Mozart and his family. Lots of letters, trinkets and music scores on display. Could have been better if they actually had Mozart music playing in each room as you walked round. They did have a room with pcs and",
          "If you are a fan and appreciate the history of Mozart\u2019s work then it is certainly worth a visit. Not sure if Mozart would have expected a SPAR to be right outside his birthplace!",
          "It is located nearby lots of shops, so while wandering around in the city you will probably pass in front of the building. Lots of people taking pictures! It is even difficult to walk around.",
          "Although, we saw the outside of the birthplace of Mozart and didn\u2019t go inside it was a thrill to be there. The area of town around his birth place is beautiful and the Mozart museum is just across the street - worth a visit.",
          "We were not sure what to expect with a birthplace site. The photos were delightful. The stories were great. The information was also in English so that helps the English speaking guests.",
          "Its a great feel to visit the birthplace of one of the greatest genius the world has ever produced in the field of music.",
          "Mozart\u2019s birthplace is in the heart of the old town of Salzburg and so a visit here is easily combined with seeing other attractions in the city, it takes approximately one hour to see the exhibits. There are numerous genuine artefacts to see including: portraits, documents,",
          "What can I say Mozart \u2018To stand outside the birthplace of one of the greatest composers of all time is simply a chance I could not pass up. Guide told us many interesting facts which was delightful.Worth the trip toSalzburg!",
          "Salzburg is a beautiful place. Mozart has added spices to this places through his music in ancient time, Whose birthplace in this heavenly region. Now it a tourist place in the form of museum. Don\u2019t miss place at Salzburg",
          "Is amazing can be in the house were Mozart was born, see his piano, his violin and even a piece oh his hair o.O, is a short visit, maybe a little expensive but was great show my daughter this place.",
          "From the outside we weren't expecting much but this is a very well put together and interesting exhibition on Mozart's life. Plenty of interesting artefacts and stories about his life and that of his family. It's in a house so the rooms are all quite small so it does feel",
          "Loved the place and history. Finding it very difficult to put in words. It's a must see city as are all the sites within!",
          "This is located right in Old town and free with the Salzburg card. English audio guide . Nice exhibits in every room of his apartment. Well presented. Lots of information. Spent about 45 mins there. 60 min max. More interesting than his residence in the new town.",
          "This is a great place to visit. It offers a lot of the personal belongings of Mozart, and it gives you a great feel of the actual residence. Then once you are finished you can enjoy a nice cup of coffee in the front courtyard.",
          "I\u2019m not a Mozart classical music fan, but if you are in Salzburg you probably should take the opportunity to visit one of the two museums dedicated to Salzburg\u2019s most famous son. Today, the former Mozart family home contains a small museum where Mozart\u2019s childhood violin,",
          "I LOVE Mozart's music, and I find his biography to be absolutely fascinating. Nothing was going to prevent me going in. The house fulfilled my every expectation, and more. BUT ... I confess that there was a lot here than made me very grumpy. There are a lot of stairs with no",
          "Don't pay. Walk by it and that is enough to satisfy the need to say you saw Mozart's birthplace. It is a \"house.\" Take a picture and see his statue.",
          "If you're really interested in Mozart I would recommend going to the Mozart Residence, I visited both during my recent stay and they pretty much have the same background and information. Although Mozart's Birthplace did have some quirky belongings of Mozart, like two strands of",
          "Loved the tour and also the gift shop. The headset tour was a little lengthy for me but worthwhile. I was able to pick and choose what I wanted to listen to.",
          "A few interesting letters written to his wife, a birth room that had one contemplating the difficult times of that period, amid concise accommodation. Not much else.",
          "Go if you really enjoy Mozart or have purchased the Slatzburg card, otherwise not worth 11 euros just as much value having your picture outside",
          "Nice house in the middle of the old town. V busy. Very orange but interestingly monument to look at. Check it out",
          "I think a person would enjoy this more if you're a huge Mozart fan. This is where he was born and spent his childhood, they have another museum across the river where he lived for some years. We didn't go to that one. The price is a little steep for what you get.",
          "Very well laid out. Very informative without being too long winded.. Well worth the\u20ac11 entrance fee.",
          "Literallly nothing but a flag dangling from a building between shops. Nothing to see here if you ask me.",
          "I felt such nice for being in the same place as Mozart has also been. The house was nice, nothing more like the architecture that is being followed in whole Salzburg.. It was bizzarre the fact that under of it, is a supermarket..",
          "First, there are two Mozart houses to tour at 12\u20ac a person per house, which is pretty steep compared with what you get. Second, they both pretty much cover the same information (most of its duplicative). We had the Salzburg Card and it included both locations so we went to both.",
          "This museum is, without doubt, the most sterile and unimaginative I have ever visited. I am sure it pulls the crowds in, especially in high season but it is very poor value for the high admission cost. The exhibits are sparse and poorly presented. Very disappointing.",
          "When you arrive at Salzburg, the highlight of the things to do, this one is one of them. The place is not huge but Mozart is so famous and important in music history. If you not go there. The journey in Salzburg was wasted.",
          "Including in Salzburg card! Or you will feel the price a little bit expensive...! Anyway it still was a not bad or...must visit place!",
          "I'm not a classical music fan, but I was in the city of Mozart, so I went. Boring, waste of money. Few great insights into the main himself, poorly interactive. I know some people rave about this place, but I think you need a love for the man and his music to get enthusiastic.",
          "I really enjoyed reading the personal stories of Mozart's family. I'm not an expert, so it may not appeal to those who really know a lot about Mozart and his music. As a novice, I loved it.",
          "We had a very friendly and best-informed private guide in salzburg and have seen many place - but the house of Mozart's Birthplace was exciting and so much interesting to learn much more about Mozart.",
          "This is the birth house of Mozart. It is a five storey house converted to a museum. It is filled with interesting stories and artifacts of pertaining to Mozart. An hour would be sufficient for the visit here.",
          "We visited the place at night time and wish to visit the house next time. Hope to get more info about Mozart, his family tree and see the room he was born in. Hopefully next time. Just a bit shocked to see the SPAR Supermarket at the ground floor of the building. I was",
          "Very easy to find yellow building in old town. Building was not big but there are details stories about Mozart from his parents, siblings to his children and artifacts. Learnt a few things about Mozart including his tours since he was a child to showcase his musical talents,",
          "It was so interesting reading about Mozart's life & seeing the room he was born in. It humored us that there is a grocery store (Spar) on the ground floor of the building.",
          "Situated in the Main Street of Salzburg, this was an interesting place to visit. Very informative regarding the family tree, Parents\u2019 biographies and birth of Mozart and his siblings and his very early years.",
          "You\u2019re in Salzburg, you have to visit Mozart\u2019s birthplace. A plethora of interesting information re: the times, Mozart\u2019s life-comparisons between Vienna & Salzburg (during Mozart\u2019s time....) Definitely worth the visit. It was suggested that this museum is much more interesting",
          "Not an avid Mozart fan, but easy to spend time here, with young kids too (lasted nearly an hour), looking at handwritten sheet music, learning of his life and finally hearing some of his music.",
          "A well worth it trip back in time, you're taken into the childhood days of Mozart. The detailed explanations on Mozart, his family, his childhood and later stages in life is impressive and interesting. You'll find yourself going through the house as if reading an interesting",
          "As an avid classical music fan, I knew that Mozart's Geburthaus was #1 on our list of things to do in Salzburg. Walking from our parking spot near Mozartplatz and through the narrow city corridor, I felt like I had been swept back in time. Walking the very streets that he",
          "A must for all Mozart and music lovers. The guide boo says the house he lived in later is better but this is a must and I learned more about Wolfgang and his family that are no published widely. It has many interesting artefacts and you do get he feel of the times.",
          "This was a dream come true for me and I was fortunate enough to travel with my mother which had been a dream of mine since I was 9. To be able to be in the place where a music genius was born was a pleasure.",
          "This is a quaint and educational place to spend an hour in the heart of Salzburg. I was not well informed about Mozart and certainly learned a lot about him, his family and the history of Austria at that time. It\u2019s not expensive (E23 for a family of 4) and very good value for",
          "This house is worth a visit just to get a feel for life in a Salzburg townhouse. Although not really furnished it does have some genuine Mozart artifacts including instruments and locks of hair.",
          "Interesting exhibits, im not normally a fan of museums but these were surprisingly interesting. Worth seeing if your in town.",
          "Excellent museum on the main street. Four floors of Mozart memorabilia including the top floor where his parents lived and he was born. Some interesting stage set models are incorporated into the museum. Well worth a visit.",
          "Interesting building with lots of history, worth a visit. Great value when used in conjunction with Salzburg card.",
          "The fascinating thing that I learned about Mozart at this museum was by reading his HILARIOUS letters that he wrote to his wife. I am not big into going to museums. I would much rather be outdoors. BUT since the whole town of Salzburg has Mozart's name, Mozart's music, Mozart's",
          "A magical charm takes you once you pass by the warm and little road where this great Musician was born...The building, with its courteous and classy out painting, is in line with the unique Genius of this Great musician...You get then to read info about this big Artist..when was",
          "Interesting look at the life of Mozart and a fasinating look into parts house kept in a prevoius century's style",
          "Chronologically arranged , one gets to visit and understand the journey of the maestro . Very well laid out and interactive exhibits make it interesting for all ages .",
          "The Birthplace of Mozart is made into a Museum, some of the interior is actually still the original. You should take a guided tour, anyway I am not sure if there is an unguided one. It is located in the Heart of the City, so will pass by anyway! If you love Mozart's Music there",
          "As a huge fan of Mozart and his music, going to Salzburg was a must see destination...this, and the other Mozart related sites, were well worth it!",
          "This town is based on Mozart for sure. Great house only seen from outside as I\u2019m not fan of his \ud83c\udfb6. It\u2019s nicely located",

          "If you are at all interested in music, you must see where Mozart was born. It's wonderful. Great views. They were wealthy but had to bring everything up several floors. The kitchen (kept as it was in Mozart's day) is pretty basic, and apparently their servants slept on the",
          "The entrance fee is 11 e for mozart's birthplace and 18 for both mozart's birthplace and his residence located on the other side of danube On the rooms were excibited staff of mozart's life along with paintings from his and his family life Also you can learn about his whole",
          "Everything in Salzburg is about Mozart. Therefore we have to visit Mozart's birthplace of course. This museum was once Mozart's birthplace and home until 1773.",
          "As mentioned in our reviews about Salzburg, everything there seemed to be related to Mozart. However this was the first priority among all those things said to be related to Mozart in Salzburg. Everything well displayed and you could learn a lot about this great person's life.",
          "Total 3 floors of museum display about life of Mozart at this birth site. For people who are interested to find out more about Mozart, good to purchase Mozart Residence ticket as package. It does not need to be utilised within same day as you have 24 hours to do so. Cafe was",
          "This was a great place to visit, especially if you have. The Salzburg card. Some very interesting exhibits and well worth the visit",
          "We stopped here while meandering the main shopping district in Old Town and were so glad we did. But, while it is labeled as Mozart's \"birthplace,\" it is not set up like a house. The rooms of the house are for museum displays and very interesting indeed. But, if you want to",
          "Going to visit Mozart birth place not only gave me more knowledge about his life, also a feeling of what was like back then. You will immerse yourself in his world. Looking at his pianos and violins I felt close to him. Mozart\u2019s music is played in the background and the audio",
          "Must-to visit. Not very interesting when going on your own. Maybe it is better to choose coming here with a guided tour.",
          "You wont miss it, its a giant yellow building. Its really interesting seeing inside and seeing where Mozart was born and the way of life from that time period.",
          "This is an ok sight. I would spend my money on the house where he lived as a child instead of this sight. Not much in here.",
          "Over hyped !! Nothing great - just the location is good - opposite hotel bristol - cafes around the place are good - plus you have doppler residence next to it -",
          "The best part of this tour isn't so much being in the house itself, it's the great audio tour and the authentic pieces of history like the pianos that were actually played by the Mozart family. Otherwise, one good say it is quite a short experience, especially if you don't take",
          "Nice place to visit, very interesting learning about mozart's life and music. All the places he visited during his life etc.",
          "If you have a Salzburg card or are interested in Mozart, it's worth visiting. It also gives you a good insight into the look of very old apartments in the Altstadt.",
          "experienced the most beautiful and musical night of my life with live music served over a 4 course meal",
          "You really can\u2019t miss visiting this museum in Salzburg where Mozart was born and performed. It is very historical with information in English",
          "One of the biggest attractions in Salzburg is definitely Mozart's Birthplace or Mozart's house. A few rooms , pictures about Mozart and about family of Mozart. Presented the life from birth to death. Free entry with Salzburg card.",
          "Came here on a day-trip to Salzburg. We purchased the combo ticket for Mozart's Birthplace and the residence. The Birthplace is located in the old town, a few steps down from the Red Bull's world. It summarizes and outlines Mozart's family including himself, parents, sister, and",
          "Being a big music history fan, and western art music fan, I found this very fascinating. Probably wouldn't be so good if you aren't such a fan, but for musicians and western art music fans, it's very exciting",
          "Not much to see (as expected). Unless you are a real fan, you can visit complete the visit in 10 minutes. Learned about his family mostly and saw a few items. Not worth the 20 something euro family ticket. Plus it was cold (rooms are heated but passageways not).",
          "Part of a tour from Viking Cruises was visiting Salzburg. Walking through the city was delightful. The guide stopped at the house of Mozart. We tasted candies especially made to honor the musical genius.",
          "It was very interesting to visit this old house and see where the genius was born and lived as a young person. One could just about picture his talented father teaching him and his very talented older sister in these rooms. Great information there, really good to find out so",
          "So, any time you get to stand in a place where the famous person actually was, it's a good day. In Mozart's birthplace, you get to stand in the actual room where Mozart was born. If that alone isn't with 10 euro, I don't know what is. Additionally, the museum had tons of letters",
          "WE had a very wet day in Salzburg and dried off in the Cathedral where it was warm. At Mozart's birthplace something was going on which prevented us from going in. We will go in next time.",
          "We stopped in while visiting Salzburg for the Christmas market, Almost hard to spot with the commercial properties on the main level these days. Nice exhibits about Mozart's life, but we didn't stay long. Was a bit crowded--might be better to stop in early in the day when there",
          "Worth a trip round. We had the Salzburg card so didn\u2019t have to pay and didn\u2019t have to queue. Not much to do for young children but it\u2019s interesting to see where Mozart was born and some original items on display.",
          "It was nice to visit the home where this musical genius was born and lived. The museum provides a great overview of Mozart's life and times. Best to visit in the morning.",
          "Although the presentations were a little haphazard- it was still a good glimpse into one of the classical music greats! We spent probably close to two hours meandering around a house where Mozart grew up in. Personally I enjoyed the Residence more probably because that was",
          "Too many tourists. Too little to see. Too commercial (Starbucks and a supermarket at the door! Noooo!) Have a look at the entrance, but given Mozart spent most of his time not living here, maybe try a different museum.",
          "So I'm not a music lover, but this is the most boring, static museum to which I have had the pleasure of paying an entrance fee. You move from room to room, with ia few exhibits in each room. Some paintings, manuscripts, a violin or two. The usual attendant saying \"No photos\""

          "If the works of Mozart are only pieces of classical music to you, then you might not enjoy spending time (and euros) to see the magnificent composer's birthplace. However, if you love Wolfgang Amadeus, then it is a house that you should not miss. We were certainly glad that we visited Mozart's birthplace.",
          "We happened to be there on Mozart's actual birthday so we were able to get in for free which was awesome. There are some really cool exhibits inside with very helpful staff to explain everything in whatever language you want. Along with all the exhibits, they also had some musical performances which were just awesome. Highly recommend.",
          "Worth a visit but unless you are a big fan - not a reason to give this more than an hour.  Lots of focus on Mozart's family and circumstances rather than his music and genius.   None in our party was really thrilled and we felt that the could have been better spent.  Nothing wrong here but priorities would take us elsewhere.",
          "Very nice and in the most beautiful part of this lovely town.\nNot expensive (25\u20ac for family: 2adults 3kids), discount for groups and students\nSimple and well organised. Educative.\nOnline instructions, and museum in photos available in the \u2026",
          "Rustic and well preserved, this is a great place to visit if you want to know more about/ like Mozart. I certainly enjoyed the different art pieces they display in addition to the house and old pieces of furniture.",
          "Very well maintained and detailed art collection. Mozart's family is main focus here\nThe letters written are well preserved. Very good display of all musical instruments\nFYI, This place is usually crowded. Plan accordingly\nThe best way to reach here is by walk",
          "Nice museum that gives you a good idea about Mozart's family status and also himself. Don't expect personal items or other housewares things. Are only texts, music sheets and couple of small pianos that he trained on.",
          "Clear evidence that humanity is getting taller. You may want to watch your head if you are 6' plus because this building was built during an era of shorter folk. Still worth it to witness the legacy of a very influential musician.",
          "Fun to walk through. Not so much in the museum parts, but enough to get you a feeling of how it was to live back then (under quite privileged circumstances). I also guess visiting Mozart's birthplace is something you should have done once during your Vienna visits. It is easy yo get too in the Central city.",
          "As an avid traveller,  I didn't find this place worthy enough to be pay 12 euros, which is almost  as the fort that is close by. The house just offers the insights of Mozart and his childhood in a very small place. There are many other places to visit and spend your money on a nice snack than this.",
          "I'm not even particularly musically inclined but I found this to be a fascinating experience. This was a lovely museum. I would recommend about 2 hours to see everything",
          "Wasn't able to go inside, but the surrounding area was nice. There is also a small cheese shop nearby (50m or less) that you should visit.",
          "Lack of original personal Mozrat things",
          "For those Mozart fans, it is a wonderful place. I don't think that there is a dah where you can visit without having a crowd there. A lot to see and explore- know gets to know Mozart a lot better. Audio guides in various languages",
          "Very fun to see the place where Mozart was born and loved for the first few years. They have a very interesting collection of artifacts and information assembled.",
          "Nice and its really very detailed about his life and family. Didn't actually know that his sister was also so talented! Seems a shame that no one has ever really heard if her and that she could just teach music instead of anything else. \u2026",
          "Overall an amazing experience but it is really easy for anyone to walk in without paying. I suggest more security at the entrance and more people to monitor the art as many people take pictures of it when not allowed.",

          "Loved experiencing Mozart's early years in his childhood home. The artifacts were interesting and there were several creative exhibits. It was both an educational and moving experience for a music lover like myself.",
          "Very interesting museum with a lot of items in display. Well worth the visit.",
          "A great museum in the wonderful city of Salzburg. Taste the sausage in the city market.",
          "Has original historic documents such as Salzburg Chronology recording his birth in 1756. Deserves five starts as birthplace of one of the greatest music composers of all time. However, the museum and displays have a dated feel. There is good representation of his family and not as much of his own life or work.",
          "There is nothing great about the place jus a lot of Mozart momento. If you are pressed for time I recommend skip this place",
          "Have been 2 times to Salzburg. Once I went inside as well. Nice to add to your trip. Go inside only if you are Mozart fan. The entry fee(11 euros) is not worth for the place.",
          "Great historical building and very nice and special  town.",
          "Very interesting place. You can know how Mozart grew up and learnt something about his music composition life.\nSorry no photo taking is allowed inside the museum.",
          "Worth a look, most certainly. Just managed to see one of his homes --  the one he was born in and lived till the age of 17 with his family. It was a very interesting display. And while I won't have the time to see the second Salzburg, the \u2026",
          "Very interesting to see where one of the most talented musicians was born and grew up, how his family lived and how the life and death of not only Mozart but his whole family was like.",
          "It's pretty much just that, his birthplace. Hardly worth the time or the ticket.",
          "The museum is such a treasure. They are upgrading the collection all the time. We have seen so many new things ckmpared to 7 years ago. It is so nice to see original letters and operas dispayed and listen to them. The museum has it's own \u2026",
          "Worst kind of museum, lots of exhibits without context or detailed description. First third (the Mozart's apartment) is the worst, than it's getting slightly better. Save the time and money and go to the Mozart Wohnhaus instead.",
          "If you like Mozart, visit this place. They did a good job exploring his family's history and explaining to you his early life experiences and travels. You'll get a feel for what living in Salzburg was like being in Mozart's time.",
          "I went to both the Residence and the Birthplace. I preferred this one by a little. There's no English audioguide. You walk through various rooms and read things on the walls that describe Mozart's family. You don't really learn much about \u2026",
          "Totally not worth the 11 euros unless you got the salzburg card. The baldy receptionist also killed the mood from the beginning by slapping the desk very disrespectfully asking us for our card. Probably not getting paid enough or just hates his life.",
          "You get to know and read a lot about Mozart and his family. It's a small apartment and we get a feel that not much is altered.",
          "It's a really nice museum but I wouldn't say it's fun for kids. Much to read and not super much to see. So if you are really interested and like Mozart then it's a great place to visit! (Same at \"Mozart-Wohnhaus.)",
          "Well organized museum.  Appreciated the details given about how people lived during that time period",
          "Lovey place rich od history, nicely maintained. A but crowded but manageable. We had lunch in adorable restaurant in a tiny little house just next to the Birtholace house, where Mozart was living for couple of years. Excellent food! Would visit again.",
          "The town and streets surrounding Mozart house are very charming. Must see if you like old towns with narrow charming streets. The area has too many good restaurants.",
          "Interesting, had a guy playing mozart too.",
          "I really liked this place. It was a bit redundant when I started the tour because it was almost identical to the information about Leopold given at the Wohnhaus. Other than that, I think this museum is better than it's counterpart because \u2026",

          "A good exhibition ruined by rude staff. \nWe found lots of interesting stories, displays, and literature about the Wolfgang Mozart and his family. But we see most of the staff in the rooms are doing their own things in the rooms. They were \u2026",
          "Beautiful building. The street has been transformed into a high end shopping district. Nice to see, however, compared to some of the other places I visited, not worth going out of my way.",

          "Famous..but not worth 12eur...",
          "Easy to find right near main Town square, $11 euro to enter",
          "It was beautifully decorated but a little bit dull at some point.. Anyhow it was thrilling to be able to walk through the walls that Mozart was born",
          "Nice place to visit for people who like to know history and music",
          "Crowded, but gives understanding about the living in the 18th century and being not poor :)",
          "Delightful!  Well-organized interpretive photos, artwork, artifacts and textual displays.  Very helpful docents.",
          "A lot of details about the life as well as obviously from his birth. The information about the family was also very interesting. They have a sound room, and songs which you can enjoy, so overall a very pleasant experience.",
          "OK but a bit boring. We were invited to use a dedicated app but thus gave no more information than was displayed. An audio guide on the app would have been helpful.",
          "Love the Spar just underneath it. The person working the door of the Mozart birth house was very helpful and actually did his job. Made the visit so much easier. Really full of people.",
          "Extremely touristy but it was very fun to see a 6 year old Mozart's music script! Worth it for that alone. Also pretty educational about his life.",
          "The best schnitzel I've had in my entire life. The potatoes... How did they make them that delicious !?!",
          "If it wasn't for the tour guide, I'd have walked right by this place. It has a placard acknowledging this historical place on the outer wall, but easily missed.",
          "Start your journey in Mozart's home and be a good visitor. You will learn about his family, clothes, and things he received. You will see his pictures too. Great experience.",

          "An interesting place if you like Mozart. You can find a lot of Information about his life, his family and of course about his music. The place is heavily crowded, though and you are not allowed to take any pictures.",
          "A beautiful landmark in the beautiful city. We couldn't go inside (not sure if they allow as well) but the hustle and bustle of the place and the vibe was infectious! Worth visiting once to pay tribute to a legend of music.",

          "I was cool to see Mozart\u2019s birthplace but I expected more. More staff to read than see...",
          "Beautiful place and historical landmark, but as travelling on a budget for few months and with lots of places to go, the price was a bit too much. EUR 36 for my wife and i to go inside a place that people were coming out of with an expression saying 'yes that's ok' , its not what we have in mind.",

          "Not many things to see, at least I have expected more. It is in the center of Salzburg and one should see it when visiting",
          "I think it had very less history of Mozart, although you get to see some real documents related to his life. Like his first job, some part of his travel and compositions. But I felt there could be more, for a great musical icon.",

          "Easy access from the main train station by foot (10-15 minutes) or car/ bus (5 minutes). There is a museum accessible for I modest fee (in my opinion). The surrounding streets are picturesque and very historical. Also one can easily walk or ride to the nearby castle and enjoy a view of Salzburg and the Alps.",

          "Big fan, but it's just a mini-museum, not alive.  The few bits of staff paper we're cool",
          "Interesting museum. Also take a look at Mozart's residence too, but out of the two I'd choose this one for more information on his whole family and younger life.",
          "Very informative museum. With lots of amazing artefacts.",
          "The building is not wheelchair accessible. If you have any kind of problems with walking, it will be rather difficult to climb the stairs to the third floor where the exhibition is. The cashier told me that yes, disabled people cannot \u2026",
          "We came there 30 minutes before closing and they warned us that it's not enough time to explore the whole museum, we still bought the tickets and went there. Unfortunately they turned off all the interactive machines inside,  and didn't warn us about that. So we paid the full price only for partly working stuff.",
          "Christmas Markets were extremely colorful.",
          "Great museum with very inspiring atmosphere. Speed down and plan to stay here 2,5 hours minimum. Worth visit!",
          "Not that special, you are basically looking at a fancy SPAR. Nice place for pictures.",
          "There's something special about being in the birthplace of a musical genius. Plenty of info and articles on the life of Mozart and his family",
          "When you are in Salzburg, you know you are going to learn about the most famous son of the city - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Now a museum in the apartment at the birthplace of the musical genius is something one should plan on visiting. But \u2026",
          "Only able to view from outside. Good to see property is being maintained in its original style.",
          "There is a few nice little cafes just outside of the birthplace of Mozart.",
          "Quiet trip in the house with letters, paintings, personal belongings and detailed descriptions in every room. Personal favorites are the Mozart Online where some of his pieces can be listened to and the everyday life of Salzburg at the age.",
          "Area is very historic and beautiful. Didnt get a chance to see everything. Beware that alot of stores around are closed on sundays.",
          "Interesting place! Very good to learn more about Mozart's life.",
          "I love classic music, but I really don't know what's the interests of this place. There are two antique piano with much less and smaller keys. But nothing else let me get ideas of what it looks like when the great was born, nor the environment he grew up. That's what I most interested.",
          "It was a worthwhile experience. Lots of history about Mozart and music.",
          "Beautiful event! Good vibe !",
          "Being in the house where Mozart was born is an amazing experience, however, the majority of exhibits seemed to be facsimile (they are marked when they are.) It's disappointing to think you are in the same room with the pianoforte he played, only.to.read the label that likely he played one similar to it.",
          "I love the place lindau is such a beautiful city the Mozart museum is amazing I knew a lot of information about him. His family",
          "The lady in ticket office and the man in the front both are very rude. Very disappointed today.",
          "A nice exhibition about the Mozart family and Wolfgang Amadeus' life in the original location of his birth.",
          "What an amazing place of history! We got to be in the room where Mozart was born.",
          "I love history. I love culture, as then no comparisons come into the picture. Every aspect is its own entity to be appreciated in itself. Expectations are limited to the particular item of interest. It's only expected then that I'll fawn over being at this place.",
          "A quick stop along the tourist area of Salzburg.",
          "It has been preserved so well.",
          "Romantic town \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Very interesting museum, but also very crowded (according to the reputation of the composer in his hometown) and small ; therefore you cannot visit very quietly. Architecture of the house is typical and you can feel History through the \u2026",
          "Amazing history and culture! Beautiful churches. Will definitely come back again!",
          "What an interesting place! The 1st floor of the building is a supermarket lol",
          "U can feel the classic vibe around the place. Recommend to visit before 9 AM, because it's gonna be crowded",
          "It was easy to miss in the old town and really crowded around.",
          "Interesting information on Mozart and his family. Should have his music in all the rooms. And even decorate the living and bedroom to the time period. The kitchen is a good start. The models to Mozart operas are great",
          "No photos allowed inside. Its got a vast exhibition about the life of mozart and his family, how he was raised as a child product, the operas like don giovanni made by mozart, the letters he wrote, his birth room etc. Definitely worth seeing. Its included with Salzburg card.",
          "If you walk fast enough youll miss it.",
          "Interesting place especially if you are a Mozart fan. The place is fairly modest but well kept. I was just disappointed that there was a Spar supermarket on the same building. A national monument dedicated to one of the most famous composers of all time and we have a Spar spoiling the atmosphere.",
          "This shopping street is very unique mostly for its signs",
          "As a classic fan, I enjoyed touring around this place.",
          "It should be really nice if Mozart music would be all over that place",
          "We were requested to come back later for some reason",
          "the museum itself was great, but the lack of ac made the experience a bit less enjoyable. the exhibition was amazing though",
          "Most of the items are replicas and the narrative is someone\u2019s subjective view. Not really worth the 11 euro entry. There\u2019s a free app you can download called Geburtshaus Mozart and it will give you the full narrative of what\u2019s inside.",
          "Very walkable old city. Very wonderful old cathedral.",
          "Interesting information on Mozart and his family. Should have his music in all the rooms. And even decorate the living and bedroom to the time period. The kitchen is a good start. The models to Mozart operas are great",
          "A beautiful city to visit. Can be covered on foot in one day",
          "Very informative. Couldn\u2019t take any photos. Can download information onto your phone",
          "This is a top notch place and super interesting. Lots of great information and artifacts. Definitely check it out if you have the time.",
          "For me, this place was a little too cramped but this place is basically a museum that has like a collection of mozart's belongings or possesions i think. Like his piano, etc.",
          "Good, informative museum with interesting historical artifacts concerning W.A. Mozart, Nannerl Mozart and Leopold Mozart. I would recommend getting there early as it does get busy quickly, and using a Salzburg Card as it is much better value for money and gets you in to lots of other attractions for free also!",
          "Very beautiful hause.",
          "Click! Picture taken. Let's carry on.",
          "The House of Mozarts Birthplace is located in the City Center of Salzburg and you almost cannot miss it.\nThe experiance inside is quite nice and well documented. The App does not work apperently here always...\nIn conclusion if you go to Slazburg then this is definitly something you should stop by.",
          "Such history \u2665\ufe0f",
          "Great moments to visit A Master's house..",
          "Fake. I expected an old 1750 house with furniture, beds...only there is a kitchen. The house is empty with writings in the walls explaining facts about Mozart's life. I don't recommend the visit.",
          "Interesting info regarding Mozart, presented in a charming way.",
          "I've only rated it 4 stars as we didn't actually go inside. It's a beautiful grand building(as are most in Salzburg) and is wery well ket in the outside",
          "This tour was just alright. It was pretty annoying that they didn\u2019t have an audio guide, because without it the museum ended up being pretty boring. There\u2019s honestly much better places to visit in Salzburg and if you\u2019re interested in Mozart, I would recommend going to Mozart\u2019s Wohnhaus instead.",
          "Lovely museum. You get to learn all about Mozart's life, from birth to death. Central location, free with the salzburg card. Please note you mustn't take photos or videos inside the museum.",
          "Historical. Home and Birthplace of one of the greatest musical genius in the middle of  old salzburg Town. Good musuem detailing him and his family life. No photos allowed inside, hence no pics from me except the front.",
          "Lots of interesting historical items. I like those handwritten notes, can really see the different styles of handwriting. Too bad this place does not allow photographs, kind of archaic.",
          "Very attractive place and memorable landmark",
          "Extremely good quality for such old building. So many tourists... it is sad",
          "Interesting museum about the Mozart family. Here's a photo of the square from one of the window of the house.",
          "It was interesting to see Mozart's birthplace \u00e1t a time  when there are always many.",
          "Beatiful",
          "This was a fun self-guided tour but it lacked any structure for where we should go. People we're just walking in all directions. This is a history tour as opposed to any of his music. Lots of paintings but nothing at all to resemble what the house looked like when he lived there.",
          "We couldn't get to see inside as it is closed on Tuesdays. From the outside it was like a achievement to reach this place. Nothing special about the building apart from the history.",
          "Nice museum. They even have a hair of Mozart.",
          "Must see! My children loved it!",
          "Beautiful and really interesting to visit. Must to visit!",
          "This place has detailed description of Mozart and his family's life. If you are inspired by him this place is a definite go",
          "Interesting artifacts. Has senior admission rates, a plus. No A/C so it was stifling during the heat wave.",
          "A must on your visit list if you love music and want to know about Mozart",
          "Birthplace is better than residence.. photos not allowed",
          "Probably overpriced.  It's a small museum.",
          "Very crowded, but nice to see",
          "Nice to see, appreciate his beginnings a bit,  \nInteresting but venue needs air-con",
          "Lovely large pitch. Showers and toilet facilities clean. Good value for 24\u20ac with electric.  Greeted well. Didnt like the fact that people live on the site.  Didnt like looking out at the 100s of gnomes in the morning. And poorly maintained living quarters.  No toilet roll or hand sanitizer. So had to keep remembering to take with us.",
          "Fascinating tour.  Take your time. Don't rush through.",
          "Ok, I can understand why it was crovdy. But I don't understand why there's no air conditioning. You can see a lot of portraits and a lot of dokuments and that's pretty much all. Actually there is no furniture or personal belongings so you can not feel any spirit of that place.",
          "This is a lovey museum dedicated to Mozart's early life. We really enjoyed it. Our ten year son loves music and Mozart. He enjoyed parts of the museum, for example seeing Mozart's childhood violin. But overall, I think the experience is geared more towards adults- there was quite a lot of text to read, but all was fascinating.",
          "Interesting museum where you can learn more about Mozart and his family.",
          "It is a place of very famous musicion on the age with magic talent on his decade. Reviewed by Kayin Fauzi, owner of Pondok Mantau producent of Mantau Black Pepper, special buns from Balikpapan Indonesia.",
          "Superb building rich with history and excitement got to see this if in Salzburg",

          "If you like classical music or just like culture  visit this place.",
          "Go ahead and touch the door and the walls... Maybe, just maybe, you will get some of his genius! \ud83c\udfbb",
          "A must if you are interested in Mozart's history. Place is very well kept. Lots of family items, not just WAM.",
          "Salzburg old town is beautiful with right mix of old and new.. Roamed around, did window shopping, went to the castle, the love Bridge and more.. The snow made things much more charming",
          "Very crowded and be tired.\nHowever, the night are quiet , illumination and fantastic.",
          "A very imposing structure from outside. The first destination when you visit the Old Town in Salzburg's. First stop before going up in the frontier or going around.",
          "Great but use one of th\u00e9 tour guides to get most benefit & use th\u00e9 horse and carriage to tour city approx 48 euros per carriage.",
          "A very historic museum that lies at Mozartsplatz in Salzburg. If you love Museums then it's a must go.",

          "The building located in very nice road.",
          "A good place to visit in Salzburg",
          "Cool historic place. Pretty over run by tour groups and tourists, but that's kind of the point.",
          "Beautiful gardens with informative tour guides. Don't miss the fort upon the hill. If you want a inexpensive view, take the elevator up the hill from inside the modern museum. There is a cafe and overlook up inside the museum. The streets \u2026",
          "Place feels like it's going to fall apart, items on exhibition largely uninteresting to me. It basically goes on and on about how Mozart was such an amazing genius from birth. Photo shows the most decorated room; any others maybe have one violin and a few tiny objects.",
          "Popped in Just because we are here had to be done.",
          "Good place to learn about Mozarts childhood and family. Worth a quick visit if you have Salzburg card but not if paying entrance fee.",
          "Great experience that is reminiscent of old times with a chance to savor some music",
          "Original memorial for Salzburgs most famous son..",
          "I liked this place. Wonderful experience.",
          "This place is interesting and has many cute souvenirs. you can see mozart's real work. However it is a tiny bit boring and so many people!!",
          "I would say that the birthplace(here) is better than the residence.",
          "Very pricy ticket, no pictures available inside, no audioguide just a link to an app to download with some text information. Inside very few memorabilia from Mozart, in general mostly panels with information about his life. Not really worth a visit.",
          "Interesting place with a wealth of information about Mozart, his family, his early years, and early music. A replica of his famous piano is also present. Close to the exit is a set of computers where you can look at and listen to some of \u2026",
          "Amazing feeling..Watching the building",
          "Interesting historic museum of Mozart!!",
          "Well documented  easy to find Cheap entry fee",
          "Not a great deal to see.  A few musical instruments and personal belongings but it's mostly writing one the wall and information plates.  It didn't feel like a home.",
          "Very good history of Mozart\u2019s life and amazing portraits, pianos he used, and first copies of his compositions (don\u2019t take photos well you\u2019re there they get mad lol)",
          "You must try the sea food counter beside mozart house.",
          "Good place for purchase from spar and to walk around",
          "Salzburg is a quaint gorgeous city. Mozart was born here. A must place to visit if you are in Salzburg Austria.",
          "Nice location. Maybe a little bit crowded...anyway you have to see it if you are visiting Salzburg!",
          "Cant believe Mizart was born and lived here til he was 18. Nice little building anyway.",

          "Just viewed the outside. Beautiful place",
          "Cool place!",

          "Finally visiting the city of Mozart, Von Karajan and of course Sound of Music ...",
          "Beautiful History. So much to learn",
          "One of my favorite historical places to visit in Austria. The house is a very modest house that Mozart\u2019s patents rented. Mozart\u2019s mother gave birth to 6 babies but just Mozart and his sister survived to adulthood. We learned a lot about his childhood, his parents and his early years. A highly recommended visit",
          "Standing in the room where one of the biggest composers of all time came to this Earth is a feeling hard to describe. You should experience it yourselves.",
          "Did not go inside, very frequent place.",

          "most famous son of austria",
          "I loved it seeing the birthplace of my favorite musician\u2661",
          "Great place to visit if you're staying more than two days in Salzburg. Otherwise it's fine just to see it from the outside and take a photo with the birthplace of Mozart.",
          "If you skip it loose nothing. Only in one room there are furnitures from the time, rest is only explanation.... No foto! The only interesting attraction! for me a little room, where you you can sit alone on a chair and listen to the music.",
          "It's beautiful place and great layout. Lots of cafe and reaustrant.",
          "one of a kind birthplace of Mozart",

          "Great very informative",
          "There are many information and nice work of Mozart and Mozart\u2019s family. I am quite surprise with the layout design of tour path and great to know more about Mozart. If you\u2019re fan of Mozart, you shouldn\u2019t miss it.",
          "This is where Wolfgang Mozart was born and spent some of his early childhood with his family. The house or rather what we'd now call an apartment is a a small museum and to be honest there really much to see. Even though I paid the combined \u2026",
          "Price was steep for an experience that wasn't all that exceptional. I would recommend only visiting the outside and reading the rest on Wikipedia rather than on the walls of the inside.",
          "Mozart's Birthplace takes you into history where a music prodigy evolved",
          "Beautiful place with their characteristic architecture. Mountain view with river on other side of road. Shopping and antiques shopes were there to collect souvenir for the trip memory.",
          "Visiting the museum is pretty short but still nice.\nNice design and decorating.",
          "Kind incredible that you get to visit this site. Its pretty badly located since is in the middle of a mayhem of shops and tons of obnoxious tourists. But great to have this site with great exhibit and info about this amazing artist and musician.",
          "Mozart's birthplace in Salzburg Austria. I was there in January. It was covered in snow and freezing cold but beautiful. I stayed in Munich and did a day trip by train to Salzburg for 49euro. Well worth it. We had a guide from England. He was very knowledgeable and entertaining. Definitely recommend.",
          "Just a house in a row of shops. You need to pay to visit the museum",

          "Bit overrun by tourists. Still a nice classic to visit.",
          "Nothing fancy about it. Nice house like almost any house in that street. You will find it easy because it is always crowded in front of the house. People are taking photos all the time, chit-chat and move on. There is not much to do there. \n\nDid not wanted to pay entry fee to visit a house inside, so cannot comment that segment.",
          "I really like Mozart so I'm so thankful I got the opportunity to visit this place. It was really educating and worth it at its price. The museum wasn't too busy! And the souvenir shop is really cute and not too expensive; I bought a really nice shirt!",
          "House full of replicas. Waste of time and money",
          "Nice museum but way too crowded!",
          "Rich exhibition and nice experience",
          "It was literally everything we expected it to be.",
          "I didn't visit the interior but I don't think it would have been worth the price either. Salzburg is nice though and well worth the visit",
          "So well maintained",
          "It tends to get too crowded. You can\u2019t seem to enjoy the experience with all the pushing around",
          "Not very exciting unfortunately. Mainly an old building not well presented, very hot during the summer and no pictures allowed (I mean with no flash of course).\nThere are some rooms with some paintings and notes for the Mozart family and \u2026",
          "It was A-OK place it was very very crowded and it was difficult to get in but their authorities are very very efficient in the way that manage displace actually this is one of the few places you have to visit while in salzburg",
          "Nice, Mozarts birthhouse. But thats about it. There is even a supermarket on the ground floor of this building.",
          "Great experience to see someones life from place where he was born to place where he lived in  just one kilometer. Definitly must see !",

          "An amazing place to visit with fascinating pieces. I learned so much that I didn't know! I only wish photography was allowed because I'd loved to have been able to capture all the cool things there were to take in all around me. Still just \u2026",
          "Actually there\u2019s nothing special. It\u2019s just like the usual Appartement.",
          "Vising the birth place of a legendary musician will make you nostalgic. Very well preserved heritage easy to spot and can be easily reached. No wonder such a musician was born in this beautiful city of Salzburg. It was interesting to know that famous physicist Doppler's house is next to Mozart house.",

          "Beautiful place surrounded by all brand shops. Love this place in the evening.",
          "Great place for the greatest musician of all time!",
          "Some artifacts are interesting but large portions of the space are dedicated to family members also I find the entire premise of the museum is undermined by the fact that Mozart hated Salzburg and endeavored to leave as soon as possible. \u2026",
          "Fantastic place full of history. A must see for the classic lover",
          "Overpriced. However the main cause of disappointment here was how rude the staff at the entrance and reception were",

          "It's interesting and worth the visit to see the personal effects of the man and his immediate family.  I especially enjoyed the letters, music sheets and seeing two of his pianos.  The self guided tour app is convenient.  Three stars \u2026",
          "A must in Salzburg. Decently priced and not over crowded.",
          "Only the outside as walking guide gave a short history of Mozart",
          "This place doesn't need a review. It's a must visit if you are in Salzburg for obvious reasons. The only minus was,  it felt a little stuffy and sweaty in the enclosed rooms because of the large gathering of tourists and absence of proper cooling measures.",

          "we are not musician..so just little thing to see",
          "A museum that seems small from the inside but contains a vast amount of information that you probably didn't know in the inside.  Would definitely recommend a visit to. However, it's not wheel-chair accessible for architectural reasons. Might be pricey but in my opinion it's worth it.",

          "Takes us back in time to Mozart's birthplace... It is maintained well.. plan to spend 2-3 hours for a mozart fan",
          "It's okay. You get to learn a lot about Mozart's family and the circumstances he lived in, mostly during his youth. It was sad to see heated rooms with the door wide open to the outside. You also need to go outside to go from one section to \u2026",
          "The house was built in the 12th century on ground which had been part of the garden belonging to the Benedictine monks of St Peter's, Salzburg.",

          "Interesting visit to what is \"reportedly\" his birthplace",
          "Expensive",
          "An absolute must see in Salzburg. Mozart is Salzburg's most famous child and linked to this beautiful city forever. His birthplace is therefore a starting point to explore more about the life of this famous composer. You don't even have to go inside. Just admiring the outside is enough.",

          "Its pretty nice",
          "It's a good place to get a brief overview over Mozart, but nothing more. Otherwise it's basically an old house with white walls. If you want to learn more about him, it's probably better to head over to the Wikipedia page. Due to the Salzburg card, my visit was free, otherwise I'd regret paying the entrance.",
          "Great potted history of the very short life of a true artistic genius.",
          "Here is like a museum. The rooms are small, narrow and sometimes is crowded. This place is a big attraction is Salzburg. Mozart is a famous musician and of course the people are proud.",
          "Worth the money to see Mozart's birthplace!:)",
          "We learn that young Mozart live in a small apartment in Salzburg and compose songs with small piano that lighter and two octaves shorter than modern piano. It is a small house-museum with some original furnitures and letters, also Mozart \u2026",

          "Excellent place to visit if you are into cars or planes or motorbikes. Can\u2019t quite believe that it is free, so thanks Red Bull. Very easy to get to from central Salzburg, Number 2 or 10 bus stops very close and means just a short walk. A must visit if you are in Salzburg.",

          "We loved the exhibition! The entrance was free of charge but the shop was already closed at around 7 p.m. when we visited. The toilets are on another level. Would recommend!",
          "As a huge fan of a modern architecture, technology & food this a a must. The main building looks like a contrustrion from space station and contains many iconic Red Bull machines & achievements. Surroundings are clean, comfy and filled with small seatings, private corners AND",
          "The hanger has many different planes, and cars from the Red Bull Family. We we're lucky enough to see the DC-6 out of the hanger. The F1 cars were great but to see Felix Baumgartner' historic flight suit and capsule was the highlight. Worth the visit.",
          "Awaiting check in and bag drop at the airport we decided spur of the moment to take a visit here. In a taxi it took 5mins tops and about 7 euros from the airport. FYI luggage can be left in large baggage area for 4 euros a bag for a few hours which was a bonus! We arrived",
          "I was in the bar in the 2nd floor, absolutly top. the museum at the ground floor is a must for every plane-fan and formula1 fan. The architecture is unique and a top spot in Salzburg",

          "An unique exhibition of racing cars, planes or super interesting things like the Baumgartner\u00b4s module. I was impressed. It\u00b4s a must see thing in Salzburg even when you\u00b4re not a racing fan. The exhibition is for free including free parking.",
          "Hangar 7 is a fun place to visit with plenty to see from F1 cars to Red Bull Air Race planes. A real highlight is seeing Felix Baumgartner\u2019s Red Bull Stratos. To get to Hangar 7 take the number 2 bus from the city centre to Karolingerstase. Entry is free which is an added bonus.",
          "We went to The Castle first (up with cable car - 1min, all inclusive ticket) and after walked to Hangar-7 (around 30min chill walk). It was great, impressive, modern, free entrance, 3 restaurants/bars for a beer afterwards. If lucky, you can see a red bull plane or helicopter",
          "Whether you are a kid or adult you will enjoy this place if you like airplanes. This is basically a hanger next to Salzburg airport where they have displayed some of the vintage aircrafts including the ones used in WW-2. There are couple of F1 cars also on display. There is a",

          "I had heard this was a fantastic collection. It is easy to find and ample parking. Addmission is free. We were there late summer and it is in a clear dome so the sun was very warm. There are better collections in the United States.",
          "I love Red Bull motorsports and adventure so this was awesome for me; my family, not quite so much although they still enjoyed it. The concept, setting and exhibits are brilliant and I had a whale of a time wandering around looking. A surprise element was the external cafe and",
          "When you come here and see all the vehicles, you would presume its just a Collection. But take the guided tour and learn more on how this space combines love for architecture, art and horsepower.",
          "Really nice place! I enjoyed the collection of beautiful vehicles (enter is free!), had a tasty fresh lunch.",
          "Great to walk around the large collection of vehicles and learn about the feats of red bull- like the near space free fall and air racing. Good bar and cocktail place, simple lunch like club sandwiches. A few of the eating/drinking places were closed on our daytime visit.",
          "This is a good spot to stop for wifi, beer, and the hamburger isn't too bad either. A good spot for people watching and they have some sports too.",
          "I've got to say: I was unimpressed. I love Red Bull because of the sponsorships they provide and the crazy cool videos those people produce, so was excited to see the machines and maybe the stories with those machines. The stuff here just wasn't all that interesting. I found the",
          "Visited after a local friend recommended it as a good way to kill an hour or two before a flight. It's a fascinating building with a small collection of aircraft, cars, motorcycles and other vehicles including a cable car! Even the toilet signs are interesting! Had a coffee on",
          "This is a great glass building just beside the Salzburg airport. You can visit before you are leaving Salzburg or by car, just before you drive to A1 highway. Formula cars, motorbikes, planes and of course a corner for Felix Baumgartner who jumped from the edge of atmosphere to",

          "Hangar-7 is awesome, the building's architecture and planes/cars/helicopters on display were very interesting. If you are in the area and can make it there, I would recommend going. Even on a rainy day, the views of the airport were spectacular. Displays from the Strato jump,",
          "Really relaxed place, some great cars, bikes etc inside. If you have couple hours free then head down here, close to airport so if you are early for your flight its a great visit!",
          "First of all i was surprised because i didn't know that red bull was an austrian company Its only four stops after the salburg airport with thee bus and the entrance is free Inside the museum you can find many vehicles that red bull has sponshored and their history !!! The",
          "If you want to escape the history of Salzburg for just a minute and enjoy some futuristic exhibitons this is the place to go. The pieces inside change, but you always see different planes, helicopters, formula one cars, and basically most of the things Red Bull sponsors. My fave",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Hanger-7 and it's collection of Red Bull vehicles including planes, helicopters and Formula One cars. Also hosts a number of bars and restaurants in a smart modern setting. It's reachable on foot from the airport (ask at information desk for",
          "Good detour if you have a stopover in Salzburg. Voted in the top 10 things to do in Salzburg, we had some time before our train journey so we jumped in a cab and went to look at a few expensive toys owned by the RedBull owner. It takes about an hour to walk around the hangar and",
          "Were really excited (especially for the kids!) to stroll around this museum, but too bad its closed until 4th of January! Not communicated well enough through the hangar-7 site (found a very small dynamic text 'good to know' cycling with other texts) and tripadvisor says it's",
          "We came here to kill time for a couple of hours before our lunchtime flight. We stopped for breakfast first which seemed very posh and was a real end of trip treat. The exhibition was very interesting considering it was free. Staff were also very helpful and looked after our",
          "easy to find next to the airport, parking place attached and for free, free entrance, what you wanna more? go there if you are near, park your car, see some great cars and planes and helis, get a coffee and leave... cool place, uncomplicated. very nice!!",
          "This is the most awesome museum I have ever visited. The building is a hangar made of specially made glass. There are tons of cool vehicles of Red bull, including aircrafts, helicopter, aircrafts, formula one racing cars, fabulous cars, and so on. We were introduced nicely. All",
          "3minute drive from Airport Terminal, it features a selection of Airplanes, F1 cars and other vehicles... Definitely cool to see the branding - but then again, if you are just a casual tourist interested in checking it out, not worth more than a 10minute walk around... Very",
          "Formula 1 , Jet Fighters , planes , helicopters , ballons taking humans to 130,000 feet at the edge of space to jump out - Dietrich Mateschitz's personal toy chest does not disappoint. Near Salzburg's very modest airport, this hangar 7 has a world class Red Bull trinket and",
          "This is 100% worth going to! It was the best thing we went to in Salzburg. The collection is reasonably small, but well presented. We enjoyed being able to get close up to things which you would never normally see. The building itself is great, and very nice to look at. We had",

          "Not intending to visit but too good to miss if passing the airport with boys of a certain age. Car parking is opposite, no charge, entry free Inside is a school boys dream of gleaming F1 cars, planes and other man cave materials. Cafe looked amazing, but perhaps if eating",
          "Just passing at night, stopped in out of curiosity. Lighting was different, but planes and race cars were \"right there\" on view. These are working pieces, ready to go, and the display changes often. Amazing machinery and great hanger!",
          "Hangar 7 is a must see in Salzburg. it's a little fat from the city, at the Airport but worth the trip. A hangar full of restored and Functional early 20th century aircraft , F1 cars and Beer at the cafe ...can't get better.",

          "It's really nice if you are a fan of Red Bull as a company or even if you are only interested to see a F1 car. I loved to see the suite of Felix Baumgartner for crossing the English Channel and the capsule for the stratosphere jump. Very nice for a short visit especially in the",
          "A nice place to spend a couple of hours looking at race cars, planes and motorcycles of Red Bull. Our kids (9 and 12) loved it :) The place is not very big, so one hour should be more than enough. There is a small cafeteria at the Hangar for those wishing to extend their stay :)",
          "If you have a teenager son like I have-he is going to love hangar 7 and think it is cool. If you sometimes feel like a teenager, you are going to love hangar 7 and think it is cool. It is free and has free parking-what else can you want? Of course, if an assortment of airplanes",

          "It's a small collection of red bull engineering i.e. cars and aeroplanes. My husband and I are both formula 1 fans so we really enjoyed seeing those cars up close. It's a small collection but you can easily spend the best part of an hour there and even longer if you want a drink",
          "Worth visiting if you are with kids or if you are interested in racing / sports in general. The museum/hangar itself is unique given its architecture and design. Inside you will find a lot of interesting stuff ranging from vehicles, planes and helicopters to statues and",
          "The planes and cars on display were amazing. It was a bit smaller than we expected. The resturant looked interesting but we had just eaten before we went. It looks like it would be very good for hospitality events.",

          "We went there to spent some spare time. It was really interesting to see all the planes, helicopters and vehicles - F1's. You can buy ice cream by the entrance and parking is available. There is also a restaurant but its more on the pricey side. No entrance fee. It's a good",

          "How often can you enter a very modern hangar structure filled with beautifully restored vintage aircraft for free? As a warbird enthusiast, I can tell you, not often. However, Red Bull generously opens this facility for free. Now, some heads up here. First, there is no guarentee",

          "This was an amazing place to see! The building itself was worth seeing. An extra credit for a free place to visit (we had been sightseeing in Innsbruck and Salzburg a few days earlier and spent hundeds of euros just to get in to places). The staff was friendly and helpful when",
          "If you have a son claiming he will be a pilot, you have no way to escape visiting this facility :) Nicely done, keep the inovation level at this high level! Sorry to have seen the Tito's DC only from far.. but the feeling of looking at the continuously changing system",
          "We made a short stop here on our way home from vacation in Italy. It has an small but good collection of cars and aeroplanes. Even the kids thought it was interresting. Go here to spend an hour if you are in the area, its well worth the time and it is also free.",

          "I came here on a Sunday morning and it was popular for brunch diners. The line was out the door as it's not possible to book. The exhibits are ever changing so if there's something you want to see, check first. The building itself if very interesting for the architecture",

The amount of planes, formula one cars and helicopter squeezed into the hanger is impressive. You will want to take a pic of each",

          "What a neat place to see. Had no idea Red Bull was based in Salzburg. Corporate HQ was stunning as well.",
          "Im not fond of machines, but I think it was nothing special. There were just one big exhibition space and some plane, helicopter and F1 cars. The best thing was the enviroinment and one transformers robot. It is a good idea if you're in the neighborhood and you have half an hour.",

          "My family did the salt mine tour in Berchtesgaden while road-tripping through Germany, and I had read that this was a great place to stop by while we were in the area. If you're driving yourself, be aware that the \"freeways\" in Austria are toll roads and you need a toll sticker",

          "Just shows you when people make a huge amount of money on a pointless invention they just don't know what to do with their money. Also the bus drivers must not like tourist outside the city; we got left at the bus stop. Good place to go to the bathroom its clean!",
          "Went here and had coffee and pancakes. The exhibition is free and covers all things Red Bull related, including F1 and flying exploits and Felix Baumgartners epic free fall from the edge of space. The bar serves coffee, tea and a selection of light meals and snacks. If you're a",

          "It is pretty close to the airport. Took us 5 mins to get to the airport by taxi and it was around 9Euros. Worth to visit to see the free-fall suit Felix Baumgartner used along with race cars and multiple planes. One of the planes was the one actually landed on Mt Everest. On the",
          "We had a pit stop at Red Bull Hangar 7 before heading to the Salzburg Airport. Great time to spend about an hour in the hangar and cool restaurant / bars such as Ikarus, Carpe Diem and Mayday Bar. Guest chefs from around the world cook at Ikarus Bar and you can try interesting",

          "The home of Red Bull is worthy of a visit. In complete contrast to historical Salzburg, is another piece of history, the toys of the Red Bull team. Free entry is a bonus and you'll enjoy walking around this model hangar of fast cars, planes and toys. Enjoyed a tasty coffee in",

          "I had the impression to be in the temple of Red Bull. The entry is free. If you feel to consume something you can choose from 2 bars and a cafe. One of the bars is right under the ceiling and has a glas floor, so I would not wear a skirt or kilt ;) I was there for breakfast",
          "We got dropped at Hangar 7 on the way back to the airport. The lovely staff kindly looked after our luggage whilst we walked around the hangar. A stunning modern art building. The centre roof is an engine shape and is all glass and if you look closely you can see a hidden bar",

          "The very best you can trust on is, that it doesn't matter, which exposition is actually running. I wasn't bored, whenever I've been there and I was there at least twice each year since 2004. Due to the architecture, it is nice to stay there with bad weather. At sunny days it is",
          "My teen sons were thrilled to look at all the race cars, airplanes and helicopters on exhibit. It is a very interesting space and definitely worth your time to stop in, especially if you have a car to get to it. It really feels like you have stepped into some Bond villain's",
          "This was quite unexpected, but the items on display are amazing! Seriously, you'd never know what it was from the outside - no signage on the street and not in a particularly central location, but it was easy enough to get to on the bus. Definitely worth a visit",
          "This attraction is free to get in. It is one hanger styled building filled with Red Bull helicopters, cars, aeroplanes, space items and bikes. Interesting for maybe an hou unless you are a Red Bull enthusiast. Small Red Bull shop there plus cafe/bar and restaurant which were all",
          "Whether it's F1, NASCAR or Areobatics Red Bull Hanger - 7 will have something for you. Although the iconic F1 cars dominate take a look at the incredible capsule that Felix Baumgartner rode to the edge of space, and then jumped out! Although we didn't use it there is a wonderful",

          "This is a very fun place for kids and parents to enjoy. Very interesting especially if you like to travel. The area is very pretty and it's different than the old town. Worth the visit.",
          "The venue looks great but unless you are an F1 fan wh wants to stand within a few fet of some retired F1 cars there is nothing in the \"museum\" to provide engagement for more than a few minutes. The bars are VERY expensive and the restaurant prices were eye watering. We (there",
          "Pouring rain the afternoon I arrived in Salzburg so perfect opportunity to visit this gem. Took the #2 bus from right outside my hotel to near the airport (Karolingerstrasse stop) and walked the rest of the way to the Hangar. Huge custom built hangar with a sizeable inventory",

Bus is easy to get on, buy your tickets from",

          "Hanger 7 is a cool airplane hanger, but not as large as we expected it to be. We were disappointed by what the website portrayed and what was actually there. It's much smaller than what you expect but not to be missed! Restuarant on site was great, cool exhibits, very awesome",
          "Free entry and parking - why wouldn't you visit! The hangar building itself is simply stunning to see and inside is a trove of aeroplanes, F1 cars, helicopters, trophies and many other treasures of engineering! There is a restaurant and caf\u00e9 bar onsite as well as a redbull",

          "Oh how the other half lives. Must admit wife and I are a couple of petrol heads that follow F1 but I am not the biggest Red Bull fan and so wasn't exactly dragged here scrapping my heels but wasn't hankering either. However, this is all free and visitors are made most welcome",
          "Not having looked up any imagery for this place, it genuinely made my eyes 'pop' when we drove up to the free adjacent parking. Whatever might be Red Bull's motivation for creating and showing off such a magnificent piece of modern architecture, a superb array of racing cars",
          "A \"must do\" on your bucket list. Very modern, interesting, organization. FREE! (which was a plus) If you\"re interested in the history of Red Bull, this is the place to visit! (I would also recommend Red Bull world is Salzburg!",

          "This is a great place to visit for a couple of hours. It\u2019s free to enter this very futuristic building which holds the Red Bull collection of Cars, Bikes, and Planes including quite a few F1 cars. For anyone not interested in the metal wear there is a couple of excellent cafes",
          "I drove from Munich to Salzburg on the Autobahn. It was a nice drive in early summer of 2010. Hangar 7 is a museum for Dietrich Mateshitz collection of race cars and aircraft. The Hangar is big and there are a few places within to grab a snack or drink. There is a cigar lounge",
          "1. The hangar is an architectural masterpiece. 2. The collection of planes and helicopters is amazing.",
          "It is a very modern hangar and beautiful displays of aircraft, cars and motorbikes. The restaurant was close while we were there. The flower arrangements in the bathroom were something to see. We were very lucky to be here when it was the 90th celebration of Salzburg airport.",
          "You rather book a breakfast table before arriving. The food experience is exquisite and worth to try. The place is full of details you will appreciate whether architecture, interior design, statues, expositions.",
          "For a free venue it was a very good place to visit, espacially on a rainy day. The main exhibition is of different aircrafts, racing cars and motorcycles. There are also changing photoraghs exhibition. When we were there there were preperations for a live tv sports show, which",
          "We revisited this place, again, this year. Again it was verry nice, althogh they have changed something, is verry nice.",
          "Friendly service, sometimes too slowly at the bar if busy, large offer of drinks, great view over the collected airplanes",
          "This is a great place that reminds you that Salzburg is more than Mozart, Fortreses and Baroque buildings. This is a fun place for all those that love planes and automobiles. A great array of machinery. If you can go, the restaurant looks fabulous too.",
          "It was great. There were lot of interesting Red Bull things. It 's only for people who are interested in it. Not a day trip, just one hour.",
          "i alsways recommend to stop in hangar 7 to everyone who is visitng Salzburg or just passing by to other destination, it is close to the highway, free of charge, very interesting short stop. And particulary tasty coffe in their caf\u00e9\u00e9.",
          "Hubby loves planes & I love F1 cars so overall we were in heaven. Beautiful display of various aircraft, helicopters, cars, bikes etc. Stunning building. Just incredible architecture & so great you get to see the entire collection for free. Definitely worth a visit. Easily",
          "We came especially on our trip to Salzburg and based on TripAdvisor recommendations. It is nice to be there, interesting exhibits, light glass and metal building. Overall visit is about one hour not more otherwise you want to sit and take a coffee or sandwich. Good to visit but",
          "Hanger 7 is at the Salzburg airport. It contains a wonderful variety of aircraft and cars that are either part of the Red Bull racing teams or part of the collection. You can see it in an hour unless you elect to dine or drink in one of the facilities that are part of the place.",
          "It is very good place to visit if you pass by this hanger. Many numbers of race cars, motor cycles and some army airplanes. One hour is more than enough. There is a coffee shop if you would like to drink. Just if you are passing by.",
          "It is a great place to see with many pretty planes and such. Just be aware to choose the parking just opposite side of the road, not as us, on the same side just before...",
          "We went for lunch and a visit to the museum. The cars were interesting and the aircraft bought back memories of some models I'd built as a kid. Free enrty so top value",
          "Something to do in Salzburg on a rainy day, specially if you travel with teenagers ir Red Bull Formula 1 Fans. The architecture is interesting and the Michelin Awarded Icarus restaurant worth a visit if you are a foodie, have a previous reservation and don't mind spending 180\u20ac",
          "On a rainy day in Salzburg this was a lovely warm way to spend an hour or so. The silver P-38 Lightning was a particular highlight. There was also a decent photo exhibition so a little something for those who aren't particularly interested in motors. The options for food looked",
          "This is a spectacular looking glass dome that houses historic aircraft and old racing cars. You could visit here just for the architecture of the building but if you are a fan of aviation or racing it's a must visit destination. And the entrance is free. The exhibited collection",
          "Wasn't too sure what to expect with this but thought we would give it a go whilst we were in Salzburg. And we were very glad we did - exhibition offered a lot to look at - numerous F1 and touring/ sports cars, planes, Felix Baumgartner section. All good for a 2 hour visit that",
          "Fun place to have a drink or a posh meal. Arrive early to have look at the planes and helicopters on display in the glass domed hangar. If you are lucky, there is a bat tight at the top of the dome. (It was closed when we visited because it was too hot on a sunny summer day.)",

          "Situated right next to the airport (city side) this is a mist stop attraction for anyone that loves motorsports, planes, adrenaline sports and families. It's a huge air conditioned glass hanger full of Red Bull Toys. The display changes frequently so you never know what you",
          "Great place to visit. Our kids love it. I love it. Kids love formula... and a lot of airplanes... we really recomend.",
          "Unless you are a great fan of cars, and even if you are, this place is quite boaring. Not a big selection and nothing special in the hanger. Skip!",

          "The amount of expensive, fast, high powered gear in this building is amazing. Well set out, easy to get to by local bus from town it's a good way to spend a few hours. The coffee shop was very reasonably priced and the toilets were spectacular! The size of the rest rooms and",
          "I don't really like planes and helicpters but when I heard that there is a real F1 car it was obvious that I have to visit this place. It's one of the best designed F1 car in the history I think so it's worth to visit for every F1 fan.",
          "We went there with two children. The two-year-old thought it was kind of cool, and the eight-year-old thought it would be funnier if we could try the objects.",
          "If you have time, its well worth the visit. The glass structure is impressive and the collection of cars, planes and electronic gadgets are fun to watch.Probably every guys dream.",
          "Talk about a great brand experience. If you're interested in planes or race cars, this is a pretty cool place to visit. They also have a Michelin star restaurant. I didn't eat at it, but we did eat at the out door lounge, which had great food, the atmosphere of a beach lounge",
          "Loved seeing the Redbull toys. Free admission and definitely worth the stop as we drove by. The kids enjoyed the race cars and jets.",
          "A spectacular building filled with amazing airplanes, helicopters, racing cars etc. Everything is made so stylishly. Beautiful live piano music was playing and filling the whole building. If you are visiting Salzburg be sure to have a look at this masterpiece. Entrance is free!",
          "An amazing place,full of beautiful cars and planes.Great art work.So well done,being a car racing fan I was in 7th heaven ( excuse the pun). Great cafe for coffee or a meal. Be sure to visit the toilets they are truly amazing!!!!!!!!",
          "Please do your navigation homework of have a guide take you there. It is co-located to a active international airport runway (which adds to the experience). It is a excellent display for the fine Red Bull collection. It serves as a exhibition hall, museum, Red Bull gizmo shop,",
          "This venue will be my forever favorite place as hubby proposed to me here. It was the most romantic set up. They booked the bar upstairs overlooking the whole hangar and private plane collection just for 2 of us for 30 mins and we enjoyed a bottle of champagne. Spectacular view",
          "I took my niece and her boyfriend (both aged 15) and while I'm a bit whatever about the place, they seemed to enjoy it. Now, you need to understand that this is a showcase for the Company Red Bull and that no normal person would go there for eductaional purposes. It's just a",
          "Hangar 7 was really cool to see all the planes and F1 cars. It's free to et in and easy to get there using public transport. Also, make sure you have a drink in the Mayday bar, it's slightly pricey but you've got in the place for free anyway!",
          "Our visit was unanticipated, but I'm glad we went. I enjoyed the architecture of the building and interior design more than the displays, but that's subjective. There were plenty of race cars, planes, helicopters, and other vehicles displayed in this \"working\" hanger. They were",
          "Did not realise it was just a popular canned drink.So much to see and very interesting.The cars are amazing close up.Well worth a visit.Take your time you,ll be amazed.",
          "A fabulous place for people who love racing, planes & bikes. The place has a history & is perfect for an instagram moment. We spent a clear 2 hours here because the guys refused to leave. It's better to take a taxi from the city to the Hangar. There's a cafe that serves short",
          "My brother, who is studying to be a pilot could have spent all day here. It is free to the public and pretty awesome for anyone interested in airplanes, helicopters or racecars. We made the mistake of eating beforehand, as there was a cafe and a restaurant both of which looked",

          "We visited with my grandparents on a warm June day... It rather hot in the hangar which was a problem for my 85 year old grandmother, since she started feeling dizzy... But there were sofas available where she could sit down... And we had a drink at the cafe... We really enjoyed",
          "The food was delicious, the setting spectacular, the service flawless. We chose the 8 course dinner, and while the portions were small, it was WAY too much food. But what amazing food. The service was impeccable. Go hungry and enjoy the toys before you sit for a wonderful dinner.",
          "This attraction is OK, definitely not a bucket list thing to do. Only some displays had information, then there was only 1 display in English which has the word Australian spelt incorrectly. Very poor. Everything else in German, I heard a few people complain about how",

          "Paid an unexpected visit to this venue, whilst staying nearby. It's a Red Bull museum close to Salzburg airport and literally near nowhere! It does have a lovely restaurant, and bars including a Sky bar. Bar does fab cocktails (all served with a form of Red Bull) and",
          "it can be seen on the way to the mountains. its a pretty cool place for bike and plane lovers. excellent place for spending 2-3 hours",
          "An amazing concept, not only for helicopter and plane fans. It is one of a kind - superb in any way, still nothing I would go to over and over again, hence \"only\" the \"very good\".",
          "This was recommended by new friends that we met at Krimplestatter. Lots of cool planes, motorcycles and cars on display. Small RB gift shop and world class restaurant that changes menus (new international chef) monthly.......we did not have time to experience. Hanger is all",
          "At first glance it looks great since it's free. However after an hours walk the ten minutes it takes to walk around the place isn't worth it. Very little to see even for avid car/aeroplane fans.",
          "Simply breathtaking beautiful. Located right next to the airport, Hangar 7 is owned by the creator of Red Bull and houses his numerous planes as well as a host of Formula 1 cars Admission I personally find a little pricey. But investable for a one time thing.. There are also",
          "This was recommended as a \"rainy day\" attraction. Evidently it has some kind of special restaurant with visiting chefs, but if you're not eating, sleeping it's just a big Red Bull commercial. You're through it in 10 minutes. Rainy days are better served at museums!",
          "This place is very very close to the airport or else you can take a bus from Salzburg.It takes 30 minutes to see this place.My husband was very keen to visit hangar7.It has many F1 cars,aircrafts and cars on display.Nice to see them.Entry is free.It is a silent place.Its fun to",
          "Free and clean. All in working order and spectacularly clean. Down to the flowers in the underground bathrooms, everything is amazing. You do not need to be a petrol head to enjoy your time here. I went as it had been highly recommended but was not expecting it to be as good",
          "On our way out of town to see something else, we decided to stop in on the recommendation of a family member who had been here. I didn't hold out much hope of this being anything more than a bunch of Red Bull memorabilia. Correct, but it was a different kind of memorabilia -",
          "So, I like aircraft museums. This isn't what it is per-se, but in the end, it is a nice display of various aircraft and vehicles. Hangar-7 is free, which is nice. It is small, so don't expect to spend much time there. And, apparently what is on display rotates once and a",
          "A must visit for young people and adventure lovers. The place has got formula one cars including one driven by Sebastian Vettel. Many planes used for aerobatics are displayed. The highpoint of the place is the suit used by Felix Baumgartner, who holds the world record for sky",
          "Worth a visit if you have the time and/or to avoid the rain. My friend and I visited on our final day in Salzburg after having seen and done everything that we had wanted. It was a rainy day and whilst not really our thing, admission is free, and the bars & restaurants (and even",
          "A good place to spend a couple of hours, food very good and interesting to see all the red bull planes and F1 cars",
          "Very well presented of course, nice exhibition of extraordinary planes and cars. The gift shop is small and ridiculously overpriced. Bummer. The restaurants are more clubby than typical for a family. So don't take the kids there hoping for something they will like. Probably",
          "This was the first attraction we saw. Took us about 15 minutes to walk from the airport to get to it, but it was quite a good museum. Everything of Red Bull on display oh and the number 10 bus outside it goes into the city so happy days!",

          "Whoever had the idea of HANGER7 should be given a knighthood ( or whatever the Austrians give folk who excel in a specific area). This is a superb place to visit to see aircraft, cars, helicopters, in fact anything associated with Red Bull. The building itself is stunning and",
          "I've only a passing interest in seeing F1 cars & planes etc. - but the building is very impressive and well presented; I'm sure its a great place for Red Bull to have for corporate events etc. You certainly have to know where you're going as going by public transport (bus) from",
          "I'm not hugely into F1 cars and aircraft but I do find them generally impressive. This is a wonderful collection of rare items, all housed in an impressive building. Best of all it's free (unexpected but nice!). Had lunch in the cafe on the ground floor. As previous reviews",
          "I'll be honest, at first the hangar sounded boring to me. I'm not into planes or automobiles, so it wasn't really resonating as a place I'd enjoy. After spending 30 mins perusing the hangar and 45 mins at the champagne bar, I can now say it is one of my favorite places in the",
          "We went to the sky bar and had some interesting drinks/food in glasses. We got this as a gift. Fun view, great flavors, nice date atmosphere. Unfortunately we went on a night when the hanger was rented out to a private business party did loud presentations the whole time. But we",

          "We went there just before our dinner at Ikarus. (around 19:00) It was dark outside so the lighting inside made it extra spectacular. We just walked around for 15 minutes, it was enough for us. We found it really impressive and interesting what Red Bull have accomplished.",
          "My family and I rented a car to drive around Salzburg, and we decided to stop for a while. The structure was modern and impressive, the exhibitions as well. They were on one floor only and restaurants were upstairs. I do recommend going outside to enjoy the beautiful",
          "It is perfect stop if you are to explore more than historic Salzburg. Car or public transport is necessary, but you will be awarded with very nice exhibition of Red Bull cars, planes and choppers. Free of charge entrance, even you can enjoy perfect African tea and coffee, also",
          "Very interesting for all Redbull auto-moto-avio fans. I would just looove to have the opportunity to dine in Ikarus restaruant... Nice smell of fresh flowers in toilet room. I recommend a visit! Free parking and close to the city centre of Salzburg!",

          "very interesting trip if your into Red Bull. A good chance to see the cars, planes and other vehicles close up. It only takes about an hour to see everything so unless your booked into one of the restaurants I wouldn't advise a special trip out of the town for this but wait",
          "Great exhibition and display! Quite some airplanes, helicopters and racing cars. We were told that the exhibits are still operational. Good way to spend time when it rains. Hungar 7 is near the airport. Easy to get here by bus Obus2 from the Main train station (Hauptbahnhof),",

          "Thank you for making this great attraction which is free to enter and explore the incredible flying machines as well as all of the racing cars and bikes. This is serious man/woman cave for the rev head nut out there and you can get up close and even touch some of the exhibits.",

          "Hanger 7 is a FREE exhibition with a brilliant display of vintage aircraft, F1 cars, motorbikes, helicopters etc which shouldn't be missed. Set up by the head of Red Bull the hanger is a glass construction very close to the Airport easily accessible by bus from Salzburg.",
          "We visited on our way out of Salzburg and it was well worth a stop - you could spend much more time there than the 45min we did! Ideal if you are into all things fast!",
          "Fun place to visit if you have 2 spare hours before your flight. This hangar is very close to the airport. So basically this is very modern, chic and sleek hangar filled with collection of different vehicles used by Red Bull teams all over the world. If you like jet planes,",
          "We were there with a nice group of friends...we enjoyed the museum especially that Felix Baumgartner is a super hero--(great-since we carry same name) We had lunch at the restaurant which offers each month a different chef's variety... It is rather overpriced -but quite trendy!!",
          "Perfect for pre dinner activity, we went there to the red bull illume exhibition, which was really nice. Right after that a drink at the bar and then in the city for dinner. Perfect evening.",
          "The location is amazing even though it's quite difficult to reach there if you are a tourist. The menu is quite \"poor\" of choices and it's expensive for young travelers. Spend some time to taste a nice cigar, they have a nice selection.",
          "Walking into the surreal hangar which was stacked with Formula 1cars, aeroplanes from WWII and a life size statue of Felix Baumgartener, these guys know how to create a buzz! A must visit, they have a lovely restaurant that needs to be booked in advance. A wonderful day out.",
          "Visited Hangar 7 whilst on a weekend in Salzburg. Whilst the ladies went shopping we men folk hopped on the trolleybus from the centre and spent a few hours in this wonderful museum. Very imaginative layout and building design allowing plenty of space to view the exhibits from",

          "As soon as I booked our holiday to Salzburg, I wanted to go to hangar 7. As a aircraft engineer myself, and a regular airshow visitor, I have a very strong interest in aircraft and the formula 1 stuff was a added bonus. The star of the collection for me is the DC6, which is",
          "Considering it is free to go in, if you are interested in Red Bull or the cars/planes it is worth a visit. We were with friends who drove us, so not sure how much a taxi would cost, but it wouldn't be much. We enjoyed have a wander round, looking at the different vehicles on",
          "I read in the brochure that not all the planes would be available at all times. I very much enjoyed the museum but was also disappointed that none of the WW2 planes were on display. They were all in the maintenance hangar teasingly close to Hangar 7. The museum was a good",

          "I had found this place before my visit and I'm glad I did! There isn't any clear signage leading you to the hangar and you're left to track it down on your own. I caught a bus from near the taxi rank, they are regular. On arrival the building looks like an architectural wonder!",
          "What a cool place to visit!! There are so many cool Red Bull airplanes, cars, etc. to see. They also have a bar suspended from the roof, but it didn't open at the time stated, so you may want to call to find out if it will be open. They seem to be an awesome place to have a",
          "Not a large place but you can see quite a large number of Red Bull branded planes, F1 cars, helicopters as well as high altitude jump pod. Free admission and would not take long to walk around.",
          "It's a bit off the beaten track but well worth a visit. Hugely impressive large, modern hangar containing various Red Bull-linked items - F1 cars, planes, motorcycles, helicopters, etc. All beatifully presented - no expense has been spared in creating this small attraction. Even",
          "Great place to visit if you like all things SPEED! I'm an F1 fan and there were plenty of original Red Bull racing formula 1 cars there along with some planes, helicopters, nascar, Indy car. Entry is free. To get there, take the #10 bus towards the Flughafen/Airport, you can get",
          "Ok. But not worth the effort unless you want to see race cars and planes, or love Red Bull. We had no idea Red Bull was made in Salzburg.",
          "I'm a fan of airplanes so this was a must stop sight to see the chrome b-25. I was surprised at how many vehicles they had in there. If you love red bull, aircraft or motor sports this is a must stop location. The building was very modern and had a nice open feel to it.",
          "Really cool place to spend an hour looking around at all the cool cars and planes. Neat place to eat and drink on the 2nd and 3rd floor.",

          "Very unique place with snazzy race cars, bi-planes and helicopters on display. There are eating areas too - bar, cafe, restaurant, outdoor cafe. Each week or month is a different famous chef. Make reservations at least a few days or weeks in advance if you want to eat at the",
          "We loved the Hangar. It has a fascinating collection of F1 cars, choppers, planes etc. Wonderful architecture, the building is beautiful. There are a few interactive facilities available. There is a wide range of restaurants/coffee bars etc. to chose from. A great place to visit",
          "Small but good collection of historical airplanes, choppers, formula 1 cars. motorbikes and none other than a small exhibit of Felix Baumgartner",
          "What reminds of Red Bull is the energy drink and the F1 cars with associated names like that of Sebastian Vettel. The place is good to visit if one is interested in seeing F1 cars, historical planes, choppers and bikes, all with Red Bull brand. The hangar is a covered glass",
          "Great to visit on a wet day or if you have some time to kill before flying home. The exhibits do vary due to if they have any competitions etc or any events going on inside highly recommend you check their website before visiting as if they do have anything on then the opening",

          "My partner planned a trip to this museum as part of our road trip and we had a really nice evening here. Although the museum is not very big it was fascinating to see and we had some nice cocktails (with red bull of course!) and a lovely meal at the outdoor lounge - it was a",
          "The only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars has nothing to do with the Hangar itself, with a rather spectacular private collection of planes & hellicopters (and an ocassional racing car), it has more to do with a fact that dining in one of its restaurants requires very",
          "Good museum.I would agree with most comments about the building etc. However,I was a bit disappointed that none of the aircraft I would have really liked to have seen were on display. The DC - 6 and B25 Mitchell were in the maintenance hangar which wasn't accessible to the",
          "We walked from our hotel located in old town so it took about an hour to actually make it out here. It was definitely a change of pace to see such a modern looking building after being surrounded by the historical area we took off from! Like walking into a spaceship !",
          "This is not only a great restaurant, it's an awesome experience! the restaurant is at the airport inside a brand new hangar with a huge collection of the top planes, fighter jets, helicopters, racing cars and motorcycles. you can go to the display and see them all in mint",

          "What can I say? first of all it's FREE then, it's open till 22:00 when everything else in Salzburg is closed. The design of this place is just unreal. I think anyone can appreciate it. you don't have to be into cars or airplanes to enjoy it. it's just an awesome place! I don't",
          "I was particularly looking forward to visiting hangar 7 prior to my visit to Salzburg, but was a little disappointed. This was due to the fact that the main aircraft I wanted to see were all in the maintenance hangar, The B25 Mitchell, the P38 Lightning, the F4U Corsair and the",

          "Basically a show casing of red bull cars/choppers and planes. Not much else to do unless you are going to the restaurant which can get fully booked very often. But great location - very picturesque since it is up in Alps. Just across from the Salzburg Airport.",
          "If you have a spare hour or two then head here!! A fantastic collection of F1 cars, helicopters, airplanes and other assorted red bull racing vehicles. The hangar itself is magnificent and you can look out towards the operational hangar. We were lucky enough to see some red bull",

          "The reviews and photos I had seen were of items that were not in the Museum when we visited..so that was a bit disappointing. I guess they must rotate some of their displays. We caught a taxi from Salzburg city, intending to have dinner. We arrived around 5pm and were told that",
          "Possibly the best museum I've been to... It's not the biggest, nor does it have the most expansive exhibitions... But what is there is perfect and all housed within an architecturally stunning building. If you follow Red Bull's F1 endeavours or any other sport they participate",
          "I'm not the car aficionado in the family so I found it sort of boring. There were F1 cars and lots of different types of aircraft.. Text was all in German, no sub titles. Restaurant was pricey and mundane.",
          "This is where seemingly infinitely wealthy Red Bull keeps all of their toys from sponsorships of various racing teams and such. It's a little out of the way if you don't have a car, and the part that visitors can go to isn't that big, but it's free so it's worth it. This sounds",
          "If you are an F1 fan, this is a must-see! The architecture and exhibit are great to see. The whole place is ultra-cool and hip. My understanding is that the restaurants are very good, but usually booked way in advance. We had a delicious casual meal in the outdoor restaurant",
          "yes - its clean and shiny, well presented, totally free and all that. no hands on was a disappointment for our 10 year old. I loved the cartoon artwork on the walls...",

        "wiki": "The University of Salzburg, also known as the Paris Lodron University of Salzburg (German: Paris-Lodron-Universit\u00e4t Salzburg, PLUS), named after its founder, Prince-Archbishop Paris Lodron, is a public university in Salzburg municipality, Salzburg state, Austria. It is divided into four faculties: \n\nCatholic Theology\nLaw\nCultural and Social Sciences\nNatural SciencesEstablished in 1622, the university was closed in 1810 and re-established in 1962. Today, it has around 18,000 students and 2,800 employees and is the largest educational institution in Salzburg state.\n\n\n== Benedictine University ==\nOn 23 July 1622, Archbishop Paris Lodron appointed the scholar Albert Keuslin first rector of the Benedictine university. Keuslin, a graduate of the Jesuit University of Dillingen, had established the Akademisches Gymnasium, a secondary school, at Salzburg five years earlier. By resolution of Emperor Ferdinand II, issued on October 8, the Gymnasium was raised to a university. While the Thirty Years' War raged outside the Archbishopric of Salzburg, the university was built up and maintained by a federation of Benedictine abbeys from Salzburg, Switzerland, Bavaria and Austria. In its early years, courses taught were theology, divinity, philosophy, law, and medicine.\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the Prince-Archbishopric was secularized as the Electorate of Salzburg in 1803. It was ruled by Archduke Ferdinand III of Austria, a brother of Emperor Francis I, who established a Faculty of Medicine. After Salzburg was annexed by the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1810, however, the university was closed on 24 December and replaced by a Lyzeum college with sections for divinity and philosophy, as well as a school for medicine and surgery. After the Napoleonic Wars, Salzburg became part of the Austrian Empire. \nThe divinity section was again converted to a faculty in 1850. In World War I, plans were evolved to relocate the Francis Joseph University from Czernowitz to Salzburg, though never carried out.\n\n\n== University of Salzburg ==\nThe University of Salzburg was not re-established until 1962, with a faculty of Catholic theology and a faculty of philosophy. Classes resumed in 1964, with a faculty of law added the following year. In 1975, a new federal law regulated the organisation of all Austrian universities. The University of Salzburg created four academic divisions: the Faculty of Catholic Theology, the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Humanities, and the Faculty of Natural Sciences. A fifth division, the Faculty of Medicine, was not realized.\nIn 1995, the organisation of Austrian universities was further restructured with more faculty autonomy. The university gradually incorporated new academic programs through 2004 into 32 Fachbereiche or \u201cdepartments\u201d, and again, decided not to create a Faculty of Medicine.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nThe University of Salzburg has no central campus, occupying several buildings in Salzburg's historic centre: parts of the Salzburg Residenz building (Toskanatrakt) and on Kapitelgasse south of Salzburg Cathedral. The university library is located between the Kollegienkirche (the University Church) and the Gro\u00dfes Festspielhaus; attached to it is the Gro\u00dfe Aula, or ceremonial hall.\nThe traditional faculty building of Humanities (Communication Studies, Sociology and Political Science) is located by the Rudolfskai, only 100 metres from Mozartplatz and Papagenoplatz. The Faculty of Sciences is housed in the second largest building in Salzburg after Hohensalzburg Fortress, and is located just further south next to Schloss Freisaal Castle and Frohnburg Castle.\nCompleteted in 2011, the Unipark Nonntal campus (replacing the old location at the Akademiestra\u00dfe) is home to the departments of modern languages, and cultural and social sciences. The building is 17,000 square metres in size, with 5,500 students and 300 academic staff. There is a library and an Auditorium Maximum. Financing for the construction of the Unipark Nonntal was enabled by successful negotiations between Salzburg\u2019s state governor Franz Schausberger and the Federal Ministry of Education. Originally designed in 2002 by architects Storch Ehlers Partners, it was constructed in three years.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nSmaller university offices and institutes are scattered throughout the city, with arts and music being taught at the Mozarteum University Salzburg.\n\n\n== Alumni ==\nHannes Ametsreiter (born 1967), Austrian telecommunication manager\nMartina Berthold (born 1970), Austrian politician\nGabi Burgstaller (born 1963), Austrian politician\nHerbert Dachs (born 1943), Austrian political scientist\nWolfgang Eder (born 1952), Austrian iron steel manager\nRenate Egger-Wenzel (born 1961), Professor of Old Testament\nBenita Ferrero-Waldner (born 1948), Austrian diplomat and politician\nAlexandra F\u00f6derl-Schmid (born 1971), Austrian journalist\nKarl-Markus Gau\u00df (born 1954), Austrian novelist\nToni Giger (born 1963), Austrian ski trainer\nErich Hackl (born 1955), Austrian novelist and short-story writer\nGerhart Holzinger (born 1947), Austrian constitutional lawyer\nHannes Leitgeb (born 1972), Austrian philosopher and mathematician\nHieronymus II.

          "Lovely place to take a photo, it was not busy when we went and not many people in the square. At the moment there is a lot of building work in the next square by the cathedral, the whole ground is being dug up, so there is a lot of fencing around.",
          "This is a good place to meet up when travlling with friends. There are places where you can sit and relax and there are plenty of eateries and shops nearby, although expect to pay top dollar, there was a lot of construction going on with all the pavers being replaced so was",
          "We were on a guided city tour. We were given free time and this was our meeting spot. Some nice benches to sit on and people watch. Shops nearby to whittle the afternoon away.",
          "In this small but busy city, this is a good place to meet up with your traveling companions. There are few places where you can sit and relax and there are eating places and shops nearby. Salzburg loves Mozart (sadly, the feeling was not mutual) so you will see him all around",
          "This is a very significant place to visit where Mozart, one of the greatest musicians was born and lived. There's a nice museum displaying various items used by Mozart",
          "The music school rolled a piano out into the square with a small sign asking for donations for refugees. Also anyone could play and there was a young girl who did. After that the same girl played the violin. Later we could here students playing music inside the school\u2019s",
          "Salzburg is mad busy. There sometimes seems like no escape from the throng. Just off the main drag is Mozartplatz, and that was one of the few places around where you could find a bench to take the weight off. Lots to see and do as well. Nice.",
          "This is the main plaza where Mozart greets you. At any given time, you would find hoardes of selfie maniac tourists in front of this place. But it is likely you will find yourself keep coming to this place because Salzburg old town is pretty small and all the roads seems to be",
          "Finally one square that isn't being renovated. It is worth seeing and having your picture taken with Chinese and Bosnian tourists.",
          "Named after the famous composer, the square is adorned with his statue, a beautiful fountain and home to the famous Glockenspiel. There are many shops, restaurants and cafes around the square making it a great place to relax and unwind.",
          "It's one of many plazas in the old town, but has the Mozart statue in the middle. Tons of tourists, as you'd expect.",
          "A lovely little plaza, with benches for sitting and people watching. A highlight was watching a man walk past Mozart whistling Do-Re-Mi! Convenient to everything!",
          "I have no idea why this place is so famous. If you are on a quick tour, resist what people may tell you about how historic this place is. There is one oxidation filled copper statue of Mozart and that\u2019s about it. Boring as hell. Good ice cream good coffee but people are racist",
          "Lovely city with very friendly people, great culture and very good restaurants and cafes. Spent a total of 5 hours here and didn\u2019t really touch the surface, would definitely come back.",
          "The Mozartplatz in the city center of Salzburg is not bad, but definitely nothing special!!!!!!!! It might be nice to sit down for a while (some banks are provided for tourists to rest) but the place is not in the best condition!",
          "Salzburg is beautiful. This is just one area of shops and restaurants to visit. It's not on the river, so less interesting to us.",
          "A nice statue in the middle of the most average and boring square in Salzburg but of a let down really",
          "This is an open historical square with Mozart statue in the middle and you can see the surrounding old famous buildings like the Dome and the Residentz. There are lots of shops and cafes around here.",
          "We later read that Mozart's two sons were present the day they unveiled this statue. They must have been so proud of their papa!",
          "this is a lovely city with loads to see and do Mozart t house is well worth visit even if yo0u are not musical. My grandson plays the piano and really enjoyed his visit. There are a lot o places to walk and we also did a tour of the sound of music which was OKish and the",
          "Mozart's square is the central place in Salzburg. Really not much to see apart from the statue, you can reach anywhere in the city from here. The Cathedral and Zwellers are close by and both well worth the visit.",
          "The statue in the middle of the square reminds you that Mozart himself went there a few hundred years ago Near you can find the Cathedral, restaurants, coffee places.",
          "very prominent monument in the old town,with restaurants and cafes around.place is where mozart once lived.",
          "I loved seeing this statue and being able to stand and think of all the amazing music he composed. It's in a gorgeous surrounding and worth walking by.",
          "This area was made in 1588 when they pulled down some old town houses. The statue of Mozart was unveiled in 1842. Not a great deal to see here, but just around the corner is the Residenz and the Cathedral .",
          "This square was full of stalls for the Christmas markt. We had some of the best gluhwein here on Christmas Eve.",
          "Visited during Christmas Market season and there was a nice ice skating rink here. Fun to watch the skaters and listen to the music. Otherwise, I wouldn't think there is much of interest here...other than a large statue of Mozart, of course.",
          "The place and the statue were a bit dirty!! The day we went there was the 27th of Dec. and there was full of people a Christmas market nearby. It was far from our expectation. We also noticed that everything in Salzburg was related to Mozart because of business like chocolate,",
          "We sat in a little caf\u00e9 here with a hot chocolate, under a blanket and listened to the glockenspiel chimes of the bell tower (they happen about 3 times a day), was a nice way to round off a sightseeing day. Not much else in this square apart from the statue of Mozart!",
          "Was lucky enough that the ice rink was up during our stay so went here everyday for coffee/wine music and to watch the skaters",
          "A wonderful open plaza encircled by restaurants and shops. Had a food festival there one day and also had an historic car rally stop in the platz so people could look at the cars.",
          "Nice square with gorgeous view on the castle. Is a beautiful place, but you can not do much here, except visiting many shops (prices are not low;))",
          "We had heavy rain all day in Salzburg . The square where the statue is situated is surely a delight in the sunshine. A wide ope square and a joy to visit.",
          "You know, when you visit Europe, there are town squares with statues in just about every town and village...so, nothing hugely spectacular about Mozart's statue and square. Nice memorial to the city's favorite son and accomplished musician. Nicely lit up for the holidays--they",
          "Nice place in the center of the Old Town. Big Mozart monument. In winter the city ice field is located here. In this time life music, hot wine, and children games are one of the most important elements on the Mozartplatz. One of the amusement places for citizens and turists.",
          "Enjoyed watching the winter sports and wandering around the near Christmas Market. The statue honors the town's musical genius.",
          "Passed through on way to Fortress and other areas of Salzburg but not very impressive and not worth special visit. Statue is quite small. In December it is next to ice rink & a bar.",
          "This Square contains the statue to the famous composer, and is situated centrally in Salzburg, and a 'must-see' for all music lovers.",
          "If you visit Salzburg you will walk across the 'Mozartplatz' ;-) The Square is right in the Center (Old Town) and is the main square in Salzburg. In the weeks before christmas it has an Ice Skating facility and you can drink some 'Gl\u00fchwein' or 'Punsch'. Also in Summer it is",
          "I was thrilled to get to ice skate in mid-November! The Christmas music was playing and church bells chiming. Great place to hang out and get something warm to drink nearby. Right by the Tourist Information office.",
          "This lively square transforms itself over the year. When we visited it was littered with poof cushions where folks could lounge and relax. What a nice idea.",
          "The fountain at mozartplatz was beautifully made . It was great to walk in mozartplatz . Highly recommended.",
          "Really enjoyed the Mozart Platz during our day in Salzburg. The town was holding their own Oktoberfest so we were able to enjoy local music and food while we walked around the town.",
          "pass the Mozartplatz - it's in walking distance from the city centre and the places 'you have to see' when in Salzburg",
          "There are some interesting buildings surrounding the square, but the Mozart statue is the main thing to see. There are benches around the square, and this is a good place to relax and watch people in nice environs.",
          "Mozart; the main reason why Salzburg has such a wide appeal and his statue is at the centre of a large plaza near the Castle, museum and churches. Mozart is the man who made Salzburg famous and pretty much everything today in Salzburg, from the souvenirs to the chocolates to the",
          "A nice place to walk pass and stop for a minute or two to see the statue of Mozart. Nothing really interesting but it's along the way.",
          "I visited in a very cold and rainy day, but it was still very beautiful. There were plenty of tourists, we had some hot wine and an apfel strudel in a caffe nearby.",
          "You can't come to Salzburg without seeing the statue of Mozart. And of course his birth place. And don't worry, you won't be able to forget to see it as you see Mozart EVERYWHERE you go!!! From Chocolate to liqueur, to costumes, to posters, to status, souvenirs, gadgets, dolls,",
          "No visit to Salzburg is complete without seeing Mozart\"s statue, his birth place and this Mozart Museum. The statue is in a pleasant plaza of its own with shops and bars.",
          "If you walk around Salzburg, you won't miss the statue located in Mozartplatz. Nothing too special, just a memorable statue.",
          "Don't get me wrong this is a beautiful part of town, but there are many others. Things are more expensive here for cheaper quality items. Take your photos's and explore a little more outside the tourist belt to get a better experience and appreciation",
          "As you walk around Salzburg you will likely find yourself in Mozartplatz at some point. I was a bit surprised it had a rock/dirt ground and not a stone or brick but the buildings surrounding the platz and just the overall look and feel of Salzburg kind of put you in fantasy",
          "It's just a statue of a famous person. There's nothing much to see here apart from the history part of it. You don't need to book a tour to come here on purpose. Spend a day in this beautiful lovely old town of Salzburg, walk around and you will meet this place.",
          "Spent a few days in Salzburg during the Mozart Festival - what a great experience! Mozartplatz is the perfect venue to enjoy past performances shown on a massive screen and enjoy the festive atmosphere while indulging in music, food and drink!",
          "good food, super cakes and excellent coffee. Prices are top end tourist price. Staff were cheerful and polite and we were not hurried away after our meal",
          "A statue of the great man in a square that bears his name. Quite fitting for this square and draws tourists to an otherwise quiet part before the more historic buildings.",
          "As the birthplace of Mozart, one would expect a statue of him somewhere in the old town of Salzburg. Where will you find such statue? It is here in an are they call Mozartplatz which is a short walking distance from the funicular cable that would take you up the Salzburg Castle.",
          "As a tourist, I love to take photos and experience the ambiance of beautiful historic sites in cities like Salzburg. When I visited the Mozartplatz, there were vendors and amusement rides all over the platz. Great for the locals but a lousy tourist experience, in my humble",
          "This is not the most memorable place in Salzburg but still it is nice to see. There several places like that in this city and it is nice every few minutes to discover something interesting: a square, a sculpture, a fountain ... The are some coffee shops around the square",
          "The very person which inspires so many musicians to date has a monument bang centre of old town. Went there a couple of times and both the times there were some musicians performing there to a decent sized crowd.Were well recieved too.",
          "Beautiful spot to sit and appreciate the beautiful architecture of the old town. A quiet break from the crowds just a block away.",
          "Good place to relax and listen to the music. there is some or the other performer playing music here. there are many chairs to sit and relax after you are tired of walking around.",
          "Nice square in the old town with an imposing statue of Mozart. The approach to the cathedral and also location for salzburg museum",
          "Mozart was a true genius, and this plaza which is dedicated to him has a statue that only slightly resembles him. It has been designed to make him look more attractive than he really was, and shows him holding a pencil with his right hand, even though he was left-handed.",
          "Salzburg Old Town is definitely a walking place, so it's great to find a good spot to chill out or catch your breath. We even forgot our bag here when we dashed off to buy souvenirs. Lucky us, the bag was still there in the same spot on the bench when we remembered to come back",
          "Charming square at the Zalzburg cathedral with beautiful Mozart monument on it. What is unusual - public lounge area with hammocks and soft chairs to relax after day of sightseeing!",
          "In the evening Salzburg is just stunning, the lighting at the square is soft and not abundant which gives it a lovely atmosphere. I'm not sure how busy it is during the day but in the evening it is a quiet place to visit and you can enjoy the monuments and fabulous buildings",
          "So wonderful just to be in Salzburg. The squares and streets all around the town are interesting as you walk along.",
          "walking through old town you will run into this square. pretty much like a lot of other European cities and their old towns - each having statues and large spaces for congregating. worthy of pictures.",
          "This is a lovely square with nice caf\u00e9s and lots of space. Nice to take photos of the statue of Mozart if you can avoid all those people taking selfies with him!!!! Interesting story about the statue showing him holding a pencil in his right hand",
          "So yes, there is a statue of Mozart in the middle that seems to be nearly a required photo form Salzburg, but aside from that, this is just a nice square with plenty of restaurants and plenty of outdoor, umbrella-covered restaurant seating that make it a nice place for lunch, an",
          "This is a nice large plaza. It had multiple setups while we were there for the Salzburg music festival, and lots of outdoor seating at cafes and restaurants.",
          "Worth visiting. It's a lovely square with a statue of Mozart and the museum and tourist information across the road from each other.",
          "A rebuilt place where Mozart once lived. Just a short stroll from Birthplace). Interesting information and artifacts on Mozart and his family. Thankfully much cooler in this museum with audio guide.",
          "Mozartplatz is a fine square with low old buildings - it's easy to imagine how it looked three hundred years ago. Pay your respect to the master standing in the middle and say 'thank you for the music'.",
          "The whole area is all about Mozart, pictures, statues you could buy anything. It was a fun place but overall touristy.",
          "The square itself is no different than other European squares. There are a few stalls, but the highlight for myself and the kids was playing life size chess. It was a great game and plenty of people watch and enjoy as you play. However, plenty of people let their kids come along",
          "Ok so you have to come here if you're in Salzburg just to get a photo or two of Mozart, but other than that, there's nothing else to say!",
          "There's a nice big statue of a somewhat-idealized Mozart, according to our Segway tour guide. (Mozart was left-handed not right-, and not so tall or so handsome.) Other than that, there's not that much going on in this square. During our visit to Salzburg, I much preferred",
          "Took some photos with the statue just because it was there. Plaza itself is clean and the buildings typical austrian style. Was not a very busy spot. Not much there but guess you have to go there if on town.",
          "Other than getting some pictures of the statue and the horse water fountain from the sound of music...not much else to do here.",
          "with a statue of Mozart. We people watched......struck up conversation with other tourists and then galavanted off. No doubt you WILL pass thru as you wander the old city.",
          "Just really a big crowded plaza with people and some cars. No shade on a hot day. Fine to pass through it on way to something else but not much of a destination.",
          "There are several plazas in Salzburg. We had food at a caf\u00e9 adjacent to the statue, and listened to a local musician play in the square while we ate. The statue is in an open area, so you can get a photo and people watch. Nothing more to it.",
          "Not sure why this is supposed to be reviewed! It is a nice plaza with a statue of Mozart and some typically Austrian historical buildings around it. Sometimes you will hear a free concert or see other things going on, but as far as Marketsquare's go, this one is pretty average.",
          "One can almost hear the music here. A must pilgrimage for all classical music lovers. The square has a lovely feel and one can visit the oldest cafe and try Mozart balls.",
          "another big platz in the beautiful Salzburg. although very touristic it is not noisy, good to stop at a restaurant and watch people and horses drawn carriages :)",
          "This square had a grand piano set up so that anyone could come and play it. Just sitting there on a beautiful spring day listening to some very talented people was a fantastic way to spend an afternoon.",
          "It's just a plaza with a statue, nothing special. The surrounding buildings are typical for Salzburg.",
          "Mozartplatz is a busy square with many tourists milling around the souvenir shops & restaurants. It is also a popular place in which tourist groups meet up after their exploration of this lovely city. And in the centre, dominating the space, is a fine statue of Mozart who was",
          "Certainly worth a stop,Mozart really gave our Wonderful World some of his life,to be there is certainly a moment in time.",
          "This beautiful sculpture of Mozart sits smack in the middle of a gorgeous square where you can rest for awhile, grab lunch or a snack or refreshment, do some shopping or take a horse carriage ride! Worth seeing!",
          "This is an ideal town centre; it has coffee shops, beautiful architecture, and eateries. Just walking through this spot made me feel the great vibes of this place. There are always a lot of people here, and it's fun to be amidst all this. Another must-see place in Salzburg.",
          "Mozartplatz tends to be the recognized start of a tour of Salzburg City Center. there are many restaurants to enjoy ice cream, an afternoon snack, or eat lunch and dinner. The city center tends to fan out from this location.",
          "Not only can you see Mozart's statue, but you can go to an excellent tourist information centre, enter the Salzburg museum and have a coffee. A nice elegant square with lots going on.",
          "It is nice to see a remembrance statue of Mozart in this big square, however the image makes him look very handsome and we all know he didn't have the best look. Could you imagine what they would make him look like now with photoshop!",
          "The Mozartplate is the main public square, located in the middle old town area in city Salzburg, next to the \"The Salzburg Museum\" where stand the Mozart Monument. Today is the favorite place interest for tourist a lot of Shops Cafe-Restaurant around.",
          "This is a nice park on the ring, close to Hofburg, where the Mozart statue is located. Worth a quick stop when you're in the area.",
          "While interesting because it depicts Mozart, it is just a statue in a square surrounded by buildings housing a variety of entities. Nothing special -- but assuming you're walking through Old Town Salzburg, it's certainly worth a two minute stop.",
          "This place is free when you buy the Salzburg Card. Else the entrance is 10 EURO. The attraction is fine only if you are a real Mozart fan.",
          "Expected much more but it wasn't there. A big square hosting a nice Mozart's statue and having a few cafes/ shops etc on the periphery but nothing more than that .... also didn't find too many tourists there.",
          "A cobble stone square with average shops and cafes and a statue of Mozart. Look up to see a tower that chimes a few times a day. Much of this area is car free which is nice.",
          "Well what do you say about a square dedicated to Mozart. Special indeed. Nice statue. some seating to watch the world stroll by. And there's free public wi-fi in the area.",
          "This is in the center of the Historic Centre of the City of Salzburg. There area cafe's and shops and the Fortress to see.",
          "We thought that the square would be impressive and while it is large, it's actually quite plain. There are a number of stores and restaurants around the edge and the Museum to one side. The statue of Mozart is actually fairly flat in that the detail isn't amazing, it's not as",
          "You'll not be disappointed with the authentic charm in the Salzburg courtyards. Feel free to start early, as the local bakeries will have fresh bagels, and baguettes, and the local vendors will be there to service you in a friendly manner.",
          "Nothing much to do other than one statue which is there. It's a big square like most cities have. Walk around enjoy the place",
          "Turnaround through 360 degrees and you will be totally impressed with the views. The statue of Mozart, the museum, the old houses and shops, the Weinachtenmuseum, the church in the next grand square and even up to the palace on top of the hill. Shame about the building under",
          "The buildings are stunning with intricate details coming out with every new camera angle. One of many lovely places to visit in Salzburg.",
          "This square sets the tone for your time in Salzburg. After all this city is all about Mozart. here you can get a carriage to tour the city, sit in the sun and embrace the spirt or sit at a cafe and spend some quiet time with a coffee as you decide your next adventure.",
          "We visited in early January and the ice rink was still in use. We didn't take to the ice on this occasion but we did enjoy a few mugs of gluhwein whilst we enjoyed the spectacle and looked at the beautiful surroundings of the square. Sure it's just a stunning when it's not",
          "not too crowded and well worth a visit. Some renovations in the background but not too disruptive for photos.",
          "Nothing special here, just a nice \"square\" to pass through by the museum. Seem to recall that the Mozart monument is a bit controversial so worth a curious look",
          "The Mozart Square is a busy square in Salzburg. The rectangular square dates back to the year 1588 and changed a lot since then. The Imhofst\u00f6ckl and Mozart statue dates from a later period (1835). Besides the fact that it is a beautiful square, so this is really the place to",
          "I was dissapointed with Mozartpaz. Only interesting things on this plaz is Mozart monument and this is all.",
          "Nothing special to see, you can just walk-through. A tip: In the winter there is an ice skating ring in the platz, although the skating shoes are in horrible shape (atleast the size 45 i wore and size 44 my friend wore), but if you have your own skates go for it.",
          "We went there in Dec 2016 for the Christmas ambience. There was an ice-skating rink, which was crowded and sort of spoilt the atmosphere. The building around had old-world charm. One will take just 15 minutes to take all the IG-worthy photos and videos and be off to the next",
          "Even when it's cold and snowy the Mozartplatz has it's own splendor to appreciate, especially during the Advent Christmas Market season. Take a skate around the outdoor rink for some winter fun. It will warm you up as skate around maybe etching a figure 8 into the ice next",
          "Went to the Mozartplatz and did some ice-skating right in front of the Mozarts statue. There were also museums around the corner, and the souvenir shops here are slightly cheaper than those inside the old town. Could not stay here for longer due to the snow.",
          "This was an amazing area, filled with people music and history. We enjoyed our day strolling around. Lots to look at and just soak in.",
          "There is a wonderful ice skating rink at Mozartplatz during Christmas which was the source of endless amusement for our teenaged son, and the adjacent Christkindlmarkt kept his parents amused for as long as he could keep skating!",
          "Mozart is perhaps the most famous resident of Salzburg, so it is fitting to have his statue in the middle of the City. There are churches and museums in the area and the fortress is near by.",
          "We visited Salzburg and Mozartplatz during the Christmas time.At this time of the year,Salzburg is a fairytale itself and Mozartplatz it's a part of this charming atmosphere. There are a Christmas Market and an ice skating rink, the Mozart statue, the entrance at two",
          "Walked through Mozartplatz a number of times and the only thing notable was the statue of the maestro at the center of the square. The plaza leads directly to the more notable Rezidenzplatz where some of the major Christmas Market stalls were located as well as the Dom. The",
          "I just expected a square with his statue in the middle It ended up being a huge square filled with restaurants and shops. It is very nice and well kept.",
          "Lovely square and feel Mozart would thoroughly approve of the outdoor ice rink and gluhwein stall !!",
          "Visiting my son and family was extra special because I was able to see the locals and enjoy their lifestyle for a few weeks. Truly a pleasurable experience!",
          "We visited while the Christmas Markets were on and this square was filled with an ice rink! Was great to watch people skating with all the twinkling fairy lights overhead!",
          "I felt like I was part of an important place in history. The bus pulled in and I fell in love with Austria on a new level. I want to go back as soon as I can.",
          "Walking around this are was entertaining. All the attraction in the old city is near this place. One is surrounded by the old world charm.",
          "This square with statue of Mozart is a good place to sit and watch the passing movement of tourists and horse-drawn carriages and perhaps listen to a street musician. All the buildings being well maintained, it is a most attractive location.",
          "We spent a good 30mins here on a bench just watching and listening. Lots of shops and restaurants around, but we were content sitting on a bench in the early evening watching the day end and listening to an amazingly talented violin player. Quiet spot to enjoy Salzburg.",
          "This is a cute little square with little shops, a statue of Mozart and indoor/outdoor cafes. I would have enjoyed sitting back and enjoying a glass of wine to people watch if I'd had the time.",
          "Usually a little quieter than rest of old town, lots of benches and with any luck, a violin player will be there, so, sit back and have a time out.",
          "This is the main square in the city centre of Salzburg. Lot of stores, cafes and restaurants to pass time and get a feel of the place. I found it to be the most vibrant of places esp in the evenings.",
          "Here we are again ... this town has sooo . . . many cultural attractions .. the only way to explore .. use the Hopp on = Hopp off Bus Services ... you can get off and rejoin any time you want ... Visit this Place preferable only by good\u2026",
          "Mozart is everywhere in Salzburg and this plaza gives you that feeling and also it is a fair homage to Mozart ans his genius. This square is really beautiful and as is well located in the city.",
          "This is a place where you should stop to look at thge Mozart Statue and meet before visiting the Museums in the area. There is a very good restaurant in the area (KK) and a ticket office where you can get info and buy tickets to different events.",
          "Nice square. A good place to get your photo taken with the Mozart statue, and then you can quickly move on.",
          "Of course the centre of the square has the statue of Mozart. It is a great square to sit and watch the passing parade of tourists and horse-drawn carriages. The buildings surrounding the square are all well maintained and are quite lovely.",
          "It was good time there we enjoy in this place, And we will try to visit another place in the next time",
          "Of course Salzburg have also a square named Mozart! And of course with his Monument. Around the Monument there are always flowers...",
          "In Salzburg everything is beautiful. Every street in the center is well taken care and the atmosphere is about Mozart. Mozartplatz is a 5 minute visit in the center of town. A part of the visit.",
          "Great place to sit and watch the world go by especially from one of the nearby cafes. Get your picture taken with Mozart, well the statue anyway!",
          "I'm a Mozart-fan, so I decide to go to Salzburg only to see and keep close to this person and history. It was amazing when I turn one corner and saw this place. It's a beauty place reserved to him. Here, it's the abstract of all the city - they breath Mozart. And I loved!",
          "it's a quick stop over in the city. just ride over if you have short of time Good to know the history",
          "A must see place for every tourist. We had a Salzburg sausages and bear while enjoying the atmosphere at Mozartplatz.",
          "In my opinion, this is the hub of old town. From Mozartplatz, you can go in many different directions to take in the amazing sites of Old Town. Start here and branch out!",
          "This square is quite central and has many restaurants and cafes situated off it. Its also close to some major fountains. Its well worth a visit whilst you are in town.",
          "It's a small open square that holds a few shops, a cafe, and the Salzburg Museum. Also, it's just next to the Fontana della Residenza.",
          "This was the starting point of our walk around Salzburg. It is a pleasant square with the statue of Mozart in the middle. It is very near to the cathedral and has a tourist information office on one side. There was also a very nice cafe where we enjoyed a laate and a cake.",
          "Nice square not far from the Cathedral. You will be nearby anyway, so it worth to take a picture with the Mozart monument,",
          "We visited this Mozartplatz over and over during our stay--rain and shine.We used umbrellas for both. It s always busy and there is a lot to see. Great views of gorgeous, famous buildings. Music to listen to sometimes.There are yummy places to eat or bring your own and sit on a",
          "We grabbed some food and then went to Mozartplatz, sitting beside the Mozart statue and ate. From our viewpoint we could also watch the horses pass with their carriages.",
          "A popular square with a few shops, Cafes and restaurants. The Tourist Information Office is located. The Salzburg Museum, Salzburg Cathedral, Residence Museum are all nearby. Nice location to relax and enjoy the atmosphere.",

          "Mozart continues to inspire young musicians who strum their sounds in the courtyard around his statue. Great vibe and worth the visit, even just to hear the up and coming talent.",
          "Not only great place to relax and enjoy the view, but as well a spot were almost always some live music is on!",
          "Salzburg - home of Wolfgang - and rightly proud of him. So there is a square with his statue. handy for the Tourist info, and many tourist shops.",
          "In this city you can see the birthplace of Mozart, the place where he worked and the grave of Mozart. Very nice city and can visit from Munich city by train.",
          "Its a ok big square to walking around or sit a while. Its nothing really too special about with a status.",
          "It is just a small statue of Mozart and surprisingly, not touristy. A landmark for you to take photos if you wish to.",
          "A must take photo opportunity to include on your visit to Salzburg. Situated close to all the many attractions so easy to find.",
          "It's a square - with a statue of Mozart! Hmm...that's about it. You'll pass through, no doubt, as you stroll through the Old Town, and we grabbed a coffee at Mozarts on the corner which was nice. But nothing particularly thrilling.",
          "Huge statue of mozart. Nice place to visit and you can spend almost one to two hours. Very close to other sight seeing places",
          "very nice when it's sunny , lots of animations and close to shops , cathedral and not far from the Festung hohensalzburg as well as the Domquartier.",

          "I only had a brief time in Salzburg this time around, and my visit didn't involve hitting the old town, but every time I go I find myself compelled to do at least a short stroll through it. It was evening, the attractions (including the funicular to the fortress - I had waited",
          "A great place to visit after dark and often there are musicians playing live near the statue. A must see if in Salzburg.",
          "It was the best place in Salzburg. You should visist it if you can come there. Many small local shops and old buildings",
          "Obivously they're very proud of this notorious musician. All about him is indicated - where he was born, where he lived, and then this square dedicated to him - very charming.",
          "If you visit Mozart's house in the new city, you learn that many likenesses of Mozart are inaccurate or fake. This statue fits into the first category by many accounts, but it is a nice tribute and placed where Salzburg first began.",
          "Lots of shopping, a food market, activities and restaurants in this area, along with historic buildings. Artists are selling their paintings of Salzburg locations on the street.",
          "This is an active and buzzing area and very pretty too. It is agreat spot for pictures and historical spot.",
          "Our first day in Salzburg, we sat out on Mozartplatz with a glass of wine and just enjoyed the pretty plaza. They have kept the plaza very simple, elegant and free of tee shirt and souvenir shops. In fact, most of the people walking around the plaza appeared to be local",
          "Had a beer in the sunshine, and sat for an hour after walking the trail above Salzburg, via the Abbey - it is Well worth the climb up the steps.",
          "We spent an hour walking in circles searching for this damn statue. Once we finally found it we realized our initial starting point was less than 100 yards away. DOH! Okay, a large open space with a huge bronze statue. Anything special about this? I love his music but this",
          "An ordinary square with a monument in the middle - nothing special! But good restatrants in the neighbourhood!",
          "Need to see and take a picture. Right in the middle of the old town.Just have some coffee in the coffee shop next to it an enjoy the atmosphere",
          "This would not be Salzburg if there was not a lovely statue of Mozart. This is a lovely square where you can also go on a horse and carriage ride and enjoy all the sites.",
          "There is a Mozart statue which is the main attraction of this square. But the days when we were in Salzburg, there was a nice little fare going on and this place was buzzing with activity! Lots of stalls for food and drinks and small activities and shopping.",
          "Nice place to visit and it's safe good for family and lovers as well with friends Good people and calm place nice view Come and visit",
          "Walking the city is amazing! This plaza was quiet and honestly not that interesting except the statue. The view of the mountain was nice and it is all part of the experience. Spend your time in Salzburg!",
          "We were blessed with 2 really beautiful days during our 5 night stay in Salzburg. Our hotel was about 50 yards from the square so we got to know it very well. Just sitting watching the world go by was great, plus, if you enjoy ice cream, there was this great place that sold",
          "Another Mozart spot in Salzburg. It's surrounded with other attraction so you could achieve visiting other spots.",
          "Lovely square in the city center, surrounded by old nice building. In the center of the square, a beautiful fountain. Helpful tourist information bureau included",
          "Some squares have fountains surrounded by churches, some have squares with a statue of Mozart. This is probably one of the few squares in the world that honor Mozart which adds a nice element to the square. But, there are nice cafes, shopping and people watching, not to mention",
          "We stayed three nights in Salzburg and while we saw amazing things and enjoyed many of the sights, I can't say that I would recommend staying that long to anyone else. We were there in May and even though it is considered the off season, the streets were literally packed",
          "This is one of the 4 public squares around the cathedral, when the sun is shining the many cafes are full with peopme sitting outside, there are also many seats around the square to sit and enjoy. The statue of mozart is quite sober really for someone of such importance to the",
          "Salzburg IS Mozart (or the Sound of Music!). I love both thankfully, so had a wonderful afternoon checking out history of both! You can visit Mozart's birthplace within walking distance, which is well worth it. It brings him to life, if only for a little while. Enjoy!",
          "Salzburg was the birthplace of 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. A statue of Mozart is in Mozartplatz Square, but not much more to see here. Mozartplatz is close to the fountain in Residenzplatz Square and is a good meeting place to start a walking tour Salzburg.",
          "Salzburg means Mozart. That's why you should go and take a picture with the statue or you can have a nice walk in the square.",
          "It's a nice square next to Mozarts house. You can sit and relax a while and watch the world go by. You can visit his house and the museum. Personally I walked through the square, took a couple of pictures and hit a nearby restaurant for lunch. It was drizzling when I was there",
          "After a long walk in Salzburg you can have a seat at the MozartPlatz, with some misic that you will hear from the mucian playing there. fro winter it is recommended at the advent period. ( iwas there summer and winter)",
          "Good place to meet up, and a nice place to take a picture. Otherwise, you probably won't end up spending that much time there, even in the height of summer.",
          "It\u00b4s the platz in front of one of the Mozarts houses. Just look at the buidings, Feel the atmosphere. And then, go to the Mozart house itself",
          "It's a place to pass by, but there is nothing so much especial. Probably better to go. In he summer, it was raining, so we couldn't really stay and appreciate.",
          "Nice buildings stand around the square but open place is boring. Just some coaches during the day or some special events give better feeling to the visitors of the place. Mozart\u2019s monument is nothing special.",
          "You will fin the statue of Mozart here. Nice memorial! Its a great place to relax. The buildings surrounding it are so nice to look at. The tourist information office is here if you need more info for the area things to do. We sat in one of the pavement caf\u00e9s and listed to",
          "We went here when the Christmas markets were up and there was an ice rink set up in the plaza. Spend a few moments to admire the statue and contemplate that Mozart is the reason people visit this lovely town today.",
          "A small Platz next to the Cathedral that has the name of Mozart to honor him. Couple of souvenir shops next to it.",
          "A great square for soaking in the city. A statue of Mozart is the centrepiece currently surrounded by a pop up ice rink and late night bar.",
          "I visited here on December 31, 2015. I walked here from the train station which was about a 30-minute walk, This is the key place in Salzburg to start from and to orient yourself to the city. There is a famous statue of Mozart there and also a Tourist Information Office where",
          "The monument was centred in the part of town with a lot of buzz. Restaurant, a temporary skating ring so that a lot of people just hanging out enjoying themselves. Thats how a genius shouldbe celebrated, among the people enjoying themselves",
          "`The spirit of Mozart dominates the city and what better place to sit at one of the cafes surrounding the square, watching the Fiakers (horse-drawn carriages) as they clatter along the streets. Even in winter when I visited on a cold but sunny day, hundreds of people sat at",
          "If you love skating, you will love the atmosphere ;-) going round and round to the beautiful music, looking to the monument of the greatest composer of all times ;-) You have to experience this ;-)",
          "I try this rink out every 5 years (the only time I skate) and I still enjoy the fact that I manage to stay upright. A favourite for all ages and families.",
          "This is what the City of Salzburg is all about - Mozart. Mozart is what made this city so famous! It pretty much puts Salzburg on the map of Austria. Hence it is only right that there be a monument honouring the Greatest Composer of All Time! This statue in the center of",
          "Worthwhile taking a quick look being in Mozarts birthplace and is in fairly central part of old town. We saw it at night time which meant the photos we took were great.",
          "A lovely square in the centre of Salzburg. In the middle of the square there is a monument of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It's great on a sunny day to get the true vibe of the city. It's a great place to walk around to see the buildings and architecture. Be sure to stop and listen",

          "Grab a table at one of the cafe's, order coffee or beer and watch the people, horse drawn carriages, listen to the chatter (even if you do not understand what they are saying), and just relax. There is shopping, but people watching is better",

          "I would recommend you see this square. It contains the Mozart monument, some shops and the information shop if you want to book any tours. It is also around the corner from the Mozart bridge which was featured in the Sound of Music movie.",
          "Maybe I'm missing something. The statue is nice and so is the square but thats about it. There is nothing here that stands out than any other square. Instead of going here go to the castle or explore the convent where the Sound of Music was filmed.Your best bet is to walk",
          "nice statue of Mozart in the middle of this pleasant square in the old town . not a lot else to say .",
          "A lovely plaza houses the Mozart statue and is located to the right of the plaza where you exit the funicular. Visit the Panorama Museum and the Salzburg Museum on your way there.",
          "I was amazed by the view. I could almost hear Mozart playing. I have great memories of Salzburg. My first trip was in the Spring of 1961. I met a few girls that were refugees in Portugal, for some time, due to the Russian occupation, they were great and showed me places I would",
          "Not a lot happening here - huge area. Tourist Info situated here. Statue is nice. Shame there wasn't more here to attract people. A lot of the other squares have market stalls, musicians etc",

          "We were there on the first day,meeting our guide for the walking tour.The tour was informative.The square is rather touristy.It was easy to find as the statue of Mozart was right in the centre. Great meeting place",
          "Lovely monument to commemorate this famous musical genius. That said the highlight was this puppeteer having his skeleton puppet singing to an Elvis song. Great talent.",
          "Salzburg and Mozart complement each other. Hence this square is famous. I agree there is not much happening here. All the major landmarks are around and hence one cannot possibly miss this spot",

          "Salzburg, how do you single out one attraction, when you think you have looked upon something of great beauty and grandeur you cross a road or round a corner and your mind spins again. Walk through the gardens, take in the fountains then walk back the opposite direction and be",
          "Nice square near the Dom Cathedral and The Residenz. Not really an attraction. Just good old Mozart standing proud and tall.",
          "Funny enough this spot, although it is in the centre, is never that busy. Simply because there is not much happening on this square. Not that it is an ugly squares, but around it are not so many interesting places.",
          "I had gone to the Tourist office to gather some information on an attraction to visit & saw this impressive bronze statue on a white pedestal of Salzburg`s most famous son.This statue was built by Schwanthaler & unveiled in the presence of Mozart`s two sons in 1842.This square",

          "The most important in this square is the memorial to Mozart in the middle of this beautiful square. Another important issue to the tourists is that here is a Tourist Info situated.",
          "This is another nice square in a town with many of them. The Mozart statue is fine if you are a fan. We were here in the spring so there wasn't ice skating but it is a nice spot to walk to, see the statue, or sit and relax a bit.",
          "If you go to Salzburg this statue represents it's most important person. The plaza also with the buildings beside show a good picture to take.",
          "This beautiful square, with trees and plants stands in the heart of Salzburg. Lots of the most beautiful buildings to see and masses of 'buzz'. A must see.",
          "We found this place mesmerizing......A truly amazing place and a visit most would enjoy. We went for the New Year and it snowed for three whole days. New Year was one of the best ever and at midnight on New Years Eve everyone dances to the Danube Waltz, which was great, young",
          "It's nice to see but I would not go out of my way. The local history books say the likeness does not look like Mozart. It sits on a very old location. A piece of Roman rock that was there when Rome controls this area. From this location you can get to other sites that are close.",
          "I listen to Mozart to go to sleep when stressed so it was kind of cool to see this and be in the area. I am not a huge fan, but it was still nice. this entire area is a must see if you are a fan.",
          "I guess the highlight is pretty much the Mozart Statue. During winter, they have the ice skating rink around the statue. Other than that, there's nothing much to see in this square.",
          "We visited salzburg twice back in the late nineties. Went back last week and was dissapointed to finf that the cafe on mozartplatz is now a museum. The cafe was the perfect place to stop a take in the square. Also skating rink in the square was blasting cheesy amarican standards",

          "Mozartplatz is an unassuming square located close to the DomQuartier, a palace in Salzburg's old town. The most interesting aspect of this square is the statue of Mozart. It's something to have a look at an maybe snap a pic of Salzburg's favorite son.",
          "During our day in Salzburg, there was a huge festival in the Mozartplatz and in front of the Cathedral so it was difficult to really see anything.",
          "We found the place alright but it was extremely busy. The festival was on and there were people everywhere. Purely for the history involved you would have to visit but I found it not to be very spectacular. Statue is about as interesting as all the others that we have seen on",
          "I come to Salzburg for Mozart!I snap some pics here-and there are some museums here if you have time-and the nearby castle on the top of the hill.There is a nearby kebab shop after one day of walking around here.",
          "We actually followed the Rick Steves walking tour of Old Town with starting at this site. So the statue is ok, but it's near a nice plaza and it is a good starting point for walking the Old Town.",
          "It was strange that in the middle of such a captivating city you find a place that doesn't really match the rest of its beauty. The plaza is pretty empty of anything else except for the statue of Mozart of course.",
          "While some may think the Mozartplatz is just a big empty space, think back to days gone by and imagine the bustle there would have been then. It is lovely to stroll from one square to the next and have 'elbow' room after wandering down all the very narrow streets. Mozart was",
          "If you want to see a statue of Mozart, then this is the place to go. Unfortunately, there's not much else in this plaza. There's a couple of small souvenir shops, however Mozartplatz is really just a big empty square that most tourist groups use as a meeting point at the end of",
          "Having visited countless squares in Europe, I find this somewhat underwhelming but I appreciate the importance of Mozart to the world and Salzburg. Definitely worth walking through. Sadly there's not much else to recommend it be on the attractive buildings. It's somewhat",
          "This is a large empty, except for the Mozart statue, plaza that offers practically nothing to tourists. Just a boring landmark, no more no less.",
          "What I Liked: nice to take a photo of the bronze sculpture. What I Disliked: nothing to admire except the surrounding buildings. Yes or No? No cause time will not permit me to visit so many places with limited time :(",
          "There's a nice statue of Mozart here alright, but essentially, there's nothing else to see. It makes for a good gathering spot; otherwise, it's wise not to make a special trip to visit this place. If you're nearby, however, just drop by, spend five minutes taking pictures of",

          "It's a simple plaza without much to recommend it - except the statue of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, arguably the greatest composer of all time! Plus there's a great Tourist Information center right there too!",
          "Indeed a milestone and a place to visit while in the area of Salzburg, if you're looking for something more than parks and malls. Its an elegant memorial to Mozart, not flashy or grandiose - just about right.",
          "Named after the great himself, it's perhaps no surprise that this simple square is marked with a memorial to Mozart that was unveiled in 1842. While not as flashy or beautiful as other well-known squares in Europe, it's difficult to avoid passing through it on the way to and",

          "We enjoyed visiting this square on a number of occasions. Background music wasa being played, which gave an atmosphere. Hot wine was being served, which was excellent on a cold and snowy day",

        "wiki": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 \u2013 5 December 1791), baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart, was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period.\nBorn in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized.\nHe composed more than 600 works, many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is considered among the greatest classical composers of all time, and his influence on Western music is profound. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: \"posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years\".\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\n\n\n==== Family and childhood ====\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born on 27 January 1756 to Leopold Mozart (1719\u20131787) and Anna Maria, n\u00e9e Pertl (1720\u20131778), at Getreidegasse 9 in Salzburg. This was the capital of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, an ecclesiastic principality in what is now Austria, then part of the Holy Roman Empire. He was the youngest of seven children, five of whom died in infancy. His elder sister was Maria Anna Mozart (1751\u20131829), nicknamed \"Nannerl\". Mozart was baptised the day after his birth, at St. Rupert's Cathedral in Salzburg. The baptismal record gives his name in Latinized form, as Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart. He generally called himself \"Wolfgang Amad\u00e8 Mozart\" as an adult, but his name had many variants.\nLeopold Mozart, a native of Augsburg, then an Imperial Free City in the Holy Roman Empire, was a minor composer and an experienced teacher. In 1743, he was appointed as fourth violinist in the musical establishment of Count Leopold Anton von Firmian, the ruling Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. Four years later, he married Anna Maria in Salzburg. Leopold became the orchestra's deputy Kapellmeister in 1763. During the year of his son's birth, Leopold published a violin textbook, Versuch einer gr\u00fcndlichen Violinschule, which achieved success.When Nannerl was 7, she began keyboard lessons with her father, while her three-year-old brother looked on. Years later, after her brother's death, she reminisced:\n\nHe often spent much time at the clavier, picking out thirds, which he was ever striking, and his pleasure showed that it sounded good. ... In the fourth year of his age his father, for a game as it were, began to teach him a few minuets and pieces at the clavier. ... He could play it faultlessly and with the greatest delicacy, and keeping exactly in time. ... At the age of five, he was already composing little pieces, which he played to his father who wrote them down.\n\nThese early pieces, K. 1\u20135, were recorded in the Nannerl Notenbuch. There is some scholarly debate about whether Mozart was four or five years old when he created his first musical compositions, though there is little doubt that Mozart composed his first three pieces of music within a few weeks of each other: K. 1a, 1b, and 1c.In his early years, Wolfgang's father was his only teacher. Along with music, he taught his children languages and academic subjects. Solomon notes that, while Leopold was a devoted teacher to his children, there is evidence that Mozart was keen to progress beyond what he was taught. His first ink-spattered composition and his precocious efforts with the violin were of his initiative and came as a surprise to Leopold, who eventually gave up composing when his son's musical talents became evident.\n\n\n==== 1762\u201373: Travel ====\n\nWhile Wolfgang was young, his family made several European journeys in which he and Nannerl performed as child prodigies. These began with an exhibition in 1762 at the court of Prince-elector Maximilian III of Bavaria in Munich, and at the Imperial Courts in Vienna and Prague. A long concert tour followed, spanning three and a half years, taking the family to the courts of Munich, Mannheim, Paris, London, Dover, The Hague, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Mechelen and again to Paris, and back home via Zurich, Donaueschingen, and Munich. During this trip, Wolfgang met many musicians and acquainted himself with the works of other composers. A particularly significant influence was Johann Christian Bach, whom he visited in London in 1764 and 1765. When he was eight years old, Mozart wrote his first symphony, most of which was probably transcribed by his father.\n\nThe family trips were often challenging, and travel conditions were primitive. They had to wait for invitations and reimbursement from the nobility, and they endured long, near-fatal illnesses far from home: first Leopold (London, summer 1764), then both children (The Hague, autumn 1765). The family again went to Vienna in late 1767 and remained there until December 1768.\nAfter one year in Salzburg, Leopold and Wolfgang set off for Italy, leaving Anna Maria and Nannerl at home. This tour lasted from December 1769 to March 1771. As with earlier journeys, Leopold wanted to display his son's abilities as a performer and a rapidly maturing composer. Wolfgang met Josef Myslive\u010dek and Giovanni Battista Martini in Bologna and was accepted as a member of the famous Accademia Filarmonica. In Rome, he heard Gregorio Allegri's Miserere twice in performance, in the Sistine Chapel, and wrote it out from memory, thus producing the first unauthorized copy of this closely guarded property of the Vatican.In Milan, Mozart wrote the opera Mitridate, re di Ponto (1770), which was performed with success. This led to further opera commissions. He returned with his father twice to Milan (August\u2013December 1771; October 1772 \u2013 March 1773) for the composition and premieres of Ascanio in Alba (1771) and Lucio Silla (1772). Leopold hoped these visits would result in a professional appointment for his son, and indeed ruling Archduke Ferdinand contemplated hiring Mozart, but owing to his mother Empress Maria Theresa's reluctance to employ \"useless people\", the matter was dropped and Leopold's hopes were never realized. Toward the end of the journey, Mozart wrote the solo motet Exsultate, jubilate, K. 165.\n\n\n=== 1773\u201377: Employment at the Salzburg court ===\n\nAfter finally returning with his father from Italy on 13 March 1773, Mozart was employed as a court musician by the ruler of Salzburg, Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus Colloredo. The composer had many friends and admirers in Salzburg and had the opportunity to work in many genres, including symphonies, sonatas, string quartets, masses, serenades, and a few minor operas. Between April and December 1775, Mozart developed an enthusiasm for violin concertos, producing a series of five (the only ones he ever wrote), which steadily increased in their musical sophistication. The last three\u2014K. 216, K. 218, K. 219\u2014are now staples of the repertoire. In 1776, he turned his efforts to piano concertos, culminating in the E\u266d concerto K. 271 of early 1777, considered by critics to be a breakthrough work.Despite these artistic successes, Mozart grew increasingly discontented with Salzburg and redoubled his efforts to find a position elsewhere. One reason was his low salary, 150 florins a year; Mozart longed to compose operas, and Salzburg provided only rare occasions for these. The situation worsened in 1775 when the court theatre was closed, especially since the other theatre in Salzburg was primarily reserved for visiting troupes.Two long expeditions in search of work interrupted this long Salzburg stay. Mozart and his father visited Vienna from 14 July to 26 September 1773, and Munich from 6 December 1774 to March 1775. Neither visit was successful, though the Munich journey resulted in a popular success with the premiere of Mozart's opera La finta giardiniera.\n\n\n=== 1777\u201378: Journey to Paris ===\n\nIn August 1777, Mozart resigned his position at Salzburg and on 23 September ventured out once more in search of employment, with visits to Augsburg, Mannheim, Paris, and Munich.Mozart became acquainted with members of the famous orchestra in Mannheim, the best in Europe at the time. He also fell in love with Aloysia Weber, one of four daughters of a musical family. There were prospects of employment in Mannheim, but they came to nothing, and Mozart left for Paris on 14 March 1778 to continue his search. One of his letters from Paris hints at a possible post as an organist at Versailles, but Mozart was not interested in such an appointment. He fell into debt and took to pawning valuables. The nadir of the visit occurred when Mozart's mother was taken ill and died on 3 July 1778. There had been delays in calling a doctor\u2014probably, according to Halliwell, because of a lack of funds. Mozart stayed with Melchior Grimm, who, as a personal secretary of the Duke d'Orl\u00e9ans, lived in his mansion.While Mozart was in Paris, his father was pursuing opportunities of employment for him in Salzburg. With the support of the local nobility, Mozart was offered a post as court organist and concertmaster. The annual salary was 450 florins, but he was reluctant to accept. By that time, relations between Grimm and Mozart had cooled, and Mozart moved out. After leaving Paris in September 1778 for Strasbourg, he lingered in Mannheim and Munich, still hoping to obtain an appointment outside Salzburg. In Munich, he again encountered Aloysia, now a very successful singer, but she was no longer interested in him. Mozart finally returned to Salzburg on 15 January 1779 and took up his new appointment, but his discontent with Salzburg remained undiminished.Among the better-known works which Mozart wrote on the Paris journey are the A minor piano sonata, K. 310/300d and the \"Paris\" Symphony (No. 31), which were performed in Paris on 12 and 18 June 1778.\n\n\n=== Vienna ===\n\n\n==== 1781: Departure ====\n\nIn January 1781, Mozart's opera Idomeneo premiered with \"considerable success\" in Munich. The following March, Mozart was summoned to Vienna, where his employer, Archbishop Colloredo, was attending the celebrations for the accession of Joseph II to the Austrian throne. For Colloredo, this was simply a matter of wanting his musical servant to be at hand (Mozart indeed was required to dine in Colloredo's establishment with the valets and cooks.) However, Mozart was planning a bigger career even as he continued in the archbishop's service; for example, he wrote to his father:\n\nMy main goal right now is to meet the emperor in some agreeable fashion, I am absolutely determined he should get to know me. I would be so happy if I could whip through my opera for him and then play a fugue or two, for that's what he likes.\nMozart did indeed soon meet the Emperor, who eventually was to support his career substantially with commissions and a part-time position.\nIn the same letter to his father just quoted, Mozart outlined his plans to participate as a soloist in the concerts of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, a prominent benefit concert series; this plan as well came to pass after the local nobility prevailed on Colloredo to drop his opposition.Colloredo's wish to prevent Mozart from performing outside his establishment was in other cases, however, carried through, raising the composer's anger; one example was a chance to perform before the Emperor at Countess Thun's for a fee equal to half of his yearly Salzburg salary.\nThe quarrel with the archbishop came to a head in May: Mozart attempted to resign and was refused. The following month, permission was granted, but in a grossly insulting way: the composer was dismissed literally \"with a kick in the arse\", administered by the archbishop's steward, Count Arco. Mozart decided to settle in Vienna as a freelance performer and composer.The quarrel with the archbishop went harder for Mozart because his father sided against him. Hoping fervently that he would obediently follow Colloredo back to Salzburg, Mozart's father exchanged intense letters with his son, urging him to be reconciled with their employer. Mozart passionately defended his intention to pursue an independent career in Vienna. The debate ended when Mozart was dismissed by the archbishop, freeing himself both of his employer and of his father's demands to return. Solomon characterizes Mozart's resignation as a \"revolutionary step\", and it significantly altered the course of his life.\n\n\n==== Early years ====\n\nMozart's new career in Vienna began well. He often performed as a pianist, notably in a competition before the Emperor with Muzio Clementi on 24 December 1781, and he soon \"had established himself as the finest keyboard player in Vienna\". He also prospered as a composer, and in 1782 completed the opera Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail (\"The Abduction from the Seraglio\"), which premiered on 16 July 1782 and achieved considerable success. The work was soon being performed \"throughout German-speaking Europe\", and thoroughly established Mozart's reputation as a composer.\n\nNear the height of his quarrels with Colloredo, Mozart moved in with the Weber family, who had moved to Vienna from Mannheim. The father, Fridolin, had died, and the Webers were now taking in lodgers to make ends meet.\n\n\n==== Marriage and children ====\nAloysia, who had earlier rejected Mozart's suit, was now married to the actor and artist Joseph Lange. Mozart's interest shifted to the third Weber daughter, Constanze.\nThe courtship did not go entirely smoothly; surviving correspondence indicates that Mozart and Constanze briefly separated in April 1782. Mozart faced a challenging task in getting his father's permission for the marriage. The couple were finally married on 4 August 1782 in St. Stephen's Cathedral, the day before his father's consent arrived in the mail.The couple had six children, of whom only two survived infancy:\n\nRaimund Leopold (17 June \u2013 19 August 1783)\nKarl Thomas Mozart (21 September 1784 \u2013 31 October 1858)\nJohann Thomas Leopold (18 October \u2013 15 November 1786)\nTheresia Constanzia Adelheid Friedericke Maria Anna (27 December 1787 \u2013 29 June 1788)\nAnna Maria (died soon after birth, 16 November 1789)\nFranz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (26 July 1791 \u2013 29 July 1844)\n\n\n=== 1782\u201387 ===\nIn 1782 and 1783, Mozart became intimately acquainted with the work of Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel as a result of the influence of Gottfried van Swieten, who owned many manuscripts of the Baroque masters. Mozart's study of these scores inspired compositions in Baroque style and later influenced his musical language, for example in fugal passages in Die Zauberfl\u00f6te (\"The Magic Flute\") and the finale of Symphony No. 41.In 1783, Mozart and his wife visited his family in Salzburg. His father and sister were cordially polite to Constanze, but the visit prompted the composition of one of Mozart's great liturgical pieces, the Mass in C minor. Though not completed, it was premiered in Salzburg, with Constanze singing a solo part.Mozart met Joseph Haydn in Vienna around 1784, and the two composers became friends. When Haydn visited Vienna, they sometimes played together in an impromptu string quartet. Mozart's six quartets dedicated to Haydn (K. 387, K. 421, K. 428, K. 458, K. 464, and K. 465) date from the period 1782 to 1785, and are judged to be a response to Haydn's Opus 33 set from 1781. Haydn in 1785 told Mozart's father: \"I tell you before God, and as an honest man, your son is the greatest composer known to me by person and repute, he has taste and what is more the greatest skill in composition.\"From 1782 to 1785 Mozart mounted concerts with himself as a soloist, presenting three or four new piano concertos in each season. Since space in the theatres was scarce, he booked unconventional venues: a large room in the Trattnerhof (an apartment building), and the ballroom of the Mehlgrube (a restaurant). The concerts were very popular, and the concertos he premiered at them are still firm fixtures in the repertoire. Solomon writes that during this period, Mozart created \"a harmonious connection between an eager composer-performer and a delighted audience, which was given the opportunity of witnessing the transformation and perfection of a major musical genre\".With substantial returns from his concerts and elsewhere, Mozart and his wife adopted a rather luxurious lifestyle. They moved to an expensive apartment, with a yearly rent of 460 florins. Mozart bought a fine fortepiano from Anton Walter for about 900 florins, and a billiard table for about 300. The Mozarts sent their son Karl Thomas to an expensive boarding school and kept servants. Saving was therefore impossible, and the short period of financial success did nothing to soften the hardship the Mozarts were later to experience.On 14 December 1784, Mozart became a Freemason, admitted to the lodge Zur Wohlt\u00e4tigkeit (\"Beneficence\"). Freemasonry played an essential role in the remainder of Mozart's life: he attended meetings, a number of his friends were Masons, and on various occasions, he composed Masonic music, e.g. the Maurerische Trauermusik.\n\n\n==== 1786\u201387: Return to opera ====\n\nDespite the great success of Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail, Mozart did little operatic writing for the next four years, producing only two unfinished works and the one-act Der Schauspieldirektor. He focused instead on his career as a piano soloist and writer of concertos. Around the end of 1785, Mozart moved away from keyboard writing and began his famous operatic collaboration with the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte. 1786 saw the successful premiere of The Marriage of Figaro in Vienna. Its reception in Prague later in the year was even warmer, and this led to a second collaboration with Da Ponte: the opera Don Giovanni, which premiered in October 1787 to acclaim in Prague, but less success in Vienna in 1788. The two are among Mozart's most famous works and are mainstays of the operatic repertoire today, though at their premieres their musical complexity caused difficulty both for listeners and for performers. These developments were not witnessed by Mozart's father, who had died on 28 May 1787.In December 1787, Mozart finally obtained a steady post under aristocratic patronage. Emperor Joseph II appointed him as his \"chamber composer\", a post that had fallen vacant the previous month on the death of Gluck. It was a part-time appointment, paying just 800 florins per year, and required Mozart only to compose dances for the annual balls in the Redoutensaal (see Mozart and dance). This modest income became important to Mozart when hard times arrived. Court records show that Joseph aimed to keep the esteemed composer from leaving Vienna in pursuit of better prospects.In 1787, the young Ludwig van Beethoven spent several weeks in Vienna, hoping to study with Mozart. No reliable records survive to indicate whether the two composers ever met.\n\n\n=== Later years ===\n\n\n==== 1788\u201390 ====\n\nToward the end of the decade, Mozart's circumstances worsened. Around 1786 he had ceased to appear frequently in public concerts, and his income shrank. This was a difficult time for musicians in Vienna because of the Austro-Turkish War: both the general level of prosperity and the ability of the aristocracy to support music had declined.By mid-1788, Mozart and his family had moved from central Vienna to the suburb of Alsergrund. Although it has been suggested that Mozart aimed to reduce his rental expenses, research shows that by moving to the suburb, Mozart had not reduced his expenses (as he wrote in his letter to Puchberg), but merely increased the housing space at his disposal. Mozart began to borrow money, most often from his friend and fellow mason Michael Puchberg; \"a pitiful sequence of letters pleading for loans\" survives. Maynard Solomon and others have suggested that Mozart was suffering from depression, and it seems his output slowed. Major works of the period include the last three symphonies (Nos. 39, 40, and 41, all from 1788), and the last of the three Da Ponte operas, Cos\u00ec fan tutte, premiered in 1790.\nAround this time, Mozart made some long journeys hoping to improve his fortunes: to Leipzig, Dresden, and Berlin in the spring of 1789, and Frankfurt, Mannheim, and other German cities in 1790.\n\n\n==== 1791 ====\nMozart's last year was, until his final illness struck, a time of high productivity\u2014and by some accounts, one of personal recovery. He composed a great deal, including some of his most admired works: the opera The Magic Flute; the final piano concerto (K. 595 in B\u266d); the Clarinet Concerto K. 622; the last in his series of string quintets (K. 614 in E\u266d); the motet Ave verum corpus K. 618; and the unfinished Requiem K. 626.\nMozart's financial situation, a source of anxiety in 1790, finally began to improve. Although the evidence is inconclusive, it appears that wealthy patrons in Hungary and Amsterdam pledged annuities to Mozart in return for the occasional composition. He is thought to have benefited from the sale of dance music written in his role as Imperial chamber composer. Mozart no longer borrowed large sums from Puchberg and made a start on paying off his debts.He experienced great satisfaction in the public success of some of his works, notably The Magic Flute (which was performed several times in the short period between its premiere and Mozart's death) and the Little Masonic Cantata K. 623, premiered on 17 November 1791.\n\n\n==== Final illness and death ====\n\nMozart fell ill while in Prague for the premiere, on 6 September 1791, of his opera La clemenza di Tito, which was written in that same year on commission for the Emperor's coronation festivities. He continued his professional functions for some time and conducted the premiere of The Magic Flute on 30 September. His health deteriorated on 20 November, at which point he became bedridden, suffering from swelling, pain, and vomiting.\n\nMozart was nursed in his final illness by his wife and her youngest sister and was attended by the family doctor, Thomas Franz Closset. He was mentally occupied with the task of finishing his Requiem, but the evidence that he dictated passages to his student Franz Xaver S\u00fcssmayr is minimal.Mozart died in his home on 5 December 1791(1791-12-05) (aged 35) at 12:55 am. The New Grove describes his funeral:\n\nMozart was interred in a common grave, in accordance with contemporary Viennese custom, at the St. Marx Cemetery outside the city on 7 December. If, as later reports say, no mourners attended, that too is consistent with Viennese burial customs at the time; later Otto Jahn (1856) wrote that Salieri, S\u00fcssmayr, van Swieten and two other musicians were present. The tale of a storm and snow is false; the day was calm and mild.\nThe expression \"common grave\" refers to neither a communal grave nor a pauper's grave, but an individual grave for a member of the common people (i.e., not the aristocracy). Common graves were subject to excavation after ten years; the graves of aristocrats were not.The cause of Mozart's death cannot be known with certainty. The official record has it as hitziges Frieselfieber (\"severe miliary fever\", referring to a rash that looks like millet seeds), more a description of the symptoms than a diagnosis. Researchers have suggested more than a hundred causes of death, including acute rheumatic fever, streptococcal infection, trichinosis, influenza, mercury poisoning, and a rare kidney ailment.Mozart's modest funeral did not reflect his standing with the public as a composer; memorial services and concerts in Vienna and Prague were well-attended. Indeed, in the period immediately after his death, his reputation rose substantially. Solomon describes an \"unprecedented wave of enthusiasm\" for his work; biographies were written (first by Schlichtegroll, Niemetschek, and Nissen); and publishers vied to produce complete editions of his works.\n\n\n== Appearance and character ==\n\nMozart's physical appearance was described by tenor Michael Kelly in his Reminiscences: \"a remarkably small man, very thin and pale, with a profusion of fine, fair hair of which he was rather vain\". His early biographer Niemetschek wrote, \"there was nothing special about [his] physique. ... He was small and his countenance, except for his large intense eyes, gave no signs of his genius.\" His facial complexion was pitted, a reminder of his childhood case of smallpox. He loved elegant clothing. Kelly remembered him at a rehearsal: \"[He] was on the stage with his crimson pelisse and gold-laced cocked hat, giving the time of the music to the orchestra.\" Based on pictures that researchers were able to find of Mozart, he seemed to wear a white wig for most of his formal occasions\u2014researchers of the Salzburg Mozarteum declared that only one of his fourteen portraits they had found showed him without his wig. Of his voice, his wife later wrote that it \"was a tenor, rather soft in speaking and delicate in singing, but when anything excited him, or it became necessary to exert it, it was both powerful and energetic.\"Mozart usually worked long and hard, finishing compositions at a tremendous pace as deadlines approached. He often made sketches and drafts; unlike Beethoven's, these are mostly not preserved, as his wife sought to destroy them after his death.Mozart lived at the center of the Viennese musical world, and knew a significant number and variety of people: fellow musicians, theatrical performers, fellow Salzburgers, and aristocrats, including some acquaintance with Emperor Joseph II. Solomon considers his three closest friends to have been Gottfried von Jacquin, Count August Hatzfeld, and Sigmund Barisani; others included his older colleague Joseph Haydn, singers Franz Xaver Gerl and Benedikt Schack, and the horn player Joseph Leutgeb. Leutgeb and Mozart carried on a curious kind of friendly mockery, often with Leutgeb as the butt of Mozart's practical jokes.He enjoyed billiards and dancing and kept pets: a canary, a starling, a dog, and a horse for recreational riding. He had a startling fondness for scatological humour, which is preserved in his surviving letters, notably those written to his cousin Maria Anna Thekla Mozart around 1777\u20131778, and in his correspondence with his sister and parents. Mozart also wrote scatological music, a series of canons that he sang with his friends.\n\n\n== Religious views ==\n\nMozart was raised a Roman Catholic and remained a devout member of the church throughout his life.\n\n\n== Works, musical style, and innovations ==\n\n\n=== Style ===\nMozart's music, like Haydn's, stands as an archetype of the Classical style. At the time he began composing, European music was dominated by the style galant, a reaction against the highly evolved intricacy of the Baroque. Progressively, and in large part at the hands of Mozart himself, the contrapuntal complexities of the late Baroque emerged once more, moderated and disciplined by new forms, and adapted to a new aesthetic and social milieu. Mozart was a versatile composer, and wrote in every major genre, including symphony, opera, the solo concerto, chamber music including string quartet and string quintet, and the piano sonata. These forms were not new, but Mozart advanced their technical sophistication and emotional reach. He almost single-handedly developed and popularized the Classical piano concerto. He wrote a great deal of religious music, including large-scale masses, as well as dances, divertimenti, serenades, and other forms of light entertainment.The central traits of the Classical style are all present in Mozart's music. Clarity, balance, and transparency are the hallmarks of his work, but simplistic notions of its delicacy mask the exceptional power of his finest masterpieces, such as the Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor, K. 491; the Symphony No. 40 in G minor, K. 550; and the opera Don Giovanni. Charles Rosen makes the point forcefully:\n\nIt is only through recognizing the violence and sensuality at the center of Mozart's work that we can make a start towards a comprehension of his structures and an insight into his magnificence. In a paradoxical way, Schumann's superficial characterization of the G minor Symphony can help us to see Mozart's daemon more steadily. In all of Mozart's supreme expressions of suffering and terror, there is something shockingly voluptuous.\nDuring his last decade, Mozart frequently exploited chromatic harmony. A notable instance is his String Quartet in C major, K. 465 (1785), whose introduction abounds in chromatic suspensions, giving rise to the work's nickname, the \"Dissonance\" quartet.\nMozart always had a gift for absorbing and adapting the valuable features of others' music. His travels helped in the forging of a unique compositional language. In London as a child, he met J. C. Bach and heard his music. In Paris, Mannheim, and Vienna he met with other compositional influences, as well as the avant-garde capabilities of the Mannheim orchestra. In Italy, he encountered the Italian overture and opera buffa, both of which deeply affected the evolution of his practice. In London and Italy, the galant style was in the ascendent: simple, light music with a mania for cadencing; an emphasis on tonic, dominant, and subdominant to the exclusion of other harmonies; symmetrical phrases; and clearly articulated partitions in the overall form of movements. Some of Mozart's early symphonies are Italian overtures, with three movements running into each other; many are homotonal (all three movements having the same key signature, with the slow middle movement being in the relative minor). Others mimic the works of J. C. Bach, and others show the simple rounded binary forms turned out by Viennese composers.\n\nAs Mozart matured, he progressively incorporated more features adapted from the Baroque. For example, the Symphony No. 29 in A major K. 201 has a contrapuntal main theme in its first movement, and experimentation with irregular phrase lengths. Some of his quartets from 1773 have fugal finales, probably influenced by Haydn, who had included three such finales in his recently published Opus 20 set. The influence of the Sturm und Drang (\"Storm and Stress\") period in music, with its brief foreshadowing of the Romantic era, is evident in the music of both composers at that time. Mozart's Symphony No. 25 in G minor K. 183 is another excellent example.\nMozart would sometimes switch his focus between operas and instrumental music. He produced operas in each of the prevailing styles: opera buffa, such as The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and Cos\u00ec fan tutte; opera seria, such as Idomeneo; and Singspiel, of which Die Zauberfl\u00f6te is the most famous example by any composer. In his later operas, he employed subtle changes in instrumentation, orchestral texture, and tone colour, for emotional depth and to mark dramatic shifts. Here his advances in opera and instrumental composing interacted: his increasingly sophisticated use of the orchestra in the symphonies and concertos influenced his operatic orchestration, and his developing subtlety in using the orchestra to psychological effect in his operas was in turn reflected in his later non-operatic compositions.\n\n\n=== Influence ===\nMozart's most famous pupil, whom the Mozarts took into their Vienna home for two years as a child, was probably Johann Nepomuk Hummel, a transitional figure between the Classical and Romantic eras. More important is the influence Mozart had on composers of later generations. Ever since the surge in his reputation after his death, studying his scores has been a standard part of classical musicians' training.Ludwig van Beethoven, Mozart's junior by fifteen years, was deeply influenced by his work, with which he was acquainted as a teenager. He is thought to have performed Mozart's operas while playing in the court orchestra at Bonn and travelled to Vienna in 1787 hoping to study with the older composer. Some of Beethoven's works have direct models in comparable works by Mozart, and he wrote cadenzas (WoO 58) to Mozart's D minor piano concerto K. 466. For further details, see Mozart and Beethoven.\nComposers have paid homage to Mozart by writing sets of variations on his themes. Beethoven wrote four such sets (Op. 66, WoO 28, WoO 40, WoO 46). Others include Fernando Sor's Introduction and Variations on a Theme by Mozart (1821), Mikhail Glinka's Variations on a Theme from Mozart's Opera \"Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\" (1822), Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin's Variations on \"L\u00e0 ci darem la mano\" from Don Giovanni (1827), and Max Reger's Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart (1914), based on the variation theme in the piano sonata K. 331.Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky wrote his Orchestral Suite No. 4 in G, Mozartiana (1887), as a tribute to Mozart.\n\n\n=== K\u00f6chel catalogue ===\n\nFor unambiguous identification of works by Mozart, a K\u00f6chel catalogue number is used. This is a unique number assigned, in regular chronological order, to every one of his known works. A work is referenced by the abbreviation \"K.\" or \"KV\" followed by this number. The first edition of the catalogue was completed in 1862 by Ludwig von K\u00f6chel. It has since been repeatedly updated, as scholarly research improves knowledge of the dates and authenticity of individual works.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart in popular culture\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBraunbehrens, Volkmar (1990).

You learn so much about his father especially with him mentoring Wolfgang his entire life. Everything Wolfgang was in terms of his music",
          "After having read some rather negative reviews on here about this place, I was a bit nervous, but it was fantastic. Obviously such a place would only be of interest to anyone who is interested in music. My teenage son, husband and I all enjoyed our visit and it was fascinating",
          "We visited here as part of the combo ticket with Mozart\u2019s Birthplace. This was the first museum we visited. The museum was fairly small and we did it in about an hour. The information was redundant. A lot of the artifacts were facsimiles which detracted from the overall",
          "Horrible horrible horrible service and underwhelming museum. All locals and tourists must avoid this scam.",
          "We got the combined ticket for Mozart's birthplace and adult residence (wohnhaus). In this adult residence there are hardly any original items. The information and paintings are repeats of the displays in Mozart's the birthplace or in Mozart's apartment exhibit in Vienna. Staff",
          "Imagine what they could do with a bit of funding to really curate this exhibition to the quality it deserves. Who will step up and fund that to happen with so many annual visitors and so much good reference material?",
          "The residence is beautiful Leopold Mozart must mentioned its a vital part in Wolfgang Mozart history and life.",
          "It was interesting, but there is more of an emphasis on the father than on Wolfgang. Also, we thought the ticket price was high for what you get.",
          "We visited both the Mozart Residence and his birthplace and were more impressed with the former. It provided useful information about the father and the important role he played in the development of the talent of son Wolfgang and daughter Nannerl. We also enjoyed the audio",
          "Criticism in some previous posts complain that most of the House is dedicated to Mozart\u2019s father rather than Wolfgang himself. This misses the point. You cannot understand the Wolfgang Mozart of the Salzburg year\u2019s without knowing about his domineering father. The exhibition on",
          "This is where Leopold Mozart lived with his family and is best known as the father of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, where the latter lived as a child. The house is a a small museum and there really isn't much to see. There's an exhibition that's more about Leopold than his more",
          "Terrible experience. We bought the ticket to enter to Mozarts birthplace and to Mozarts residence. We got at 5 pm to Mozarts residence and we didn\u2019t get allowed!!!! No one in the counter. At 5:20 the two women from the counter finally appeared to tell us that the place was going",
          "Based on other reviews I had prioritized a visit to Motzart's birthplace, but with some additional rain during our stay we decided to visit this residence as well and am very glad we did. As others have noted this location is more focused on Leopold Motzart, however, the audio",
          "This is where Mozart lived with his family as a child. A small museum. Boring. Fun to see how big an apartment the Mozart family had but that is all. Mozarts house in Vienna is faaaar more interesting.",
          "Not the biggest ever exhibition I have seen, but why have you visited Salzburg? Because of Mozart. Therefore birthplace and residence are must for you. Buy a combine ticket or Salzburg card.",
          "We didn't do any research before walking in, so we didn't know that most of the information presented here was mostly about Wolfgang's father. There's a lot of information, should you care. We learned a lot, and it was a nice place to visit on a rainy day. Not very",
          "Going to the residence I was expecting to learn about the life of THE Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus. But instead the exhibition was all about his father Leopold. Nicely executed exhibition but who cares? Not me. He was interesting enough to rate a room but not the whole exhibit.",
          "We went to buy tickets and the staff told us that at this time, the museum was more dedicated to Mozart's father and teacher. We decided to only see the outside of the house and go to his birthplace instead.",
          "Staff at this museum are extremely racist, rude and jaded. There\u2019s no need to make racist Chinese remarks and note I am NOT from China and I can perfectly understand u. Don\u2019t think that u can mumble and grumble without being understood! Not fit to work in a tourist attraction",
          "WOW! I had a view, just across the street from Mozart's residence, from my hotel,the Hotel Bristol Salzburg and it was just steps away.",
          "Mozart of course lived in many places but it is a privilege to visit a space where this genius found inspiration to help created such memorable works",
          "I like it as it\u2019s Mozart\u2019s birth place, Mozart\u2019s portraits, pianos, violin, room he was born in etc.",
          "The museum was bad but the staff were horrible, got very annoyed because I took a photo, made for a very unpleasant experience. Very underwhelming indeed. I left after about ten minutes feeling totally conned. We went to the castle , it was brilliant, comparison was Night & day.",
          "Best part about visiting this place is the audio guide which has all the amazing music compositions made by mozart family. One can listen to them while walking around. Apart from that, the exhibition items on display are moderate",
          "I enjoy Mozart so thought it would be a good place to visit but it was a bit underwhelming. Good place to learn some of his history and see where he lived though. The staff was not helpful at all, rude, and seemed like they didn't want to be there. If you are a Mozart fan",
          "Although both Mozart's Birthplace and Mozart's Residence can be entered on a single slightly discounted ticket, they are both disappointing. There are only a few rooms to walk through, and these are hardly authentic. Sure one can use the audioguide for some explanations, but",
          "You get to see all of Mozart's home - his kitchen, his family place, etc. There is a lot of info on his family and his journey. If you are into history and love this guy, just don't think twice. Well maintained, good tour.",
          "It\u2019s was interesting visit but not for kids as it\u2019s too much history. Definitely worth visit if history is your thing but skip if your kids are under 10",
          "We went to both Mozart\u2019s birthplace and residence and would recommend this more out of the 2 if on limited time. The audio guide is great giving a very comprehensive insight. Spent just over an hour here, would recommend if you\u2019re in Salzburg.",
          "Glad we went but just not that exciting or interesting. Maybe our expectations were a little higher than should have been. Nice to say we have been there.",
          "Really enjoyed the tour of the Mozart residence with the audio guide. Lots of history about the whole Mozart family with snippets of music throughout the tour. Free entry with the Salzburg card.",
          "Mozart\u2019s Residence was a very captivating part of our trip to Salzburg. We spent an hour or so touring around the residence with the audio guide which was quite interesting. I recommend getting the Salzburg card - gets you into all of Salzburg\u2019s main attractions for much cheaper",
          "Twinned with a visit to the other Mozart museum across the river, this brings the story of the great but flawed genius to life. We made use of our wonderful Salzburg card to get free entry and free hire of the excellent audio guide. The signage could be improved - but that said",
          "A further informative site of Mozart's life after visiting Mozart Geburtshaus. Free audio guide in English. There's a fun room at the end of the tour.",
          "For any Mozart fan this is a surprising hidden gem, housing the Mozarteum - a collection of his instruments and papers collected over the years, very informative and interesting about the whole family, both Salzburg and to some extent Vienna Mozart Houses do focus on the family",
          "The Mozart Residence is in Salzburg's new town and in the 18th century was given the nickname \"tanzmeisterhaus\" after the then resident, the high-ranking dance master Johann Pastier from France. This museum has a mix of static and audio / visual displays that describe the Mozart",
          "Iw would be hard to visit Salzburg and not visit Mozart's Residence and it is very central and easy to find.",
          "Salzburg is all about Mozart, of course, and for good reason. Visit the Mozart Residence, which as been turned into an interesting museum. There is an audio guide included, which is quite informative. My favorite part was the room filled with instruments that he had played.",
          "For the entry fees, we paid 9\u20ac for senior citizens and 11\u20ac each for adult. The tour took us to a room with several rows of chairs where visitors sat to watch a multimedia presentations on the life history of Mozart. In this room, Mozart\u2019s piano was prominently displayed. It",
          "The Wohnhaus was across from our hotel. It was better than expected and showed how prosperous the Mozard family became. Well presented audiphone exhibits gave context to the time and life of the family. It was included in the Salzburger ticket so i gave it a go in a spare hour",
          "Great to see if you are fan. Very informative also easy to reach, free with Salzburg card. Interesting place. Recommend if you are fan.",
          "If you\u2019re a Mozart fan this is worth it. I found his birthplace a little more interesting but this place was nice too. I\u2019d recommend the Salzburg Card which covers both places. This had a room where you can watch movies about him and listen to his music for free but I didn\u2019t",
          "I don\u2019t usually get irritated at other reviews, but the reviews for both this museum as well as Mozart\u2019s Birth House simply aren\u2019t accurate. Not only is there quite a bit to see each place, but most of what you are seeing is original, NOT a facsimile. You are seeing actual",
          "Since this was paid for by our tour purchase it was okay but nothing so great. Not much to the museum but okay for a walk through.",
          "We liked this museum, interesting to read about Mozart\u2019s life, however there\u2019s not a huge amount to it. They have a range of instruments that are fascinating but not much else. Luckily, it is not that expensive!",
          "The instruments were so cool to see, the place is well maintained and full of histroy. Would highly recommend!",
          "When visiting Saulsburg you must visit the birthplace of Mozart and you must visit this his primary residence in Saulsburg. It\u2019s a wonderful museum and a beautiful garden plus a terrific restaurant. It\u2019s filled with very interesting musical artifacts and as well laid out",
          "So this is where Mozart lived with his family - very historical. We saw his actual pianos, violin...family portraits. We even had an extra special time there as there was a group visiting from the LA Opera and the museum prepared a special concert for them which we also enjoyed",
          "The residence is well maintained with lots of clear elaboration in English about the life chronology and family background of Mozart. My kid is fond of music and it is a valuable lesson for her to understand more about the great musician Mozart. Highly recommended",
          "Visitors are allowed a walk-through of this residence, where the fortepiano and violin that Mozart actually played are on display among other artifacts. We were lucky enough to have witnessed a performance on both by representatives of the Mozarteum Foundation -- quite an honor.",
          "The fact that this house is a rebuild and nothing in it is from Mozart time and coupled with the arrogant rudeness of the older staff member on the first floor..would not recommend..better spend money on a concert and experience his true brilliance",
          "Free entry with the Salzburg and we were running out of things to do. Stopped in here and had a nice visit.",
          "A large painting of the family shows the prodigy with his father and sister. Above the threesome his mother is portrayed, painted separately as she had sadly died two years before. This is just one of the marvellous artifacts in the rooms, to which the family moved in 1773 as",
          "This museum has so much to see and Read! Even with the audio tour, there is a lot to read at almost every exhibit. Plan on several hours if you want to take it all in. We visited Mozart's birthplace museum first, then this museum. That is the order I would recommend.",
          "This tells more of the story of Mozart and has a free audio tour. Included in the salzburg card but I think still overpriced if you pay. Lots of exhibits and instruments and details about other members of his family. Far more educational and takes a bit longer to really look at",
          "The Salzburg card gets you free admission. You go through this place with an audio device that explains what you see. You also hear Mozart's music. This is a much better apartment than his birthplace. There are several multimedia presentations. You learn about the cult of Mozart.",
          "Free with the SalzburgCard. You should allow 1 to 1\u00bd hours. No photos allowed. One of the best audio-guides so make sure you take this. Each exhibit is labelled with a number which you tap into the handset to hear the basic commentary. You can then tap in a request for",
          "Spend your time here to learn about Mozart's work, compositions and about his family. The mobile app is a good guide! Probably a great place for Music students.",
          "Its just an old house with very bare looking rooms and a few posters about Mozart. OK so its where he lived for a few years but that's about it. Mozarts birthplace in the centre is larger and more interesting.",
          "I enjoyed seeing the instruments Mozart actually used. They organized the history of Mozart's music activities well with the video production.",
          "There are two places to see about Mozart. One is the house where he was born, the other is the house where the family later moved to and lived. There is an interesting film and also a visit of the house is worthwhile. It is amazingly spacious. Some of the original instruments",
          "The home where Mozart was born has been beautifully maintained and the history. The stories, artifacts and explanations are very interesting. Enjoyed seeing it and learned a lot about Mozart that I didn't know.",
          "The pink house is where Mozart lived during his youth and composed some of his most famous melodies. It now houses a museum about his life and works. It is just a normal house but a must for music fans.",
          "This added more perspective re Mozart and his family but we enjoyed his birthplace house more as the house itself had more character to it.",
          "Very nice to learn more about Mozart. Audio is very helpful and objects in the room are also interesting to see. On the other hand, Mozart lived there for only a few years so the visit can be worth due to his life, story and accomplishments, but not by the house in itself.",
          "Highly overpriced entry ticket without much to offer. It's any random last century house. It's better to spend your money on some good opera to experience Mozart than going to this old house.",
          "Today I went to the Mozart Wohnhaus, which is where Mozart lived. This was not my first time in Salzburg, so since I had previously been to the Geburtshaus, I decided to go to this one this time. To be clear, this is the house Mozart lived in when he got older; the Geburtshaus",
          "This is a small place and there is no too much to see. If you are trying to waste an hour or so it may be worth a stop.",
          "Free with the Salzburg card so worth a quick visit. Not as interesting as Mozart\u2019s birthplace as not many exhibits. Mainly listening to audio guide. Most is about his family as Mozart only lived til 35 yrs and most info is at Birthplace museum. If you were pushed for time you",
          "Not what we expected, we definitely expected a more educative tour of the residence. We probably learned more from our city private tour about Mozart than from this tour.",
          "The museum is interesting, but I was expecting more. There are a few pianos, which were donated by private collectors, and some of Mozarts notes. Unless you read all of the notes, you can walk through this museum in 30 minutes. Taking pictures is extremely forbidden.",
          "If you know your Mozart history, you will know this place as the Tanzmeisters Haus. If you know your WWII history, you know that it is lucky this building still stands -- even in its reconstructed form -- for visitors. The displays over at the Birth House are better. What I",
          "Mozart's birthplace and the residence pretty much have the same history and biographic information, except the residence has more of a quirky interactive end. Would definitely recommend this house as opposed to the other.",
          "Did you know that Salzburg is the hometown of the great musical genius, Mozart\u2026 interesting isn\u2019t it? As you can see in the photo, me and my little music lover enjoyed this place very much. We are so fascinated seeing the display of old music instruments, hearing the story of",
          "Dissapointment. The house was reconstructed. The information was not clear and in a weird order. I just did not liked this place to much. The Mozarts geburtshaus is WAY better!",
          "See my review about the birth place. This tour is definitely better and more informative than the birth place. I recommend skipping that one and just doing this one. 12\u20ac a person to get in. Included in the Salzburg Card.",
          "You should definitely take a guided Tour in this house, you'll get a very good understanding of how Mozart's life was and what he was up to besides making music. It really puts you in the timeframe of his days, my wife and I enjoyed the visit very much.",
          "This is a small museum where you can learn some quite interesting facts about the life of Mozart and his role in the Austrian music. Old musical instruments, paintings, music scores etc. are part of this collection. Worth a visit.",
          "This is a true piece of music history - being able to see the instruments and hearing the history behind his mind and how he made music was enchanting. I love that you are not allowed to take pictures as it makes you enjoy the experience even more.",
          "A very well set out visit with audio guide and plenty of artefacts. My favourite was seeing the instruments owned by the Mozart family and hearing recordings of them being played. There is a point in Salzburg however when you will reach Mozart overload!",
          "I've loved Mozart music for decades. To actually be in the home in which he lived was a very, very special experience. Beforehand, you think of this man an ethereal entity. Then you come to realize that he was a human just like the rest of us living in a nice home with a",
          "Got in free with the Salzburg Card. Small but quite interesting. The real buzz is standing in the room where Mozart was born. Some interesting stuff about the family.",
          "This exhibition is purely about where Mozart grew up and about his family and their composers. It has very little to do with Mozart himself and more about his father and sister.",
          "As mentioned in a prior review, if you are a lover of Mozart or his music this is a must see! Extremely interesting.",
          "This is a small museum. There are some interesting Mozart artifacts and some information about his childhood. A third or more of the museum is about the history of the Mozart family in general, not very interesting to those who are not really diehard fans of Mozart. You should",
          "If you have visited Mozart's Birthplace and still have time, do pay a visit to this house. There were of course some valuable things worth to see and I do think it is the arrangement of the management to separate Mozart's belongings into 2 museums so that you will have to go to",
          "Impossible to park around, so walk there. It is quite expensive for what you get. Extremely hot inside and there is no safe place to leave clothes. They do not let you make pictures inside. It is worth a visit but not very great.",
          "The museum is based in the house that Mozart was born and anyone who is a Mozart fan will thoroughly enjoy the experience. There's plenty to see and read about and not like other museum's, felt relaxed as you moved from room to room. We found the museum a very worthwhile",
          "After seeing Mozart's small and not particularly impressive Gerburtshas the day before, we wanted to see the house in which he showcased his rising fame in childhood. This house is quite impressively large, with room to receive guests and put on shows, quite a few instruments,",
          "It is interesting going in and learning about Mozart. You see the pianos he played and some other memorabilia. It is interesting but I found it kind of overrated.",
          "I loved this place. I was there 2 hours. So much to listen to and read. You can just sit and enjoy his music. Loved this place.",
          "While it has lots of history in the rooms, you feel like everything is forced together to make an experience for the guests. The letters and other items found in the rooms are interesting, but not captivating in any way. Overall it is a rather substandard tour.",
          "While holidaying in Salzburg this is of course one of the places to visit. Mozart lived here as a young man with the family and I believe his very talented father died here. I had never heard or seen his full name written before so it was very interesting to discover that here.",
          "The highlight of the museum is the range of artefacts on display, including musical instruments used by Mozart when he was a child, music compositions, mementos and the portraits of Mozart painted during his lifetime. Salzburg is the birthplace of music maestro Wolfgang Amadeus",
          "We visited this along with Mozart Birthplace, using the Salzburg card. Our girls found this more interesting than the birthplace, as there were slightly more interactive exhibits (height, different clothes with your face etc). The audio guide was good and nice to have music!",
          "It was nice to see the musical instruments owned and played by Mozart. The staff were well informed . The gift shop and cafe were as expected",
          "Although it had quite a few original instruments of Mozarts and gave a lot of information about him and his family it was overall a disappointment. There was not enough to really engage with and not one room displayed even with replica furniture to show how it may have looked",
          "It is was really nice to see the collection of Mozart's instruments and to see them in such good condition. This was our favourite part of the residence. As the building was rebuilt fairly recently it is a nice clean modern building inside with a very museum feel and like",
          "There was only one room that was about Mozart, which contained some instruments he owned, and gave some information/stories. That was it. Expected a lot more about Mozart to be featured... The second room was about his dad, the third about his sister, the fourth about his son,",
          "A nice trip through the house tells you about the life & family of Mozart. It was a great little museum easy to tour and squeeze into our visit.",
          "This house, resided in and dedicated to the life and works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, can be found near the Market Place. It houses interesting memorabilia of the famous composer, and is a must for music lovers.",
          "As I have mentioned in my review of Mozart's Birthplace, if you are not a fan of Mozart, but believe this to be a Salzburg \"must\" just skip it. It will not affect you or mean anything to you. There is plenty to do in Salzburg that will satisfy you and give you unforgettable",
          "This is the perfect place for music lovers and history geeks alike. This residence is much more interesting than the one in Vienna. They have a couple of Mozart\u2019s original instruments, and there\u2019s just a lot more to learn and absorb here. Would definitely recommend.",
          "This is worth the short walk - very informational and inspiring to see where he lived and to learn about his family. There are many artifacts and historical papers to see , and Mozart's music is played throughout. The building itself has undergone a lovely restoration. If you",
          "highly over rated - expected more details of his personal life to be avaialble or more personal items",
          "This is the Mozart residence where he spent much of his formative years. Through the audio guide, you learn about his upbringing, his family and of course, his wonderful music. My favorite room was the music salon, where there are many of the musical instruments he used. It",
          "Mozart\u2019s place was closed so we decided to go to this place. This place is more about his compositions and his instruments. Entrance is free with salzburg card and they give you audio guide using which you can hear his compositions. A good place to go",
          "Mozart Residence includes a free audio guide whereby you can listen to his music while looking through his house to learn about his life/ family/ compositions. pictures weren't allowed to be taken in there.",
          "A place of history as far as music goes and a museum today; the exhibits showcase the life and times of Mozart. Use the audio guide for a better experience. There are several photos, instruments, videos etc. and it makes for a few enjoyable hours.",
          "Mozart's Residence shows many of his musical instruments and there is a video giving highlights of his life and this was very interesting Worth visiting",
          "Free entrance with Salzburg Card. Use the audio guide to \"pick and choose\" what you want to hear about. We found this more interesting/informative than Mozart's birthplace. It was great to see the instruments Mozart used to play on, hear about how he was such an enthusiastic",
          "Stopped here briefly to take pictures and see the residence.mwe did not go inside or go to the gift shop so can not evaluate those things. Great old building with a great history.",
          "I'm a classical musician (violist) and had been looking forward to seeing this. I enjoyed the slide presentation of Mozart's life near the beginning. But overall, it was not that good of a museum. There was no indication that photography is prohibited. I took one picture and",
          "I actually enjoyed my walk around here. Stairs for access. If you follow the audio tour you receive comprehensive explanations about the exhibits with some lovely music. We used the Salzburg Card for entry and it was well worth the visit.",
          "This residence was actually a dance and music school in Salzburg. It is a nice visit if you are a fan and find yourself in Salzburg. But don't come specifically for this. There are only a few instruments and music sheets. The audio guide is interesting but sometimes gives way",
          "Mozart residence is part of the whole area that is covered in the old city of Salzburg. One can pay a quick visit to see the residence...",
          "Along with his birthplace another of Mozart's buildings now turned into a Mozart museum. Worth going to see with many of the artifacts from his time still in situ.",
          "We could not see Mozart birthplace as there was some small ceremony going on there. So we decided to atleast visit Mozart Residence .. Its a nice place overall ... You get a audio guided tour for free if you have Salzburg Pass. There were different kind of musical instruments",
          "The tickets are not cheap.... Even if it is raining it is not worth the price ... Better to have a good coffee and some cakes... Especially if the Sacher Hotel is just a few steps from there ... And of course their authentic Sachertorte is waiting for you ... On the other",
          "At first glance this Mozart residence seemed like a must-see attraction. I had wanted to see the former home of the composer in its home form, with period furniture and layout. Instead, in each room were exhibits of stuff from his life like letters and such, and many of those",
          "I was bored by this attraction (and it cost 11 euros pp). It's not set up as Mozart's residence as I was thinking it was. It is where he lived, but it's set up as a series of 4 rooms with cases of his notes and some of his instruments.",
          "Better than the birthplace: the audio guide was very well done. Interesting exhibits. Worth the hour or so it takes to go through slowly.",
          "Mozart's house has been rebuilt in the 1990's to resemble what it looked like in the 17th Century. It has been restored to its original design.",
          "We enjoyed learning about Mozart's short life, and seeing different instruments that he played during his life. Its worth the hour or two it takes to tour the museum.",
          "Free entrance with the salzburg card. It is awesome to be able to get some insights into the life of a genious. Make sure you have the audio guide. It is not boring or filled with unnecessary details. It helps you understand a little bit more about Mozart. The museum is quite",
          "Free entry with our Salzburg card - recommended. Nicely explained through audio guides and allows a gentle pace even when is busy. Fascination exhibitions and a full insight into the extended Mozart family. The audio guides also include (of course) beautiful background music",
          "This was a very informative museum. Well worth a visit. They offer complimentary audio units in sever languages which made our visit much more satisfactory as we don't speak the local language.",
          "It was not easy to find the place, and the ticket attendant there did not speak English/German and was very rude and did not know how to use the machine to read the bar code from the Salzburg card, took forever. He spoke only Korean. Once inside, the place is so small, and so",
          "I had an absolutely wonderful Schnitzel, beer and apple strudel. Prices are very reasonable and there is a lovely seating area outside where you can enjoy the sun and the beautiful setting.",
          "Three of my friends and I arrived approximately 35 minutes before closing, and when we arrived at the window, we clearly asked if it would be ok to enter and would it be worth it. The lady said yes, but rushed through our purchasing of tickets and then literally slammed the",
          "Guten tag mozart,Wie geht es dir? I met with mozart a unique man, a man with charm, true intelligent and full of music passionate. After have a cup of coffee in the backyard, so i said good bye to him, Auf widersehn. A beautiful home of him indeed.",
          "A privilege to share a house in which Mozart once worked. Plenty to see and think about as well as listen to.",
          "The house where Mozart's family moved to after there was more money in the kitty is half museum, half documentation center about Mozart and his gifted family. Worth spending some time learning the fascinating history of Wolfgang Amadeus and the Mozart family...",
          "This is quite interesting but not a huge amount there for the price and you are not allowed to take photos. There are some interactive items at the end. Lots of stairs inside the place",
          "Went here as it was part of the Salzburg Card. Learned a lot about Mozart and a must for Mozart fans. Very informative.",
          "Some interesting stuff here good audio guide and a good way to spend a few hours looking at the various bits and pieces related to the Mozart family",
          "Pricey but worth it compared to the pricey, un-worth it birthplace. Much to learn about the boy-man. Audio guided. He lived sme 13 years here",
          "The audio guide was pretty good and all the displays had translations in English. However, it seemed like most of the exhibits were dedicated to his father, his sister, and his son. There really wasn't too much about Wolfgang himself. It was pretty awesome seeing his last",
          "Mozart and Doppler: the different sounds of Salzburg Everyone searches for and visits Mozart\u2019s house. Mozart was born and lived in Salzburg. Everyone gets excited by seeing the house where Mozart lived and deservedly so. However, across the road from Mozart's house is the house",
          "I visited the Mozart Wohnhaus, where Mozart born and lived with his family in the Tanzmeisterhaus (dancing master house). It was open from 9.00 AM - 5.00 PM daily, paid ticket + audio guide. It was more than a museum between tradition and modernity, it's the place in Wien where",
          "Centrally located on the Main Street of the main shopping/ tourist attraction in Salzburg. Nice small museum- a little pricey for what it is, but a nice stop nonetheless.",
          "On the other side of the river from the old centre of Salzburg and larger space to visit. Having visited Mozarts birthplace and residence I had the feeling more on display here",
          "Due to the crowds, we were in two minds whether to queue for tickets but we're very pleased we did. The tour is very informative and we certainly felt we got a good idea of the life Mozart led.",
          "The great composer Mozart lived with his family in this house for about 13 years. His father died in it. Then they moved out. The place displays lots of Mozarts belongings. If you are into this you will find this place interesting",
          "Any Mozart fan will enjoy the tour. If you are there when not so busy, letters, music sheets and family items fun to view and read.",
          "This is your chance if you want to learn more about Mozart to see the musical instruments he played, his musical scripts and his family.",
          "A must visit for fans of Mozart, the legendery music composer. Get information about his works, family lineage and an audio visual experiece about his life and compositions. Small place can be covered in 30-45 minute",
          "We visited this museum even though my husband is allergic to museums generally, and both of us found it to be enriching. First, it is where Mozart lived with his family for much of his youth. That makes it more interesting. Also, it is not too much information. You can enjoy",
          "Very slow to get entry, but good audio guide, including extracts of Mozart's music. Lots of artefacts from Mozart and his family. Crowded on the day we went. Not quite as good as Mozart's birth place [but that has no audio guide]. [Get the Salzburg card - 24, 48 or 72 hours",
          "Both the Mozart Birthplace and Mozart Residence provide in-depth perspectives on the life and times of the musical genius. If you only have time for one of the Mozart museums, we would choose Mozarts Geburstshaus. Other reviewers would disagree and choose Mozarts Residence.",
          "since salzburg is the birthplace of mozart , this place was the obvious thing to do and see , its very close to the city square and the mirabelle gardens.",
          "This was a more in-depth look at Mozart's life than the birth house and was very interesting to see. Lots of original scores and letters to view. Mozart's beloved instruments are in here as well as some original portraits. There's also a fun interactive photo room at the end",
          "The museum was very much worth the time for the visit. If you can only visit here or his birthplace this is the one. Many of his pianos are here and paintings depicting Mozart and his family. Use the audio guide for a better experience.",
          "Charming town and so historic as Mozart's birthplace. Tour guide did a nice job of explaining. Such a pretty area.",
          "Mozart Wohnhaus is a MUST see mainly when you love his music, his operas and his unique talent. ( I do). I was very satisfied with the whole experience because the museum is well organized and very easy to walk and enjoy. I visited Mozart's Birthplace, apartment first and",
          "Small venue to see, but the exhibits are well done especially in combination with the audioguide. Nice overview of the life of Mozart. Worth a visit especially if you have the Salzburg Card.",
          "Fun to walk thru history. You are provided with an audio guide. The guide is very important to your visit. Interesting to see pianos Mozart played on. Very easy to find, right near lock bridge. Nice restaurant in building.",
          "The Mozart Wohnhaus is located across the Salzach River from the Mozart Birthplace. This is a must all people who like music (real music) and history. Just to say you walked around where Mozart actually lived is indescribable. A self guided tour is available with headphones.",
          "In this place you can see some stuffs that belongs to Mozart (piano, music letter, objects in general). They also play some videos with his music's, trips, history.",
          "The palce is a must visit for Mozart lovers... nothing great but lot of historic value...easy to reach",
          "Honestly I'd pick the birthplace museum over this one. Over priced. Delay on the audio guide so that you're done looking at everything before the audio is half done. Audio doesn't really match up what's in most rooms anyway.",
          "Interesting exibits on Mozart's later life. It is more centered on his professional life, music and instruments than his family -- which is more the focus of his birth-house museum.",
          "Going to this museum is an act of homage to Mozart. Some interesting facts about his life (which you could also get from a book). Some of the rooms seem to have artifacts more to fill space than to bring the composer to life.",
          "As with Mozart's birthplace, there is some interesting information and memorabilia, but it is somewhat spare and definitely overpriced (even when purchasing a package with Mozart's Birthplace). However, if you're in Salzburg, visiting Mozart sites is important.",
          "I enjoyed seeing the instrument exhibit and learning more about his compositions. I also enjoyed the room which focused on his appearance. Very enjoyable.",
          "Although the primary reason to see this is the connection to Mozart, the place is interesting as a look into upper middle class family life in the 1700s Habsburg Empire.",
          "If you are a Mozart fan, do visit otherwise it is a pretty small place which has the instrument he played along with other exhibits. We were done in under an hour!",
          "This is the place where Mozart family lived. Apart from the obvious historical significance, this place houses not only the music instrument played by Mozart but also offers live music performances of some of his pieces. If you are a Mozart fan or just curious about his life,",
          "We visited both the birth house & the residence (Wohnhaus). We liked the residence better, even though it was smaller. It had original pianos and a lot of information on Mozart and his family. It's much smaller than the birth house and doesn't get as much recognition as the",
          "This large house museum had an excellent audioguide and good video presentations as well as a number of exhibits that really explained a lot about Mozart's life. The Birthplace is smaller and not as well presented in our opinion.",
          "So I had reviews beforehand and was expecting a grand 2-3 hour long tour. But it turns out to be about 45 mins. I took someone's suggestion in fast forwarding through the music which helped out. It's worth the trip if you are REALLY in to Mozart to listen to his Symphonies",
          "The residence itself is nothing much and it takes merely an hour to complete the visit. Most of the exhibits are about his father, mother and sister rather than Mozart himself. If you like Mozart and would like to learn a bit more about his background, you will probably enjoy",
          "I'm not a huge fan but appreciate his music so therefore it was worth a look. It's included in the price of the Salzburg card which makes its good value as lots of other places are also included with the price.",
          "I was trying to be subjective and can state this was a stunning setting area and locale. This was though not the original building as this was completely destroyed during World War II, was reconstructed and opened to the public as a second Mozart museum in 1996. They have very",
          "Good place to know about Mozart This house is his residence Free with Salzburg card (with audio guide) Not too big museum but a lot details",
          "i learned so much stuff about Mozart from this museum. the audio tour gives much information about their lives and plays the work from the family. a must visit in Salzburg",
          "It's not bad but it's not great either,probably build up to that and then come out feeling a bit missing something. Yes i learnt but i think it has more potencial. No photos allowed",
          "We visited Mozart Residence museum and found it even better than the Mozart birthplace museum. It is well set up and very informative. Takes a good hour or so and is worth the self guided tour.",
          "Great to visit, but choose a day when there are no huge groups of Japanese tourists which seem to be everywhere.",
          "I visited the Mozart Residence with a Salzburg Card (which means I paid nothing), right after I visited Mozart's Birthplace. And there lies my \u2013 and I believe many, many others' \u2013 mistake: It's Mozart overload; it's just too much! Mozart's Birthplace already contains a wealth",
          "Interactive displays, films, photos and objects. Only takes about one hour to visit. We had the Salzburg Card which is great value and included this visit. Audiophones were great and in lots of different languages.",
          "Even if you're not interested in classical music, you will find this very interesting. The story of his life and his extended family's life is truly fascinating.",
          "We bought dual tickets to visit both the Residence and his birthplace. We found the Residence to be very focussed on his children and other people around him but very little about Mozart himself. The Birthplace was far more interesting and informative.",
          "Very well laid out and made more interesting by the audio machines in every language. It costs 11 euros each per adult.",
          "This was the highlight of our trip but by sheer chance. We went on a Sunday morning, having seen the Mozarts Geburtshaus the day before. We had just entered the main room when a man came in and seated himself at the piano - Mozart's own - and proceeded to play one piano sonata",
          "I have been looking forward to visiting the Mozart sites in Salzburg for years, but found this rather disappointing. I got no sense of how the house (or what is left of it after development and changes over time, wartime bombing and later reconstruction. I was disappointed to",
          "If you are keen on classical music or not, this museum is a fascinating insight into the life of Mozart. It is great how they have managed to keep some of the original house intact.",
          "The good audio tour guides you round this very spacious apartment, where many interesting things can be viewed, ranging from clavichords and organ to violin, and many documents. Mozart's travels round Europe are also well covered.",
          "We did not find this attraction worthwhile. There were not a lot of interesting items or information (if you go to Mozart's Birthplace, they have all the same info, but more to look at). The staff were quite rude, there were no no photo signs, and when I went to take a photo, a",
          "The rebuilt residence is interesting to walk round and has a good audio guide to take you round the museum. It contains several of Mozart's original instruments. If you visit both the birthplace and residence be ready for significant overlap in information. The residence has",
          "museum is included in the salzburg card and has an audio guide included which explains the various exhibits along with some mozart music, Rooms contain a number of mozart related memorablia. Well laid out museum and worth a visit",
          "We visited the Wohnhaus and found it to be a small but interesting museum relating to Mozart and his family. It was best to use the audio guides as one moved from room to room as they provided a comprehensive and informative history , although they were very loud and appeared",
          "Compliment to the Mozart's birth house, you can also get a combined ticket. They are very close one of each other. Better documented than the birth house, because you get an audio guide in any language.",
          "This is worth the visit for more Mozart history. It does not take much of your time and the entry is free with the Salzburg card.",
          "Interesting place to see, is a little overwhelming with information. Alot to take in and audio headset available to take you through everything but still alot to divulge. Amazing to see original instruments - fascinating. Use the Salzburg tourist card for free entry. No fast",
          "If feel it's worth it with the Salzburg card not sure if I had to pay it would be. Super informative and they give you a headset with and it's available in different languages. Right off the 25 bus line.",
          "It is nice that you can walk through this Mozart Residence and Museum listening to a guided history tour and music. The paintings and rooms with history of Mozart and his family were interesting. I went during the Christmas season so there were little other tourists in the",
          "It's an amazing experience to visit a house of one of the most famous musician in the world. Worth a visit!",
          "There was so much reading and writing to do that it felt a bit like looking at a book on the walls. I didn't really feel I got to know Mozart any better at the end of our visit than at the beginning. He's such a 'legend' that you can't really quite imagine him living and",
          "Had a great time in Salzburg. The shops and museums where beautiful. The castle was amazing to walk through. All in all a really great day.",
          "The audioguide is filled with a lot of music which takes up some extra time. I found myself skipping a lot of it but I think for some people it would be really interesting to hear examples of Mozart's work. Most of the collection is books and music scores with a smattering of",
          "For some people this is like a place of pilgrimage as this is the residence of the maestro of western music and people to this day workship him and his work.",
          "This is the residence of mozart.where the house he lived in has been converted to a superb museum of his musical instruments.his life story..take the audio guide..explanations are superb..it takes about 2-3hours to go through the whole display...superb gift shop also...",
          "Rebuilt after the war, not well planned and if you want to know about Mozart you can read about it elsewhere. His birth place was better. If I did not have the Salzburg card I would have sjipped this place.",
          "Total waste of time. No flow to the exhibits and completely boring! Better of going to his birthplace!",
          "Lots of info on mozart, but also about his family too. Interesting to find out what happened to his sons and how mrs mozart continued her life after his death. Some mozart exhibits in the house are breathtakingly gorgeous. Loved seeing the old instruments from mozart seniors",
          "This is full of fascinating period instruments, recordings of music and information on the whole Mozart family. We could easily have spent a whole day here. Ironic that Salzburg has done so well out of Mozart considering that he couldn't wait to get away from the place!",
          "This is a small building - unfortunately damaged and rebuilt after the War - where fashionable young people learned to dance, and where Mozart's family lived when he was older. There is a main dance hall and 4-5 side rooms, and they are all full of interesting things. Mozart's",
          "If you are a music lover, or even if you aren't this is a place you should include in your itinerary. There's a very good audio tour around the museum with small pieces of music included. No photography inside. That's a blessing because it's a small museum and one doesn't want",
          "Get the Salzburg card if you intend to visit these places. It offers you great value of entry tickets.",
          "If you are in Salzburg, is a MUST to see. Great collection about the whole life of Mozart and his family, and of course those time, and history. All about Mozart!! :)",
          "Mozart Wohnhaus is small. The majority of the items displayed are replicas and not authentic. The building was reconstructed after being destroyed during WWII. A tour is included with the Salzburg card, thus if you have the card it's worth a visit. I don't recommend paying",
          "Museum is pretty small. Not sure if I would have liked paying 10 Euro, but it was free with the Salzburg card. Enjoyed the \"Mozart's Birthplace\" museum better.",
          "A nice place to visit. Not very well \"signed\". It has a small courtyoud, and you must climb stairs to get to his living area.",
          "Was here 30+ years ago. So much better now. Tour includes audio set which gives you fascinating history. You will even hear Mozart music during the tour. Self-guided. Allow about 2+ hours for the tour.",
          "Paying a lot to hear the story of Mozart and see normal rooms is to much. You have better choices to spend your time and money in Salzburg",
          "The Guide will explain better when they take you for a walk around the city. Experience the city and history",
          "During our stay in salzburg in Sept 2016, we planned to visit this place, must be noted there is entry ticket of EUR 15/16 for this place alternatively one can purchase salzburg card for free admission. At the entrance while collecting ticket you will be provided with an audio",
          "Love Mozart's music and feel he's been shortchanged by this museum's shortcomings. Interesting instruments, documents and art but the organization (?) and unimaginative display leave much to be desired. The lighting of many exhibits bounces off non-reflective glass, which makes",
          "Very nice place to go to get to know about Mozart. There is a detailed account of his life history. There is a section showing his faces through the years. There are the musical instruments used by him on display..there are many Mozart souvenirs to buy from the gift shop. After",
          "this place is quiet big & every information about parts are available redily, you can plan & enjoy the place in quiet afternoon.",
          "I mean who goes to Salzburg and does not visit Mozarts house. There are several rooms and you can explore them all. Get there early since it does get crowded later in the day.",
          "We could not have returned from Mozart's city without visiting his Residence. Located just across the river from the old town (in Makartplatz) this is at a much quieter place. This is the house where Mozart spent quite a few years of his younger days. The museum mainly hosts",
          "The museum is well situated in the Old Town. It is always crowded. Early visit is recommended. There is an entrance fee of 10 Euros. The rooms are very small. There are several interesting items and documents about mozart. No photography allowed. The staircase leading to each",
          "We actually visited this museum in late May of 2015. This is well worth the visit, as it shows a great deal of what life was like for Mozart as a child, and gives a good history of his life and music.",
          "this is located in nice and convenient area yet not too crowded area. it is easy access by walking and the road is flat and no hills.",
          "Such a wonderful site to explore in Salzburg. It consists of 8 rooms and each room has its own purpose and recorded commentary. The ticket is not overpriced. A must visit",
          "Not dramatic but if you have some extra time to spend go and visit. Its a cool place histiric and well tourism",
          "It is surely historic, and a tick off place. If you are a Mozart fan, a must go. If not, just if you have time over.",
          "Both his birthplace and residence were very interesting. Self guided tour is informative without being long winded as some can be. You don't have to spend many hours there either and you can do both as they are walking distance from each other. The residence is the more",
          "In my trup to Europe I went to three different mozart houses, the one in Vienna included, this is the best one, there is a ton of information everywhere and mozart's first violin. Just Beautifull.",
          "The Mozart Residence is just outside of the Old Town area, but not far away. It's worth the walk there. You take a self-guided audio tour of the residence and it's very informative. It takes a good hour or more depending on your interest. It's worth your time!",
          "If you dont have Salzburg card and you are not like die hard fan of Mozart then just skip this place. Its just a place where Mozart lived and all the other info in available on internet so I think its not worth the money.",
          "This is the house the Mozart family moved to as Papa Mozart became a successful musician and the house that Mozart and his sister Nanerl grew up in. Most of its furnishings are period if not original. Some of Mozart's manuscripts and musical instruments are on view. Not to be",
          "Visited with Salzburg card. Audio guide here was included. Lots to see and read. Worth visiting if you want to learn more or are a big Mozart fan.",
          "This museum is a little different to most we have experienced. They had lots of informative stuff about Mozart himself and his family but they particularly emphasise some of the musical aspects - old instruments, details behind a few of the compositions and lots of pleasing",
          "The museum is small but contains some interesting pueces. Audio guide included in ticket and gives helpful explabations. Nice cafeteria with excellent coffee and breakfast.",
          "One of his residence and the one mostly shown to tourists. Worth a look but you can't go in. Mozart is everywhere in Salzburg and at each stop the guide will tell you something more about the composer. Worth a look and another story...",
          "Who do you most associate with Salzburg? Who does Salzburg festival celebrate the most? Whose picture do you most often see on chocolates all over Austria? Correct. Mozart. So why on earth is one of the main attractions associated with this rightly most celebrated of Austrians",
          "The museum is a wonderful place to escape from today and to get closer to the genius Mozart. Great experience in the beautiful Salzburg.",
          "We are really appreciated this kind of. Audio guid gor kids can more easy understand and listen directly in their own languages. Have chance to understand mozart more about his life and gis family background. That was quite interesting experience for kids.",
          "You wouldn't miss this place when you walk in the city . One of the few places you should visit while in Salzburg. In one day we visited all popular places in the city",
          "The original building was badly damaged during the second world war so this is a replica however it gave a fascinating insight into the life of Mozart.",
          "This museum is included in the Salzburg card so probably wouldn't have done it, as found the Birthplace museum dry and disappointing. If short on time do the residence rather than the birthplace. However, found this museum interesting about the whole Mozart family, with",
          "The place where Mozart was born informative and interesting living History to its fullest.8.50euros admission 6.50Euros for Seniors and Students",
          "There are authentic objects of Mozart here but a lot of stuff are about Mozart\ud83d\ude09's father instead of Mozart himself. Personally, I like Mozart's birth place much better. But a big fan should still go.",
          "If you are a Mozart lover, then obviously Salzburg is the place for you. The Residence is a wonderfully informative place to see and learn about Mozart's life. Free with your Salzburg Pass...which is definitely worth the investment.",
          "Then, how do you expect me to be interested! That is what I felt. Unless you are a great Mozart fan, you cannot be happy in this place. Of course there are some things in display but the whole house appears refurbished. It is not like you feel Mozart in there. But on the whole",
          "This is great for any Mozart fans and you get a real insight into the man and his work. Dispels some myths as well. Take advantage of the ticket that enables access to the Mozart Geburthaus in the old Town as well. If anything, it's even better.",
          "Unless you are a Mozart lover seeing the home of his birthplace is probably enough. There was a lot of the same information and found this attraction quite boring.",
          "This museum contains a lot of great information and a pianoforte that Mozart actually owned and played. For some reason they won't let you photograph it (lame). It would be a gigantic improvement if each room contained period pieces and looked like they did when the family lived",
          "Having a Salzburg card, I visited this house where Mozart lived his teen years. While it was nice, it left me on my appetite. I had a translator, which was nice (packed with information about Salzburg in the 18th century), but the number arrangement for the rooms was",
          "definite worth a visit if you are in salzburg. a good learning experience to life of mozart and that time period",
          "In Salzburg you have 2 things to do. One is to understand the life story of the music genius and the other is to follow Maria von trapp",
          "This is a nice little museum but unless you are very interested in Mozart you will find your mind drifting.......",
          "Interesting place to go to learn more about Mozart. You get an audio guide and there are lots of exhibits and a gift shop.",
          "As I wrote in my review of the Mozart birthplace, the Wohnhaus is the far better venue for Mozart lovers as you get a very comprehensive exhibit of his life, his works and instruments. Not only will you get to understand Wolfgang, but you will get insights into father Leopold,",
          "Mozart the great music composer stayed here. He was a child prodigy. He composed great pieces of classical music",
          "Somehow writing a review about walking and original floorboards that Mozart wrap one, wrote some of today's most beautiful music on, just boggles the mind. It was such a privilege to see his violin and piano he used in his concerts period several letters he wrote to his mother",
          "This site was the home of Mozart, or at least where he was born and resided for some years growing up. It is located at 9 Getreidegasse in the middle of the old town of Salzburg and has now been opened as a museum. An entry fee of 10 Euros applies and you can explore the old",
          "I am fairly ambivalent above Mozart. I like his music but rarely listen to it. That said my wife and I found this tour definitely worth the hour or so it took to complete. Especially if you buy the Salzburg card. Be sure to get the audio handset guide and use it. The tour is",
          "You can see it on the way in your trip. it s a decent place and has historical importance. lots of information about his family and his life..",
          "If you only want to visit one Mozart site, I recommend this one. There is extensive information about not just Mozart, but also his father, his sister, and his son. It's also really cool to see instruments that his family actually owned. The last two rooms have some",
          "You can tour this museum in conjunction with Mozart's birthplace by buying just one ticket. It is easy to walk from one house to the other. There were a lot of interesting portraits and musical instruments once used by Mozart. Lots and lots of information, depending on his",
          "Mozart lived in this house for seventeenth years from 1773 and then again after a three year interruption. After the house in which he had been born became too small the entire Mozart family moved across the river to that edifice, then called \u2018Tanzmeisterhaus\u2019, on the square",
          "Amazing to see Mozart's actual birthplace and where he first played his violin. The way the houses link up by courtyards is clever.",
          "If you've been to the birthplace you should complete your dose of Mozart by visiting the much more commodious dwelling on Makartplatz. The admission includes an audio tour which explains the various instruments and furniture displayed as well as family details. I was struck by",
          "The place to go to see the instruments Mozart owned and used for his compositions. There are also paintings and personal letters on display.",
          "Very well setup with an audio guide quite user friendly You need to spend at least one hour if not more to discover who was Mozart",
          "This house can be seen, because if you didn't it's like you never been in Salzburg! The spirit of Mozart is still there! Feel it!",
          "It's a great experience to see Mozart's actual musical instruments he actually played and composed at. His very first piano is housed here, along with several other pianos. Also his violin. You can do an audio tour which you get to hear some of his music aswell. A must for",
          "What a fabulous insite to how the child Mozart lived and grew up. I recommend going with a guide to get the most out if it but it's well worth the visit",

          "If you have any interest in Mozart, the museum in the house where he grew up has a wonderful collection of artifacts. When you're done, enjoy a glass of wine or lunch in the restaurant next door opposite the entrance. They have a lovely selection list of local wines.",
          "Its a small museum and has some good history about Mozart. This is for some one likes history and wants to know more about Mozart. Not too many articles, but worth a quick visit if you are in the hometown of Mozart!",
          "It's pretty subjective: Some people will find this place great, others boring. If you have an interest in this genre of music you're bound to find this place interesting.",
          "It's just a residence and nothing more. The fact that Mozart died very young and that he has travelled all over Europe, there's really not much to showcase. It was interesting at first, but then it seems like there's nothing left to show, so the museum cramped in what they can",
          "Interesting to see Pianos and various artefacts but not somewhere I needed to stay for too long. People were scrutinising letters and documents on display, we were in and out in 10 minutes.",
          "The audio guide is worth the money and you can get through the small museum very quickly. The informationals are provide interesting facts about the family. I didn't realize there was so much to learn about the family. It is probably not a \"Must See\" but sure was good. If",
          "Interesting small museum. Good to understand how this family of artists lives and to hear the lovely music. Very useful information with the audio guide Worth an one hour visit - free with Salzburg card",
          "There is a lot of information common between the two Mozart houses. This one had mostly music. If you want to see household items and learn more about family history, go to the other one.",
          "The house of Mozart was really cool to see. My sister and I are not music buffs but even we could appreciate that we were in the house of a great. I would definitely recommend for anyone in Salzburg!",
          "To share in the history of a young boy's childhood and family, was an honor really...I'm not a Mozart fan, yet to see the photos of him as a young boy, pushed into performing at all the 'posh' occasions- no wonder the child turned out to be spoiled rotten and eccentric! It's",
          "If you're big into classical music, such as Mozart then definitely take a walk inside this place. It was included on our Salzburg card. We got to see where Mozart lived and the various instruments he had. It was something to see, so we recommend it.",
          "It was a joy to walk around the house and see artefacts and read about Mozarts life. If you are into Mozarts music this is definitely worth a visit.",
          "I call it the second Mozart house. Here lies his art and music collection. The family history paintings. The instruments. The Mozart as a musician.",
          "The world famous composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born there and a lot of more or less original pieces are displayed there.",
          "After having visited Mozart\u00b4s Geburtshaus and seen the small flat where he was born it was interesting to see the place to which the family moved somewhat later. This is a large eight room apartment across the Salzach river (from the old town where the family first lived). The",
          "If you are interested in a collection of 18th century instruments and Mozart's biography, then this is the place for you. Be sure to get the audio guide. It will give you the full story accompanied by some of Mozart's best known music. You can see it in one hour.",
          "Bought the combined ticket for here and the birthplace. Some very interesting artefacts and information, only to find out this wasn't actually Mozart's residence, that was destroyed in the war. You don't actually find that out before you buy the ticket though, it's just a modern",
          "A great museum to learn about Mozart\u00b4s life, the entrance isn\u00b4t cheap but if you use a city museum visit card, like Salzburg Card, it\u00b4s quite cheaper. Inside, you\u00b4ll find a very interesting museum, with Mozart\u00b4s original instruments and many interesting facts about his artistic",
          "It contains original sheet work, musical instruments and other personal items and info from the life of this city's face.",
          "Visiting Saltsburg has alwas been my lifelong dream. I read the Mozart biography like a novel, with the awe and fascination. This story full of suffering, passions and the moments of real triumph, grabbed my attention. Needles to say, the apartment where this genius was born is",
          "Make sure you get the audio guide as it gives a comprehensive overview of Mozart's life. The exhibits are excellent.",
          "Thirst i went into the Mozart shop for some presents and then entered the home where this amazing child Mozart was born,love the yellow fa\u00e7ade of the building,was a tour worth taking,very busy they should allow only a certain amount of humans so to appreciate it more but worth",
          "This was the second house of Mozart where he, after becoming very rich and returned to Salzburg, lived.",
          "The film in the opening room of the museum is the highlight of the experience. Instead of simply gathering instruments in the front room, it would have been interesting to have more of a sense of what the room might have looked like when the family lived there. I ended up",
          "I will be the first to admit that I have much to learn about Mozart's music, but this place really did a great job of portraying his early life and family connections. I had no idea that he came from a family with such great musical influenced (and a father who really pushed",
          "If You like music and You love Mozart, You cannot miss to visit this nice residence. The guided tour is very didactical. Nice also for non experts",
          "We decided on a whim to visit this Museum and it wasn't that bad. Once you finish visiting the house you will know everything you ever needed to know about Mozart. It does have some interesting exhibits and everything is described in several languages, including English, which",
          "Who loves the music, who loves the Mozart, they will feel the atmosphere of the Mozart's house ;-) Mozart's music speaks the language to the soul and heart and it will stay forever in you once you hear it ;-)",
          "So Mozart is everywhere and this house marks his life. I thought there were a lot of little details left out about his life that would have made the experience more interesting. Maybe they could have had a section where you can listen to his works in chronological order to show",
          "A very interesting and informative place to visit. Whether classical music is your forte or not we gained so much information and insight about Mozart and his family. Historically it was fascinating.",
          "The scenes are so vivid and the story so well explained that you will get the feeling you know mozart family. Very sad at the same time",
          "This little museum is well worth the time it takes to walk around its many floors (3-story) to see aspects of Mozart's family's life.",
          "We were pleased that we had Salzburg Cards and didn't pay separately to visit here. Surly cash desk staff, and very little to see of any historic interest. It's an odd assortment of copies of things tenuously related to Mozart, with his piano being practically the only",
          "Walking through his house give a great feeling into Mozart life. You can see pictures of his family, his young life, but in general gives a feeling. For young and old, for music lovers or not, great place to see and/or just walk through the home of one of our great men.",
          "The building looks simple and humble as any other building but this amazing to see all the thing and imagine how Mozart lived here. There are instruments and elaborate details on his life.",
          "We took our teenagers to the Mozart Residence. It was fine, not outstanding. Saw lots of his instruments but they were expecting to see a furnished house and where he lived but it was more listening to an audio guide and seeing letters and some information about Mozart. I",
          "A Simple building worth seeing when compared to his birth place and located dionally opposite to the Mozart'S bridge. You get to know some interesting facts and see some interesting pictures. No Photos allowed inside. There is a tiny little park in front of the house. The entry",
          "My sister and I visited this residence. It was interesting, as many important pieces of Mozart's life were on display. However, I wish there had been more on his life in general. Would recommend the museum. You only need 2 hrs (max) to have a good visit.",
          "We are so lucky to have seen the house that Mozart had lived in. It's such a humble and simple house that had inside its walls a huge prodigy. I loved how some parts of his life are written on the walls of the house. Unfortunately no pictures allowed inside. We were able to see",
          "It was really great to see the building where Mozart lived a lot of his life. The building itself is somewhat peach in color and has an Austrian flag flying at the entrance! Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to go inside to explore.",
          "this should be on the things to do list, when you are in Salzburg. You get audiophones in order to do a self guided tour. Also this building is in one of the most famous streets in Salzburg. Take a stroll around but be Aware on Weekends are lots of People.",
          "Worth seeing the original forte piano and the family portrait in the \u2018Dance-Master's Salon\u2019. Open Daily from 9am to 5:30pm. Entry \u20ac10, Free with Salzburg card",
          "What stands out is that the house shows the full family's history instead of just Mozart's and you get to see his journey from a child to the musician we know him as.",
          "Included a visit here in our weekend trip to Salzburg in October. Although quite small the location is well presented and the museum contains many interesting artefacts, with good and well displayed information.",
          "Visited this place on our salzburg card. The museum is very well made and gives proper insights into mozart's complete history. We just strolled through but there are audio guides available.",
          "The house that Mozart lived in with his family from age 17 to 25. His dad Leopold decided to move the family to this large Tanzmeisterhaus building they rented half of the building complete with 8 spacious rooms now converted into a museum for the Mozart family with a minimal",
          "The residence gives a great family history of Mozart. The displays are well captioned and if interested in music, it is a must.",
          "It is a must when visiting Salzburg, the audio guides are available in almost all languages, all it is well decorated.",
          "Plenty of information and history to soak up in the Mozart Residence. \u20ac10 entry fee per adult. Many exhibits, photos and items that once actually belonged to Mozart himself. Not a huge place, it was his home after all, but worth a visit during your time in Salzburg.",
          "i only appreciate his music now i see his places . just great to know his history.knowing his passion mean a lot to me.",
          "This unique museum provides fascinating details about not only Mozart but his entire family - mother, father, sister, wife, sons. You also get to see lots of Mozart-related artifacts and evolution of his compositions.",
          "After visiting the \"Geburtshaus\" there is littlle to see that is new and as with the \"Geburtshaus\" everything is cordoned off and there is no disabled access. The latter is inexcusable, since the building is actually quite new (half of the original building was destroyed during",
          "Great snap shot of the life of Motzart and some lovely exhibition pieces of his instruments and family letters",
          "We were glad this was included in Salzburg card as the ten euro entry fee for around six rooms seemed expensive .",
          "Fascinating historical details of the Mozart family, his parents, siblings, his wife . Many photos, paintings and letters which were very interesting as described during the audio tour.",
          "I was disappointed. The fee to enter was 10 Euros, and I don't think it was worth it. It consisted of about 5 rooms of pictures and items behind glass. The audio tour gave you the information of each piece of information that was numbered. I guess it was interesting, but I",
          "There are visual AV presentations, displays, musical instruments, paintings, and modern images arranged in a way such that each room/area concentrates on a different part of the Mozart family life. It is interesting to see not just how they lived when they were alive, but how",
          "This was a much better experience than the birthplace, which we visited the day before. There were fewer people and it was much easier to get around. I particularly enjoyed seeing all the instruments on display, as well as the pictures and other exhibits. The rooms were well",
          "We had a combi ticket which was cheaper and meant we had three days to go to both the residence and the birthplace. It is worth seeing them both for a really well rounded picture of life for the Mozarts. It was great so see the family artefacts and impacts of daily life. The",
          "Interesting if you are very knowledgeable about Mozart. But it was over just when we thought it was starting. But it did provide a lot of information about the family and especially his sister.",
          "Well worth visiting. Great insight into Mozart family and several notable instruments on display. Space quite restricted but was a family apartment of course so allowances must be made. I found photograph of Constance particularly interesting.",
          "The most outstanding building in the Markstplatz, this is the residence where Mozart was born. The building houses a museum containing written script of the life story of Mozart from birth to death. Worth a visit to learn about the greatest musician in the world with his first",
          "Nothing great about it , he had plenty of residences all over salzburg ,one was even bombed out and then re constructed. It is all about history but not worth the 10 euro entry fee.",
          "You would have to be a hardcore fan to get something out if this. It's ok. But not really worth the 10 euro. The audio guide is not bad but the house just seems to lack something given that all the city talks about and promotes is Mozart. If you have the salzburg card then pop",
          "It was so interesting walking through the home where Mozart spent his early years and listen to stories on audio that recall his relationship with various members of his family; furthermore, the listener got a sense of how his career progressed over time. There is one",
          "Any Mozart lover will enjoy seeing the house in Vienna. While most of what you see is a replica and the house has been turned into a modern museum, there are still incredible artifacts that belonged to Mozart while he lived there. I especially enjoyed the audio tour which plays",

          "This place was somewhat small but it gave a lot of interesting information about Mozart and his family. I thought it could have been a bit more informative on his life in general but it didn't. It is worth seeing if your interested in Mozart at all. We used our Salzburg card",
          "I recommend this place for a Mozart fan. You will be able to see Mozart's art works, original score sheets, as well of a piece of his hair. Essentially you are surrounded by his music and his life in this residence. If you nor not into classical music, i would not recommend this.",
          "I came here expecting to learn about Mozart's life, and I did a little bit. But the second half of the museum got weird and started talking about the authenticity of drawings and paintings of Mozart, and that was rather uninteresting. I would say if you don't have the Salzburg",
          "Well, to be honest there's not much of interest for an \"average\" visitor. If you're a Mozart fan maybe there's more value. Entrance fee (10 euros) is inflated just on famous composer name. We had Salzburg Card and the entrance was included, so not a complete disaster. If you",

          "We keep hearing Mozart on a daily basis. Ever bothered to know who he was, where he lived and get the feel of the great musician. Visit his house in Salzburg, the famous place where Sound of Music was shot (no doubt). Little did we know that he was a small man with humble",

          "I visited with family in August 2014. Well worth a visit. Good audio guide with lots of interesting things to see. We were not very knowledgeable about Mozart so it was interesting to learn a lot about him and his family. When visiting Salzburg, you should purchase a Salzburg",
          "The tour started with the dancing room which was the best for me. Mozart's piano, violin, organ and portraits were on display. The tour would go on to explain the lives of him and his wife. My children enjoyed this visit very much. We prefer the residence over the birthplace,",

          "Ok, so I have to agree with other reviewers, in terms of price and value. The place is definitely worth a visit, especially if you're into music... but, I think that the price is steep. In any case, MANY tours of the city include the entrance to this place or you could get the",

          "We saw both houses. The birth place isn't really that interesting, but the second house that the family moved to really interested me. There is an excellent audio guide which explains each room and its contents, much of them personal possessions of Leopold the father, as well as",

          "We stayed right down the street from this and did the short visit to it. It was interesting to my wife and I as we know a lot about Mozart. Our teenage kids didn't find it very interesting as their generation doesn't really have an interest in classical music, unfortunately.",
          "This was an excellent museum about Mozart and his family. You can listen to an audio guide or just read the signs. Everything is in German and English. The audio guide is nice because of the music on it. At the end is a hands-on display. The gift shop is nice, too. Must see",
          "This was my third time there and at least they're trying. It's hard to make a museum about a composer, and to be honest there isn't much to look at here, but they're changing the exhibitions a bit everytime I visit (compare with my review on Mozart's birthplace). They also",

          "The museum gives a very good account of the life of Mozart. The \"tour\" comes with a hand-held recorder which gives excellent account of the place (room by room) in the language we are comfortable with. We now have a much better understanding of this famous composer.",
          "There are a few nice things about this museum. There are several period instruments (mostly replicas) to admire and some nice portraits of Mozart, his family, and other important contemporaries. The informative audio guide includes many clips of Mozart's famous pieces, and there",
          "There is really nothing particular to Mozart in this museum, except for a few pieces of musical instrument. They could have called this the Mozart portrait museum as the rest of the exhibits focuses on portraits of him and the authenticity thereof. If you're a die-hard fan you",
          "We visited the Mozart house and were quite disappointed by the overall museum layout and how small it was given the entrance fee. Essentially it was just a series of documents (letters, sheet music, etc) to look at along with some of the instruments that Mozart played,",
          "We really enjoyed learning more about Mozart's life. It was a small museum, but the interactive display was especially good.",

          "It\u2019s very interesting to see how Mozart lived in this house. There\u2019re several old time musical instruments made from wood displayed. They kept several items related to Mozart here. The items are kept in good condition. From this place, I learned that there\u2019re many portraits",
          "We were fairly excited to be seeing the place where Mozart had lived, unfortunately, this museum was a big let down. I would suggest going to the Mozart Gerburtshaus, which is in the middle of the old city, if you really want to learn about Mozart's life. The Wohnhaus museum is",

          "This is an unusual museum, it seems most of the attention is given to the debate over the authenticity of pictures and portraits of the famous man. This must be of importance here in Salzburg, perhaps not-so-much to us outsiders. BUT! The short film at the beginning of the",
          "This tiny museum contained a few musical instruments and the rest were pictures of Mozart, some believed to be actual portraits, others not. They show the composer at various ages but, for the most part, they all look alike. We were in and out of there in ten minutes. Not",
          "This is not the museum to come to if you want an introduction to the life and music of Mozart or if you would like a recreation of the rooms in which he would have lived. The exhibit has already been well described by recent reviewers and, while we found the audio guide",
          "This place is mostly paintings and other images of people that might or might not be Mozart. I got the audio guide, which gave rather long explanations of most of the stuff in this museum. I didn't find it all that interesting. You can pick up a few things about Mozart, but",
          "A good addition to visiting Mozart's birthplace but if you have only time or cash to visit one, then this is the one to leave out. This house is full of Mozart pictures and details of the provenance of each one - many were fakes from the 1800's! Sadly it also illustrates just",

          "Its all about portraits whose almost more than half of them are not for Mozart..at the end you can watch a 10 min clip about his life..but watching the movie Amadeus is more enriching..its waste of money and will not add in any way to your knowledge about Mozart...",
          "I walked out of this place so mad at myself that I wasted \u20ac20 for my husband and I to walk through! It was not at all what I thought it was going to be. I grew up playing the violin and was very excited to tour Mozart's house. I was thinking it was going to have things he grew",

          "It is a pretty interesting place, as well as historic. But there is nothing memorable about it. It would be nice to visit if you are interested in the artist in particular. If not, you can skip this stop, you won't be missing out on much.",
          "Fully historic place",
          "The exhibits are almost exclusively about Leopold Mozart, Wolfgang\u2019s father. If you want Wolfgang, skip this museum and go to Mozart\u2019s Birthplace, it\u2019s another museum on the other side of the river.",
          "A must place to visit. The museum is very interesting and easy on the brain",
          "Expensive, nice",
          "Nothing special, come here only if you have strong interest in the history of Mozart.",
          "Definitely a place to see very interesting",
          "Always a good selection fresh meat products and very good quality service",
          "This was pretty cool. Not a big Mozart fan but checking out his roots was not a bad experience at all. The place does a fine job of educating you on music as a whole. Also the surrounding locations were very enjoyable as well including the small but quaint park across the street with free city Wi-Fi.",
          "No towels available upon arrival, the bed for the kids was not done and very expensive breakfast. Other than that good facilities and well located.",
          "many things to see and it is worthwhile",
          "Even with the Salzburg card, you have to stand in queue to get the audio guide, which took about 30 minutes.",
          "With the exception of the fact he was born and raised there really is very little that's remarkable about it and worth the entrance fee.",
          "Birth place of Mozart and a handy Spar to boot in buitifull Salzburg, what a combination",
          "A must place to visit where Mozart composed most of his famous pieces",
          "It was very informative",
          "More about Leopold Mozart but still interesting. A little pricey for the offerings.",
          "Can see live of Mozart. I prefered this one than other Mozart haus, but recommend to visit all of them. Also enjoyed tea in the cafe downstairs. Great!",
          "It's the house of Leopold Mozart, Father of Wolfgang Mozart. He was also a musician ,famous for the book Violin tutor.",
          "Again can't miss out on this if you are in salzburg a must see for all Mozart lovers.very easy to get too by local tram or bus.",
          "Nice place to understand the story of Mozart",
          "Great place to park your car.",
          "Pretty expensive. Garden is nice to get a drink though",
          "Learned alot about Mozart's father",
          "Wonderful place and well worth a visit. I loved the kitchen!!",
          "Great musician",
          "Amazing \ud83d\ude0d Wonderful time spent here. Easy to find and brilliant electronic guides available in English \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc4d It really made my day. And the guide had not only the story part but also the music \ud83d\ude0d It made this whole process a lot more magical ;) thank you a lot for this \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Peaceful corner to listen to some classics.",
          "Quite underwhelming compared to Mozart's birthplace. We were in and out of here in less than 10 minutes. Don't waste your time here.",
          "It is an big and cossy house",
          "Must see impressed",
          "Very ineffective system for entrance. Exhibition ok but not worth the price or time in line.",
          "Very instractive and interesting",
          "There is a shop inside the building, selling a lot of things about Mozart. And in front of the building there is a beautiful sakura garden. And near there, there is a beautiful catholic chuch.",
          "Informative and modern - provides a lot of insight into Amadeus and Leopold Mozart.",
          "I have no idea how it is from inside.  But it is Mozart come on.",
          "Included in the Salzburg Card. The exhibit displays some of Mozart's instruments, some letters, music scores and an outline of Mozart, his sister and his family's life (parents and descendants). The audio guides include some of his music \u2026",
          "The whole area is a market. And every attraction is marketed.",
          "A true pilgrimage! Must visit for music lovers!",
          "Beautiful \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Loved exploring all things Mozart in this city. This was a self guided tour and there was a QR coffee you can scan to get the audio tour on your phone so you done need to use the communal audio devices... I learned wow a bit about Mozart \u2026",
          "Wasn't worth going in.",
          "Learned so much and enjoyed the maestro once again.",
          "The music room is interesting but goes down quickly after that. Nice to see some of his instruments and writings. It not a must see unless you are a big Mozart enthusiasts",
          "If in Salzburg then I'd recommend visiting this famous composers residence. Contains lots of interesting exhibits and video presentations.",
          "It was very informative all about Leopold Mozart",
          "Well organized with some instruments and interesting books. The multimedia was very interesting as well.",
          "So interesting",
          "The combination ticket with audio guiance included is a very good way to assist tourist for the stories of Morzart family!",
          "A bit disappointing, honestly. It's too expensive for what they offer. They don't tell practically anything of Mozart's life. Pictures are also forbidden. It takes you just 30 minutes to see everything. 11\u20ac is way too much. I give 3 stars because you can see a lot of original instruments and documents",
          "I have seen the kids so much fun because there are so many Mozart things left. I also heard a guide with the app. It is not too bad to stop for a while.",
          "A pastel building of Mozart's residence.",
          "Family place. Most about Leopold Mozart. The father of Wolfgang Amadeus.",
          "Boring and completely nothing I was expecting. 11\u20ac for looking at sheets of notes is definitely too much. You\u2019d better go to Geburtstag Haus",
          "The most overpriced museum I've ever been to. 11 euro for a couple of bleak rooms with a few documents. No authentic atmosphere, nothing really about Amadeus Mozart. The museum may be significant from a history perspective, but the price is laughable, and, frankly, insulting.",
          "Leopold was so important for the development of Mozart.",
          "If you are interested classic music, it's very nice place. You can see instruments, letters and books Mozart used. Also you can see the house they lived and learn about relatively less famous stories when he was young in Salzbrug.",
          "Go to the birth house. It's better, but if you want to see this place, get the combo tickets, much cheaper",
          "Super easy to find and use the Salzburg Card for free entry including audio guide. Amazing to see his actual violin inches away, as well as other artifacts. It provided a nice insight into his family life and I really enjoyed finding out \u2026",
          "This is not as much about Wolfgang as it is about Leopold. The information is limited but that which they have is a treasure. The gift shop is a complete scam, Mozart\u2019s face on everything, Mozart Balls, you get the idea.",
          "Great place to see Salzburg's landscapes.",
          "As a history enthusiast, I have been here. It is all about Mozart senior. Very repetitive narrative in the museum and quite expensive for the display items there. You can skip this and will not miss a lot.",
          "It was a wonderful experience and very valuable, except that we got a fine for parking in front of the museum.",
          "The shop is not bad.",
          "Exellent",
          "Adds to the many insights into Mozart's life in Salzburg. Well worth the visit to further understand one of the world's favourite composers.",
          "Not too much to see in the museum, but if you in Salzburg and know a little bit about Mozart's life and history it is a good place to visit. Music is great  as its all Mozart's music. 11\u20ac is expensive  for such a small place, but with the card it's free.",
          "There is much to see",
          "Nice and informative museum of music maestro",
          "Very cool, but we were not allowed to take photos....",
          "Lovely place for Mozart fans.",
          "Very nice area to walk through.",
          "Did not show anything about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, just his father Leopold",
          "Historical and interesting",
          "Top\ud83d\udc4d",
          "A must visit if you like classic music and Mozart. Historic and educational site. Lots to see and learn. Nice tour. Very attractive place to make photo's. We had a lot of fun. You have to climb some stairs.",
          "Unfortunately closed.",
          "You should visit if you are the musician or hobbies in classic music.",
          "Not so many things to see but ok",
          "When one walks through the main ballroom, one can perfectly picture the young concertmaster Mozart writing his Salzburg serenades for the archbishop, fantasizing about widening his range in Paris. Since I am a fan of Mozart's young adult \u2026",
          "It's one floor, 4ish rooms. There is an audio guide available in MANY languages which is to be commended. However, the commentary on the audio guide was uninspired and excruciatingly dull. There was a lot of jumping around in chronology \u2026",
          "Bad attitude performed by those trash workers",
          "At the end of the day, it's WA Mozart's house.. C'mon man!",
          "Was expecting more from wolfang moxart",
          "we are not musician, therefore it just a little things to see, not things much.",
          "Kool place for history but you will go through it fast",
          "Rather disappointing, with more about Mozart's family than the man himself. It was good to see his piano but the rest was pretty dry.",
          "You can feel the genius",
          "It\u2019s better than Mozarts Geburtshaus.",
          "Nice visit 8f you got the salzburg pass.",
          "No good\nIt built for tourists only",
          "It was wonderful to visit an early \"musical genius's home\"... What an honor! :)",
          "two museums perfect for music lovers",
          "It was pretty amazing to see the original instruments, music notes and letters of Mozart. It was interesting to see how tall he was. Everybody is given an audio guide, so it was very quiet, which was nice. No place for kids.  I think they \u2026",
          "Are you fan of Mozart? Go there!!!",
          "Very interesting place if you like the genius, Mozart.",
          "The line for the tickets was horrendous, very crowded.",
          "It is very small.",
          "Learn much about Mozart...",
          "A bit pricey, but worth visiting only if you like classic music, especially Mozart. I was a bit annoyed they didn't accept my student card because I'm over 25",
          "Not quite as interesting as his birth place in my opinion. But still a cool place to visit if you are versed in the classics",
          "Neat museum! Definitely worth the look!",
          "great place to know more about the master",
          "Educational",
          "Very cool! Salzburg is a beautiful place with many sites worth seeing.",
          "I think this is better than the birth place",
          "I wish there was more to it then just listening to a narrator speaking about some objects",
          "Really interesting place to visit. Audio guide a must and be prepared to spend 1,5 hours in the whole house.",
          "Interesting life and work of Mozart. Insightful  stories around the environment which he grew up in, experiences, achievements and death",
          "Really enjoyed this visit. Can be taken in in under an hour so definitely should be on the to do list when in Salzburg. The audio guide is interesting and learnt a lot about the Mozart family, in particular Leopold and Anna as well as \u2026",
          "Just walked past it, that's all.",
          "Very good information about Mozart and his family members. I liked the artifacts from their lives and the explanations to go with them. Lots of information about such a special group. I was surprised to find that there are no living relatives from the family today.",
          "Nice \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "Too long. First room is the interesting one. Maybe going to Mozart Birthplace is better and enough of you don't have enough time to do both.",
          "I could see how Mozart lived and the relationship with his family. It was also interesting to see the instruments he really used.",
          "Nice to see.",
          "Overrated, but still a piece of history.",
          "Very good exibition",
          "It was good, but nothing extra ordinary that would make this museum really great.",
          "It is such a great museum, i spent 2 hours here, there are so many valuable documents about Mozart, if you love music, this is the must visit place for you.",
          "I\u2019ve played piano for 15+ years and was excited to see the museum, but was sad that most of the information was more about family and friends, rather than Mozart himself. Very disappointing.\n\nI took pictures of the only interesting part about Mozart - pianos and organs that he played on.",
          "Historical residence of the Great Mozart had people from different parts of the world come visiting. I had a really good time relating to his musical adventures and the artifacts used by him many many years ago.",
          "I do not enjoy the experience. The place is cramped as there're too many tourist. The ventilation is bad in some of the room, it gets very hot and humid.\nThe audio tour was also too jumbled and boring :(\nSome of the visitor also not very \u2026",
          "Can be made more immersive with little music being played over the entire place",
          "Amazing to see original pieces and instruments. Learning how this brilliant musical mind was raised and the early life.",
          "It's only worth visiting if you are a die hard Mozart fan. For lay-man in european classical music, nothing exclusive.",
          "An OK museum. The staff is friendly, but the museum requires some more interactive features.",
          "Read a bit about this before entering",
          "One of the most important places to visit in Salzburg if you are a Mozart fan. (The other being the Mozart Geburtshaus not too far from here)",
          "Mozart fans will eat it up, music fans will enjoy it, and others will spend 20 minutes.",
          "Fascinating collection, but should probably update its photo policy.",
          "Pretty small. But you can see the original draft from the prodigy",
          "Nice place to know a bit more about mozart...",
          "There is not much to see there.",
          "It is okay, but Mozart's birth-house is much better to visit.",
          "Almost talking about his father.",
          "Really nice to get to know about Mozart's life, family and music.",
          "Must see",
          "It's a must see if you're in Salzburg. The museum contains a lot of authentic musical instruments and documents from Mozart, his family and era.",
          "Overpriced tourist trap.",
          "Nice place",
          "Amazing",
          "It was very interesting. I\u00b4m not a fan of this type museums but this was great :) I enjoyed spend my thime there.",
          "Sometimes too many people",
          "Wonderful place to visit for any Mozart-lovers. Sadly cannot take pictures with cameras!",
          "Nice place. 9\u20ac but it worth it. Not too big. You better have your smartphone charged cause it's an audiobook guide app !",
          "Great house, provides great insight into a genius and you get to listen to many of his greatest compositions..",
          "Very good museum detailing Mozart's life and work.",
          "Interesting visit, you get to see some of his original belongings. Unfortunately the place packed with groups of indelicate tourists.",
          "Very well preserved and nicely located across from the Theater. Especially the audio guide was a welcome feature as I would sit and enjoy the exhibits while listening to the guide.\n\nWell worth a visit",
          "Interesting place to know more about Mozart's life!",
          "I very much preferred Mozart's Birthplace over Mozart's Residences. I thought Mozart's Residences (this) was more interested in collecting all things Mozart rather than educating the audience about his life. \nJust my personal preference.",
          "Good museum of Mozarts home with history of his life. A must visit for Salzburg",
          "Well organized small museum, definitely more worthy than Geburtshaus. Interactive presentation of Mozart's life. The lady at the ticket desk could be more polite.",
          "Gratefull",
          "You should have seen Mozart Wohnhaus on the TV before but you should visit this place personally at least once.",
          "Creative  genius before his time cool house.",
          "One room of great Mozart treasures, and several more rooms of filler. Worth it if you are a Mozart fanatic.",
          "Nice little museum .. covers some of the historical facts of Mozart... App can be installed inside the Wohnhaus and can be used as an audio guide... Liked that idea ! ",
          "Historical place",
          "Great for history and learning more about family. It should also fall into a place covered for 1 free entry if you have a Salzburg Card.",
          "A great audioguided tour that shows many of the instruments Mozart himself used during his lifetime. Also this museum is included in the Salzburg city card so is free to anyone who has it. Otherwise it's not a very expensive visit.",
          "Interesting place to visit and see the original instruments Mozart played. I highly recommend visiting if you have the Salzburg card.",
          "It's an amazing place to know more about Mozart! Especially his physical appearance \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06",
          "Informative. If you're looking for authentic furniture etc, this is not for you.",
          "There are nothing too special about this place. They only display instruments from Mozart time if you are interested and Mozart music pieces. If you have Salzburg card and time you can enter it for free but I would not pay to enter this place. ",
          "Once you're in Salzburg, Mozart is everywhere! :-) it's nice to walk back in the place and time of Mozart, listening to the audio guide, knowing more about his life and family",
          "If you're interested in the man a must visit, tells all about the man and his music.",
          "If you like music \ud83c\udfbc you have to visit it",
          "Because you can visit this place. And you can drink coffee in the nice caf\u00e9.",
          "Interesting place to learn about Mozart, his father, sister, son, wife, and his wife's second husband who started a society dedicated to teaching and preserving Mozart's work. We preferred Mozart's birth place museum (also in Salzburg) because it gave us a more intimate view of Mozart's life and belongings.",
          "The emphasis of the exhibits here is much more on his music and there\u2019s an excellent collection of instruments. The museum also looks at how his image has been used in popular culture since his death. The audioguide adds a lot of value to \u2026",
          "Awsome",
          "Great place to visit.",
          "interesting",
          "It is a good museum if you are interested in Mozart and his family",
          "Lots of information about Mozart's compositions and history. Highly recommended. The music library is wonderful for music lovers and professional! Had great time here and learned a lot more when taking my time here. ",
          "If you only have time for one of the Salzburg Mozart museums, I'd definitely go here over Mozart's birthplace. There are more interesting artifacts and a good audio guide. ",
          "Interesting performance, with opera singing, dancing, and comedy, it was a truly fun experience.",
          "If you like Mozart, or are interested in early music, then this is for you.  If not then it's a generic museum with a very overpriced gift shop attached.",
          "Price is very steep  for what is being offered and exhibits are important but few. Skip unless you have salzburg card and extra time",
          "good to see the instruments really Mozart played. good audio guide. i can listen to explanation with his music.",
          "Amazingly detailed displays of instruments, music, and life in the Mozart family.",
          "Awful rude reception by a rude, unhelpful, uninterested, Angelica who wanted to know which country I belong to at the ticket counter degrades the entire experience. The body language and rolling of eyes would be unacceptable anywhere.",
          "The tour of the house includes an audio guide. Tourists walk through the second floor where the Mozart family resided since he was 8. The museum is included in the Salzburg city card. ",
          "I liked the tour inside Mozart's house. A bit touristy but all good.",
          "Amazing",
          "Not worth the price. More info on his father and sister then Mozart himself, except the gap-filling history of the genius' advertising images... takes 20 min to visit all ..",
          "A true piece and place of musical history \ud83d\ude00. To imagine that one of the greatest musical legends once walked the same rooms. Sit down for a few moments and let the history seep in. ",
          "A good view to the musicians life",
          "Very few exhibitss",
          "Very well organised. Can be done very quickly with all relevant details",
          "Excellent place, informative on Mozart's life",
          "Very interesting.",
          "Interesting museum, mostly if you know  about music enough to enjoy the various operas hereby played",
          "Interesting!!",
          "Interesting musical tour. It is must visit if u loves music a lot.",
          "Nice way to spend an hour. Make sure to grab the audio tour.",
          "Good place",
          "How amazing to stand in the room where the maestro was born!!!",
          "Although I preferred the birthplace museum more, this is still worth a walkthrough. A bit overpriced for what it is",
          "Lovely courtyard with a small beer garden.",
          "Going back in time visiting Mozart's house. It have authentic furniture, pianos, organs, books and all the daily things Mozart has touched.",
          "Very intetactive",
          "Really good and entertainment",
          "This museum is not worth the ticket price. There is not much to see. For all the information provided there, one can get them on the Internet.",
          "Mozart house. Worth to see",
          "A bit of a money making scheme - very expensive for what it is",
          "interesting museum, free visit having Salzburg card, russian audio guide, many interesting information available",
          "We realized how genious he was!~^^ I love W.A.Mozart~\u2665\u2665\u2665",
          "Great",
          "Interesting, but uninspired. Not worth the admission price.",
          "Probably very interesting for Mozart lovers but otherwise too expensive for what you get",
          "The Wohnhaus has more artefacts on Mozart's family than his own life... but I like the Getburtshaus where more displays and descriptions on Mozart's  path",
          "The museum is a little smaller than I thought, and it's about the whole Mozart family. But it had amazing artifacts and good voice guidance. ",
          "Great place to understand life of Mozart. They provide audio guides. Very informative. No pictures allowed inside.\nPlan to spend atleast 2hrs. If you plan to listen to entire audioguide collection and life story and travels of Mozart, it might become a bit tiring. And if u do that, you can skip Mozart Geburthaus.",
          "Go if you have time",
          "Got to go if you are a classical lover. The place itself is not that special but they commentaries on some exhibits are nicely done. ",
          "Crowded, much to read but little to see and the information that is displayed is not very interesting.",
          "Pictures and camera not allowed in this place..\nIf i'm paying , i need to document my visit as long as it's not free...\nI like mozart and beethoven we consider them unique Musicians.\nThe way of showing the history of mozart was not \u2026",
          "Super boring place. Not advisable to go there.",
          "Cool looking place, sadly i didn't get to see Mozart.",
          "Good if one has interests.",
          "Renovated house of Mozart. Some paid music events take place regularly.",
          "Cool",
          "I guess if you are not real big fan of Mozart then it is a house for you. The entrance fee is relatively expensive compare to museums through out Europe.",
          "Had coffee and a pint in the restaurant. Not bad",
          "A must visit place for Western classical Music lovers",
          "Mostly dedicated to the history of the images of Mozart. Other than that you get very little new information,  and the way it is presented is very not exciting. ",
          "The magnolia was blooming.",
          "Perhaps if you are a Mozart lover or have the Salzburg card visit. Otherwise just do the Geburtshaus (birthplace). Is small and really short for the \u20ac10 and focuses as much on his son as it does on daddy Mozart",
          "Not too much to see here.",
          "We enjoyed the Mozart plays and interesting musical instruments belonged to him",
          "Kind of pricey for a simple tour. Does include English (and other language) options for audio tour.",
          "Ok",
          "Has done of his belongings, but I enjoyed the cafe downstairs more.",
          "I was disappointed especially after visiting Mozart other museum (hi birth place) on the other side of the river, that one is worth a visit.",

        "wiki": "Salzburg (Austrian: [\u02c8saltsb\u028a\u0281k]; German: [\u02c8zaltsb\u028a\u0281k] (listen);  literally \"Salt Fortress\"; Bavarian: Soizburg) is the capital city of the State of Salzburg and with 155,031 inhabitants, it is the fourth-largest city in Austria.\nThe town is located on the site of the former Roman settlement of Iuvavum. Salzburg was founded as an episcopal see in 696 and became a seat of the archbishop in 798. Its main sources of income were salt extraction and trade and, at times, gold mining. The fortress of Hohensalzburg, one of the largest medieval fortresses in Europe, dates from the 11th century. In the 17th century, Salzburg became a centre of the Counter-Reformation, where monasteries and numerous Baroque churches were built.\nSalzburg's historic centre (German: Altstadt) is thus renowned for its Baroque architecture and is one of the best-preserved city centres north of the Alps, with 27 churches. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The city has three universities and a large population of students. Tourists also visit Salzburg to tour the historic centre and the scenic Alpine surroundings. Salzburg was the birthplace of the 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Because of its history, culture, and attractions, Salzburg has been labeled Austria's \"most inspiring city.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity to the High Middle Ages ===\nTraces of human settlements have been found in the area, dating to the Neolithic Age. The first settlements in Salzburg continuous with the present were apparently by the Celts around the 5th century BC.\nAround 15 BC the Roman Empire merged the settlements into one city. At this time, the city was called \"Juvavum\" and was awarded the status of a Roman municipium in 45 AD. Juvavum developed into an important town of the Roman province of Noricum. After the Norican frontier's collapse, Juvavum declined so sharply that by the late 7th century it nearly became a ruin.The Life of Saint Rupert credits the 8th-century saint with the city's rebirth. When Theodo of Bavaria asked Rupert to become bishop c. 700, Rupert reconnoitered the river for the site of his basilica. Rupert chose Juvavum, ordained priests, and annexed the manor of Piding. Rupert named the city \"Salzburg\". He travelled to evangelise among pagans.\nThe name Salzburg means \"Salt Castle\" (Latin: Salis Burgium). The name derives from the barges carrying salt on the River Salzach, which were subject to a toll in the 8th century as was customary for many communities and cities on European rivers. Hohensalzburg Fortress, the city's fortress, was built in 1077 by Archbishop Gebhard, who made it his residence. It was greatly expanded during the following centuries.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\nIndependence from Bavaria was secured in the late 14th century. Salzburg was the seat of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, a prince-bishopric of the Holy Roman Empire. As the Reformation movement gained steam, riots broke out among peasants in the areas in and around Salzburg. The city was occupied during the German Peasants' War, and the Archbishop had to flee to the safety of the fortress. It was besieged for three months in 1525.\nEventually, tensions were quelled, and the city's independence led to an increase in wealth and prosperity, culminating in the late 16th to 18th centuries under the Prince Archbishops Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau, Markus Sittikus, and Paris Lodron. It was in the 17th century that Italian architects (and Austrians who had studied the Baroque style) rebuilt the city centre as it is today along with many palaces.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\n\n==== Religious conflict ====\n\nOn 31 October 1731, the 214th anniversary of the 95 Theses, Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian signed an Edict of Expulsion, the Emigrationspatent, directing all Protestant citizens to recant their non-Catholic beliefs. 21,475 citizens refused to recant their beliefs and were expelled from Salzburg. Most of them accepted an offer by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, travelling the length and breadth of Germany to their new homes in East Prussia. The rest settled in other Protestant states in Europe and the British colonies in America.\n\n\n==== Illuminism ====\nIn 1772\u20131803, under archbishop Hieronymus Graf von Colloredo, Salzburg was a centre of late Illuminism. Colloredo is known for being one of the main employers of Mozart. He often had several arguments with Mozart he dismissed him by  saying, \u201cSoll er doch gehen, ich brauche ihn night!\u201d (He should just go then; I don\u2019t need him!)  Mozart would leave Salzburg for Vienna in 1781 with his family including his father Leopold staying back as he and Colloredo had a close relationship.\n\n\n=== Electorate of Salzburg ===\nIn 1803, the archbishopric was secularised by Emperor Napoleon; he transferred the territory to Ferdinando III of Tuscany, former Grand Duke of Tuscany, as the Electorate of Salzburg.\n\n\n=== Austrian annexation of Salzburg ===\nIn 1805, Salzburg was annexed to the Austrian Empire, along with the Berchtesgaden Provostry.\n\n\n=== Salzburg under Bavarian rule ===\nIn 1809, the territory of Salzburg was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria after Austria's defeat at Wagram.\n\n\n=== Division of Salzburg and annexation by Austria and Bavaria ===\nAfter the Congress of Vienna with the Treaty of Munich (1816), Salzburg was definitively returned to Austria, but without Rupertigau and Berchtesgaden, which remained with Bavaria. Salzburg was integrated into the Province of Salzach and Salzburgerland was ruled from Linz.In 1850, Salzburg's status was restored as the capital of the Duchy of Salzburg, a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The city became part of Austria-Hungary in 1866 as the capital of a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The nostalgia of the Romantic Era led to increased tourism. In 1892, a funicular was installed to facilitate tourism to Hohensalzburg Fortress\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n\n==== First Republic ====\nFollowing World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Salzburg, as the capital of one of the Austro-Hungarian territories, became part of the new German Austria. In 1918, it represented the residual German-speaking territories of the Austrian heartlands. This was replaced by the First Austrian Republic in 1919, after the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919).\n\n\n==== Annexation by the Third Reich ====\n\nThe Anschluss (the occupation and annexation of Austria, including Salzburg, into the Third Reich) took place on 12 March 1938, one day before a scheduled referendum on Austria's independence. German troops moved into the city. Political opponents, Jewish citizens and other minorities were subsequently arrested and deported to concentration camps. The synagogue was destroyed. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union, several POW camps for prisoners from the Soviet Union and other enemy nations were organized in the city.\nDuring the Nazi occupation, a Romani camp was built in Salzburg-Maxglan. It was an Arbeitserziehungslager (work 'education' camp), which provided slave labour to local industry. It also operated as a Zwischenlager (transit camp), holding Roma before their deportation to German camps or ghettos in German-occupied territories in eastern Europe.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nAllied bombing destroyed 7,600 houses and killed 550 inhabitants. Fifteen air strikes destroyed 46 percent of the city's buildings, especially those around Salzburg railway station. Although the town's bridges and the dome of the cathedral were destroyed, much of its Baroque architecture remained intact. As a result, Salzburg is one of the few remaining examples of a town of its style. American troops entered the city on 5 May 1945 and it became the centre of the American-occupied area in Austria.  Several displaced persons camps were established in Salzburg\u2014among them Riedenburg, Camp Herzl (Franz-Josefs-Kaserne), Camp M\u00fclln, Bet Bialik, Bet Trumpeldor, and New Palestine.\n\n\n==== Present day ====\nAfter World War II, Salzburg became the capital city of the Federal State of Salzburg (Land Salzburg). On 27 January 2006, the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all 35 churches of Salzburg rang their bells after 8:00 p.m. (local time) to celebrate the occasion. Major celebrations took place throughout the year.\nAs of 2017 Salzburg had a GDP per capita of \u20ac46,100, which was greater than the average for Austria and for most European countries.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSalzburg is on the banks of the River Salzach, at the northern boundary of the Alps. The mountains to Salzburg's south contrast with the rolling plains to the north. The closest alpine peak, the 1,972\u2011metre-high Untersberg, is less than 16 kilometres (10 miles) from the city centre. The Altstadt, or \"old town\", is dominated by its baroque towers and churches and the massive Hohensalzburg Fortress. This area is flanked by two smaller hills, the M\u00f6nchsberg and Kapuzinerberg, which offer green relief within the city.  Salzburg is approximately 150 km (93 mi) east of Munich, 281 km (175 mi) northwest of Ljubljana, Slovenia, and 300 km (186 mi) west of Vienna. Salzburg has about the same latitude of Seattle.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSalzburg is part of the temperate zone. The K\u00f6ppen climate classification specifies the climate as a humid continental climate (Dfb), however, with the \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm for the coldest month, Salzburg can be classified as having four-season oceanic climate with significant temperature differences between seasons. Due to the location at the northern rim of the Alps, the amount of precipitation is comparatively high, mainly in the summer months. The specific drizzle is called Schn\u00fcrlregen in the local dialect. In winter and spring, pronounced foehn winds regularly occur.\n\n\n== Population ==\nIn 2018, 31% of the total population is foreign born according to Statistik Austria.\nSalzburg's official population significantly increased in 1935 when the city absorbed adjacent municipalities. After World War II, numerous refugees found a new home in the city. New residential space was constructed for American soldiers of the postwar occupation, and could be used for refugees when they left. Around 1950, Salzburg passed the mark of 100,000 citizens, and in 2016, it reached the mark of 150,000 citizens.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Romanesque and Gothic ===\nThe Romanesque and Gothic churches, the monasteries and the early carcass houses dominated the medieval city for a long time. The Cathedral of Archbishop Conrad of Wittelsbach was the largest basilica north of the Alps. The choir of the Franciscan Church, construction was begun by Hans von Burghausen and completed by Stephan Krumenauer, is one of the most prestigious religious gothic constructions of southern Germany. At the end of the Gothic era the Collegiate church \"Nonnberg\", Margaret Chapel in St. Peter's Cemetery, the St. George's Chapel and the stately halls of the \"Hoher Stock\" in Hohensalzburg Fortress were constructed.\n\n\n=== Renaissance and baroque ===\nInspired by Vincenzo Scamozzi, Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau began to transform the medieval town to the architectural ideals of the late Renaissance. Plans for a massive cathedral by Scamozzi failed to materialize upon the fall of the archbishop. A second cathedral planned by Santino Solari rose as the first early Baroque church in Salzburg. It served as an example for many other churches in Southern Germany and Austria. Markus Sittikus and Paris von Lodron continued to rebuild the city with major projects such as Hellbrunn Palace, the prince archbishop's residence, the university buildings, fortifications, and many other buildings. Giovanni Antonio Daria managed by order of Prince Archbishop Guido von Thun the construction of the residential well. Giovanni Gaspare Zuccalli, by order of the same archbishop, created the Erhard and the Kajetan church in the south of the town. The city's redesign was completed with buildings designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, donated by Prince Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun.\nAfter the era of Ernst von Thun, the city's expansion came to a halt, which is the reason why there are no churches built in the Rococo style. Sigismund von Schrattenbach continued with the construction of \"Sigmundstor\" and the statue of holy Maria on the cathedral square. With the fall and division of the former \"F\u00fcrsterzbistum Salzburg\" (Archbishopric) to Upper Austria, Bavaria (Rupertigau) and Tyrol (Zillertal Matrei) began a long period of urban stagnancy. This era didn't end before the period of promoterism (Gr\u00fcnderzeit) brought new life into urban development. The builder dynasty Jakob Ceconi and Carl Freiherr von Schwarz filled major positions in shaping the city in this era.\n\n\n=== Classical modernism and post-war modernism ===\nBuildings of classical modernism and in particular the post-war modernism are frequently encountered in Salzburg.

          "Walk around the beautiful Mirabell gardens and if you are a fan of The Sound of music film you will see where parts of the movie were filmed in the gardens around the fountain and the steps. The Mirabell Palace is now a government building but still wot a visit and great photo",

          "This was an interesting visit. Not really my favorite of Salzburg. I was hoping to hear music abound. No. Construction was in abundance. I understand it was off season but it was torn up. The gardens were gorgeous and lucky with warm fall weather.",
          "Of course it would be best in springtime when everything is a bloom, but I have been there at three different times of the year and never disappointed. Whenever you go, take your time to enjoy all the details of this gem and don't judge it by its size. I especially like hanging",
          "As well as the garden and orangery there are the rooms of the Palace to view. Excellent Mozart concerts here too, even in winter",
          "The gardens are obviously not at their best in winter. The Sound of Music scenes from various portions of the Gardens make them very interesting. Beautiful statues including two unicorns at the one gate's entrance. The Castle was closed when I visited but it may have been",
          "I REALLY wanted to visit as many \"Sound of Music\" locations as humanly possible during our trip. My husband was a good sport about it - having never seen the movie, he had no clue why the places and statues we were roaming the city to find mattered at all...but he's kind of used",
          "Whether or not you are a big \"Sound of Music\" fan, this place is beautiful and worth the visit. It's an added bonus, however if you love the movie. The best time to go is when the flowers are in bloom. We went in August and the gardens were filled with flowers everywhere. The",

          "We managed to see the concert hall in gold which was an amazing venue. However again the full gardens were closed and fountains off due to weather. The Mirabell was disappointing in the building now is more of an office complex than palace. There was nobody around to give info",
          "Probably not the best place to see during winter because most of it is closed of for winter. However you do get to see the filming locations were the Sound of Music was filmed Great experience",
          "It\u2019s worth a visit however, we visited during December (winter season) so were not allowed to enter in some parts of the garden. They close it every winter season to preserve it. You can still walk through the sides though.",
          "Visited Salzburg for NYE so experienced everything including the gardens in winter time when maybe not so colourful. Like everyone else searching out the scenes from Sound of Music. Look out for a crowd and there\u2019s sure to be a picture opportunity. Would be more colourful spring",
          "Mirabell Gardens were lovely, even on a blustery winter day. We enjoyed our stroll and visiting scenes from \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d were the von Trapp children scampered through singing \u201cDoe a Deer\u201d.",
          "It is a nice palace with a nice garden but it's not so special. We pictured it much bigger, it's really a short walk through. You probably don't need more than 30 minutes.",
          "I came here in December and found nothing interesting from this garden. It seems that flowers bloom in this garden in other seasons, but it is very plain during winter. Technically, this is just a garden. You can't go inside the palace because it is used for private events.",

          "As palaces go, Mirabelle is fairly modest. We did not tour the inside chambers so in fairness, there may have been indoor attractions that would warrant a higher score. The gardens contained modest plantings of pansies that brought little color and the layout of the beds around",
          "Given this is on the list of must see places I expected more. It was ok for a brief stroll but nothing spectacular.",
          "Big and Beautiful garden. Even the sound of music was filmed here. Not the best place to be when it\u2019s winter. Unfortunately there are a lot of closed down areas in winter.",

          "Its a great place for an evening walk. I would suggest to go late in the evening, before the closing time to enjoy the beauty with less number of people. Must see if you are in Salzburg",
          "As a first time tourist, you should stop on by for an hour or less. Gardens are well known and a part of the Salzburg experience. But...it's a small pleasant garden versus a grand splendor. Seen it once, took well less than an hour to walk the whole thing a couple times and see",

          "Very nice garden, however there it is just average compared to some of the other palaces or parks we visited in Europe. Also not very large. It is all about the movie experience to say \"I been there\" . The palace only has one room open an it is neat. Could do everything in",
          "but in Winter, there really was nothing to see. I'd have expected to see a little bit more in the way of garden. I think they're relying on the movie rather too much. Pretty disappointed really.",

The gardens were beautiful, the crowds were about what you\u2019d expect, and",

Unfortunately for us, we were there during the worst heatwave in Europe and though the garden looked pretty enough, it was too hot a day to enjoy the view. I had read that there\u2019s a kid\u2019s playground at the park, but no",

          "Very nice gardens. Interior has limited room access. Marble room is nice- but just a room. If you chose to go to a concert might be more glamorous.",
          "When I stood in this garden, it flashed my mind to the well-loved musical film, The Sound of Music\" which I had seen several times in my younger days. Though nothing that attractive as we expected, especially under the hot sun, we had quick photo shots around - the fountains,",
          "Billed as the scene of Sound Of Music and such, much of it was closed to visitors. So besides the Marble Hall which was nice but not fantastic, it was just ordinary. In fact all places billed as palaces were ordinary. The gardens in Melk Abbey were much better in comparison.",
          "Not as impressive as some other gardens we have seen, but has nice features. Several large statues. Nice fountain. The flowers arranged in arcs was a lovely display.",
          "Four of us had a return visit here and saw more this time around, despite it being very busy that day. A local Band were playing in the gardens which added a little more to the atmosphere.",
          "Worth walking around the beautiful gardens and well laid out flower beds. Benches to the sides to sit and relax (if you can find one out of the sun).",
          "Was the at 5am to hunt for the do re mi steps in the movie the sound of music. The garden was huge and so beautiful. Must visit early in the morning when the crowd all still sleeping",

          "The Trick Fountain in the Hellbrunn Palace is a place which every one will enjoy visiting. It is full of fountains springing up from all over. The story behind this place is very interesting. We get to see all the gadgets working at the same time. A live demo is provided by",
          "Lots of tourists and locals visiting the gardens. Nice setting and well maintained gardens and if summer time ample shade. There is a waterfall and statues lining the garden.",

          "It was a rainy morning but the wife just had to go and see the gardens. This is where the kids sang \u201cDo Re Mi\u201d in the 'Sound of Music' movie, dancing around the fountain and on the stairs of the now Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac.",
          "This is the garden where Maria and the Von-Trapp children sang Do-Re-Me. The flowers were beautiful and the roses were blooming too. I could also smell the scent of the roses. It was awesome! A very nice place to walk around and chill too. It is located in the city and it is",
          "I agree with others that these gardens are small compared to so many other European options, including of course a half dozen in Vienna. However, they are intimate and have a feeling of accessibility the others might not have. Our hotel happened to be on the far end of these",
          "The gardens are very strategically located. The story behind the renaming of the gardens is equally fascinating.",
          "The concert was lovely, lots of people gather in the park to hear the bands/performers. We did have hard time finding the place of the performance. No signs or indications of where it will take place. We arrived an hour early to walk around and explore the park and almost gave",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the evening concert at the beautiful Marble Hall in the Mirabell Palace. Perhaps the fact that an arch-bishop built this grand place for his mistress makes it even more appealing. We heard a fine concert of Mozart, Haydn, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. A high",
          "The garden were pretty, but I actually walked through it earlier that day without even realizing it... thus meaning it didn't make a big impression on me",
          "Had a wonderful experience being on the steps where the sound of music was filmed. the gardens are beautiful",
          "The gardens here are magnificent. Well maintained and cared for, a great spot to relax with a coffee or just sit on a rug and listen to the fountains whisper to you. If you are a Sound of Music fan, then the steps will impress you. It\u2019s a nice walk through the gardens to get",

          "Mirabell Gardens are simply beautiful and the views of the castle and old town spires in the distance are amazing. you have beautiful flowers, landscaping, statues and splendid views wherever you look - and IT IS FREE. We came later in the day as the crowds were slimming down",
          "You walk down the 'Sound of Music Steps' and the fountains are there with the enclosed tunnel of roses and the statues, etc linked witht he film, however a poignant memorial stands here with memories of the mental patients and the severely disabled who were put to death by the",
          "A fine place to visit with splendid surroundings. However, the density of tourists has now reached a critical point... The old city is now a display of fashion boutiques and sournie shops...",
          "Just small garden that every city has. Nothing special if you don't have any interest in old Sound of Music movie.",
          "The gardens were extensive and pleasant to stroll through; the buiding was adequate but not a must see",
          "Great spot for pictures. This is definitely a must do. The place where they dance in the sound of music is located here.",

          "Beautiful gardens worth the visit in Salzburg. No fee, plenty of shade and sunny spots. A nice break from walking the narrow streets and the many shops and restauants in the old town. Mirabel is across the river from old town and begins a couple of blocks from the bridge.",

          "The Mirabell Palace and Gardens are not to be missed. I went there on a city tour and got a lot of great information but even just strolling around will lend itself to a great afternoon. You must check it out when you\u2019re in Salzburg!",
          "Mirabell Palace and Gardens is a historic building in Salzburg originally built for the Prince Archbishops of the city. It's a beautiful Baroque building. The gardens is laid out I think in a geometrically arranged Italian style garden. The gardens is free to enter to the",

          "After the Sound of Music tour, we were taken at this garden where most of scenes were filmed. It is a must see if you\u2019re a fan of the movie. Though it poured early on, the sun came out and gave us a chance to enjoy and take pictures (see below). I\u2019d highly recommend to visit",

          "This is a beautiful garden with a castle. This is where some of the scenes from Sound of Music were recorded. Do not miss the dwarf garden and the maze on your left hand sight when you enter from the south. A good idea is to go there early in the morning since there are many",
          "These gardens were only a stone's throw from our hotel. They were lovely. Water, flowers, trees, lots of places to sit and enjoy. We really liked the Dwarf Garden of statues and their history. Lots of tourists though with many people taking selfies everywhere.",
          "Beautiful hours passed in the tranquility of these gardens. Bonus of Sound of Music photo opportunities and a a fabulous, free orchestra to serenade us. Good marker for getting your bearings in Salzburg.",
          "To many Sound of Music fans, this is a place to visit, to others is a beautiful place to walk around to enjoy the spring.",
          "The palace garden was impressive. Such beautiful flowers, bushes, and trees. So peaceful. No wonder we saw several couples who were in wedding garb enjoying the beauty. And for Sound of Music fans, you can recognize several scenes shot in these gardens.",

          "We got married in th marble hall of the Mirabell palace and the architecture and interior design was stunning. The ornate sculptures on the walls and ceiling were beautiful. Sadly there was a lot of work being done around the Pegasus fountain and in some of the landscaped areas",
          "The gardens are NOT spectacular, but they are pretty, and some scenes from the Sound of Music were filmed there. River cruise tourists are as thick as locusts, and it is hard to move around. The Palace has bee restored, and the concert hall is worth seeing from the outside",
          "The garden is so beautiful and peaceful that is well worth the visit especially since it had stopped raining now The sound of music being shot here made it more of a must see spot.",
          "It is just a beautiful, romantic garden, were you can walk peacefully and take stunning photos. The \"zwerg garden\" is fun to see. I go back there whenever possible.",
          "This is an amazing garden scape. I the middle of the city this is truly a treasure and well worth seeing.",
          "Many scenes from the Sound of Music were shot here so if you are a fan it is a must see spot. Regardless, the garden is very pretty to stroll through. Many benches throughout as well as shady spots.",
          "After looking at photos of these gardens online I envisioned they would be truly spectacular. On arrival I was very surprised by their small size, and how centrally located they were. I imagined them to be an entire complex on their own, maybe outside of the city altogether",
          "We were there for about 1 hour. Huge gardens, it's very nice. We were able to enter the castle. It's very impressive as you have various statues and paitings towords first and second floor. On the first floor (if I am not wrong), there is a room, even though it's private (for",
          "The beautiful blooming flower beds in the gardens are a treat to watch. The Palace and the whole location brings the movie \"Sound of Music\" alive. I loved visiting the location.",
          "This was an afterthought upon completing a bus tour. So happy we did! The grounds are lovely and would be even better a little later in the spring so the flowers have had a chance to bloom. Many scenes from the Sound of Music were filmed in the palace and gardens a. This",
          "My wife and I were in Salzburg recently with a tour group. On our first visit to Mirabell Gardens, it was raining so we did not see it at its best. Even in the rain we could see the beauty of the Gardens. Thankfully, we did go back the next day to better appreciate all they had",
          "It was worth to visit, even with unfriendly rainy weather. Beautiful flowers, nice bulidings, but many tourists so a bit too crowded.",
          "Only managed to visit the garden. Beautifully laid out and relaxing especially if it is sunny. For those who love the film Sound of Music, the gardens offer one of the locations for the film.",
          "This is a great place to go if you are a Sound of Music fan and if that is not your interest then it is just a pretty place to go. Be prepared for it to be busy with a lot of tourists. The palace itself if pretty in the marble hall but was not as exciting (to me) as the gardens.",
          "It's a beautiful garden nice for taking pictures, did not get a tour of the palace.but we did get to tour the city and that was interesting, a lot of street musicians offering talented performances.",
          "We only walked through this beautiful garden, again our guide did not offer a tour of the palace (she didn't with Mozart's birthplace either). It is lovely with a fountain in the center. It was mid April and the flowers were in full bloom. The walkways are dusty gravel and",
          "The Mirabell Palace and Gardens was built in 1606 in in the city Salzburg, located in the middle of city very close to the the Baroque gardens were completely 1690 located in the heart of the city, Today is the most famous place interest, romantic weddings.",
          "Mirabell Palace is worth a quick visit and the gardens, especially the Sound of Music fountain, are worth a visit but my favorite part is the oldest Dwarf Garden (1695) is the world. The statues are all quirky and cool. Some of them have some great faces. I highly recommend",
          "We just spent around 30 min here. It was a labor day holiday and all offices in the Mirabell Palace were closed. We could see the concert hall though which was real good. It was buzzing with activity with a team getting ready for their concert in another hour. Garden is good bit",
          "A place that definately worth to visit. Nice gardens and impressive pallace centrally located in town",
          "Unfortunately we were there early spring and there wasn't much blooming other than pansies. The pop of purple and yellow color was nice but outside at least it was very underwhelming. I think when in full bloom, this place would be a must see but I think if you're there in",
          "Place is amazing , flowers bloom the park is unique very worth to visit. Perfect for romantic walk during spring/summer.",
          "The gardens in Salzberg are impressive. We visited for a short time in early spring and everything was beginning to bloom or burst into growth. Don't miss the dwarf sculptures, they have quite an interesting tale.",

          "The gardens are certainly worth a visit , however do not expect to be overwhelmed. I guess maybe coming from Australia I expected too much compared to our gardens. It is a nice tranquil place though",
          "It was a good idea to visit Mirabell gardens. My friends and I enjoyed the marvellous views the garden offered.",
          "We visited the Mirabell Palace Gardens during our brief visit to Saltzburg during the Easter week. The flowers were just starting to bloom, and it was absolutely beautiful. Even though there were a lot of people there, it did not feel as crowded mainly because the garden is so",

          "Pretty gardens, if you are taking a train into town, you will definitely pass it along the the way to town. It was a public washroom and great place to take pictures.",
          "Garden is very beautiful and what\u2019s more entrance is free. Well maintained and good for children, only gripe is we cannot find a restroom. Another must see when you\u2019re in Salzburg, very near old town love bridge and city center",
          "The beautiful gardens surrounding the palace are worth a stroll The gardens are featured in the sound of music. We heard opera practice on the north end near the marionette theater. Best place to visit sough of the river.",
          "The wisteria are in bloom and they are so beautiful! This is a place where scenes from the Sound of Music were filmed and the gardens are exquisite and so beautiful with spring flowers and different flowering trees everywhere. I only wish the roses were in bloom - the garden is",

          "In Salzburg for a few nights, I thought it a must to hear some Mozart in concert. The venue was stunning, albeit small. The musicians were excellent. A particular highlight was the traditional horn played part way through. There\u2019s a short intermission, where you can purchase",
          "My adult daughter and I spent a lovely afternoon touring these beautiful, expansive gardens and would highly recommend a visit. There are so many beautiful things to see, the formal gardens planted when we visited with vibrant tulips and pansies, the stunning fountains, the",
          "Only a small part of the palace opens but it is free. The geese a are very impressive but unfortunately a strong breeze made it a dust bowl so the visit was short",
          "I could\u2019ve spent hours just relaxing in the Gardens. I visited over Easter weekend and had perfect weather - bright sun and 73 degrees. Beyond the relation to Sound of Music which is pretty neat, even more impressive is how immaculately maintained the gardens are. I highly",
          "We visited mid march on a rainy day and there were hardly any flowers in the large garden. As a result the garden area was not what is advertised. Most of the large building is taken up by municipal offices leaving only one room to view showing the grandeur of its former life",
          "Lovely gardens with special memories of scenes from the Sound of Music. Quite crowded during the afternoon and tricky to get a photo",
          "Wanted to bring my youngest son who played some characters at stage of The Sound of Music, we really enjoyed being here, it\u2019s not too big garden but it\u2019s amazing, including the story about construction, the Sculptures, magnificent architecture, The sound of music filmed here and",

          "There is not much to see at this palace. The exterior architecture is simple and not very impressive. Can be visited only The Marble Hall (which is really impressive) and where you get via a magnificent staircase. Also you can visit the castle garden and The Orangery , a not",
          "A must-see on the New Town area of Salzburg. Regardless if you are or are not a \"Sound Of Music\" fan, this garden offers a wonderful view of the Hohensalzburg Fortress in the backdrop when you enter through the entrance gate where Julie Andrews and VonTrapp children sang",

          "Highly recommend this place if your visiting Salzburg. Its stunning! Now if your a Sound of Music fan then you will obviously LOVE this place, however, if your not a fan, well there still so much to see and do. Children will love it, theres a dwarf garden and play area!! A must",

          "The gardens are beautiful, it can be a quick stroll through, we only spent about 15 minutes here. Our 10-year-old would have spent an hour playing on the nearby playground if we had let him. The play ground is just off the Mirabell grounds near Schwarzstrasse.",
          "I had a hotel room near here so I walked this garden often and loved it. Some, points in the park were in the movie Sound of Music, but you may want to take that tour for all info. I easily walked from here to the bridge over the river to old town. Put on your walking shoes.",
          "We visited in end of March which is not really the peak season, so the trees were still leaf less. But the gardens were in full bloom. Word of warning there are too many tourists so if you want a peaceful walk and pictures I recommend going earlier in the morning.",

          "We visited here mainly because Sound of Music was partially filmed here. Nicely manicured gardens which have apparently been kept this way for centuries. Nice to come here for a leisurely stroll and enjoy the flowers.",
          "The gardens were a little drab in March. However you could see their potential for later in the year. Some great sculptures (including a grinning unicorn - and why not indeed). Too many tourists possibly but still worth a look.",

          "Our tour group lucked out as it snowed the two days in Salzburg. We only went up to the marble staircase to one of the rooms. The big WOW was walking through the garden with a fresh coat of snow. Simply stunning and magical. We really lucked out.",
          "I only visited the gardens of the Mirabell Palace, but thought it to be lovely. If you are a fan of The Sound of Music, then get ready to spot numerous movie scenes within the gardens. You don\u2019t need long to have a nice stroll through the gardens, 20 minutes would do. Make it",

          "Majority of gardens were closed to visitors in December therefore limiting photo opportunities, especially for Sound of Music fans.",
          "Totally in awe at the size of this place and the magnificence of the gardens. Beautiful place to stroll and to spend the afternoon",
          "Very easily approachable as most of the buses stop here. We had the opportunity of visiting the Christmas market also. Backdrop of the fortress is fantastic and makes up for a good location to click photographs",

          "We called into, these majestic gardens steeped in history from The Sound of Music. Beautiful statues of unicorns line the grand stairs leading down to the gardens and the main building. The gardens even though we visited in Winter time were still lovely albeit cold. There were",

          "Mirabell Palace and Gardens was truly magical! Hopping down the steps, posing with unicorn statues, walking through beautiful flowers arranged in great patterns to get to fountains and a large tunnel with plants covering it! MUST-SEE if you are in Austria!",

          "I went here with a tour guide on a day trip from Vienna, and as such did not have time to venture inside the palace. The grounds themselves were worth it though. The colorful flower arrangements and designs were very impressive, and even though the place was crowded, it still",
          "It is great fun to act out the Sound of Music and song on the step is the plaza. We loved the views of the castle, especially at night.",
          "Very pretty place to stroll, also a marvelous concert venue. Tickets can be ordered on line. Pay extra for the premium seats. You'll be seated in the front row which is definitely the best place for the concert hall as the seats are not elevated and the rest of the seats are",
          "Everyone goes here. The gardens are beautifully laid out but I could have done without the parties recreating the Sound of Music in a less than tuneful fashion! Not sure when you would browse in peace as it seemed as packed at night as during the day. The interior is worth",

          "Beautiful gardens to wander around and relax in. Roses were in full bloom which added to the ambiance. Lovely fountain in the centre of the gardens and benches where you can sit. To the right of gardens opp Palace there are quite unique statues very gnome like which were fun",
          "We were here on a gloomy November day. The park is well maintained and there are a few flowers, but here were way too many tourists and it's quite a small park, so we didn't enjoy it very much. I can see why lots of people like it in the spring and summer though.",

        "wiki": "Housed in the Neuen Residenz (to which it moved in 2005), the Salzburg Museum is the museum of artistic and cultural history for the city and region of Salzburg, Austria. It originated as the Provincialmuseum and was also previously known as the Museum Carolino-Augusteum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe Salzburg Museum was founded in 1834, when a small collection of military memorabilia was made accessible to the public to formalize the memories of the Napoleonic wars. After the Revolution of 1848, the collection became the official town museum of Salzburg.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1924, the natural history objects of the museum were given to the Haus der Natur Salzburg. One year later, the folk culture collection opened a side-branch in the Monatsschl\u00f6ssl in the parks of Hellbrunn Palace.\nDuring World War II, the museum got three direct hits from bombs. Most of the collection had already been moved to mines that served as bunkers; however, the building was completely destroyed along with many objects too large to move. Several objects disappeared from their bunkers during the US occupation, including a collection of gold coins that had been kept in the salt mines of Hallein. A new building was opened as a provisory museum in 1967. A debate about the final and most worthy location for the headquarters of the Salzburg Museum lasted for decades. Side-branches of the Salzburg Museum were opened during this time: The Domgrabungsmuseum in 1974, the Spielzeugmuseum (Toy Museum) in 1978, and a newly developed Festungsmuseum (Fortress Museum) in 2000. By 1997, promoted by Landeshauptmann Franz Schausberger, local politicians had finally agreed on the Neue Residenz as a new venue for the Salzburg Museum.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe museum reopened in the Neue Residenz in 2005.

          "Not sure how do I feel about the whole experience. The museum is nice, also it was a little hot inside. As soon as we left the building, a girl chased us and acqused in front of the kids of not paying a bill in the museum's restaurant and requested money. We never even entered",
          "The nature part of the museum is good with pleanty of animals, geology and the human body. Pleanty of live fish in the aquarium and live reptiles to, large collection of stuffed animals. The displays are well explained. That's where the good bits end, the science and",

          "We spent a good 3 to 4 hours in here with our 2 year old and saw maybe a quaster of what was here. Maybe not what you would come to Salzburg for but definitely worth your time if you are. Especially if you have children. It turns out that Christian Doppler is a Salzburger so",

          "Easy to be found. If you want to fully discover the building you'll need several hours but it does worth it for younger and older visitors alike! However some exhibitions are more for children but this is not that disturbing if you are not one. Thematically well organised and",
          "Definately plan enough time to see the museum. It is nice to wander around and you will learn a lot. Some parts have to be renovated because they date back from 1990's or older, but still nice! We spend more than 3 hours here and you can easily do that.",
          "It's the best science museum in Europe I've ever been. The exhibitions are interactive and there is so much fun connected with science for adults and children. Especially cosmis area is just great. We were in Haus der Natur two times and never be bored. What important,",

          "We were there with a one-and-a-half-year-old boy who really enjoyed himself. The place is huge and you can spend a whole day. There is a neat place to sit down to eat and rest. There is a veritable room that can be done full of experiments. We enjoyed the same level as the",
          "If you like museums, this would be the best one in Salzburg. They have different sections covering a wide range of exhibits from precious stones, science to an aquarium and artificial zoo. Not a bad couple of hours to spend.",
          "On a cold afternoon on our last full day in Salzburg this was the perfect activity.ntixket price is highly reasonable, frankly I'd have been willing to pay more. Highlights for me we're definitely the aquarium and the reptile zoo, both of which were more comprehensive than",
          "... and ended up staying for 3. and we weren't even finished! brilliant choice for an educational and interesting experience. i find the floor with the solar system the most mesmerising, especially the short film on how the galaxy came to be, plus the planets and one's weight on",
          "They put so much love into this place. Very fit to the very young ones. Many activities in the science building. It was rainy so very perfect for us and we enjoyed being kids again relearning many things.",
          "We stayed there 4 1/2 hours without feeling the time passing by. If you have kids from 6-16 you can go there and have a wonderful day. It\u2019s a mixture from a standard museum and a feel&touch museum ... you will even find your lost kid in yourself when playing physic or water",
          "Great place for all ages. There aren\u2019t many places that offer such a diverse range of things to see and do. You will need several hours here. Aquarium is small but interesting, reptile house is bigger than expected, then there is the space zone, the science hands on centre and",
          "Really enjoyed this place. Nice layout, very interactive for the kids and a good cafe too. There is also a picnic area if you want to take your own lunch. Naturally, a lot of the exhibits are in German, but there was enough in English to get by. The Reptile area and the human",
          "Thought we pop in after lunch for a short visit but ended up staying for over 2 hours. Lots to see and explore even for adults. Worth a visit if you have extra days in Austria.",
          "This was a very nice museum. Not too big, however, very interesting & nice indoor activity. Enjoy the different levels with all the well done dioramas! The aquariums were beautiful too. It goes from the dinosaur era up to space! Used Salzburg card for this activity.",
          "Great place especially for kids. One of the best science centres Ive ever been to and we spent almost 3h there. There are lots of interactive exhibits, as well as a reptile zoo and aquarium. Definitely recommended and had a great time there.",
          "Our 13 year old son enjoyed a lot: natural history with a few dinosaurs, acquarium with fish from all over the world, learning some physics laws through play, a room dedicated to the history of man exploring space...If you park in the nearby Aldstadtgarage, ask at the museum",
          "Popped in to escape the rain and stayed over 4 hours. There is so much to see and do, many things are labelled in English and most of what isn't is fairly self explanatory. Younger children may want to skip the section on human reproduction. Great hands on activities in the",
          "We spent half day in this museum, very interactive so the kids had a blast! They did Not bored at all! They didn't want to leave!! They have a little bit of every area.. Dinosaurs. Aquarium, science, about the solar system... They have a small shop and a caf\u00e9 so you can eat",
          "Really great mineral collection, although labels were all in German. Aquarium was also good, and bilingual. Lots of kids on a Sunday, and they really seemed to enjoy it.",
          "It's a museum for adults and kids, a place where you can try different things. It's great to understand physics and technology. I actually saw groups of kids visiting this museum with their teacher. It's a great place. Much better than Mozarts' house.",
          "Free entrance with Salzburg card. If it is raining or cold and you have kids with you, make sure you come to this museum. There are lots of interesting stuff about nature, minerals, space and so on. Even though I am an adult, I had tons of fun whilst learning more about nature,",
          "Amazing museum definitely worth visiting. For kids science and aquarium sections were the best. No complaints except that air conditioning was only working in science section.",
          "Unfortunately we had one rainy day in Salzburg, which we spent in 'Haus der Natur'. Both of us really enjoyed the time, it's a museum for adults and kids, you can try things, see fishies, reptiles or explore the human body. I would always suggest doing it if you have a rainy",
          "The pictures on tripadvisor dont do this museum justice. While some of the exhibits are a bit old, weird, or dated by comparison to museums in Australia, it is actually a lot of fun, and is a great place to mix it up between palaces, museums, and shopping. A lot of the exhibits",
          "This museum was really enjoyable! We had lots of fun. All signage is in English as well and easy to use explanations to help you talk to your children about what is happening. Over the road is 3 floors of hands on stuff to do including water on the bottom floor. You need at",
          "Many peoples, but a Museum with unusual things. Low entrance fee, nice restaurant inside. My kids loves the T-Rex",
          "It is a science and technology museum with a nice variety of topics, all very well explained for kids.",
          "This is how a well done museum of nature and technics should look like. Interactive expositions, interesting themes, dinosaurs - everything you need.",
          "I didn't know what to expect. It was amazing and I think everyone should visit this museum, even children!",
          "We visited as a couple (without kids) and found this to be a bit dated. We didn't spend much time there but checked out four of the six floors on offer. We had visited, and loved, Deutches museum in Munich recently which may have tainted our view of this attraction. We could see",
          "You can find inside a technical and nature buildings. I visited only a nature side, because it was more interesting for children. There you can see a dinosaur, the world of fish, there is a lot of aquariums, exhibition of body, exhibition of animals, ... I recommanded this",
          "We had this planned on a rainy day... But the sun was shining, and it was hot inside. But the kids loved it, and so did we.",
          "The Haus der Natur in Salzburg is one of the biggest magnets for the general public in the city. Roaming through the museum, visitors discover the most fascinating aspects of Mother Nature. Right at the entrance, giant dinosaurs show us what the world must have looked like",
          "It is a nice place to be on the visiting list when you travel to Salzburg. Keep in mind that it will take up at least 4 hours, because there is a huge amount of things to see inn this museum.",
          "The many floors of things to do can keep a visitor any age busy for hours! I was there for 2 1/2 hours and still did not manage to see everything! I learned something new in every single room that I entered! If you have the time on a rainy day or just need a break from the sun",
          "We visited this museum on a rainy day in Salzburg. Being school holidays, it was very busy, but this did not detract from the enjoyment here. We particularly enjoyed the interactive science activities, such as seeing how much power you can produce by running through a",
          "This museum is so spacious that you are not disturbed by other people. There are so many different themes. I found the sections on the human body and the animals of myths and legends particularly interesting though it should be said that not all exhibits have English",
          "We were in Salzburg with group of kinds on football tournament and looking for attraction to \"kill\" the morning time. This came as a very nice surprise and all kids aged 6-14 loved it ! It is interactive and quiet place with lots of things to see. We were also impressed with the",
          "We planed to visit this amazing house only for short time...and we stood here more than 5 hours. So many animals, so many things to do...and it is great for children and adultes too.",
          "Me and a friend went there on a rainy day. we are both students, for us the Entrance is only 5\u20ac. You can learn something about animals, look at the aquariums, the reptiles, the solar system, history, the human body on the one side of the building on 5 floors and have 3 extra",
          "Very well laid out with interesting and informative exhibits.I particularly liked the one showing why the seasons are what they are and why temperatures are different in summer and winter. It was the best way of explaining it to kids that I've seen. Lots of other great",
          "Must bigger, and much more to see and do than you might think! Everything from science to contemporary discoveries. Put aside at least 2 hours plus some time to grab something to eat in the cafe. And pretty sure you will be flagging before the children. Well worth a visit,",
          "It takes an exceptional place for me to give any establishment a 5 star rating. on a recent wet day, i took our family of four adults and three grandkids here. and like others, expected to stay an hour or two. FOUR hours later we exited and still had not had our fill of the",
          "Lots of fun and educational experience for kids and adults too. Love this museum! From dinosaurs to space, from nature and animals to history, from music to science... and part of the museum about the human body is great! We were there for 6 hours with two kids (4 and 9) and the",
          "it's right at the end of shopping street in the city center. tickets for about \u20ac8. 4 floors loaded with showpieces. I saw many kids and older people too. It can be intresting for everyone.",
          "This place has everything... it's a museum, a zoo and a science center all in one. Highly recommended, this can save the rainy day and it's worth visiting on sunny days, too.",
          "We came here with our 6 year old, looking for something to keep him occupied for an afternoon. The exhibitions are excellent (with plenty of English available) and many are interactive. Overall this was a delightful surprise and rivalled most of the museums I've visited over",
          "you can spend easily 2 to 4 hour there and its never boring. also a great thing is that they have this science playground for kids which they love",
          "Almost in middle of Salzburg (part old-town) there\u00b4s a new renovatet museum, calles \"house of nature\". Its very interesting to get much information about nature, animals, sorted on more levels. Its same interesting for kids and for adults. In the building there\u00b4s included a nice",

          "We stopped in the Haus der Natur for just one hour before closing time with our 2 and 4 year old. They enjoyed the exhibits and we easily could have spent another few hours there. We wish we had started in the Science Lab portion of the museum because there were many hands on",
          "We went here because the Salzburg Card gave us free entry. We were highly impressed with this attraction. It was highly informative and interactive. Make sure you leave yourself at least 3 to 4 hours to take in all that this place has to offer.",
          "Went in here expecting to spend an hour or so there, came out over 3 hours later! Has 4 floors and contains a wide variety of interesting exhibits, including a large aquarium section, a reptile house, various science exhibitions and a ton of other stuff. Entrance is free with",
          "This museum is on several floors spread across a large area. Great exhibits and fun things for kids and adult to do. Very reasonably priced, easy to find and great fun.",
          "We probably would have visited anyway, but a wet day decided the matter. It is a good example of a scitec type museum, but had a lot of varied exhibits which in the main were done very well. Aimed at kids obviously but most exhibits were done well enough to interest adults as",
          "When the weather outside is cold and snowy, take the kids to Haus der Natur, we went there on a Sunday at noon. It was a day well spent. The have 4 floors knowledge. From fish to mammals to people to insects to animals to dinosaurs.Precious stones and ornaments. You can take",
          "I really loved it, I have been in many museums, but this is the best. If you visit Salzburg, you need to visit house of nature. Its cheap.... compared to other sights in Salzburg. If you have children, it is really great, I think, I have seen many kids there, play around and",
          "We ended up going to this place thanks to our Salzburg card else it wasn't on our list of must see places. The museum was very intersting and worth a visit. I would have preferred having more time here.",

          "This museum was very interesting for us adults and our children. I highly recommend it, I tell all of my friends about it. I just wish we had more time there.",
          "The tourist information recommended we dropped by as a good cold weather activity. Our British kids (6&3) loved it. Our 3 year old could not get enough of the model dinosaurs. Our 6yr old was transfixed by the aquarium - a camouflaged octopus and plenty of clown fish were more",
          "We decided to visit this museum on a rainy day while visiting Salzburg. This was an excellent choice! We really enjoyed all of the exhibits. Many are hands-on and many have live creatures. Well worth the visit. Plan on spending several hours here to really get a feel for all",
          "We ve been to many museums-but this one is no 1. We went there with a plan to run trough and go home. We stayed for almost 5 hours. So many things to see, learn, try. It is a mix of a museum, a zoo and a labaratory. History, live animals, experiments... our 11 year old was so",
          "Prepare to stay here for a while. We stayed around 3.5 hours and could have stayed more if we were not that hungry. There are so many interesting things to see and a lot of areas where you can try them for yourself. You can even get some exercise done here, so better leave your",
          "This is an extensive science and natural history museum. The ground floor has dinosaurs and tropical fish tanks. Other floors include crystals and biology of plants and humans. There is also an area on the solar system which includes an exhibit on the moon landing which can be",
          "You do not expect much from such a museum not metropolitan. But Salzburg's Haus De Natur contains a lot of information that will need 2 visits to digest. They also have a special exhibition as tribute to their special Salzburger Christian Doppler. Kids corner with a lot of games",
          "There is a hands-on section for children that explores all sorts of scientific and natural phenomena. This is a must for children. The rest of the museum focuses on the sciences and will interest children and adults alike.",
          "The musem is divided mainly into 2 parts. The first one is for nature and animals. So expect to see animal fossils and also some alive reptiles , snakes and aquarium. The second one is for science and it was really really interesting as it has a lot of interactive experiments",
          "Very nice, a must see with kids. First part (old building) rich in nature, second part (new building) in sience experience kind of playing tools. We were there 5 hours, still not saw everything...",
          "We visited this house on Sunday afternoon which was not ideal because there were so many people and especailly children running around and screaming (so this attraction is definitely something that families would enjoy). But the house is huge, we spend there 3 hours and we",

          "We really enjoyed the natural history part of the museum, but we did not have time for the science portion. We did take a break at the cafe and had the most wonderful tomato soup!",
          "I'm a bit of a fan of natural history museums. This one is not just natural history but also a science museum. My recommendation would be to go straight to the science side and forget the nature bit. I've never felt so sorry for fish than I did here. The poor stingrays are",
          "We love science museums and have been to many as a family over the years. This museum felt really, really outdated. The space exhibit was nice and looked recently updated due to some donations from Red Bull. Everything else just felt old and musty.",
          "I (21) visited it with my boyfriend (23) abd were sooo sathisfied. It was great! It is huge, so we were there for about 5 hours but at the end weren't looking in details. The aquarium and reptile zoo are awesome! And at the and we found science lab where are really i teresting",

          "We spent a whole morning there and loved every minute of it. Make sure you go very early though as it gets super busy later on, especially when it rains. We all loved the science experiments the most, if you like this sort of thing then go there first of all ;)",

          "It was a natural history and science museum and had been quite well reviewed. My boyfriend is a big fan of natural history so I thought it was worth checking out. I ended up being absolutely blown away by how fun it was. First of all the place is HUGE. There is a massive",
          "We spent a couple of hours inside and if we had more time we could have stayed much longer. The kids (ages 9 and 11) really enjoyed both the nature and especially the science side of the place. highly recommended for families with kids. It's included in the Salzburg land card.",

          "One of the best in Salzburg. We spent more than 3 hours there. Informative with good presentation. The kids enjoyed this place. Every thing about earth, human, animals and science is available there. Information are presented in a nice way there, some of them are interactive. We",

          "Interesting museum with a broad range of exhibits. It needs a full days to tour it in detail or a fill half day just to walk through. Lots of children on school trips. At \u20ac8 you can't beat the value.",

          "We took our toddler here and she loved it. It was rainy so inside it was dry and warm with plenty to do. Including an aquarium and scince interactive exhibits and games. There is also a resturaunt that was a good place to break.",

          "This is a very interesting place. There are plenty of interactive experiments and displays. Just make sure you have plenty of time at hand. Big thumbs up!!!",
          "We had so much fun and time flew past. The science lab is great and incredibly interesting. Put aside enough time, if you want to get the most out of this facility a short visit will not do. There are a lot of floors/areas to cover. The facility is very much child friendly.",
          "This is an excellent attraction for school parties and families with children as there is so much to see and so much variety. Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to do this museum justice, as we visited too late in the afternoon and so did not have sufficient time to look",
          "My daughter enjoyed the mental shift that this museum gave us after seeing so many beautiful historic sites. However, the higher floors were so hot that we couldn't stay very long. I'm sure it would be a more pleasant visit in temperate weather",
          "This place is huge! With a big variety of exhibits on multiple floors. We couldn't get around it in one day. The floor plans are broken up so they are easily navigated. I loved the animals with some amazing fish and reptiles. There also loads of the usual bones and specimens.",
          "The best part of visiting \"Haus der Natur\" with your kids is watching them coming in touch with science in the so called \"science center\". It's a space of fun - they have a chance of playing with hydraulics or experimenting with sound.",
          "We visited here on a grey & cloudy day and had a very enjoyable time. It was quiet which suited us and as expected there was plenty to see and experience. I would expect that children visiting would get a huge amount from the interactive aspects alone. For us the things that",
          "Its too good and very interesting for every age.. its worth to buy ticket and can enjoy with whole family..",

          "We had a one day trip to Salzburg and unfortunately it was a rainy weather so we looked for an indoor attraction. This museum was a great choice, it was a really good fun for the kids. The exposition is kids oriented with lot of interesting experience for them. They really loved",
          "Great for kids, good variety of subjects, very interactive. Better avoid weekends, the museum is full.",

          "We visited those kind of museums before; almost every big city in Europe has one. Mostly they are rather \u2018dusty\u2019. But this was surely not the case in the Haus der Natur. It was a delight to see all the different expositions. Everything was so well organised, clean and perfect.",
          "Its the most educated museum I have ever bin to, there is just not enough time to stay there I would like to have a week or more just to see everything, kids love it but its so much fun for adult also.",

          "We visited this place with 2 young kids and both of them loved it. Cost 8 euros for adult and 5.5 for kids over 4, Salzburg card gives free entry. Aquarium, reptile zoo and Science lab are excellent. Food in cafe is very good and not so costly compare to quality and quantity.",
          "We visited the aquarium and full exhibition's for 5 floor's. Interesting for children's and not only. Last expo - for human body - was a little bit too explicit for smaller children's, but finally was ok.",
          "One of the best museums in the world and a benchmark for me against others around the world. It is superbly laid out- and fascinated my daughter whom I first took there when 8. We literally spent our entire holiday in there. So many interactive exhibits, and even if you don't",
          "As it was raining we decided to use our Salzburg card and visit this attraction, we have visited it before but only for a short period of time. It was busy but still having room to move about freely. The new exhibition is about the human body and what a great time we all had,",

          "Excellent museum. Mineral collection is astonishing. I think it is even better than museum in Vienna. Modern presentation is additional benefit. Highly recommended for anyone interested in nature and universe.",
          "My daughters and I enjoyed our visit here even though some of the exhibits are a bit dated. Many have English narratives along with the German, but a good number do not. There's a kids area that little kids are sure to enjoy.",
          "As we had the Salzburg card, thought of peeking into this museum (also due to rainy weather). The aquarium was big and informative. We especially enjoyed the care they take to breed rare fishes and the new-born fishes. Also, the section that were informative for us were:",

          "Natural history museum are not uncommon but this one seems to be one of the better one. It was big, informative, interactive. Some exhibitions were really great. Also it seems to be the best museum among other ones around it - modern art etc. I am not a museum enthusiast. A",
          "It's hard to believe that there exists so much to see & do in one location. This is the best kid-friendly, interactive museum we've ever visited. The animatronic dinosaurs (my first impression of the place) leave a bit to be desired but as you wander in further to the aquarium",
          "This is a great morning or afternoon or both. Many families brought their own food and so rested the children in between floors in specially organised picnic areas.",
          "There was so much to see for so little amount of money. The aquarium was the most beautiful I have seen. Also the reptile section was cool. I also enjoyed the sience part, because it was explaing many things by experiencing/trying/playing them.",
          "We spent almost 2 hours here to explore all the interesting items showed here about Dinosaurs, Tibet, Geosciences, Ice Ages, Africa, World of Oceans, Human Body and many other things. Good exhibitions and not boring at all.",

          "This was surprisingly one of the best attractions on our trip. We traveled with both a 17-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl, and both thoroughly enjoyed the visit. The various exhibits range from aquariums to space and the cosmos to Tibet. (note: why Tibet?). We spent the",

          "This place is great for fun and educational at the same time. I think that my parents and I enjoyed it just as much as my 6 year old did. Live, pictures, stuffed, videos, it has a little bit of it all.",
          "If you have any small interest in any sort of natural history or technology then make sure you come here. A large portion of the museum had English displays which were very helpful, even those which didn't were still very interesting to look at. Three stories of hands-on",
          "Spent the afternoon here to stay warm and out of the snow. Definitely worth it! They have an Aquarium and Reptile Zoo - my favourite part. It's an informative and fun place to go for all ages! From Minerals, to animals, to the human body, and reproduction. It's definitely a",

          "Not your typically American museum, which is what I was expecting. Incredible life-size exhibits, with English translations under the German information. The 10 euro adult ticket (I think 4.50 for kids) includes the I amazing science center that is so fun for kids, and parents.",

          "Really a good place if you are tired of seeing Mozart in everywhere of Salzburg. Impressive collection from aquarium to other exhibition. Not only for kids, grown-ups who are interested in science or animals should visit here.",

          "We used the salzburg card for this museum - you will have to show your card and get a ticket for the museum at the entrance. This has some nice exhibits like the aquarium, a section on the Doppler effect, the science area has a lot of hands on activity. The natural history",
          "This museum is really impressive and holds interesting stories, exhibitions and items for every age. For instance in the science center, you can try to experience how it feels to sit in a wheel chair or to be blind. They built a small obstacle course and one has to master this",

          "Beautiful museum for young explorers, archeologists, scientists and everyone find of exploring this world.",
          "The science meuseum in Salzburg or as its called \"Haus der Natur\" is interesting and informative specially if you are with kids. It also house an aquarium. There are various levels covering different subjects from Earth to space.",

          "Good fun but some of the exhibitions are a bit dated for today\u2019s standards - based on printouts, containing dry facts - you end up standing in a hall reading a book glued to a wall. That is if you know German - not everything is in English. \u2026",
          "We only had 3 hours there and it is certainly not enough. Kids really enjoy the museum.",
          "A lot of experiments and great exhibits. Perfect for young kids and not so young adults who feel adventurous.",

          "Great place kids were very excited",
          "Very nice and interactive museum. Apart from classical exhibits and mineral collections, there are many live fish and reptiles. Interactive exposures are fun not only for children but also for adults. If you want to see everything honestly, count with a time requirement of about 5 hours.",
          "It is fairly hard to navigate, but otherwise it is great",
          "Big informative and engaging halls! Well worth it.",
          "Aquarium and Reptilarium TOP!\nFor the aquarium it is recommended to attend the feeding of the octopus, shark and piranhas (see timetable on website).\nScience Center is OK, not the best in the world, but enjoyable.",
          "There are many very interesting and colorful exhibitions with a lot of visitors. The younger ones move with high speed and arrive from any direction so take care :-) With slow pace it lasts many hours to check everything. The only problem \u2026",
          "Nice place to spend some time with kids, they will enjoy",
          "Excellent place to spend quality time with fun for at least 3 hours. 4 floors of amazing nature and science exhibitions and some are interactive.

          "Very cool for people who like any kind of science.",
          "Beautiful place to lean about nature and science. My kids enjoined it very much. It explains science in a simple and fun way. It will need 4 hours at least to go through all parts",
          "Wonderful place to spend a day with kids and teenagers. But overcrowded I'd say and I recommend to make some pauses, as in the end my eyes were swimming.",
          "Not much space for animals. Strange mixing of species of which I can only assume is for profit (mixing a Tokay gecko with a python for instance).",
          "This was a really interesting and interactive place to have visited in Salzburg. I would recommend at least stopping by and seeing the highlights, But trust me, each floor jeeps getting better. My favorite was the space section with the \u2026",
          "Interesting place",

          "For kids and all great experience",
          "Great experience! We went as a group aging from 23 to 65 yr old and all really enjoyed it. There were interactive stations on each level as well as videos to watch. We spend a few hours here! The only reason i did not give 5 stars is that a lot of the displays did not have English text and there was no audio tour on offer.",
          "Very interesanting place",
          "Worth a trip. Lots and lots of kids running rampage, but that's ok because it shows that they're having fun. As an adult it's irritating at first but if you just accept it and see it for what it is, it's good to see kids having a good time.",

          "Just go and spend all the day inside. With children or without. Amazing",

          "Lots of lovely shops and restaurants. Apparently some nice Schnapps tasting room too but it was closed for the holiday. I picked up some local art, chocolates, and ate lunch near here. It was a nice day.",

It is officially named Land Salzburg, colloquially Salzburgerland, to distinguish it from its eponymous capital Salzburg city and as such is the only state to be named after its capital. By its centuries-long history as an independent Prince-Bishopric, Salzburg's tradition differs from the other Austrian lands.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nSalzburg state stretches along its primary river, the Salzach running from the Central Eastern Alps in the south \u2013 reaching a height of 3,657 metres (11,998 ft) at the mountain Gro\u00dfvenediger \u2013 down into the Alpine foothills in the north, with an area of 7,156 km2 (2,763 sq mi).

It is surrounded by the Austrian lands of Upper Austria in the northeast, by Styria in the east, by Carinthia in the south as well as by Tyrol, South Tyrol (Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol, Italy) and East Tyrol in the southwest. With 529,085 inhabitants, it is one of the country's smaller states in terms of population.\nRunning through the south are the main ranges of the Alpine divide (incl. the Hohe Tauern mountains) with numerous three-thousanders. The Dachstein massif and the Berchtesgaden Alps ranges of the Northern Limestone Alps border Salzburg Land to the east and north.\n\n\n=== Regions ===\nThe state is traditionally subdivided in five major regions (Gaue), congruent with its political districts (Bezirke, see administrative divisions).\n\nIn the northern part:\nFlachgau (Salzburg city and environs), the flat (German: flach) Salzburg Basin around the confluence of Salzach and Saalach, stretching from the slopes of the Salzkammergut Mountains in the east to the Untersberg massif and the Chiemgau Alps in the west.\nTennengau (district capital Hallein), named after the Tennen Mountains, including the broad Salzach Valley south of Salzburg and the surrounding ranges of the Limestone Alps.\nThe southern, mountainous (colloquially Innergebirg) part is divided into:\nPinzgau (Zell am See) in the southwest,\nPongau (Sankt Johann im Pongau) on Salzach and Enns, and\nLungau (Tamsweg) in the southeast, separated by the Niedere Tauern range.\n\n\n=== Major cities and towns ===\nSalzburg municipalities with town privileges:\n\nWals-Siezenheim, a common municipality with about 12,000 inhabitants, is known as 'Austria's largest village'.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSalt has played an important role in the region's development; Salzburg means \"salt castle\".\n\n\n=== Salzburg as an independent state ===\nIndependence from Bavaria was secured in the late 14th century. The Archbishopric of Salzburg was an independent prince-bishopric and State of the Holy Roman Empire until German Mediatisation in 1803.\n\n\n=== Electorate of Salzburg ===\nThe territory was secularized and, as the Electorate of Salzburg, given as compensation to Ferdinand III, former Grand Duke of Tuscany, the brother of Emperor Francis II.\n\n\n=== The end of the independence ===\nFollowing the Austrian defeat at Austerlitz in 1805, Salzburg was annexed by Austria as compensation for the loss of Tyrol to the Kingdom of Bavaria, and Ferdinand was transferred to the Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg.\n\n\n=== Bavarian Salzburg ===\nAfter Austria's defeat in 1809, the province was handed over to Bavaria in 1810.\n\n\n=== The country divided between Bavaria and Austria ===\nIn 1816, following the defeat of Napoleon and the provision of adequate compensation to Bavaria at the Congress of Vienna, it was returned to Austria with the exception of the north-western Rupertiwinkel which remained Bavarian. The Salzburger Land was administered as the department of Salzach from Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. In 1849 the Duchy of Salzburg was established as a crown land of the Austrian Empire and, after 1866, Austria-Hungary.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nSalzburg participated in World War I, as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 49,000 Salzburgers were called to arms, of whom 6,000 were killed.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I Austrian Republics ===\nIn 1918 after World War I, the Duchy of Salzburg was dissolved and replaced with the State of Salzburg, as a component part initially of German Austria and subsequently of the First Republic of Austria, the separate state which was mandated by the Allied powers. (However, in the November Plebiscite 99% of Salzburgers voted in favor of union with Germany.)\n\n\n=== Salzburg in Germany ===\nAfter the plebiscite of 1938, Salzburg state and all the territory of Austria was annexed to the Third Reich.\n\n\n=== American control ===\nAfter the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, the Allies occupied the territory of Austria, being recognized as an independent territory under their rule. Salzburg was occupied by the United States.\n\n\n=== Salzburg as an Austrian State ===\nIn 1955 Austria was again declared independent of the Allies and Salzburg was once again one of the reconstituted federal states of the second Republic Austria.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nSalzburg adopted its current state constitution in 1999. The state government (Landesregierung) is headed by a Landeshauptmann (governor), who is elected by a majority in the Landtag parliament. State elections are held every five years.\nAfter World War II, most state governments were led by the conservative Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP). The \u00d6VP politician Josef Klaus (1910-2001), later Chancellor of Austria, served as Landeshauptmann from 1949 to 1961. In 2004 Gabi Burgstaller became the first Social Democratic (and first female) Salzburg governor.\n\nThe last results, in April 2018 (compared to 2013) were:\n\nThe elected Salzburg Landeshauptmann is Wilfried Haslauer (\u00d6VP), chairing a coalition government of \u00d6VP, Greens and NEOS ministers (Landesr\u00e4te). The current president (speaker) of the Salzburg Landtag is his party fellow Brigitta Pallauf.\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\n\n==== Landeshauptmann Wilfried Haslauer (\u00d6VP) ====\nEconomy\nTourism\nEmployment market\nMunicipality administration\nEducation\nInternal affairs\nFire departments\nPublic safety\nGovernor's office\nEuropean affairs.\n\n\n==== 1st Deputy Astrid R\u00f6ssler (Greens) ====\nConservation\nEnvironmentalism\nWater protection\nTrade\nRegional development\nBuilding law.\n\n\n==== 2nd Deputy Christian St\u00f6ckl (\u00d6VP) ====\nFinance\nState properties and interests\nPublic health and hospitals.\n\n\n==== Landesr\u00e4te ====\nHans Mayr (TS): Transport, infrastructure, housing\nMartina Berthold (Greens): Childcare, adult education, universities, research, science, youth, family affairs, intergenerational relationships, desegregation, migration, sports, women's affairs, equal opportunities\nJosef Schwaiger (\u00d6VP): Agriculture, forestry, water management, energy, personnel management\nHeinrich Schellhorn (Greens): Social policy, care nursing, culture, folk culture, museums.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe State of Salzburg comprises six districts, known as Bezirke or vernacularly Gaue:\n\nHallein District (Tennengau region)\nSt. Johann im Pongau District (Pongau region)\nSalzburg-Umgebung District (Salzburg environs) (Flachgau region)\nTamsweg District (Lungau region)\nZell am See District (Pinzgau region)Salzburg city is its own administrative district.\n\n\n=== Municipalities ===\nThe state is divided into 119 municipalities, including Salzburg city. 11 of them have city status (St\u00e4dte), 24 are market towns (Marktgemeinden) and the other 84 are simple municipalities (Gemeinden).

          "Good to see some of the artefacts. You pick up the general history of Salzburg as you see the sights, so the detail offered in the museum was not really where we were at. If it's raining, it's a good way to kill a couple of hours, but we didn't spend long. Entrance included",
          "I thought the audio guide and the displays gave me a lot of information about Salzburg. Some of the rooms were really beautiful as well. Good for an hour or two if you have the time.",

          "As far as museums go, this was interesting, but really nothing special. Lots of rooms, kind of a disjointed display. Some rooms had air conditioning, but most did not and they were a bit warm on a summer day. The staff was friendly and helpful.",
          "At first I thought this was going to be a lightweight collection, but the longer I stayed the more impressed I became. Their local history sections were well documented, easy to understand, and visually attractive. It's well worth the 7 euro entrance fee!",

          "Interesting museum. Comparing with other European big museums - it is nor the same level, but it's worth a visit",
          "This museum is extremely comprehensive and rather overwhelming. I might have missed folding chairs but I didn't see any and places to sit down to look at exhibits are limited. There is an audio guide but sometimes it didn't seem to gel with what was on the screen.",
          "It isn't a great museum, small hardly any exhibits. unless you really like musical instruments i would pass on the visit.",
          "Very enjoyable and relaxing. Spent a few hours looking. Some of the exhibits I didn't really get. The makeup room, the what appears to be a advertising room. I was really surprised that it had nothing about World War One or World War Two. Maybe I missed it. I guess it's a music",
          "I visited this museum near the beginning of my four-day visit, and am very glad to have started here. It provides a great introduction to the history of the town, including its economic growth and cultural history. Unfortunately, only one gallery was open during my visit, but",

          "There are ancient Roman walls with frescoes, the Roman pottery and many more artifacts to view. This museum is located conviently to your exit from the funicular (head to your right across the plaza) and exit into the plaza with the Mozart statue. If you have time also visit",
          "The exhibitions seemed not to have changed since I was here last, except for the piano stuff, which is a shame, since most of the stuff shouldn't be permanent. It is an interesting museum though, if you know Salzburg a bit. You might want to skip it the first time you're in",
          "They had a few different things in there- some art and an exhibition on pianos. Other than that it was nothing too spectacular",
          "Went here to get an idea of the Old Salzburg and was not disappointing. Three floors over a large exhibition area, a mix of standard exhibitions, interactive and more modern presentation styles. While we were there, there was an exhibition about Austria in WW1 - fascinating and",

          "This was a great choice, with free audio guides in English, and special things for the kids to look for in the various rooms. That kept them engaged -- they felt like they were on a treasure hunt. And we were able to enjoy the very nice collection.",
          "This is a small museum and due to a lack of time, the only one I got to see in my day here. However, I thought they had carefully crafted exhibitions beyond the regular efforts other places usually take. There was an Ars Sacra exhibit that was okey (I'm not a fan of religious",

          "We went in to see the painted panorama, but found out that it had been replaced with a temporary (and prolonged) exhibition on the von Trapp family, which was somewhat of a rip-off, especially as the BBC had shown the real story in a documentary earlier this year and VT story",

        "wiki": "Salzburg (Austrian: [\u02c8saltsb\u028a\u0281k]; German: [\u02c8zaltsb\u028a\u0281k] (listen);  literally \"Salt Fortress\"; Bavarian: Soizburg) is the capital city of the State of Salzburg and with 155,031 inhabitants, it is the fourth-largest city in Austria.\nThe town is located on the site of the former Roman settlement of Iuvavum. Salzburg was founded as an episcopal see in 696 and became a seat of the archbishop in 798. Its main sources of income were salt extraction and trade and, at times, gold mining. The fortress of Hohensalzburg, one of the largest medieval fortresses in Europe, dates from the 11th century. In the 17th century, Salzburg became a centre of the Counter-Reformation, where monasteries and numerous Baroque churches were built.\nSalzburg's historic centre (German: Altstadt) is thus renowned for its Baroque architecture and is one of the best-preserved city centres north of the Alps, with 27 churches. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The city has three universities and a large population of students. Tourists also visit Salzburg to tour the historic centre and the scenic Alpine surroundings. Salzburg was the birthplace of the 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Because of its history, culture, and attractions, Salzburg has been labeled Austria's \"most inspiring city.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity to the High Middle Ages ===\nTraces of human settlements have been found in the area, dating to the Neolithic Age. The first settlements in Salzburg continuous with the present were apparently by the Celts around the 5th century BC.\nAround 15 BC the Roman Empire merged the settlements into one city. At this time, the city was called \"Juvavum\" and was awarded the status of a Roman municipium in 45 AD. Juvavum developed into an important town of the Roman province of Noricum. After the Norican frontier's collapse, Juvavum declined so sharply that by the late 7th century it nearly became a ruin.The Life of Saint Rupert credits the 8th-century saint with the city's rebirth. When Theodo of Bavaria asked Rupert to become bishop c. 700, Rupert reconnoitered the river for the site of his basilica. Rupert chose Juvavum, ordained priests, and annexed the manor of Piding. Rupert named the city \"Salzburg\". He travelled to evangelise among pagans.\nThe name Salzburg means \"Salt Castle\" (Latin: Salis Burgium). The name derives from the barges carrying salt on the River Salzach, which were subject to a toll in the 8th century as was customary for many communities and cities on European rivers. Hohensalzburg Fortress, the city's fortress, was built in 1077 by Archbishop Gebhard, who made it his residence. It was greatly expanded during the following centuries.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\nIndependence from Bavaria was secured in the late 14th century. Salzburg was the seat of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, a prince-bishopric of the Holy Roman Empire. As the Reformation movement gained steam, riots broke out among peasants in the areas in and around Salzburg. The city was occupied during the German Peasants' War, and the Archbishop had to flee to the safety of the fortress. It was besieged for three months in 1525.\nEventually, tensions were quelled, and the city's independence led to an increase in wealth and prosperity, culminating in the late 16th to 18th centuries under the Prince Archbishops Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau, Markus Sittikus, and Paris Lodron. It was in the 17th century that Italian architects (and Austrians who had studied the Baroque style) rebuilt the city centre as it is today along with many palaces.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\n\n==== Religious conflict ====\n\nOn 31 October 1731, the 214th anniversary of the 95 Theses, Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian signed an Edict of Expulsion, the Emigrationspatent, directing all Protestant citizens to recant their non-Catholic beliefs. 21,475 citizens refused to recant their beliefs and were expelled from Salzburg. Most of them accepted an offer by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, travelling the length and breadth of Germany to their new homes in East Prussia. The rest settled in other Protestant states in Europe and the British colonies in America.\n\n\n==== Illuminism ====\nIn 1772\u20131803, under archbishop Hieronymus Graf von Colloredo, Salzburg was a centre of late Illuminism. Colloredo is known for being one of the main employers of Mozart. He often had several arguments with Mozart he dismissed him by  saying, \u201cSoll er doch gehen, ich brauche ihn night!\u201d (He should just go then; I don\u2019t need him!)  Mozart would leave Salzburg for Vienna in 1781 with his family including his father Leopold staying back as he and Colloredo had a close relationship.\n\n\n=== Electorate of Salzburg ===\nIn 1803, the archbishopric was secularised by Emperor Napoleon; he transferred the territory to Ferdinando III of Tuscany, former Grand Duke of Tuscany, as the Electorate of Salzburg.\n\n\n=== Austrian annexation of Salzburg ===\nIn 1805, Salzburg was annexed to the Austrian Empire, along with the Berchtesgaden Provostry.\n\n\n=== Salzburg under Bavarian rule ===\nIn 1809, the territory of Salzburg was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria after Austria's defeat at Wagram.\n\n\n=== Division of Salzburg and annexation by Austria and Bavaria ===\nAfter the Congress of Vienna with the Treaty of Munich (1816), Salzburg was definitively returned to Austria, but without Rupertigau and Berchtesgaden, which remained with Bavaria. Salzburg was integrated into the Province of Salzach and Salzburgerland was ruled from Linz.In 1850, Salzburg's status was restored as the capital of the Duchy of Salzburg, a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The city became part of Austria-Hungary in 1866 as the capital of a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The nostalgia of the Romantic Era led to increased tourism. In 1892, a funicular was installed to facilitate tourism to Hohensalzburg Fortress\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n\n==== First Republic ====\nFollowing World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Salzburg, as the capital of one of the Austro-Hungarian territories, became part of the new German Austria. In 1918, it represented the residual German-speaking territories of the Austrian heartlands. This was replaced by the First Austrian Republic in 1919, after the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919).\n\n\n==== Annexation by the Third Reich ====\n\nThe Anschluss (the occupation and annexation of Austria, including Salzburg, into the Third Reich) took place on 12 March 1938, one day before a scheduled referendum on Austria's independence. German troops moved into the city. Political opponents, Jewish citizens and other minorities were subsequently arrested and deported to concentration camps. The synagogue was destroyed. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union, several POW camps for prisoners from the Soviet Union and other enemy nations were organized in the city.\nDuring the Nazi occupation, a Romani camp was built in Salzburg-Maxglan. It was an Arbeitserziehungslager (work 'education' camp), which provided slave labour to local industry. It also operated as a Zwischenlager (transit camp), holding Roma before their deportation to German camps or ghettos in German-occupied territories in eastern Europe.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nAllied bombing destroyed 7,600 houses and killed 550 inhabitants. Fifteen air strikes destroyed 46 percent of the city's buildings, especially those around Salzburg railway station. Although the town's bridges and the dome of the cathedral were destroyed, much of its Baroque architecture remained intact. As a result, Salzburg is one of the few remaining examples of a town of its style. American troops entered the city on 5 May 1945 and it became the centre of the American-occupied area in Austria.  Several displaced persons camps were established in Salzburg\u2014among them Riedenburg, Camp Herzl (Franz-Josefs-Kaserne), Camp M\u00fclln, Bet Bialik, Bet Trumpeldor, and New Palestine.\n\n\n==== Present day ====\nAfter World War II, Salzburg became the capital city of the Federal State of Salzburg (Land Salzburg). On 27 January 2006, the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all 35 churches of Salzburg rang their bells after 8:00 p.m. (local time) to celebrate the occasion. Major celebrations took place throughout the year.\nAs of 2017 Salzburg had a GDP per capita of \u20ac46,100, which was greater than the average for Austria and for most European countries.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSalzburg is on the banks of the River Salzach, at the northern boundary of the Alps. The mountains to Salzburg's south contrast with the rolling plains to the north. The closest alpine peak, the 1,972\u2011metre-high Untersberg, is less than 16 kilometres (10 miles) from the city centre. The Altstadt, or \"old town\", is dominated by its baroque towers and churches and the massive Hohensalzburg Fortress. This area is flanked by two smaller hills, the M\u00f6nchsberg and Kapuzinerberg, which offer green relief within the city.  Salzburg is approximately 150 km (93 mi) east of Munich, 281 km (175 mi) northwest of Ljubljana, Slovenia, and 300 km (186 mi) west of Vienna. Salzburg has about the same latitude of Seattle.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSalzburg is part of the temperate zone. The K\u00f6ppen climate classification specifies the climate as a humid continental climate (Dfb), however, with the \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm for the coldest month, Salzburg can be classified as having four-season oceanic climate with significant temperature differences between seasons. Due to the location at the northern rim of the Alps, the amount of precipitation is comparatively high, mainly in the summer months. The specific drizzle is called Schn\u00fcrlregen in the local dialect. In winter and spring, pronounced foehn winds regularly occur.\n\n\n== Population ==\nIn 2018, 31% of the total population is foreign born according to Statistik Austria.\nSalzburg's official population significantly increased in 1935 when the city absorbed adjacent municipalities. After World War II, numerous refugees found a new home in the city. New residential space was constructed for American soldiers of the postwar occupation, and could be used for refugees when they left. Around 1950, Salzburg passed the mark of 100,000 citizens, and in 2016, it reached the mark of 150,000 citizens.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Romanesque and Gothic ===\nThe Romanesque and Gothic churches, the monasteries and the early carcass houses dominated the medieval city for a long time. The Cathedral of Archbishop Conrad of Wittelsbach was the largest basilica north of the Alps. The choir of the Franciscan Church, construction was begun by Hans von Burghausen and completed by Stephan Krumenauer, is one of the most prestigious religious gothic constructions of southern Germany. At the end of the Gothic era the Collegiate church \"Nonnberg\", Margaret Chapel in St. Peter's Cemetery, the St. George's Chapel and the stately halls of the \"Hoher Stock\" in Hohensalzburg Fortress were constructed.\n\n\n=== Renaissance and baroque ===\nInspired by Vincenzo Scamozzi, Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau began to transform the medieval town to the architectural ideals of the late Renaissance. Plans for a massive cathedral by Scamozzi failed to materialize upon the fall of the archbishop. A second cathedral planned by Santino Solari rose as the first early Baroque church in Salzburg. It served as an example for many other churches in Southern Germany and Austria. Markus Sittikus and Paris von Lodron continued to rebuild the city with major projects such as Hellbrunn Palace, the prince archbishop's residence, the university buildings, fortifications, and many other buildings. Giovanni Antonio Daria managed by order of Prince Archbishop Guido von Thun the construction of the residential well. Giovanni Gaspare Zuccalli, by order of the same archbishop, created the Erhard and the Kajetan church in the south of the town. The city's redesign was completed with buildings designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, donated by Prince Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun.\nAfter the era of Ernst von Thun, the city's expansion came to a halt, which is the reason why there are no churches built in the Rococo style. Sigismund von Schrattenbach continued with the construction of \"Sigmundstor\" and the statue of holy Maria on the cathedral square. With the fall and division of the former \"F\u00fcrsterzbistum Salzburg\" (Archbishopric) to Upper Austria, Bavaria (Rupertigau) and Tyrol (Zillertal Matrei) began a long period of urban stagnancy. This era didn't end before the period of promoterism (Gr\u00fcnderzeit) brought new life into urban development. The builder dynasty Jakob Ceconi and Carl Freiherr von Schwarz filled major positions in shaping the city in this era.\n\n\n=== Classical modernism and post-war modernism ===\nBuildings of classical modernism and in particular the post-war modernism are frequently encountered in Salzburg. Examples are the Zahnwurzen house (a house in the Linzergasse 22 in the right center of the old town), the \"Lepi\" (a public baths in Leopoldskron) (built 1964) and the original 1957 constructed congress centre of Salzburg, which was replaced by a new building in 2001. An important and famous example of architecture of this era is the 1960 opening of the Gro\u00dfes Festspielhaus by Clemens Holzmeister.\n\n\n=== Contemporary architecture ===\nAdding contemporary architecture to Salzburg's old town without risking its UNESCO World Heritage status is problematic. Nevertheless, some new structures have been added: the Mozarteum at the Baroque Mirabell Garden (Architecture Robert Rechenauer), the 2001 Congress House (Architecture: Freemasons), the 2011 Unipark Nonntal (Architecture: Storch Ehlers Partners), the 2001 \"Makartsteg\" bridge (Architecture: HALLE1), and the \"Residential and Studio House\" of the architects Christine and Horst Lechner in the middle of Salzburg's old town (winner of the architecture award of Salzburg 2010). Other examples of contemporary architecture lie outside the old town: the Faculty of Science building (Universit\u00e4t Salzburg \u2013 Architecture Willhelm Holzbauer) built on the edge of free green space, the blob architecture of Red Bull Hangar\u20117 (Architecture: Volkmar Burgstaller) at Salzburg Airport, home to Dietrich Mateschitz's Flying Bulls and the Europark Shopping Centre. (Architecture: Massimiliano Fuksas)\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nSalzburg has twenty-four urban districts and three extra-urban populations.\nUrban districts (Stadtteile):\n\nExtra-urban populations (Landschaftsr\u00e4ume):\n\nGaisberg\nHellbrunn\nHeuberg\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nSalzburg is a tourist favourite, with the number of visitors outnumbering locals by a large margin in peak times.

          "The Residenzgalerie is the old residence of the Prince Bishop of Salzburg. It is one of the included museums in the DomQuartier and was our families favorite. You get to see the many meeting rooms as well as the private chambers of the Prince Bishop. The art on the walls and",

          "Walking inside the Old city area during Xmas market period is surely a must. Atmosphere was excellent.",
          "this was amazing place to visit there was so much to see and walk around the buildings are incredible and the fountain centrepiece",
          "Visited the Residenzgalerie as part of the DomQuartier tour. The Staterooms are impressive whilst a bit sparse. They were some paintings and old carpets hanging on the wall but I think they removed some furniture and covered some paintings. Parts of the Residenzgalerie were",
          "it is located in the old town near the mozart square. nothing exceptional at this gallery. you get some old and new stuffs but nothing much.",
          "The state rooms are large and very interesting, but the audio guide was very slow and boring. If you\u2019re in Salzburg for the day, I suggest skipping this one.",
          "Located at the Residenzplats, where you have also the \u201cResidenzbrunnen\u201d you h\u00e1 ve the \u201cResidenzgalerie Salzburg\u201d who was founded in the year 1923. On the one hand, the museum was intended to replace the archbishop's art collections that had been lost in the early 19th century,",
          "You get the Old Europe scene here and can almost step back in time when you visit here. Good time investment.",
          "Stunning architecture and views. The place is huge and provides brilliant photo opportunities. There are horse and carriage rides available.",
          "The Residenz Fountain (with horses) is the largest Baroque fountain in the world and was used in the movie \"The Sound of Music.\" Julie Andrews splashes back at the horses. It is amazing just beiong there. Even without the movie or Mozart, the square is old, historic, full of",
          "While the modern museum section is open, the residential section with the attached Dom Quartier is not. I wasn't particularly interested in the more modern exhibits, but the portions on the city history and artifacts were quite well done. My favorite section was the musical",
          "Great museum with lots of Flemish art, as well. I would definitely recommend taking your time, if you like art.",
          "Not only do you get to see how the prince-bishops lived but the amount of art, relics, treasures, and religious items is almost beyond belief. It's a great way to spend a rainy day in Salzburg. Audio in various languages is a necessity unless you're with a tour guide.",
          "Residenzgalerie and Domquartier together gives a 2+ hours of amazing experience. And yes, it's much more than just a museum. Lots of rooms, places to see here.",
          "A great smaller museum, with beautiful palace rooms, incredible history. We toured with a private guide (see seperate review) which made our experience even better! Went on a Sunday and surprisingly few crowds (weather was sunny, not hot out so many people at parks). Only takes",

          "It is part of the DomQuartier museum. There are a series of large, sumptuous, wonderfully decorated rooms - the State Rooms, the place where used to live the former Salzburg leaders hundreds of years ago. Then there is a gallery of art that includes a lot of paintings from the",
          "The Residenzgalerie Salzburg is immense, but in all of the opulent rooms and long hallways there is no real masterpiece of Southern European Art. Not even the architecture is particularly impressive, but the size does give one an idea of how powerful the Church was in",
          "We visited this large museum with our Salzburg cards for free. Inside the Domquartier you can see a large variety of church pieces and relics is on display, but also many paintings. Durring your visit, you will walk trough beautiful rooms, each with their own story and purpose,",
          "Residenzgalerie Salzburg is the royal house at display. very nice architecture with beautiful light fixture.",
          "If your going to Salzburg, its a must see attraction, sort of, however, I\u2019m really at a lost for all attractions in Salzburg. Its a must see if your there, but i wouldn't go Salzburg, to specifically visit this site.",
          "This exclusive state-owned Art Gallery shows works by Rembrandt, Saraceni, Hieronymus, etc. However, the most important stock of paintings was purchased between 1956 and 1991 from the former Czernin Collection in Vienna. A guide is highly recommended.",
          "The audio guided tour around the whole complex is extremely well organised n informative, one of the best we experienced in many European cities we have visited. Each of the items not mentioned in the audio guide has English explication on the wall next to German, a welcome",
          "We toured the Residenz and Domquartier while there was a rain storm. We were so glad we did. At the time we went there was hardly anyone there. So beautiful and interesting and well worth the time taken to tour the buidlings.",
          "The first thing to say is this is really a complex of museums starting with the state rooms of the prince archbishops and finishing with the museum of St Peter\u2019s Abbey, the oldest Benedictine monastery in the German speaking world. Haydn and Mozart had strong associations with",
          "We visited the Residence with our combination ticket, so it was a very good value. We used the audio guides but walked at a steady pace throughout. It still took over an hour. No photos were allowed.",
          "The palace rooms are an art work on their own and are an ideal setting for showcasing the art pieces. The Magnificent Hall has breathtaking ceiling frescoes and wall decorations. A wide selection of European art from the 1500s to the 1800s are displayed. All the major names",
          "This was a very nice walkthrough the residence, the cathedral and the art museum. It says that you can start an hour before closing but that's just not enough time and they push you out the door when it's closing time even if you aren't done. Plan for 1 1/2 hours to listen to",
          "Really interesting and good value for money, especially if you visit as part of the Dom Quarter ticket (\u20ac12 or free with the SalzburgCard). The Residenz was home to the Salzburg prince-archbishops from the 12th century. It comprises the Staterooms and the Gallery. Although not",
          "We arrived in Salzburg on a Sunday, when shops are closed, but the Dom Quatier museum was not. Taking a chance, we walled in. The audioguide was very informative & the State Rooms were interesting. Not as opulent as many European \"State Rooms,\" but still enjoyable. The",

          "The gallery -- and I am assuming the painting gallery here -- is a collection of the Archbishop. Sounds dumb to say it that way, but that's all it is. He was a minor figure, related to the Hapsburgs, and he had some paintings. I wouldn't recommend it as a destination. More",

          "Nice place to visit using your salzburg card. A combination of cathedral museum and residence. Nice surprise was access to a section of the second level of the cathedral.",

          "What a place to spend a lovely day of your vacation in Salzburg ! Everything is exquisite, enchanting and it brings you back to a romantic era. And everything is so clean and well kept. Don't hesitate ... go and enjoy the balcony view !",

          "Very interesting walking through all the room and seeing the objects and paintings that people had when they actually lived there.",
          "Walk with a pride just like prince that is what i feel in the residenzgalerie salzburg. Back in the year where every people talk with a manner. I wish i can back here someday.",
          "We went in to the Domquatier via the cathedral using our Salzberg card ( which is great and well worth the price) but it was later on in the afternoon so we didn't have time to see everything. Having used our cards once we then couldn't re-enter for the other bits we missed in",
          "A remarkable site with so many beautiful antiquities. Take the self guided audio tour through each room and into the Dom church and museum. A must for Salzburg",
          "Great audio guide for the gallery which takes you through a large collection of art work. The gallery itself is the connected to the cathedral via an outdoor terrace that overlooks two of the nearby squares. You can then view the collection of religious artifacts held by the",
          "Residenzgalerie Salzburg museum has a fantastic collection of Baroque style paintings and art. They have a wide range of painitings from Dutch to French to Italian paintings. There were Rembrandt's paintings here which was the highlight for us. To our surprise the museumwas",
          "Really, I went to Salzburg to see the Christmas markets, I stayed for the museums. This place is a connected series of spaces, an art gallery, then a balcony overlooking the squares, then galleries on each side of the cathedral's naves, then more galleries and finally some of",
          "Pretty remarkable to see how the rich people from our past lived in these days. It's also painful to see how rich they were, because that period were also a lot of poor people. However, it's amazing to see!!! definitely something to go check out!!",
          "Recently,I returned to this fine,cozy art museum after 33 years,the last time I was in Salzburg.I enjoyed it even more now.I appreciated its excellent collection of Flemish and Dutch paintings as well as its small group of French and Italian paintings.Personal favorites that day",
          "Excellent audio guide. Takes at least a couple of hours to go round. This was the best thing to see in Salzburg. The place is huge and stuffed full of treasures. It connects with the galleries in the Dom. Really puts the history of Salzburg into perspective so would be a good",
          "Visiting the Residenz, or prince-archbishop\u2019s palace, was the best thing we did during our day in Salzburg. It cost us \u20ac10 as seniors which included an audio guide of the state rooms, art gallery, terrace with a view over the Residenzplatz, the Dom balcony & the museum. You can",
          "The Still life oil paintings brought me to my knees. I will return. Really old objects, exquisitely on display. One of my favorite Art places so far on this planet!",
          "You need time to visit this but well worth it. Not crowded and chairs in almost every room. Windows were open so not hot like other museums. Bathrooms along the way.",
          "There you can spend easily a long period of time so don't come if you're in a hurry, only come if you really have time for it. Paintings on the walls, on the ceilings, everywhere... Even the chandeliers are gorgeous. The ticket prices are normal and you can spend quality time",
          "Check out the proclivities and predilections of clerics and nobility in charge for 100s of years. Not as grand as Munich, but still interesting.",
          "worth visiting. it gives a good glimpse into the way of life during that time period and also how mozart made it big. mozart's travel experience were intriguing.",
          "It\u2019s an imposing group of buildings forming a whole which is said to have been built from 1595 onwards on prince-archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau\u2019s initiative albeit, in fact, only the present appearance can be ascribable to him inasmuch as a palace was already in the same",
          "It is a great opportunity to see this building from inside and get an idea of how the royals used to live. If you like history, then you will need a good amount of time to go through all the rooms and the gallaries.",
          "We visited the museum but were disappointed that the state rooms were closed, the rest of the museum and galleries were ok but could not really compensate. The museum was also very cold, the room attendants were well wrapped up.",
          "This is an amazing building, very elaborate and full of history. The pictures speak for themselves but not like being in the building. The room and corridors full of art, some original furniture and immaculately kept. There's an audio tour which is very good. Fascinating place,",
          "You need a lot of time and patience. Place is huge. Yes, it is museum but at the same time you will see and walk through original interiors. Original rooms, paving, windows, doors, stucco work, frescoes pictures furniture. From time to time you will have some special views to",
          "Quite spectacular is the only way to describe the Residenz and I felt quite grateful to be able to see it. It definitely doesn't have the in-your-face opulence of Versailles, but it is well worth seeing.",
          "We attended a Gala Dinner here at the end of a conference. Food a bit so-so but they were catering for huge numbers.",
          "Home of the Archbishop, it rivals any palace. Full of art - massive paintings on the ceilings and grand staiways. Entry is \u20ac10, Free with Salzburg card. Budget 1.5 hours to see it all. Photography is prohibited in most areas.",
          "We used our Salzburg card to visit here and it was well worth it. Very quiet and serene with stunning decorations , furniture, historical information and artworks along the way . Very nice staff. Very good audio guide and information about how to use...much better than the",
          "The audio tour was very good. Since pictures were not permitted, it would have been very nice to have found some for sale at the end of the tour.",
          "The imposing courtyard and entrance to this gallery and state rooms complex are just the start of one of the most dazzling experiences you will have in Salzburg. We waited until day five of our holiday to visit and we spent a whole afternoon here. I am not a fan of audio guides,",
          "Beautiful, beautiful palace, excellent auditory guide. I am a huge Emporess Elizabeth and Franz Joseph fan so it was wonderful to see the glorious home they once shared. The grounds alone are worth the visit with the bonus of such a wonderful palace to tour. Do NOT miss this",
          "This was really good. You had a free audio guide which took you through everything really nicely- lots of information",
          "It takes about two hours to do real justice to this tour of the Residence gallery. The artefacts and paintings and halls one passes through is like walking down history. Fantastic experience.",
          "We have been to Salzburg many times, first time for this amazing tour. Seeing the Dom Residence, seeing the church from the organ loft. Do not miss this site. There is much walking and steps but very much worth every minute.",
          "As it was a cloudy and slightly wet day, we decided to visit this Palace, not really knowing what to expect. In fact there is a lot to see, both the building and various galleries with temporary exhibitions and - my favourite part - the Gallery at the back of the Cathedral which",
          "Part of the cathedral . Enter on the right 'museum' and take the audio guide to hear history dating back more than 2000 yrs. Excellent guide to assist with understanding the political and religious rulers over the centuries. Well intact museum and archbishop's royal quarters",
          "An impressive area, with a good audio guide. You need a while to see everything. Well worth a visit. The galley was a highlight, looking over the Dom from the back.",
          "Interesting 2 hrs, looking through all the multitude of rooms that stretched through various linked buildings, as well as the upper floor of the Dom. Mostly on upper floors, so good views on to the surrounding squares. The free audioguide is a must. It explains each room and",
          "This palatial building houses a number of paintings from the 16th to the 19th century. Its collection includes works by Rembrandt, Carel Fabritius, Carlo Saraceni and Hieronymus Francken II. For art lovers a visit to this collection is a must.",
          "Are you really able to understand Salzburg history after a visit in this place that is so strategical for Salzburg culture? I think that an effort should be made to present things with a cultural perspective and not just as another toouristic spot.",
          "If you just passing by Salzburg it might be not a good idea to visit this place: you really need time. In fact, there is a complex of buildings: the Archbishop's apartments \u2013the formal and real ruler of the city \u2013 the Cathedral and an art gallery. For those interested in arts,",
          "Right in the middle of old town, we used the audio tour although we only listened to part of it in most rooms. Learned a lot of interesting things and parts of it are very decorative. Worth some time.",
          "If ever an attraction was worth the money in Salzburg it's this one. The place is huge. It's a big square maze that you continue to walk around, floor after floor, seeing many beautiful rooms, artifacts, furniture, and other items. One of the floors even leads inside the balcony",
          "We loved our visit to the Residenz. Gorgeous state rooms, beautiful art, fascinating history. Audio guides in English and other languages help bring it all to life. This is the heart of Salzburg, and the visit made the complex history of the city comprehensible. Informative",
          "The prince archbishops resident is a part of DomQuartier complex. It's more than a museum, you can fell the power of the Prince Archbishops few hundreds years ago. Very nice renovation work . The museum is just a part of this big complex ( the other pars are used by the",
          "Came in at 4pm and it's listed as open until 5pm daily. Wouldn't let me in, without any explanation. The older woman just had an expression of \"tough luck boy\". Felt cheated on my 24 hour Salzburg Card.",
          "Must visit the dom. I have enjoyed a lot and experienced the history. Spend time here. The arts are awesome.",
          "Not sure why this is ranked so low on the list of the Salzburg's attractions. Audio guided tour was very interesting and took us through Archbishop's residence/apartments, cathedral, and small art gallery from the collections of various archbishops. The whole tour took about",
          "This Palace is very attractive with its stately rooms built in the Dom quarters,over 200 years of architectural & artistic work covering the periods of Renaissance,Boroque & Classical periods.This includes frescoes,paintings,clocks & ceramics items etc representing those periods",
          "A very interesting and comprehensive historical account of this building. We loved the rooms and the d\u00e9cor and the description from our audio guide. Need 3 hours to take it all in especially if you do the Dom at the same time.",
          "The visit of this palace takes you not only to the City dwelling of the arcbishops but also connects to the cathedral where you view the inside from the level of the organs. Museum is a mixture of items that could be explained better. A worthwhile visit but not too long",
          "We didn't really expect such great arts and jewels but it really worth its visit. And the most great part is that you can actually pass through the 2nd floor of catherdral",
          "Wonderful visit with access to so many superb rooms including an elevated view inside the cathedral. Audio guide was really informative. Could easily lose two hours here, but so much to see and do in Salzburg.",
          "The residence was interesting enough but if you're looking for something really ornate and artistic, stick to the Vienna palaces. What makes this most interesting are (1) the historic context--the audio guide is a must; and (2) the tour takes you around over the terrace to the",
          "Part of the Dom Quartier an excellent art museum. The decorations in the halls are beautiful. You got an insight into the old European art. This was a great idea to include this in the visit of the whole area.",
          "There's a fair bit of value going to this through the Salzburg card as you save 22 Euros. There are a lot of rooms to see but you also get a view of the Dom Quartier from the terrace.",
          "The Residenz is worth some of your time - and if you have a Salzburg Card it is free. The audio guide is of high quality. The paintings and the decor are superb (the ceilings are astonishing) as are the views from various windows. and the connected link to the CathedraL The",
          "Beautiful museum, much more than we were expecting. At first we thought we where only going to see the residence, but you see several museums. This was one of the best ways too see the cathedral, as you see it from an upper level and look down. Don't miss the oddities and",
          "If you're at all interested in Salzburg's history, this provides an excellent insight. The audio-guides are very well done, I would recommend using them. You can walk quickly through rooms you are less interested in (perhaps the numerous ante chambers), and dwell longer on parts",
          "If you have the Salzberg card, definitely check this out as it will be free. Between the residence area, paintings, and other exhibits there was a lot more to see than I expected. You can also see the upper part of the cathedral which is connected. If you want to see some",
          "We went on the audio guided Domquartier tour. We saw the magnificent State Rooms of the Residence, the Residence Gallery with beautiful European paintings from the 16th to 19th century and from the Cathedral Arches Terrace we had a nice view over Residentplatz. The tour",
          "Nice to see inside & also to get a different perspective of the cathedral from the vantage point at the back. If you've been into other Palaces around Europe you may be a little disappointed but it still gives a nice insight into life over the century's.",
          "This building was the most impressive of the sites I saw in Salzburg. There's a lot to see here - paintings, jewels and furniture and the audioguide gives a good explanation of it all. The building itself and adjoining church are impressive.",
          "we took the full tour which takes you back to the beginning of the city's history and brings you right up to date. the state rooms, museum and gallery are a wonderful reflection of this very rich and unusual bishopric and princedom. there is so much to see that you could easily",
          "There is a great art exhibition, but the highlight is the opulence of the Residenz State Rooms. Check the hours because they vary from the gallery.",
          "I saw this gallery during the visit of domquartier. It's could be very interesting. If you have a lot of time and you are interested you can understand all with audioguide. Instead if you stay in salsburg only 2 days , maybe you can give a fast sight at the gallery during the",
          "This place is huge and keeps going. They have restored it to how it was back then and some of the furniture goes back a way too. There is an audio guide which is very informative and signs on the walls. Take the time to wander through, look at the detail like door hinges and",
          "Few people, quiet, can rest for a while, starting from there connected to the other part of the Domquartier with stairs, terrace, cloisters, corridors and finally you realize that you have come back to the Residenz.",
          "The Residenzgalerie is a part of DomQuartier Salzburg, located in the Old Town and is included in the admission price. Spread out over several rooms you can see fine examples of European painting from the 16th - 19th. The works are nicely displayed and give insights into Baroque",
          "We liked the self paced tour with the hand held audio devices. We learnt about the Archbishops residence and lifestyle. Was interesting and is worth the visit.",
          "This attraction has recently been renovated. The self-guide audio commentary (barring some bizarre mistranslations and mispronounced words) gave a fascinating insight into the sheer opulence and splendour enjoyed by the Archbishops and senior clergy in times gone by. Sumptuous",
          "Buy a ticket for the entire Dom Quarter (9.50 euros) and be prepared to be wowed for several hours. The included self-guided audio tour is excellent. You see not only the magnificent state rooms of Salzburg's prince archbishops with beautiful art, furniture, stucco work and",
          "Must see. Buy a ticket for the entire Dom quarter. Entry to the residenz gallery is a part of what you get to see on the ticket. The art collection is superb.",
          "This is well worth your time. It will take a few hours to see and helps with the overall understanding of Salzburg history. There are great views of the city center as you cross from the residence to the church area.",
          "We visited here on our first day in Saltzburg and it was a good choice except for the steps. My husband was having problems with his knee and this made things difficult for him. Not sure if there is a lift as we didn't come across one at all. Overall, though it was excellent",
          "The entire Residenz tour which includes the cathedral, the Dom, is very large and the audio tour can be very long. Don't be embarrassed to skip some of the extra segments which go into great detail. Plan on 2+ hours. The only downside is the audio guide stops after the organ",
          "Fascinating walking through and admiring the lavish decorations and expensive furniture. Please note you are not allowed to take photos. The journey starts through the religious part of the building showing crosses and other religious stuff. it then gets more interesting as you",
          "The Residenzgalerie tickets includes a number of different parts- from the historic residence, state rooms, art gallery and cathedral. It also had a balcony with a great view of the city centre. Exhibits were very well designed and the audio tour was informative (but you can",
          "It was the highlight in my recent visit in Salzburg. The Residenz has so many things to see, that can be a little bit overwhelming. The audio guide tells you a little bit of history for each one of the rooms but it takes 3 long minutes each time you press the button. If you do",

          "Yes, we got a Salzburg card, they are so worth it. Managed to visit the State rooms on our last day as it had been closed for functions previously and it was definitely worth it. The audioguide was great and, as it is tucked away, there were very few visitors when we went. The",

          "The Residenz as the official state rooms of the Salzburg prince archbishops, gives an insight into the history of the place. Some facts I didn't know plus an unusual scultpure exhibit. The opulence of the original rooms is definitely interesting.",
          "Picture galleries are not a favourite of mine but this is so much more. Armed with my audio guide I set off to explore this interesting building. From room to room I wandered lead by the helpful commentary. History, yes there was a lot of it but it's not dry and dusty and there",
          "Disappointingly, the picture gallery was closed when we visited Salzburg. Oh well, the staterooms it was. An audio guide is a must to completely appreciate the staterooms. While they are quite awe-inspiring in themselves, without the audio guide, a big part of the story would",

          "We visited the Residenz in November because we noticed that admission (including a good audio guide) was free with a Salzburg card, and we seemed to be the only people in the rooms for the majority of our time there. These official state rooms of the prince archbishops are",
          "This was an unexpected delight. We have been to Salzburg many times and we are always looking for someplace we haven't visited. This was a nice relaxing, enjoyable way to see some of the preserved history of the area. We want to go back on our next visit to Salzburg.",
          "The Residenz is the official state rooms of the Salzburg prince archbishops. The building is beautiful and the contents are mostly authetic. The audio guide was very good (not too long winded like some others we used while in Salzburg). Was definitely worth spending time on.",
          "It is not far from the tourist information centre. The fee was 9 euros and the audio guide was included. The staterooms were impressive especially the ceilings with gold leaves, paintings and engravings. The walls were covered with silk. There were also some unique clocks.",
          "I wasn't sure that this palace would live up to some of the others we've been to in Europe, but this one turned out to be great. The rooms are wonderfully decorated and give you a feel for 'old' Salzburg. And, if you are a history buff, there's lot's of historical significance",
          "I enjoyed this tour very much, as the audio guide was very informative. Three flights of stairs to climb before you commence the tour..but well worth it if you can manage them. Monday the gallery is not open, this to me was disappointing. The state apartments are a must see",

          "The advertising slogan is quite justified. The 'museum' combines beautiful palace / residence rooms, more typical museum pieces, an outdoor terrace with nice old town views and elevated views from inside the cathedral. All in all this was far and away the best attraction in",

          "I paid 34\u20ac for a 48 hour Salzburg Card, and the entry into the DomQuartier alone costs 13\u20ac without the card. Therefore if you are visiting the DomQuartier and are interested in two more museums, I highly recommend that you buy a salzburg card. I arrived at 4pm, which was the",

          "this is amazing the work inside the building is fantastic every thing was breath taking we both said we are pleased to visit and it is a must to visit",
          "Unlike museums in Vienna which are well-organised, with the handicapped and those with baby strollers in mind, the same can hardly be said about Salzburg. Especially its crown jewel, the DomQuartier. We were not given much info at the ticket counter other than go till the end",
          "Wonderful on the 'Round Tour' you get, the palace, church, art, views. Well set out displays and not boring for kids! Free with the Salzburg Card",
          "Included in Salzburg card. The self guided audio tour was great and helped add more relevance to the beautiful rooms and a hint of the history. The art section was well signed in both German and English. We only made it to the Dom by 4:45 and were told we needed to go back to",

          "At 13 Euro a person this was an excellent bargain, and this includes the audio guide, which I usually pass on but it was pretty good. You essentially get access to what I'd almost consider several separate museums. First, you walk through perhaps a dozen rooms that are",
          "You can say that among his numerous churches, that in Salzburg the cathedral is Salzburg\u2019s most important sacred building. You can see the Cathedral as the centerpiece of Salzburg.

          "Some amazing portraits including a Rembrandt before walking through different galleries and staring in awe at the priceless church treasures as well as the organ pit of the Cathedral itself. Allow 1-2 hours.",
          "The visit to the DomQuartier museum was excellent. To see such an amazing restoration and collection of art and furnishing. Visited many many rooms. Audio guide was very good as well. Part of the tour took you into the upper levels of the Salzburg cathedral with the area of the",

          "This is huge, really huge. And it's in cathedral building itself, so you get to see cathedral from top as well. Keep a good 2 hours for this, as they have an amazing collection of artifacts. In between , you even get rooftop view of what's outside. Lockers are available for",
          "There are some wonderful art work in the museum, not much for state rooms some artifacts from the church. It is an alright place, but the areas around are much better than the Dom.",
          "I didn't think I'd spend much time in museums on this trip, but I knew I wanted to see the inside of the cathedral from the organ loft -- and the only way to get there is with the Dom Quartier pass. Much to my surprise, I enjoyed the meandering path through the museum spaces,",
          "If you\u2019re looking for an in-depth tour of the cathedral and its treasures and the royal apartments and art collection, this is a worthwhile tour. The audio guide is a must to navigate through all of the buildings and their exhibits. You\u2019ll need to dedicate two or three hours",
          "We visited the DomQuarter the other day. At the start of the tour we picked up our audio guides. The content was very interesting and well organized/communicated in each room. Full tour did take some time but there\u2019s a small coffee shop to take a rest if you\u2019d like. Also",
          "This is quite a substantial cathedral / castle. During our visit there was also an exhibition of Dutch paintings. I am not sure if this is a permanent exhibition. You get an audio guide which was very useful but talked too much and provided too much detail without your consent",

          "Do come by here for a visit if you are visiting the Salzburg Cathedral and Kapitelplatz & Kapitelschwemme, that are just a short walk to here. It has a nice and interesting exhibition ongoing (during our visit there) where you will get to learn more about the Dom Quarter, the",
          "More than worth the 13 euros price of admission. Fantastic complex that takes at least 3 hrs to see it all. On the same scale as other Hapsburg palaces in Vienna! State rooms, galleries, and monastery of St Peters to highlight. Take time to relax and have a coffee on the terrace",
          "Absolutely amazing must do in Salzburg but plan at least four hours to take it all in. Great option for a rainy day.",
          "Like I wrote in a Cathedral review, do not forget to stop here. You will see not only nice exhibition of DomQuartier, but also Cathedral from inside (the floor view).",
          "Allow a fair amount of time to look around two floors full of displays. So well preserved and presented. Great variety. Some will leave you in awe. Rooms are well displayed with furniture. Some items are truely ancient. A few of the displays were a little hard to read with",
          "We agree with others saying we were surprised how much we enjoyed this visit. So many different aspects and things to see. They do a great job of leading you through the complex with the signs. We appreciated that all information was in German and English - plus there was the",

          "DomQuartier was not on our list of things to do or see because it didn\u2019t make the cut for our short stay in Salzburg. We stopped in pretty much by accident because we were just trying to duck out of the rain. We were really surprised at how much we enjoyed these museums! We",
          "A very interesting museum made up of several smaller museums. In the first part you visit the State Rooms of the Residenz Palace, a series of large, magnificently decorated halls.Then you reach the souvenir shop where you can also have a snack ,a beer or a beverage.After that",
          "We went here without expectation, just to kill time and use the Salzburg card but turn out to be quite nice. The place are big and good decoration. With free audio guide, you get a lot of information about the place.",
          "This museum was unlike any I had ever been in. It had so many different aspects that it was almost overwhelming trying to see it all. I would recommend giving yourself plenty of time to visit this one. The architecture and decorations were amazing. There is a cathedral there",
          "There are so many museums in one package so one can easily spend more than half a day. I enjoyed mostly the Bishop's Palace which was beautifully decorated, and especially all the chandeliers which are so wellkept so they look as they are brand New.",
          "If you get the Salzburg card the DomQuartier is included. It is 5 museums in one and you need to plan several hours if you want to take it all in and take the time to really enjoy it. All the museums are connected and you get from one to the other through the closed bridges or",

          "This is a huge place with lots of history to absorb. It seems they are improving it on a regular basis and have special exhibitions to allow return visitors. Well worth your time and plan accordingly to best use your time and energy.",
          "Domquartier is included in the Salzburg Card. You use ony one ticket and can come in into 5 musuems which are strategically located beside each other or connected by bridges or terraces. You follow one route and signs to navigate all the 5 museums. We decided to start at opening",
          "Went here on Salzburg pass , really interesting, well laid out on a number of floors with super views out of the Windows. Very informative about the monks and their lives.",

          "Some great art, fabulous rooms of the archbishops residence, the grand cathedral and all for free with the Salzburg card! We loved the view from the terrace at Christmas overlooking the markets.",
          "The museum, as there is just one entrance, encompasses the state rooms of the arch bishop residenz, which was quite a palace, as well as 4 different collections, from an art gallery, with a pretty decent collection, to a collection of rare items people collected in the",
          "This is a grouping of different museums in one set of buildings.The Salzburg Card gives you access. An audioguide steers you through each section and is easy to use. There are special buttons for a childrens tour. It started with the Prince Archbishops Palace with lots of",
          "Our visit here never coincided with any musical performances but it was still a spectacular place to visit and like most of Salzburg they have taken great care of preserving the history of the Domquartier.",
          "If you are a true fan and have heard Mozart / Bach or Beethoven then it is probably worthwhile or else you start looking at your watch after 15 minutes because you dont know the tunes and it becomes a drag after some time. Also the players are in a big hurry . Ideally they",
          "This seemed one of the quietest spots in Salzburg and you could browse at leisure. The church treasures were interesting, as were the Archiepiscopal apartments. Not sure about the art gallery. It had one or two fine paintings, but on the whole not a great art gallery of the",
          "We visited this large museum with our Salzburg cards for free. Inside the Domquartier you can see a large variety of church pieces and relics is on display, but also many paintings. Durring your visit, you will walk trough beautiful rooms, each with their own story and purpose,",
          "DomQuartier constitutes a visit to a series of museums: State Rooms of the Residenz; Residenz Gallery; the Cathedral's North Oratory; Cathedral Organ Loft; Cathedral Museum; Chamber of Art and Wonders; Long Gallery; and St. Peter\u2019s Museum. The unfortunate thing is that once",
          "The walk around the residenz and cathedral are the heart of Salzburg, Its scale reflects the power and authority of the age. A must see, although most of the paintings were not my style.",
          "The various museums included in this tour cover a lot of history of Salzburg and our very interesting but to me the highlight was to be able to walk in the balcony/pipe organ area and look down into the cathedral. I was lucky because the day I was there they were celebrating St",
          "Domquartier is a place where you can see the history of the salazburg at it best. its in 3 levels and best to beat the rainy day",
          "Included in Salzburg card offer, interesting, gives access to prince bishops residence and rooms. Also access to the gallery and cathedral organs area. During rainy day it's great way to spend few hours.",
          "Let's start with the obvious: The 5 different museums included in the Domquartier ticket make it a very good deal! The audio guide allowed us to go at our own pace to learn a bit about history of Salzburg. We are not well versed in art but enjoyed the tour immensely. We",
          "We toured the Residenz and Domquartier while there was a rain storm. We were so glad we did. At the time we went there was hardly anyone there. So beautiful and interesting and well worth the time taken to tour the buidlings.",
          "a really big Dom in the center of the Salzburg,entrance is free of charge.The Dom inside is very good looking with beautifull decoration on the windows and a lot of toursists visiting the church every day.",
          "I selfishly tell you of the terrace above the corridor linking the Cathedral with the Archbishop\u2019s residence because I design terraces. But this is a terrace by design: commanding views, providing soulful peace and human perspective all in the midfle of Salzburg\u2019s ebb and flow.",
          "We bought the Salzburg Card and didn't really have much interest to visit this place but boy were we proven wrong when we decided to spend our extra few hours here. Firstly, the staff were helpful and explained how to use the audio guide and things to look out for on the tour.",
          "It's a brilliant portrait of the fusion of secular and religious power vested in the Prince Archbishops for many centuries. Comprising five great museums, it shows the splendour of the Residenz and the great art within. Breathtaking was the Dom and particularly the vistas from",
          "The Domquaartier is a collection of five buildings: the cathedral, the residenz gallery, the cathedral museum, St. Peter's museum and the Rossacher Collectiion of Baroque Art of the Salzburg museum. You can go from one to the other very easily. We stopped about midway and had a",

          "The main qualities required for visiting this building and its collections are stamina and ability to absorb knowledge. The size of the collection is such that even with 3 hours concentrated effort, it is virtually impossible to view all that is exhibited. The cathedral",
          "The exhibit on curiosity cabinets made me want my own curiosity cabinet. Ditto the painting of the severed head with entrails coming out of it. Also, dear Europe: LET ME TAKE PICTURES!! Half the reason I go on these trips is to take pictures. You're killing me!!",
          "Really interesting and good value for money (\u20ac12 or free with the SalzburgCard). This is a comprehensive circular tour of several museums on the top two floors of the cathedral and adjoining palaces. If you visit before September don\u2019t miss the Wurth collection special",
          "Attached to the cathedral and part of free entry if you have the Salzburg card. It shows you the rooms of the Archbishops apartment and links into the cathedral where you look down at the nave from above with the organ towering magnificently behind you. A good tour of rooms,",
          "We went in here with our Salzburg Card. It was quite large and we probably did not see everything here. It was very well preserved and had interesting historical items to see. Plus a view of the Glockenspiel when we were on the terrace.",
          "This is a hidden gem of a tour in Salzburg. We spend 4 hours there and still didn\u2019t see everything for a price of 12 euros pp. It takes you behind the scenes of the prince-archbishops of Austria. The state rooms, the gallery of European paintings, terraces that over old town",
          "It was huge and it took quite a while to tour it. There were some beautiful things to see and the history was very interesting. You do need to check your valuables into a locker. Apparently the receptionist sent us the wrong way and we went through there the the reverse",
          "We loved the house with all its furnishings and art. We took a break on the terrace facing Mozart square and the cathedral. The visit includes a view into the cathedral",
          "Very nice staff and the tour is also impressive. Audioguide is free and very helpful. It is nice to follow the recommended path and then suddenly you are at the top of the cathedral with a very nice view around. Terrace on the top of the buildings is also interesting.",
          "While Domquartier offers a large number of items, they are not really anything outstanding. Neither was the building anything special. IMO it would be better to skip this if you are in Salzburg for a short duration only as there are many other places which you can visit.",
          "When you start on the tour route, it is not obvious that the route is going to take you ALL THE WAY AROUND the square. The fun thing is that it's not just the same-old same-old as you do the square. Various wings are set up as individual \"museums\" -- a cabinet of curiosities, a",

          "We visited this museum on our first full day in Salzburg, and found that it gave us a good grounding regarding local history, particularly as it pertains to the prince- archbishops of Salzburg. The rooms are grand and well appointed, with interesting information, like where",
          "Got in free with the Salzburg Card otherwise would have missed it out. There are loads of rooms to go into but after a while you get a bit big-roomed-out. Nice terrace for view over the adjacent square.",
          "Free admission with my Go Salzburg Card. Glad I took a trip inside. Everything is right there, might as well enjoy your time inside. Lovely and very informative, great history lesson.",

          "Because it was rainy I decided to do the self-tour. The displays were varied and interesting and the views from the organ loft of the Dome Cathedral were spectacular. There is also an outside terrace which affords a great panoramic view. Unfortunately, it would have been better",
          "This was an unexpected treat, but we were in there for about 2 hours. Once inside you are guided around a series of wonderful museums with an audio guide. This is a must see for the view from the top of the organ in the cathedral alone. Free with the Salzburg Card.",

          "Thought-provoking place, one of the best I visited in Salzburg. Full of peace, love, faith. Very interesting graveyard. Time is like disappeared here, only space still exists; strangely, this sacred place situated just within quite modern city. Very interesting experience indeed.",
          "Beautiful views, plenty to do and see!",
          "This monastery is a historical master piece. Built before 1000 AD, it retains the old world charm. It is also famous for being one of the prominent location of the shooting for Sound Of Music.",
          "This is a beautifully maintained cemetery with graves dating back several centuries. Very interesting just walking through and reading the inscriptions. Certainly worth a visit.",
          "I love it - and the view! Be prepared to climb the stairs on the way up the monastery - just take your time and wear comfortable walking shoes.",
          "good place, nice view",
          "Off the beaten track on the side of the M\u00f6nchsberg and just a few minutes to walk lies this gem of a historical building and what must be one of the most scenic cemeteries on the planet. The best thing is the peace and quiet. Try not to disrupt it.",
          "Very large Abbey we walked the grounds and it was great. This is the Abbey Maria Von Trapp was a nun.",
          "Salzburg is generally speaking a beautiful place to visit. Any Sound of Music fans will absolutely love it. But there is so much on offer for everyone.",
          "Nice little Abbey that was a filming location for the sound of music.",
          "This is a must see in Salzburg. A little remote and a bit of a climb, this church is stunning and sacred. Ornate in its own way but less traveled and more peaceful. Beautiful view of the city from a different perspective.",
          "Fun fact, the real Maria from the Sound of Music was the only person ever to be married here. The wedding scenes from the film were filmed in two different locations, one in Salzburg for the exteriors and one in Mondsee for the interior shots",

          "Beautiful cemetery in a medieval church, overseeing the mountains in the background",

          "Quite little place outside of main tourists attractions in Salzburg. You can enjoy not only the old buildings but also majestic views.",
          "Yeah....the scene from sound of music where the song 16 to 17 was sang. U can't go in the gazebo\ud83d\ude44. Lots of tourist so u can't have a picture by yourself with the gazebo. It's not worth your time if u ask me. The park was good though.",

          "Meh. Good views, but no documentation. I understand it is a working convent though!",
          "Brought back childhood memories of watching sound of music. Definitely worth the walk up and see where the von trapps hid from the Nazis in the film. Great views across the cities, only need about 30 minutes here but it is worth the walk up the steps.",
          "Wonderful,  always worth a bit of history",
          "Quite a climb but the views are tremendous.",
          "If you're a sound of music fan then this limited experience is worth the walk. If you have no idea what I'm talking about then I wouldn't go. You only have access to the small chapel on site but the gates as seen in the film are a great photo opportunity.",
          "Walked up to view. It was so quiet and empty. Great to see since it is the real location of the Von Trapp wedding.",

          "It's hard to rate places like this as opinion is so subjective! None of us are religious or fans of TSOM. I love architecture and old religious architecture is usually spectacular, so I personally enjoyed looking around the place. My \u2026",

        "wiki": "Salzburg (Austrian: [\u02c8saltsb\u028a\u0281k]; German: [\u02c8zaltsb\u028a\u0281k] (listen);  literally \"Salt Fortress\"; Bavarian: Soizburg) is the capital city of the State of Salzburg and with 155,031 inhabitants, it is the fourth-largest city in Austria.\nThe town is located on the site of the former Roman settlement of Iuvavum. Salzburg was founded as an episcopal see in 696 and became a seat of the archbishop in 798. Its main sources of income were salt extraction and trade and, at times, gold mining. The fortress of Hohensalzburg, one of the largest medieval fortresses in Europe, dates from the 11th century. In the 17th century, Salzburg became a centre of the Counter-Reformation, where monasteries and numerous Baroque churches were built.\nSalzburg's historic centre (German: Altstadt) is thus renowned for its Baroque architecture and is one of the best-preserved city centres north of the Alps, with 27 churches. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The city has three universities and a large population of students. Tourists also visit Salzburg to tour the historic centre and the scenic Alpine surroundings. Salzburg was the birthplace of the 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Because of its history, culture, and attractions, Salzburg has been labeled Austria's \"most inspiring city.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity to the High Middle Ages ===\nTraces of human settlements have been found in the area, dating to the Neolithic Age. The first settlements in Salzburg continuous with the present were apparently by the Celts around the 5th century BC.\nAround 15 BC the Roman Empire merged the settlements into one city. At this time, the city was called \"Juvavum\" and was awarded the status of a Roman municipium in 45 AD. Juvavum developed into an important town of the Roman province of Noricum. After the Norican frontier's collapse, Juvavum declined so sharply that by the late 7th century it nearly became a ruin.The Life of Saint Rupert credits the 8th-century saint with the city's rebirth. When Theodo of Bavaria asked Rupert to become bishop c. 700, Rupert reconnoitered the river for the site of his basilica. Rupert chose Juvavum, ordained priests, and annexed the manor of Piding. Rupert named the city \"Salzburg\". He travelled to evangelise among pagans.\nThe name Salzburg means \"Salt Castle\" (Latin: Salis Burgium). The name derives from the barges carrying salt on the River Salzach, which were subject to a toll in the 8th century as was customary for many communities and cities on European rivers. Hohensalzburg Fortress, the city's fortress, was built in 1077 by Archbishop Gebhard, who made it his residence. It was greatly expanded during the following centuries.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\nIndependence from Bavaria was secured in the late 14th century. Salzburg was the seat of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, a prince-bishopric of the Holy Roman Empire. As the Reformation movement gained steam, riots broke out among peasants in the areas in and around Salzburg. The city was occupied during the German Peasants' War, and the Archbishop had to flee to the safety of the fortress. It was besieged for three months in 1525.\nEventually, tensions were quelled, and the city's independence led to an increase in wealth and prosperity, culminating in the late 16th to 18th centuries under the Prince Archbishops Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau, Markus Sittikus, and Paris Lodron. It was in the 17th century that Italian architects (and Austrians who had studied the Baroque style) rebuilt the city centre as it is today along with many palaces.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\n\n==== Religious conflict ====\n\nOn 31 October 1731, the 214th anniversary of the 95 Theses, Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian signed an Edict of Expulsion, the Emigrationspatent, directing all Protestant citizens to recant their non-Catholic beliefs. 21,475 citizens refused to recant their beliefs and were expelled from Salzburg. Most of them accepted an offer by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, travelling the length and breadth of Germany to their new homes in East Prussia. The rest settled in other Protestant states in Europe and the British colonies in America.\n\n\n==== Illuminism ====\nIn 1772\u20131803, under archbishop Hieronymus Graf von Colloredo, Salzburg was a centre of late Illuminism. Colloredo is known for being one of the main employers of Mozart. He often had several arguments with Mozart he dismissed him by  saying, \u201cSoll er doch gehen, ich brauche ihn night!\u201d (He should just go then; I don\u2019t need him!)  Mozart would leave Salzburg for Vienna in 1781 with his family including his father Leopold staying back as he and Colloredo had a close relationship.\n\n\n=== Electorate of Salzburg ===\nIn 1803, the archbishopric was secularised by Emperor Napoleon; he transferred the territory to Ferdinando III of Tuscany, former Grand Duke of Tuscany, as the Electorate of Salzburg.\n\n\n=== Austrian annexation of Salzburg ===\nIn 1805, Salzburg was annexed to the Austrian Empire, along with the Berchtesgaden Provostry.\n\n\n=== Salzburg under Bavarian rule ===\nIn 1809, the territory of Salzburg was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria after Austria's defeat at Wagram.\n\n\n=== Division of Salzburg and annexation by Austria and Bavaria ===\nAfter the Congress of Vienna with the Treaty of Munich (1816), Salzburg was definitively returned to Austria, but without Rupertigau and Berchtesgaden, which remained with Bavaria. Salzburg was integrated into the Province of Salzach and Salzburgerland was ruled from Linz.In 1850, Salzburg's status was restored as the capital of the Duchy of Salzburg, a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The city became part of Austria-Hungary in 1866 as the capital of a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The nostalgia of the Romantic Era led to increased tourism. In 1892, a funicular was installed to facilitate tourism to Hohensalzburg Fortress\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n\n==== First Republic ====\nFollowing World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Salzburg, as the capital of one of the Austro-Hungarian territories, became part of the new German Austria. In 1918, it represented the residual German-speaking territories of the Austrian heartlands. This was replaced by the First Austrian Republic in 1919, after the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919).\n\n\n==== Annexation by the Third Reich ====\n\nThe Anschluss (the occupation and annexation of Austria, including Salzburg, into the Third Reich) took place on 12 March 1938, one day before a scheduled referendum on Austria's independence. German troops moved into the city. Political opponents, Jewish citizens and other minorities were subsequently arrested and deported to concentration camps. The synagogue was destroyed. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union, several POW camps for prisoners from the Soviet Union and other enemy nations were organized in the city.\nDuring the Nazi occupation, a Romani camp was built in Salzburg-Maxglan. It was an Arbeitserziehungslager (work 'education' camp), which provided slave labour to local industry. It also operated as a Zwischenlager (transit camp), holding Roma before their deportation to German camps or ghettos in German-occupied territories in eastern Europe.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nAllied bombing destroyed 7,600 houses and killed 550 inhabitants. Fifteen air strikes destroyed 46 percent of the city's buildings, especially those around Salzburg railway station. Although the town's bridges and the dome of the cathedral were destroyed, much of its Baroque architecture remained intact. As a result, Salzburg is one of the few remaining examples of a town of its style. American troops entered the city on 5 May 1945 and it became the centre of the American-occupied area in Austria.  Several displaced persons camps were established in Salzburg\u2014among them Riedenburg, Camp Herzl (Franz-Josefs-Kaserne), Camp M\u00fclln, Bet Bialik, Bet Trumpeldor, and New Palestine.\n\n\n==== Present day ====\nAfter World War II, Salzburg became the capital city of the Federal State of Salzburg (Land Salzburg). On 27 January 2006, the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all 35 churches of Salzburg rang their bells after 8:00 p.m. (local time) to celebrate the occasion. Major celebrations took place throughout the year.\nAs of 2017 Salzburg had a GDP per capita of \u20ac46,100, which was greater than the average for Austria and for most European countries.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSalzburg is on the banks of the River Salzach, at the northern boundary of the Alps. The mountains to Salzburg's south contrast with the rolling plains to the north. The closest alpine peak, the 1,972\u2011metre-high Untersberg, is less than 16 kilometres (10 miles) from the city centre. The Altstadt, or \"old town\", is dominated by its baroque towers and churches and the massive Hohensalzburg Fortress. This area is flanked by two smaller hills, the M\u00f6nchsberg and Kapuzinerberg, which offer green relief within the city.  Salzburg is approximately 150 km (93 mi) east of Munich, 281 km (175 mi) northwest of Ljubljana, Slovenia, and 300 km (186 mi) west of Vienna. Salzburg has about the same latitude of Seattle.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSalzburg is part of the temperate zone. The K\u00f6ppen climate classification specifies the climate as a humid continental climate (Dfb), however, with the \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm for the coldest month, Salzburg can be classified as having four-season oceanic climate with significant temperature differences between seasons. Due to the location at the northern rim of the Alps, the amount of precipitation is comparatively high, mainly in the summer months. The specific drizzle is called Schn\u00fcrlregen in the local dialect. In winter and spring, pronounced foehn winds regularly occur.\n\n\n== Population ==\nIn 2018, 31% of the total population is foreign born according to Statistik Austria.\nSalzburg's official population significantly increased in 1935 when the city absorbed adjacent municipalities. After World War II, numerous refugees found a new home in the city. New residential space was constructed for American soldiers of the postwar occupation, and could be used for refugees when they left. Around 1950, Salzburg passed the mark of 100,000 citizens, and in 2016, it reached the mark of 150,000 citizens.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Romanesque and Gothic ===\nThe Romanesque and Gothic churches, the monasteries and the early carcass houses dominated the medieval city for a long time. The Cathedral of Archbishop Conrad of Wittelsbach was the largest basilica north of the Alps. The choir of the Franciscan Church, construction was begun by Hans von Burghausen and completed by Stephan Krumenauer, is one of the most prestigious religious gothic constructions of southern Germany. At the end of the Gothic era the Collegiate church \"Nonnberg\", Margaret Chapel in St. Peter's Cemetery, the St. George's Chapel and the stately halls of the \"Hoher Stock\" in Hohensalzburg Fortress were constructed.\n\n\n=== Renaissance and baroque ===\nInspired by Vincenzo Scamozzi, Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau began to transform the medieval town to the architectural ideals of the late Renaissance. Plans for a massive cathedral by Scamozzi failed to materialize upon the fall of the archbishop. A second cathedral planned by Santino Solari rose as the first early Baroque church in Salzburg. It served as an example for many other churches in Southern Germany and Austria. Markus Sittikus and Paris von Lodron continued to rebuild the city with major projects such as Hellbrunn Palace, the prince archbishop's residence, the university buildings, fortifications, and many other buildings. Giovanni Antonio Daria managed by order of Prince Archbishop Guido von Thun the construction of the residential well. Giovanni Gaspare Zuccalli, by order of the same archbishop, created the Erhard and the Kajetan church in the south of the town. The city's redesign was completed with buildings designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, donated by Prince Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun.\nAfter the era of Ernst von Thun, the city's expansion came to a halt, which is the reason why there are no churches built in the Rococo style. Sigismund von Schrattenbach continued with the construction of \"Sigmundstor\" and the statue of holy Maria on the cathedral square. With the fall and division of the former \"F\u00fcrsterzbistum Salzburg\" (Archbishopric) to Upper Austria, Bavaria (Rupertigau) and Tyrol (Zillertal Matrei) began a long period of urban stagnancy. This era didn't end before the period of promoterism (Gr\u00fcnderzeit) brought new life into urban development. The builder dynasty Jakob Ceconi and Carl Freiherr von Schwarz filled major positions in shaping the city in this era.\n\n\n=== Classical modernism and post-war modernism ===\nBuildings of classical modernism and in particular the post-war modernism are frequently encountered in Salzburg. Examples are the Zahnwurzen house (a house in the Linzergasse 22 in the right center of the old town), the \"Lepi\" (a public baths in Leopoldskron) (built 1964) and the original 1957 constructed congress centre of Salzburg, which was replaced by a new building in 2001. An important and famous example of architecture of this era is the 1960 opening of the Gro\u00dfes Festspielhaus by Clemens Holzmeister.\n\n\n=== Contemporary architecture ===\nAdding contemporary architecture to Salzburg's old town without risking its UNESCO World Heritage status is problematic. Nevertheless, some new structures have been added: the Mozarteum at the Baroque Mirabell Garden (Architecture Robert Rechenauer), the 2001 Congress House (Architecture: Freemasons), the 2011 Unipark Nonntal (Architecture: Storch Ehlers Partners), the 2001 \"Makartsteg\" bridge (Architecture: HALLE1), and the \"Residential and Studio House\" of the architects Christine and Horst Lechner in the middle of Salzburg's old town (winner of the architecture award of Salzburg 2010).

          "We are not art people and weren't sure whether to take the time to drop in here - but we gave it a go and thought it was well worth it - a very different piece of art. We had just been to the top of the fortress, and wish we had taken some more photos from there to do a little",
          "this is amazing looking out at the city and seeing the views was incredible and the museum the history and lots to see we really enjoyed the visit",
          "It's mostly pictures of Salzburg and other parts of the world with rivers, mountains, etc. It's not very big, but if you have the Salzburg card, it's totally worth it.",
          "It's a small museum with nothing much to see. The panorama of Salzburg city is just ok. You can visit if you have taken the Salzburg card and have 10-15 minutes of time.",
          "If you've been up to the castle, admired the all-round views and asborbed some of the history of the city under the prince archbishops then you must visit the Panorama Museum. This 360 degree painting was done in 1826 and shows the city as it was then as seen from the castle.",
          "A very good panorama museum, if you are into that sort of thing. Not very big so it only took about 30 minutes to go through but it was well spread out over two levels (no elevator so not handicap friendly). Good rainy day activity if you have the city pass.",
          "This is a small museum, hosting a temporary exhibition on fires in the city. However, the main attraction, and the only thing I did was the 360 degree painter panorama of Salzburg as seen from the Festung Hohensalzburg in the early 19th century. The painting is very well done,",
          "The Panorama painting is fun to examine. Interesting to see what is the same and what has changed in the city. Had a good time zooming in on the miniatures. Lots of detail about life in that time period. The rest of the collection is worth a look as well. Nice place to spend",
          "Saw a panorama in a museum so got what we paid for. Very friendly woman on front desk. Quite text heavy display around exterior of panorama.",
          "Panorama pictures were all the rage in the 19th century. As noted elsewhere, there are larger ones still existing (I would totally recommend the Gettysburg and Waterloo ones), but this little gem has so much detail it is a real treat! I agree with reviewer who suggested saving",
          "If you have a lot of time, you can visit it. Not very interesting or realistic for someone who has visited a better one before, such as Panaroma Mesdag, Holland!",
          "We were expecting impressive interactive vistas of the city. Instead it was a limited exhibition about great fires in the city and their consequences. The exhibition space was on the petite side, covering somewhat confined areas on two levels. A number of interesting",
          "Okay, I might make fun of of this attraction for just being a really big painting, but 1) It's REALLY big, like so big; it's fun to see all the little detailed buildings and people and livestock, and to try to identify places you've been on your trip, and 2) it's free if you get",
          "We were the only people at this museum on this particular day. In our opinion it is one of the best that we have ever visited. The panorama of Salzburg in about 1829 and the restoration work on it was brilliant. The displays of the various fires in towns around Salzburg was most",
          "The painting was cool to see! When I was there, there was a superinteresting exhibition about UNESCO in Salzburg and what it meant for the city and how the world heritage list place had impact on urban developments. This was supernice to read/see!",
          "I went here as a bit of an add-on: my wife told me I would like it. I assumed I wouldn't and went anyway. It was really cool. I like art and detail, and love the large vistas and Salzburg so this was right up my alley. I will definitely go back here and spend some more time, but",
          "If you are interested in seeing how a city developed from time to time, make sure you stop by. There lots of painting and pictures of Salzburg in different eras. The most important part is the panorama painting, which is magnificent. It is impresisve to see how someone painted",
          "This is a (very) small museum with paintings of Salzburg from time to time... literally Salzburg painting gallery. The circular panoramic view of Salzburg is interesting, but that was the only thing that interest me. If you have spare time (and Euros) or simply enjoy paintings,",

          "Some times one rushes to the well known places and misses such beautiful historical objects. You go up the stairs in this circular hall and you are treated with the paintings of the historic city of Salzburg by J. M. Sattler (1786-1847) more than a century ago. The details on",
          "When I heard panorama, I presumed it was 1 panorama, not a series of pictures. Wasn't too impressed and we'd left after 15 mins - thankful the entrance was included in the price of the Salzburg card. Just not our thing - if you like paintings, then enjoy, but not us.",

          "There is an entrance fee of 4 Euros or 10 Euros including Salzburg Museum. No photography allowed. Lots of paintings and historical facts about Salzburg. A circular panoramic view of Salzburg is on display. It is a small museum. It is not a must see attraction.",

          "We visited this as it was next to the Salzburg museum and was free. But I was disappointed when I got inside. I was hoping to see several nice panoramic views either via painting or pictures. But they have instead cosmoramas, which should be more lifelike than a picture or",

          "We tried a few times to get into this museum and finally made it. It was worth the effort, great intricate art of not only Salzburg but typical \"grand tour\" spots around the world by artist Hubert Sattler. If you like detail and realism, this is for you. And even if you don't",
          "Nice museum with beautiful pictures and photos from several places around the world. The must see is a 360 picture of Salzburg in a rounded room.",

          "You will be surprised by this small museum, especially looking at the 360Deg picture of old Salzburg. Part of the old town",
          "The panorama itself (within the circular room) is very interesting to look at. However, I don't think the museum can justify its entry price - it would be better included with the Salzburg Museum next door.",

          "The main exhibit shows Salzburg in great detail in 1829. It is interesting to see how much has survived to present day Salzburg and what the differences are--beaches and sand bars in the river, for example. I also enjoyed the paintings of ancient sites in the Middle East and",

          "We entered the Panorama Museum and stepped into the past. Inside, there is a massive circular painting of Salzburg as it was about 200 years ago, with people going about their daily lives. The kids really enjoyed seeing the scenes from the past, using the telescopes on the",
          "The main draw of this small museum is the 360 floor to ceiling painting of Salzburg as seen from the Fortress. There are also some other smaller paintings that are very well done. I would not go here without the Salzburg card because it's not really worth the admission fee. I",

          "This small gallery in the centre of town is well worth a visit. Entry 3 euro, the main exhibition is a rotunda, housing the circular panorama of Salzburg. Beautifully painted. There is also a collection of beautiful paintings from around the world, presumably the equivalent of",
          "The main drag of this museum is of course the 360 degree panorama painting of Salzburg and its surroundings. A quite original painting. But there is also some paintings of different ancient civilizations around the globe that also were rather nice. For the price of 2 \u20ac it is",

          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this museum with excellent displays of panoramas around the world from different artists but the main attraction was the Panorama of Saltzburg in the centre of the museum by John Michael Sattler (1786-1847). It is magnificent and is displayed",
          "I find pictures boring. However I do like landscape/panorama pictures showing landscape. This art gallery primarily shows detailed landscape photos. The art gallery is small with just 2 falls. For a non-art lover it held my attention for 30 minutes. However the main attraction",

          "I found this to be very interesting indeed. The Panorama was fabulous, and to think that it was stored, rolled up for many years before seeing the light of day again. What makes it even better is that you can go up to the castle and see the exact view today and how it has",

          "This zoo is set into a mountain approximately a ten minute drive from the centre of Salzburg. It has a wonderful collection of animals big and small who have amazing very natural enclosures they live in. For me its unique selling point is that you can even take your dog for a",
          "We didn't find it a positive experience in regards to the type and variety of the enclosures for the animals. We went because we had a Salzburg card, and had time after exploring Hellbrunn Palace (trick gardens) and the park. Wouldn't recommend. However, it appeared popular",
          "I have decided to walk all around this area and visit the Zoo with 2 children after visiting the park which is 20 minutes away by walk. We finally arrived at 15:33 and asked to the counter for ticket, Suddenly saw her face and hands shaking so angry that she is not able to give",
          "I only stayed 20 minutes. Found the enclosures tiny, e.g. brown bears. I know they are constained by backing onto rocky hillside but I was quite upset.",
          "Thanks to trip-advisor, I decided to visit Zoo Salzburg on the day I arrived Salzburg. The traditional \u201czoo\u201d makes me think of animals kept in small cages but after reading the comments here I had changed my mind. It is like a sanctuary and like many people have said, the zoo",
          "Our visit to the zoo was unplanned. We were on our way to Untersberg cable car but when we arrived there it was too foggy. We remembered that we passed the bus stop for the Zoo some 10 minutes ago. So we decided to go back using the same Bus #25 to instead visit the Zoo first.",
          "Like to visit all zoo's if get the chance firstly very easy to get there bus 25 stops outside admission charge reasonable 23 euro 2 adults. Good selection of animals ranging from wolves , jaguar to mice. Fairly heavy covering of snow but still enjoyable. Main restaurant not open",
          "Excellent zoo with a varied selection of animals all of which looked in good health. It's a small zoo but the attractions offer great views of the animals in very interesting surroundings.",
          "Snow leopards! In the snow! Growling at each other! And Pumas, and cheetahs, and jaguars! This is a zoo full of the world's most precious big cats. Fabulously low entry fee and easy to get too (we caught the bus), you can explore the zoo's cosy exhibits for hours. I say cosy",
          "I have got to say this is one of the best zoo's I've seen it's spacious clean and very interesting I love the way some animals could integrate with you x I enjoyed feeding the birds and goats x the restaurant was a nice place to stop for a while after lots of walking xxyou have",
          "Looks like a tiny old zoo as you approach, but once you get in it's like a Tardis. The zoo branches left and right, running the length of the cliff that it is based up against (oh, and if you turn round back to the entrance you can see in the distance the Eagle's Nest",
          "...in winter period it is a free entrance during the work days...nice...realy all around worth to wisit durimg few days in salzburg...",
          "Animals are good to watch . Look healthy and seems like good care has been taken by the administration. Be Ready to walk along the length because the stretch is long on both the sides. The Zoo Location is fabulous and makes up for great landscapes. Dont forget to have a cup of",
          "We didn\u2019t plan to visit the zoo but we had a couple extra hours and we heard good things. I\u2019m glad we went, it was nice to see a zoo with some natural elements- built into the mountain and mature trees. This zoo is larger than it looks from outside and there are lots of",
          "It is a very nice zoo to visit as a family. The animals feel very close to you. Although it is very small but it is planned very nicely Around a hill. The African animals are kept beautifully and when you see them from above it seems like a scene from National geographic",
          "Medium size zoo, built into mountain. Some of the cages are small, for the amount of animals inside. Good range of animals on display. Its built into there natural environment. Its very green. Well maintained. You have a very good view of the animals. I enjoyed my time here.",
          "The zoo had a good selection of animals and they did a reasonable job of presenting them in a natural environment. What made it special was the outstanding scenery. It made the overall experience, particularly on a beautiful day, as it was when we went, incredibly pleasant.",
          "In a grand rustic setting we enjoyed our couple hours excursion here. An aspect that we commended was the essential spaciousness of the gardens available to the great assemblage of animals. Strolling around we were delighted to see so many different species. As always red",
          "very nice location between rocky terrain, many different animals and the surrunding of hellbrunn castle is also fine",
          "One of the best zoo i have ever visited , it like we are in home of this beautiful animals , we can even touch and play with some of this animals , kids will enjoy every moment spend here , my request is to spend a least 2 to 3 hours",
          "We have visited this zoo and we have wonderful impression. There is a great place with large territory for animals. There aren\u2019t a typical cages with dirt and exhausted beasts. There are a real grass, trees, small rivers, stones, like in real wild life. So pretty animals feel",
          "We all thoroughly enjoyed our visit \u2013 the zoo had been recommended by friends who have family in Salzburg and we could easily see why. All the enclosures seem very open \u2013 not like the small cages of old, these are much bigger spaces with some room to roam \u2013 though it meant you",
          "What a delightful place. The Zoo is set out along a cliff and the various animal enclosures are very well marked. We have been to a few Zoos over the years but this is one of the best we think. Quite small in area so very easy walking. Great for those with disabilities and",
          "We visited the zoo on our way back from the Untersberg cable car, & as we had the Salzburg card, the entry price was already included. It's a nice zoo simply laid out. The Bears were fun to watch but unfortunately the otters were completely hidden away which was disappointing",
          "Really one of the best small ZOO with very close experiences with animace... Red pandas are awesome!",
          "Admission was free with the Salzburg card and the Zoo was literally right across the street from where I stayed. I felt like I was the only one there. It was slightly snowing and all the animals were out and about. This was a perfect trip to the zoo and I will always remember it!",
          "We had a couple of hours to kill on a lovely sunny day and as this attraction was free when you have a Salzburg Card we decided to visit on our way back from Untersberg on bus number 25. The zoo entrance is just a few metres from the bus stop. There were lots of animals in the",
          "Planned to go to the zoo from day One and glad we did. You can get their by getting the public bus 25 from the city. Zoo costs 11.50 Euro to get in. The zoo is really good as has a great diverse range of animals from \u2018Eurasian\u2019 to \u2018African\u2019. As it was winter time some animals",
          "I have so great time whit my friend's and theyr kids, we get fun see the animal's and eat at the restourant .",
          "We visited the Zoo on Christmas day and were disappointed to find that a large number of animals were not on view. The Zoo does not include many indoor enclosures so it is not possible to see many of the animals in their winter quarters. The layout of the Zoo against the",
          "We didn't plan to go to the zoo but it's really easy to get to (we got the public bus from the new town). For the size of the zoo it goes some interesting animals and the habitats are as natural as possible. As an added bonus its got some fabulous views of the mountains.",
          "Got the 25 bus and entry using salzburg card. Lovely little zoo and afterwards can walk through hellburn palace again with salzburg card. After a few days in town nice to get out.",
          "I come here since I\u2019m a kid, since then I\u2019ve seen many different zoos all around the world and I still love this one. It\u2019s not a huge zoo, but there is always something new to explore. The animals seem to be happy there, which is an important factor for me to revisit a zoo. If",
          "To be honest we only visited this zoo because we had free entry with the Salzburg Card and the bus back from Untersberg stopped right outside. But we were so glad that we did. It's basically built in a straight line with a loop at the end.There is a huge cliff on one side which",
          "We are in our 70's thought this quirky zoo was great fun it is easy to walk through and more or less in a straight line below a hill with good views",
          "We visited the Salzburg Zoo with 6 Adults and 2 Children, the price of 72 Euro for the entrance was not cheap. The animals you can see are ok, unfortunately we went there around noon and most of them were sleeping. But it is a good place two spend some time with kids. For me as",
          "Rain or shine good for all ages. The animals are in great large open areas you feel like you could touch them! Wear good walking shoes as the park is large . For the little ones they have carts to pack them into! There are evening petting areas where you can feed the farm",
          "An excellent ZOO with big gardens for every species. The monkeys keep jumping on the trees and fences right in front of you! Also, what we particularly liked, the visitors of the ZOO have free parking - you only mustn't to mark your parking ticket.",
          "The zoo is not too big, but is very well maintained - many animals , clean, not overcrowded. There is a nice restaurant to eat too, so we easily spend almost half of the day.",
          "If you're arriving in Salzburg by train, head out towards the bus stops. Pick up a bus ticket on your way and find the number 25 bus - for the past year it's been located on the far left hand side of the bus stops. This will take you all the way to Salzburg Zoo cheaply and",
          "This zoo is great value for money and displays some animals you wouldn't normally see in a British zoo. The layout is odd given that it is long and thin, this means you will double back on a few animals. Pros. The bears, big brown bears were something special, we saw one swim!",
          "A nice little zoo on the side of a hill just outside the city. My Highlights: the mountain animals inkl. Ibex, brown bear <3 my favorite, snow leopard and cougar; the white rhinos with the free roaming kattas. The Salzburg Card covers the admission. It's on the way to",
          "it was good to visit the zoo, it was near by my hotel, its in big area, with lots of animal to see, good thing is they have small carts for kids which can be pulled by parents",
          "In any season, the enclosures for cougars, snow-leopards and jaguars are really impressive. These big cats (I have included cougars due to their size) can be seen on the slopes of the hill situated in the background. This alllows a very good visibility (a significant advantage",
          "With the Salzburg card the zoo is included and if you visit the nearby palace and take a water fountain tour, ask at the end which exit to take to walk 5 mins to get to the zoo. You need to validate your Salzburg card at the ticket window in the zoo and they give you a zoo",
          "About 30 minutes drive from Alstadt, old town, Salzburg, the zoo is not large or very commercial as in larger metropolises. The setting is heavenly spoilt only by the smell of some animals (only natural). It's set at the foot of a steep mountain and refund in a straight line",
          "We used our Salzburg cards for admission. It's a nice zoo with an unusual mountain-side layout. Too cold for many of the animals to be visible, but that's to be expected in early March. Neither of us is terribly crazy about zoos, but this one isn't bad.",
          "Was led to believe this was a beautiful zoo surrounded by mountains. It was winter so all the animals were either hibernating or just not there. The few big cats we saw were in very limited grounds and appeared sad and bored. We walked completely around but found little to see",
          "Its just a superb place to visit with the family. The kids were ecstatic to see the animals in their semi-natural habitat.",
          "In early December,on a pleasant sunny day,I spent several hours enjoying this zoo which has an alpine atmosphere.I appreciated its alpacas,rhinoceroses.,Przewalski Horses,Alpine Ibexes,zebras,and wolverines at this pleasant,but not large zoo.I liked its nice cafeteria where I",
          "Good zoo....alot of animals probably in hibernation at this time of year. Was nice seeing the black and white snow leopards and also the rhinos and zebras have a great enclosure and it looks like they are wandering around in the open. Included in the Salzburg card which is why",
          "Zoo is located just outside the city and can be reached by bus 25 in about 20 minutes. It contains a variety of animals set in very nice ground and uses the hilly territory to house the animals in large well maintained enclosures. Entry is free with the Salzburg card (as is the",
          "Good looking place. Very natural and great landscape. Bus #25 to Anif. Dogs are welcome to most areas. Lots of useful information about animals.",
          "It's the best zoo I've ever visited! Full of animals and different species, all in a beatiful natural landscape. Lions, jaguars, birds, horses, sheep, wolves, bears and more! I've visited the park this morning while it was snowing and that made the atmosphere even more",
          "We visited this zoo as an afterthought when we had some free time one afternoon and was so pleasantly surprised. It is quite small, but has a lovely range of animals. For us the first time ever to see snow leopards alive. They are incredibly beautiful ( would obviously prefer",
          "This zoo, whilst very scenic in winter is not worth visiting. The big cats in particular are kept in enclosures way too small for them, mostly concreted, with only painted murals to reference their natural habitat. Other than the goats, alpacas and reindeer the rest of the",
          "This is a great zoo with plenty of animals. There is even a black Jaguar. I had only saw those on television so it was a real treat for me. The Africa exhibit was much larger than I expected and they had 5 Rhinos. My daughter was probably the only one more excited than I was!",
          "We caught the num. 25 bus heading to the Untersbergcablebahnhof from Mirabel gardens. We got off at the Hellbrun stop and visited Hellbrun. Bus stops at the entry gate. The Salzburg zoo is walking distance away on the same bus route. The zoo is organised into continents with",
          "Took 16 and 5 year old sons. Spent around 4 hours there including lunch. It was raining for the first 2 hours but we still enjoyed it. Food to feed the animals cost \u20ac2.90 a pack. We bought 2 and all had fun with it. It's an unusual zoo due to its lay out - lengthwise along",
          "We had a nice half a day in the zoo. Children had a great time to see all the animals. They had a good time there. And the views around are beautiful!!",
          "Add this to your itinerary while visiting Hellbrunn, especially if you have children in tow. We always try to make sure we incorporate some activities the kids choose while traveling and this was one of those. We had a great time seeing the animals and everyone was happy at the",
          "Not a fan of Zoo's but I did enjoy going around this one. The areas allocated for the animals were I felt a comfortable size. Never seen a wolf before and did so that was enjoyable. Bears were big and interesting as was the snow leopard. Plenty of animals to see and it looked",
          "I hate to be a zoo name-dropper but I have been to many of the biggest and best - San Diego, Singapore etc. Therefore when I found myself at Hellbrunn with some time on my hands I thought - why not? And I'm so glad I did. There are many bonuses of this place (even on a sunny",
          "I visited the zoo with my kids,, they really enjoyed it. Large zoo in between woods and mountains with attractive views,, animals has wide space for each group,, toilets, cafes, small restaurants are available ,, my kids enjoyed it very much",
          "The zoo is large and holds a wide selection of animals. The animals have large enclosures which makes it difficult to spot some of them. The kids enjoy the visit, but it may become tiresome for the little ones. There are free carriages you can use to transport the smaller kids.",
          "We've been to many zoos in many parts of the world. Unfortunately this one rated as one of our least favourite. The enclosures, whilst large enough, seemed a little overgrown and not looked after. The poor reindeer had a small and pitiful looking enclosure and the wild horses",
          "This is not big zoo, but very good to visit. We enjoyed monkeys, big cats, wolves, etc.... The walk around it was very easy and smooth.",
          "Lovely few hours spent here. Was very hot when we visited so quite hard work with the kids in the heat. Plenty of cafes/ ice cream kiosks around. Saw most of the animals but some hidden in the shade.",
          "We visited as it was included with the Salzburg card and we had spent the morning at the cable car and Helbrunn palace. It is the most wonderful zoo. Lovely enclosures and we saw so many animals! We were there during August so it was open late and by 6pm we had the place to",
          "This is a well kept zoo and the animals seemed to be content most of them. It's a nice area to stroll and the background scenes of the mountains makes it even more special. Fun and educating for kids. Make sure to come early to get a parking close (free for zoo visitors) and you",
          "One of the beautiful places that you have to visit when you are in Salzburg city. It is very clean and tidy. They have many types of animals. My children enjoyed their time in the zoo. Not expensive, big parking area, and there are some cafes for snacks.",
          "Located behind hellbrunn palace. It has more than 500 species of animal. Attraction being that of lion and snow leopard my son enjoyed it thoroughly. Need half a day to roam the entire zoo Must visit for kids",
          "You can nicely spend your time here teaching the nature to your children. Too many different species & animals. Quite large and clean area",
          "Located in the suburb of Salzburg is a beautiful small zoo. A convenient parking leads to a walk in this wonderful zoo which can last 1-2 hours. Worth a visit !",
          "Our daughter very much wanted to visit the zoo as the taxi driver who took us from the train station to our hotel said it was worth the visit. And boy was it worth the visit. it is not a North American type zoo. it is not all concrete and slick exhibits. It is a glimpse",
          "Having already visited the Innsbruck Zoo, we were not really excited about coming to this Zoo, but boy were we pleasantly surprised. It was brilliant we saw practically all the exhibits on show except for the wolves, and it was a great visit. The zoo is very compact, but like",
          "good value for money. great even if its raining light as some indoor spots..loved being up close to the animals especially the big cats and rhinos. children enjoyed it too",
          "Having a habit of visiting the Zoo at every city we visit, Salzburg's zoo wasn't an exception, there's a short bus ride taken from the city center to the Zoo entrance. There is a very nice variety of animals considering this Zoo's size, we came on a bit of a rainy day but",
          "I am not a zoo person, but the my lovely bride drug me to this gem of a zoo. The staff was very professional and the layout of the zoo was easy to navigate. The animals were a joy to view.",
          "I love zoos, so that's why I visited Zoo Salzburg. And I mostly enjoyed it. First, the good points. The zoo path was mostly a straight line, so it was easy to see everything without having to do many twists and turns. Now, as the afternoon I visited was somewhat warm, many",
          "The zoo is included in Salzburg card. Transportation is not a problem since it is accessible by bus 25. The zoo and the animals are really well taken care of. We spent around 3 hours and really had a good time. Our highlight was the lemur; they are not put in the cage so they",
          "They had two Red Pandas and two Snow Leopards. Also Bears. Also Lions. Also Rhino. Also Capybara. And most importantly... Red Pandas. Also - an incredible mountain view. An excellent Zoo.",
          "Great zoo- spent around 3-4 hours there. Close viewing of the animals. Great petting zoo. The kids had a brilliant time. 2 types of animals are missing, giraffes and elephants. Well worth taking the family there for the morning. Easy walking and great for disabled people.",
          "We went to this lovely big place. Weather was snowing but this didn't stop us from visiting the place. It was -2c , this was clod for animals so they were in hyper mood as all where not active much. I liked the place but i believe the management should put more efforts in adding",
          "The zoo is very close to the Hellbrunn Palace and is a good idea to spend some time here after visiting Hellbrunn Palace. It is a nice zoo and the kids would really enjoy it. They have some very nice species of animals and worth a visit. Salzburg card is valid here.",
          "The zoo is easily accessed by the number 25 bus as is included in the Salzburg card. There are a wide range of animals which seem to be content and well looked after.The restaurant is large with a pleasant outdoor seating area.",
          "We stopped in for a few hours and had a wonderful time at the lovely zoo. Not huge but bigger than it first seems, accessible and well laid out enclosures and some unusual animals. With a vista of the beautiful mountains, well worth a visit.",
          "A lovely afternoon spent at the zoo. I would recommend devoting about 3 to 4 hours to visiting this zoo. It's not a massive establishment, but the animals are good quality and seem to be well taken care of. If you visit, be sure to purchase the feed pellets for the goats and",
          "This zoo is located on the side of the mountain on the edge of town, but is easily accessible by public transportation. They had many animals that I have never seen before. They had rhinos, zebras, cheetahs, and many more. They had animals that you don't normally see in America.",
          "Good visit, even in winter! The animals seem to be very well cared for and the surrounding area is gorgeous. The grounds are clean as well. Some of the highlights were the monkeys, snow leopard, flamingos, and alpacas! Worth a visit if you're in Salzburg for longer than 2-3 days.",
          "We absolutely loved our zoo outing. Just 2 adults! The animals were in large, natural enclosures, and they all seemed very happy. No nervous pacing or bad habits. They had a great variety of animals from around the world, and the vistas were really lovely. You get quite",
          "Some people remain opposed to zoos in principle, but this one is more like a wildlife park with plenty of room for the animals to roam freely in large enclosures. We saw mountain goats (we had earlier seen one when we took the cable car to Untersberg), brown bears, flamingos,",
          "We visited here on our holiday to Ruhpolding, Bavaria (only 5 EUR return journey with an eXtra card). We visited this zoo in 2010 when we stayed in Fuschl am See, loved it then and still love it now. The animals are all held in natural surroundings and you can see that they are",
          "Really nice location with view of Untersberg. The zoo is located on the side of a mountain which provides a very natural habitat for animals. Very large space for them to roam around. And the latest addition to the zoo, the baby rhino was just adorable and worth the visit. Only",
          "We went to the zoo part of the Helbrunn Palace and it was nicely done, the animals had their own ponds, waterfalls, trees and grass. It was nice the way they had different animals together. The bears were really interesting playing together, they put on a show for the crowds. It",
          "Absolutely loved it, had pretty much every animal we'd want to see and there were absolutely no crowds when we went, got to go close up next to Rhinos, Lions etc without loads of other visitors around.",

          "verry nice zoo and verry good opportunity for the children to see a lot of animals in their habitat...",
          "We took our two young children here and they loved it. It cost less than \u20ac30 for the four of us, a bargain compared to zoos in England. The zoo setting with the mountains nearby is beautiful and the animal enclosures are refreshingly spacious. There are play areas and picnic",
          "Having read some reviews of this zoo I wasn't expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised. The setting is quite unique up against the rock of the hillside and there is a good variety of animals. We expected to be there for maybe an hour but spent an awful lot longer there",
          "Ive been to a few zoos in europ\u00e9 and this was horrible, only been to Amsterdam zoo thats been worse. Sad park Wit sad animals. I live in seden where the zoos are for keeping species and i understand why people go there, this was just sad.",
          "Had Salzburg bus pass so got free entry. Not as big as I expected but nice and clean. It was a scorcher when we did the tour and gave up half way as there were very little shade and most of the benches were in the sun.",
          "This zoo has improved exponentially since I first visited in 1989, and again in 2000. The zoo doesn't pretend to more than it is, which is as much an historic landmark as an animal attraction. Adding the extra land in the last two decades for large animals like rino and giving",
          "The zoo was the cleanest zoo I have ever seen. It is way cleaner than zoos such as zoos in the US and China. The zoo is very easy to get to, you only have to go on bus 25 and there is a stop whose name is Salzburg Zoo. The cost is $10.50 but we got there for free with the",
          "Free bus and entry with Salzburg card.Combine your visit with Hellbrunn. The zoo is set against a rocky background. The animal enclosures were spacious and provided a natural setting for the animals. You were really close to the animals, Lions, Tigers, Snow leopard. There is",
          "Visited with wife, son 12, daughter 11. Buy a Salzburg card for bus transportation there and entry. We got off the bus adn visited the Hellbrunn Palace and fountains, then walked up a short hill for a quick visit to the Salzburg zoo. The native Austrian animals are located",
          "The ZOO is nicely set onto a sizeable rocky hill, easily accesible by car with good parking just outside the entrance. It is only smaller than other zoos and do not expect to spend there more than 1-2 hours. Also catering options were very limited.",
          "It was a while since i was in the zoo. when I was in the untersberg (cable cars) I got the chance to go there because it's close to it. we enter with the Salzburg Card for free. the Zoo in Salzburg is not that Big but you can find many spices of animals there. You have a Bus",
          "This was our only disappointment in the days we spent in Salzburg. There just is not much to see here. It's easy to get to on the 25 bus but there are better things to see in Salzburg than this zoo.",
          "Even London Zoo we visited last month wasn't as impressive. Animals looked well and lively and we had good views of them. If it's your thing I'd recommend it.",
          "We were very impressed at the quality and size of the zoo. The animals all seemed healthy and active. We only saw about half of the zoo, as we just stopped by on our way back to town.",
          "We had a few hours to spare before catching our flight back to the UK and as it was a nice day decided to visit the Zoo as it was a short drive from the airport. What a revelation. It is a small zoo with cliffs as backdrop of some of the enclousures. There is lots for kids",
          "It was my first visti to a zoo in last ten or so years. When coming back from the Untersberg mountain to the city center, I stopped over at Salzburg zoo with a low level of expectation. However, it turned out to be a good time in there. Animals are kept relatively close to the",
          "Set in front of a long rocky hill a great scenic location. The layout is a bit strange as you have to walk back on yourself to view the whole park. A good selection of animals that look well looked after. The food bags to feed the goats are a bit expensive at \u20ac3 a bag. Near the",
          "Popped here on the 27 bus went to the cable car but it was shut so visited the zoo ... Loads of animals to see bit smelly but it is a zoo .. Flamingoes beautiful and tigers and lions impressive ... Missed the rhino ...shy .. Worth a visit if u give kids ..",

          "This is not the largest ZOO you will ever visit, but it's location a bit makes is special. Whole ZOO is a strip laid along the foot of a hill - you are basically looking always uphill :-) Kids (and adults alike) enjoyed it a lot.",
          "... visited this beautiful zoo with the Salzburg Card. It is situated next to the Hellbrunn Schloss and gardens. The zoo is not very big, well organized, and we are so close to the animals! You will see a large variety of animals that do not seem to be in \"cages\", but in a",
          "the zoo seems a bit basic in many ways, but you can get close to most of the animals and we particularly liked the kids play area with free roaming goats and chickens. the goats were very friendly and theres also some friendly llamas further in that are happy to be stroked.",
          "Have been there, because our daughter wished to visit the zoo... We catched almost hot weather....so first good tip: visit zoo best when cooler, little cloudy weather. Because walking is not so strange...and many animals you can see better, because they dont hide... :-)",
          "Went there with the kids. My 6 years old and my 2 years old boys enjoyed it most. Set by the side of a mountain, the zoo is somewhat small in size but has a reasonable number of exotic animals. The boys liked the petting zoo most, but my wife hated the strong oder of the place.",
          "Nice set-up, wonderful location close to Salzburg's Zoo in Hellbrunn, good food, friendly staff, reasonable prices",
          "Every time I am in Salzburg, I'll go to this zoo. No doubt. It relaxes me. It's not like Berlin zoo, it's small. But it's beautiful. Situated on a hill, near Hellburnn, with great view on Untersberg, I love it! There is lot of species in the zoo, and I love the fact that they",
          "My wife and I wandered over here with the Salzburg card after Schloss Hellbrun since it was part of the Salzburg card and w/in walking distance. It is nothing special. I'm sure younger kids would enjoy it, but not worth stopping at unless you really want to visit a zoo.",
          "Its really well laid out, and has plenty to see, and nice places to stop along the trails. Wonderful attractions! Nice areas for the kids (the petting zoo with the goats and the little playground by the ice cream stand.) The cafeteria was handy, too!",
          "Overall, it was pretty good, but not excellent. I went because I had the Salzburg Card and entry was free, and I was out that way for Hellbrunn Castle. The zoo is small and well laid out. Some enclosures were closed, and some looked too small for the animals. The animals all",
          "The zoo is small, but nicely laid out. We went during December knowing full well that the animals may not be as lively as they would be in the warmer months. We were able to see all the exhibits in about 2 hours. The wolf, bear, and big monkeys were not there since the zoo is",
          "I went there alone since it\u2019s located next to the Hellbrunn Castle and the garden. Just take the bus line number 25 to the Hellbrunn Castle and one more stop, it\u2019s the Salzburg zoo bus stop. I visited the Hellbrunn Castle first. Unfortunately, it only opens during summer time",
          "Major disappointment! Spent a few hours at the zoo and was totally appalled by the state of the enclosures for the animals. The lions, puma, tigers were in such small enclosures that left them to lie there in a comatose state looking bored and lifeless. Some enclosures were",
          "The zoo is small, but you can touch many animals and see them in a natural habitat, not in cages. If you buy Salzburg card, the zoo is included in the price. It's totally worth visiting. Lions are gorgeous!",

          "Although I prefer seeing animals in the wild, I had the impression the animals at Zoo Salzburg were as healthy and happy as animals can be outside of their natural environment.",
          "We weren't planning to visit a zoo during our short stay in Salzburg, but this ended up being the highlight of our trip! The zoo was fantastic. They had lots of different animals, from monkeys to cougars to rhinos. We were there for feeding time in some enclosures, so the",

          "I have been to zoo's in Innsbruck, Linz and Salzburg. Zoo Salzburg is the best among these zoo's. Very good collection of animals - Rhino, Lion, tiger, bear, zebra, jaguar, leopard etc. Very good zoo. Take the bus no 25 on the way to untersberg cable. Included in the Salzburg",
          "If you are for a limited period and are travelling without kids I think this can be easily skipped nothing especial about it.",
          "Good little zoo for a half-day visit, perhaps combined with the Trick Fountains at Schloss Hellbrunn. Well kept enclosures, though a little tired in parts. Good range of animals.",

          "We've visited Salzburg on more than a dozen occasions but this was our first time at the zoo. You can buy a combined ticket for the zoo and Hellbrun Palace and there is easy access between the two but we opted to visit the zoo only and leave the Palace for another day. We were",

          "I have been too zoos all over the world and this one is unique. It is not flashy but our kids (5,3,1) loved it. The animals were very friendly and yu could interact with them more than American zoos. It is built In a clif and Ina straight line so there is only 1 way to go!",
          "Salzburg zoo promised a lot, but delivered very little. On arrival we were excited to spend our annual easter Monday day out here. 5 minutes into the zoo, I realised this was going to be rubbish after hearing a few complaints about no animals being here. The bear was not in his",
          "We visited the zoo after the Untersberg Cable Car as bus 25 stops here on the way. The zoo is by no strength of the imagination like London or Los Angeles Zoo. Instead it's rather small and built along side the bottom of a cliff. There are lots of animals, however it is no",

          "The zoo was really nice. Good variety of animals from all over the world. The kids will really enjoy it.",
          "A small zoo on the outskirts of Salzburg. It's very peaceful and the animals seem happy and the enclosures are good. Ring-tailed lemurs are free roaming but tend to stay out of the way of the public. There were a few animals off exhibit (leopard and cheetah) as their enclosures",
          "We have high standards for zoo's being from San Diego and this one did not disappoint. We are living abroad currently and think its the best zoo we have visited in Europe thus far . The animals have well kept enclosures , water , and food . There are lots of things for the",

          "Great place to visit while on a Salzburg Holiday. Kids love it. Particulary nice the scenario of the animals living on the rocks of the zoo. The Gardens of the area are wonderful and peaceful places and have a lot of things to see like a little castle, natural stone theater,",
          "A small but compact zoo along the way to Hellbrun. The animal collection was good. The informative displays were very educating, especially for younger visitors. However, due to space constrain, some f the enclosures cannot be much improved on.",
          "This is a beautiful zoo with many exotic animals. The grounds are spectacular, and it is dog friendly. They provide water for dogs in dishes placed all around the zoo.",
          "Worth the stop, the nice thing was the animals were moving around, very responsive to the crowd.",
          "Not a particular fan of zoos but it was part of going to Hellbrum. A linear layout with a good selection. The compounds appeared to be of a size and variation for the animals Worth a couple of hours to visit if at Trick Fountain and Hellbrun Schloss",
          "We really liked this little zoo. Our children enjoyed seeing the critters up close (although I was almost positive those bears could hop the mote and that tiny little gate...) and it proved to be a fun day! Cheap admission and there are beer and ice cream stands all along the",

          "We chose Salzburg as a destination because there is a lot to keep the children entertained. The Salzburg Zoo did just that. We saw an interesting assortment of animals, from the standard (lion, zebra hippo) to the not so standard....guinea pigs in a zoo? There are also",
          "This is a really enjoyable little zoo, the day we went we were practically alone there. Our kids loved it. Combine that with a visit to the water games in the castle (you can go to the castle by foot from the zoo) and that makes for a very enjoyable day out altogether!",
          "This was the first visit back for me since 2000. I have to say that conditions are now great and the animals all look content in their home with none of the obvious signs of a bad place. It's well organized and superb value for money. You couldnt get a family of five into a uk",
          "Allow at least 2 hours to see the whole zoo, especially since some animals hide away so you may need to wait a little to see them come out. It's a great place for families and kids. I especially enjoyed the bears.",
          "This zoo isn't too big but its a good size. There are quite a few animals and most of the enclosures are backed up to a mountain/hill. It was very neat to see.",

          "We were 4 bikers all adults and we really enjoyed it, so kids will love it. The restaurant just near the entrance is very good, if a little pricey as all these places are all over the world. The enclosures were spacious and it's in a very pretty area of Salzburg. Heilbrunn",

          "Me and my children were deeply impressed by the Salzburg Zoo, we visited in March this year. This is a great place to spend a lazy afternoon or to bring your children, no matter their age. Since we did not have a car, we used bus number 25 and the ride lasted for approximately",
          "Agree with previous review, great use of natural location and large enclosures rather than cages make this a great place to visit. You can catch number 25 bus from centre of Salzburg and it takes approximate 20 mins. We also did Hellbrunn Palace/fountains on same day. Highlight",
          "We went to 5 zoos in Europe this summer and felt this was the best in terms of treatment of animals and exhibits. The signs were all in German - so we didn't get much out of the signage. But the exhibits were large and made good use of the natural surroundings. The animals",

One part is a bit newer and therefore more enjoyable, but the older part does the trick as well. The park also has a nice walking path, clean facilities and a restaurant with simple but nice food.",

        "wiki": "The Franciscan Church (German: Franziskanerkirche) is one of the oldest churches in Salzburg, Austria. The church is located at the intersection of Franziskanergasse and Sigmund-Haffner-Gasse opposite the Franciscan Friary in the Altstadt section of the city. The first church on this site was erected in the eighth century. Between 1408 and 1450, a Gothic choir replaced the Romanesque choir. A slender Gothic tower was added between 1468 and 1498. The church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and served as the parish church until 1635. It was ceded to the Franciscan Order in 1642. Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach redesigned the church interior in the baroque style in the eighteenth century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first church on this site was built in the eighth century during the time of Saint Virgil, who may have used it for baptisms.  A document from 1139 mentions a parish church on this site. That church was destroyed by fire in 1167, together with five other churches, including the Dom. In the early thirteenth century (starting in 1208), the central nave of the church was built in the late-Romanesque style, making it among the oldest buildings in Salzburg. It was consecrated in 1221.\nBetween 1408 and 1450 Master Hans von Burghausen began work on the radiant Gothic choir to replace the Romanesque choir, which Stefan Krumenauer completed. A slender Gothic tower was added between 1468 and 1498. The church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and served as the parish church until 1635. In 1670, the archbishop ordered the top of the church's tower removed because it was taller than the cathedral tower. The tower was later restored in 1866 in the neo-Gothic style by Joseph Wessiken. In the eighteenth century, the church interior was redesigned in the baroque style. The \"Rosary\" of chapels behind the high altar date from the sixteenth century.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe church choir contains nine chapels decorated in baroque style by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach in the eighteenth century. The chapel behind the high altar has a winged marble altar that dates from 1561. The High Altar (1709) by Fischer von Erlach is made of red marble and gold. The central Madonna statue on the winged altar dates from the Late Gothic period (1495-1498) and was sculpted by Michael Pacher of Tyrol. The staircase of the pulpit contains a marble lion from the 12th century standing over a man with a painful grimace on his face, pushing his sword into the belly of the lion. The triumphal arch holds frescoes by Conrad Laib.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Franziskanerkirche in Salzburg\" (13.

Stand back & enjoy if you do not want to become wet. The workmanship is amazing \u2013 from the 1600\u2019s built under",
          "These fountains and gardens were built by the Prince-ArchBishop in 1613. He created these whimsical and humorous fountains and gardens. Can only be seen on the tours which move along nicely and are very informative. Allows you to \"experience\" the ruler's love for surprises.",
          "I took the Hop on and off Bus [Yellow line] and it stops pretty much just outside where you enter the Schloss Hellbrunn water feature area. You have to walk around the corner to the ticket office and cafe area [also where the main entrance is to the castle/schloss]. The cost for",
          "I was really looking forward to this as I had heard that it was fun and a little different. We were told that the tour would be in English however the tour was spoken in German mainly with only a little English spoken. I felt that the tour guide did not fully explain the idea",
          "I wasn't going to the fountain tour originally, but I'm really glad I did! It's very neat to see the different types of fountains and displays they created with the moving water. It's crazy to think this giant place was just an entertainment location for someone hundreds of",

          "Very interesting place considering it was build 400 years ago. Be prepared to be quite wet if your guide is a bit mischievous. And protect your electronics as water fountains are springing from less suspected places.",
          "Beautiful 17th-century palace & gardens with \u201ctrick fountains\u201d. The \u201ctrick fountains\u201dtour was very entertaining and is highly recommended. Expect to get a little wet!",
          "We went to the Trick Fountains with no idea of how much fun it would be. This is a guided tour only and tickets need to be bought. there is a new tour every 15 minutes. Our guide was informative and really funny. We had a great time, feeling like a kid jumping around while",
          "Hellbrun is easily reachable by bus from Salzburg and takes just a few minutes to get there. The bus costs about 2 euros a person each way. The palace itself has some cool rooms but has mostly been turned into a museum which makes it feel like it's lost some of it's original",

          "It turns out that the former Archbishop of Salzburg had a warped sense of humor: at this, his country retreat, he would hold elaborate dinner parties at specially-designed tables that would spray water all over his guests at inopportune moments. So when taking the guided tour:",
          "We were positively surprised by the \"wasserspiele\". Although you know there is chance of getting wet, I now think that it is impossible not to get wet as the water can come from any angle. Not a problem during last month's heat wave though! You have to pay to get access to the",

          "but that is only if you're afraid of getting damp. You will get damp, but you'll have fun doing it. We had a blast guessing just where the water would come from next, and we seldom guessed correctly. There are lots of great things to do and see in Salzburg, but this one tops the",

          "You are walking through a corner of the grand baroque park surrounding Castle Hellbrunn, where skilled craftsmen of the time built grottos and mechanical theatres with moving figures, all powered by water pressure in hidden pipes. This is the legacy of the 17th century",

          "There are many places that claim to have \u201cPleasure Gardens\u201d but the Wasserspiele at Hellbrunn with trick fountains are out on their own. I\u2019d rather not spoil the plot, but any visitor who emerges from the guided tour and hasn\u2019t a) got slightly wet and b) had a few real surprises",
          "Hellbrunn Palace is famous with its trick fountains. Upon arrival, buy your ticket 12.50 euros (included palace with audio guide and guided English/German fountains tour) and note your tour time. Tours generally go on the half-hour. The 40-minutes tour takes your laughing and",
          "Lots to see! Can't believe all they have set up in the water works! And this was done so many years ago! The history and beauty is great. Don't miss this. I waited and meant to see this several times for the past 45 years- finally saw it. So glad I did.",
          "You remember the famous scene from The Sound of Music when Leisl and Rolf sang \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" and jumped from bench to bench in the gazebo. This palace has the gazebo on its grounds, and, for me, was worth visiting just for that! You cannot go inside it but can",
          "Our teenager loved this and we all found it fun and interesting. I thought I was clever enough to avoid getting wet but found out I wasn't! Luckily it was a warm day! We only did this on a whim when we were searching for the Sound of Music gazebo, but found it really worth",
          "Guided tour of the fountains not to be missed! The group I was in included a group of retired people who were clearly anxious to avoid getting wet but didn\u2019t manage to avoid it! House is lovely to, well worth and visit and you can walk to the zoo next door.",
          "Wasserspiele Hellbrunn is a beautiful building which is painted in yellow and the garden in front is very nice",
          "This is one of the palaces where many scenes of the movies were shot. If you take Sound of Music tour then you can see this place as part of the tour. Otherwise also by using bus service, you can reach here. Huge property, lush green gardens and lawns, walkways and famous Gazibo",
          "Took bus ride to this beautiful place just outside the city on our own. From the bus stop, have a long walk to this great countryside estate. Great views and experience. Took lunch at Cafe, the food and service are great. Going home, took another bus ride from the back of the",
          "Interesting and amusing experience, included in Salzburg card offer. It is not just interesting but also surprising.",
          "What a fun place to visit. You better be prepared for a few water surprises along the way, though. Several ways to get here. We took bus 25 to and from. If you stop by a tobacco shop you can get a day pass for \u20ac4 vs. \u20ac2.70 one way from the driver. The guide we had was a fun",

          "On of the best experience in Salzburg and the best one of Salzburg card. Tour guide takes 40 minutes and it really worth it! We had a great girl guider with good English skill and also she made a fun. I didn\u2019t expect this kind of guide when we got a tickets, but if you wanna see",
          "Granted I hadn\u2019t read up on the risk of getting soaked at 67, but was disappointed at the contrite attitude, not just of the button-presser in the hip baseball cap, but also of the counter staff, quite emotionless when I turned up soaked, with the grande geste of, \u2018We can give",

          "The visit in the gardens of Hellbrun castle is a real treat. Getting wet is guaranteed even if you think you can avoid it. The guide will take you to see all the fun treats that were hidden in the garden and in each place you can expect a little surprise. Highly recommended",
          "Luckily when we went to Hellbrunn it was a beautiful and very hot summer day, so we could fully enjoy the water games in the gardens. Sprays and gushes suddenly come out of statues and caves, surprising visitors, and even if the talented guide makes you understand that something",
          "Guided tours in different languages all day-- the main house is interesting, the Sound of Music gazebo is in the garden-- and then there are the fountains! The tour is informative, and the water surprises are everywhere. Your shoes and clothes will get wet unless you are very",

          "The tour is within the gardens of the hellbrun castle... it is 30 mins and expect to get wet. There's no English only tour. So you have to share it with German speakers, so guides mostly focusing on german. Kids will enjoy it as will definitely get wet, but apart from that, not",
          "We stopped here on our way into Saozburg, we were delighted to stumble on the gazebo from the Sound of music the minute we wandered into the grounds. Beautiful house looking a lot like the sound of music house, in fact we tough it was until we found the real house front from the",
          "About 20 minutes outside of Salzburg is a beautiful home with sweeping grounds. Tours are given to explain the history. Don't miss the trick fountains or simply wander the grounds. You can spend and hour or stay for for a few!",
          "The main and only reason to visit here is the guided tour at the gardens whit the water attractions. Refreshing stop in the way to Salzburg. Short tour but the kids had a lot of fun.",
          "The famous attraction for foreigners is the film the Sound of Music pavilion, which is now moved to this palace. The pavilion sits in a corner but the larger park area is marvellous. The gardens are beautifully maintained and fountains are delightful. It is worth to spend half",
          "The fountains were installed some 400 years ago, mainly to entertain the Archbishop of the time at what was his summer residence. The area can only be viewed on a guided tour and all visitors should be prepared to get wet at some point during the tour as the surprise element",
          "Our family, including our three teen daughters, really enjoyed the fountains tour. The history was interesting and the fountains were clever. Our tour guide gave us a good mix if info about the designer/owner and the gardens. We bought the Salzburg City Card and it allowed",
          "It was raining throughout our entire visit, but the visit was still totally worthwhile. The museum inside is interesting, but the fountains steal the show (they operate even in the rain). When you arrive, buy your fountain tour ticket for the next show (given in English also)",
          "Take a look at the flowers on the ceiling in the crown grotto. They are the same as the flowers in Dom Salzburg. Same architect! Very cool.",
          "This review is about the trick fountains. We really enjoyed our visit there. Very interesting fountains. It's amazing that these fountains were 400 years old. Be careful, you can get a little wet!",
          "We enjoyed the boat ride to Hellbrunn, and spent the afternoon on the palace grounds. A special tour of the Prince\u2019s water fountains was a perfect antidote to the heat of the day!",
          "Very funny tour with the water fountains games. I recommend doing it on a hot summer day :) you must get wet!",
          "Went with 7 people, including 3 late teens. The castle itself was underwhelming, and the dancing waters ok, but didn't really need a tour guide or getting wet. They were sort of cute, but 10 minutes would be enough, seriously. (Not just my opinion, but 7 people's.) The grounds",
          "Easily accessible on the number 25 bus which runs every 20 minutes from various stops on both the left and right banks of the river. The journey takes about 15 minutes. Be prepared to stand though as the bus can get quite busy with school trips. On the bus there is a display",
          "This is one beautiful part of Salzburg both adults and children will love. To imagine how brilliantly this must have been created centuries ago is almost beyond me ! The fountains and the guide keep you on your toes throughout !",
          "A magical, beautiful and most exciting trick fountains to be experienced and enjoyed by both adults and children ! Our guide was excellent & gave us a wonderful story by story experience of it all !",
          "It was very interesting to see how the system of ancient fountains works. With very informative guide, our sightseeing was very refreshing and fun!",
          "You don't need me to tell you that something called \"trick fountains\" is awesome. Just imagine your favorite water park, except it was built in the 1600s and there's water shooting out of literally EVERYTHING. I wanted to do it five more times.",
          "This was an enjoyable excursion out of the city. It's easy to get to by bus, but make sure you don't miss the stop or you'll take a nice tour of the Austrian country side (actually not a bad way to spend time.) The tour of the fountains was fun and the guide was good (it's",
          "We visited on a fine day taking the no 25 bus from outside the police station beside the river at the old quarter. Using the Salzburg Card the bus, and entry fee was all included. The bus was very easy - it gave the next three stops giving us plenty of notice where we needed to",
          "Don't do too much research about it and just go. If you do too much reading it will be less fun. The whole thing absolutely relies on surprise. It is interesting to see a fun place that was constructed 300 years ago or so. These people had a nice sense of humor. I thought it",
          "This was a fun place to visit, at this location there was the magic fountains which is a fun place to visit with the family and the Wasserspiele Hellbrunn mansion and its grounds is a beautiful place to see.",
          "If you need a rest after the rush in the city this is the perfect place. You will get a funny and impressing tour and you can walk around as long as you like. For sure, many are doing the tour. But in the garden you easily find a quiet and lovely place...",
          "Whilst a little way out of the town it is easily accessible from the \"Hop on - Hop off\" bus and well worth the visit if you need a little peace and relaxation. The gardens are simply stunning and there are many places to sit and rest and to take in the stunning scenery. The",
          "The park itself is free (except for the extortionate parking) Within the free area is a large park with kids play area and open spaces. If you have a nice day come and bring a picnic for the day. There are different car parks at different prices so check the costs before",
          "The trick water fountains at Hellbrun are amazing and especially fun on a hot day. The water diaorama playing Mozart was amazing. Worth the visit.",
          "We saw this on our Hop on Hop off tour and with our Salzburger card, got the Trick Fountain tour free. If you don't want to get wet, then let your guide know at the beginning! However, it's a nice cool off tour on a hot day! Give yourself time to wonder, the gardens and ponds",
          "I had Salzburg card and had visited it. Otherwise it is not worth to go out of town to see the trick fountains, after paying for the ticket. Only if you are done with Salzberg old town more than couple of times and have extra time, then only visit it. Else be in old town only,",
          "Funny fountains - you will not expect when you can get showered :-), guide's interesting commentary, highly recommended!",
          "The hellbrunn palace with its garden is one of the nice relaxing place in salzburg. Its even suitable for day trip if you stay around salzburg. Wasserspiele is one time enjoyment. Most importantly if you have salzburg card, its entry is included.",
          "The fountains are not tricky. The tour guides are tricky. They turn on the water at just the right times so the attendees get wet. I'm sure they all laugh. If you don't want to get wet, skip the tour of the fountains and go through the castle.",
          "This place is surprisingly brilliant! Our guide spoke in English for us, and absolutely made our afternoon as he really made it so much fun! Our daughters were delighted to be drenched on a hot sunny afternoon, running back & forth through the fountains which were spurting out",
          "We wnt through the water attraction of Hellbrunn and it was not only expressing but also a interesting and funny experience and we liked it very much!",
          "Not to miss this tricky fountain. It showcases the tech savvy attitude of the then King & the way it is executed it is excellent. We took a guided tour with a lady and she was amazing. It was fun to be with her",
          "The trick fountains of Hellbrunn can only be experienced with a guided tour. The tours are timed, so be sure to be at the gate at the specified time. We arrived around 10:00 in the morning, purchased tickets, and needed to wait less than 30 minutes until the beginning of the",
          "We took bus 25 using the Salzburg Card from our downtown Salzburg hotel to Helbrunn Palace in about 15 minutes, then gained entry again with our Salzburg card. As the other reviews mention, the palace is pretty but simple, and the museum is a quick visit, but the main",
          "The park is lovely, the Museum is very quick and interesting, but the highlight of the visit is the Wasserspiele tour. The guide makes it interesting and you appreciate the engineering that went into the features, and powered only by water, and engineered hundreds of years",
          "One needs to separate reviews of the schloss from this fascinating example of 17th century water-based 'technology' - or really inventiveness - of the engineer, Marcus Sitticus. His trick-fountain garden was created to provide a whimsical and infantile amusement for the",
          "So much fun and joy during the 45 mins guided tour, water comes out everywhere unexpectedly and will get very wet. Interesting mechanics and design. Highly recommended",
          "In the suburb of Salzburg the place and a garden- the main attraction us the water tricks. Founded by Archbishop of Salzburg in the 17 century and it's still works-A garden filled with sculptures, pools and fountains, open and hidden, intended to amuse and entertain the guests",
          "Though it is considered for kids would love the place, as adults we enjoyed ourselves a lot. Our guide was a humourous lady with smooth English. The atmosphere is joyful which the place was built for by Archbishop Marcus Sittikus.",
          "After reading the reviews, I wanted to check the \"wasserspiele\". They offer a guided tour in German and English (the girl talks in German and then in English) which lasts for about 20-30 minutes and costs 8 euro for students. You get to see some really interesting fountains and",
          "In the pre-Disney days that could be a nice and exiting place to visit especially in hot days. But once you understand the way this place works watering the surprised guests it is a danger place for ones camera. Be prepared or came with small children they will love it",
          "It's a bit far from the city center (you have to take a bus for some time and then walk a bit, but you'll eventually get to Hellbrunn castle and water \"play\". You and your group will have much fun, enjoy some shade and learn fun facts. Totally worth it!",
          "Walk in the morning around the fountain and feel the freshness of flowers everywhere, it will remembrance so people you loves.",
          "There are a lot of different things inside, playground for children near the entrance , great tour in Wasserspiele Hellbrunn not only for kids, a lot of water surprises , beautiful architecture, museum and stone theater next to it , a lot of flowers",
          "I suggest taking the guided tour so that you maximize the experience. It's quite a place. Plan to take the bus and spend the day!",
          "This is a fun place to go to see the 17th century mind at work, both in terms of its playfulness and its keen interest in mechanical science. This was the day residence of the Archbishop, but it is all tricked out with practical jokes involving water by the engineer of the day",
          "Do this only when the weather is good (23 degrees and plus). Most get just a little wet, some a little more. But it is so much fun, you never know what to expect. The entire tour, I think, was not even half an hour but is included in your ticket to the \"schloss\".",
          "Trickfountains are very nice to visit! The tours go very regularly, when I visited they went every 15 minutes so you don't have a long waitingtime. During the tour you walk through the garden and see a lot of grotto's and 'waterfun' that the owner of the palace installed. If I",
          "They have done a great job with this site. Kudos to the caretakers who have maintained the original system to share with us in the 21st century! The tour guides are very good, very playful. You do not need to book with a tour company to see the water tour. Just go to Schloss",
          "A fantastic Garden , historic Fish-Pools inside, a huge Castle with a great Restaurant - easy to go with the local Bus",
          "The Wasserspile Hellbrunn tour was really fun and the guide made the tour interesting. On an hot summery the tour was \"refreshing\" in a positive way. And don't forget to visit also in the folklore museum up the hill.",
          "The inventor definitely had a sense of humour. Buy the tickets immediately as you come to the venue, you might wait for your entry - you can fill the time up by looking inside the castle or the gardens. And be prepared to get all wet. But it's worth it.",
          "Not just another Schloss. This fun-park for the elite is a water fountain play toy extravaganza...we took the private tour...worth it.",

          "I wasn't going to go to here initially, but decided to make a day of it with the Untersburg Cable Car because it was on the Salzburg Card (both are really good and were really easy to travel between). It was in fact probably the highlight of going to Salzburg so I'm glad we",
          "We came to see the summer house and you can get to it for free. The gardens are nice to walk around and the fountains are loads of fun. The tour is guided and in different languages. We got a bit wet at the very end but it was worth it.",
          "This was a fun place to visit! It is an amazing display of engineering genius! Hard to believe one man came up with these cool fountains & other things that run by water! Yes, you will get wet! I enjoyed the fountains and gardens. And you can see the Sound of Music gazebo! Fun",
          "First of its kind.. atleast the one i have seen so far.. we had an enterprising guide aswell.. It was fun filled 60 minutes of tour with people laughing and screaming over the water falling on them from the fountain and equally informative as the guide clearly explained",
          "In fact, this place is not in the near of the city centre. But it is worth the cost to visit. Best times to visit between the late April and late September. There are a lot of people, but you can enjoy the feeling of the place.",
          "Famous for its glorious gardens, the Hellbrunn Palace is also known for its trick fountains. Built by a wealthy archbishop with a lot of money and too much time on his hands, the palace itself resembles a Venetian villa. The most popular part of the grounds are the various",
          "The guide was definitely a trickster but it was an amazing experience! Guide warns you at the beginning about putting away electronics if you do not wish for them to get wet! Great idea for a hot sunny day!",
          "We've been to this attraction twice. The first time as a couple, the second time we took guests with us. Whilst we enjoyed the first tour we took here last year a bit more, this second visit was still entertaining and enjoyable. At the end of the day, a lot of the enjoyment",
          "The trick fountains are a bit corny but a huge delight. You never know where the next spray of water is going to come from and the guide made sure everyone got wet. It was 45 minutes of continuous laughter. The fountains are set in a beautiful park, an ideal place for strolling",
          "The Wasserspiele Hellbrunn is the mostly highlight in the early Baroque villa Hellbrunn Palace, it's a lovely trick fountains, you will enjoy a unique experience with all kinds of surprises, although water will squirt out of the jets and fountains, very nice !",
          "Hellbrunn is a nice place. However, one should be well aware the open and closing timings of this. Beautiful gardens, zoo , trick fountains....it's worth a visit",
          "This is definitely worth the time and money. Unbelievable experience with trick fountains constantly surprising you. It is truly a wonder especially when you consider its history (from 18th century). The guides are well versed and keep you smiling and laughing. Delightful",
          "A must see if you happen to be in Salzburg. The magic or trick fountains are a must. It also brings back a lot of memories from the sound of music.",

          "The Austrian guide was very proud of what he presented, skillfully switching between German and English. Nice walking tour where you will get a bit wet, but no worries, it's fun.",
          "Good place for a half day trip The garden is good for chill out The palace is a very small meseum that i think it is not so good The fountain garden can visit only buy guild tiur but worth to visit",
          "We only went as it was on way back from the cable car and free with the Salzburg card. We had a very funny couple of hours. The palace is charming in its own right and the museum exhibits add to this with more than a touch of eccentricity. Then we did the fountain tour. It was",
          "The palace has wonderful gardens. One can tour the fountains and water park separately. This takes about an hour. There are lot of fountains which operate without the knowledge of the tourists, so prepare to get wet, but its a very good experience and fun.",
          "The entirety of the Hellbrun palace is beautiful but the gardens are stunning. We went in the end of fall so the different colours made this place all the more special.The fountains were a bit overrated though.",

          "When we were there they were set up up for a Krampus event, but the gardens were maintained beautifully and i was glad the fountains were off as it was below freezing",
          "We enjoyed the area of Hellbrunn itself, riding there with a bike hired from our hotel. I was keen to see the trick fountains but found this attraction very boring. We were meant to be on the English tour yet the gate attendant turned us away, allowing others to join,",
          "Although the fountains were not operational when we visited in December, the tile and coral like material, statutes, and mosaics were beautiful. Less visitors and more chance to enjoy the sight in winter.",

          "The guide was very friendly. The fountains were amazing and the walk was very pleasant. It is an engineering feat.",
          "Wonderful place to visit and enjoy the parks, fountains. Also to spent a nice day there, very intersting. Not miss it.",

          "Our guide said expect to get wet and he wasn't wrong but it was hilarious! The water tricks are so clever and the workmanship excellent.",
          "We have visited the Hellbrunn in the last sunny and warm day of this autumn. The very good surprise for us were water fountains and the guided tour there. The guide was perfect and made this an amazing experience with lot of surprises, most of them wet ;-) It is better to visit",

          "Very peaceful. Lots to see and do here. I enjoyed the sound of music references, but there was more than that! The trick fountains were fun and I know our kids would have loved the playpark had they been with us. Well worth a visit...easy to access on 25bus. And the Salzburg",
          "These water fountains etc. are interesting, but I wasn't in awe of them. We had a voucher so only paid 3 Euros, don't think I'd want to pay more to see them.",
          "Very entertaining and fun tour, where you're bound to get wet. A little. Very interesting fountains with very detailed architecture. It's amazing that it was built so long ago just for the purpose of entertaining guests, or rather being entertained from guests being tricked!",
          "river trip which included a visit to Hellbrunn - would like to have spent more time in the beautiful surroundings but worth a quick look to wet your appetite",
          "Great fun and considering the technology of yesteryear very clever. Wear clothes that dry quickly and forget about your hair or take an umbrella (cowards way out in my book though). Very glad we went!",
          "very funny at Salzburg's hot days period... feel like Aristokrates in former centuries. Take the tour at the Schloss as well and enjoy a glimpse of history",
          "Although I had visited many years ago, The return trip was just as enjoyable, made more so by the very knowledgeable and humourous tour guide. Well worth a visit.",
          "excellent stop! would've loved to go in to see the trick fountains! imagine this whole place was built up as a party ground for a guy with a wicked sense of humor",
          "I knew there was trick fountains, but I had no idea I would end up completely drenched. I've never laughed so hard. Water was coming from every direction and its hard to leave this dry. Best you go on a warm day. This is perfect for kids and adults.",
          "Visited the Wasserspiele with a family from toddlers to grandparents and fun was had by all. We went on a fine day, so the kids really enjoyed getting wet. A great day out with a nice finale at the playground in hellbrunn",
          "I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the trick fountains. It started off a bit disappointing, but it got better as we made our way through the tour. Overall, it was a unique experience that I probably wouldn't visit more than once, but if you have half a day to spare while in",
          "This was great fun, but it was a very hot day, so getting soaked at one point came as quite a relief! You can avoid it if you have your wits about you - I didn't! The ingenuity of earlier centuries is fascinating.",
          "The gardens at Hellbrun are a treat. They were laid out by a bishop with a sense of humour who liked to play tricks on his guests. I say no more of this as it would spoil the enjoyment and surprises of a visit",
          "Lovely gardens, but not what we expected, the trick fountains we found to be very disappointing. I would say don't go if you have difficulty walking around as a lot of the way is wet, and we also felt the tours should have been for smaller numbers, as you didn't get to see a lot",
          "A visit to the 400 year old Hellbrunn palace and the gardens was worth the 25 minutes bus ride from Mirabell Platz. The trick fountain guided tour was quite interesting and amusing. We were certainly not prepared that the tricks were going to be played on us too. These tiny",
          "Helbrunn is definitely worth to visit, and the Wasserspiele is the enjoyable attraction for adults and for the children. Especially on a good day when you are not afraid to get wet. There is a nice palace and a park with a wonderful playground to visit after the Wasserspiele",

          "We biked there which was a very nice trip (less than 6 km) We did not enjoy so much the magic fountain, but it would be a fun activity with kids",
          "It was a fun tour with all the fountain tricks around the palace.. after getting wet, you can sit, relax, and have your clothes dry at the palace garden(park) or you can continue your tour at the museum and/or at the Salzburg zoo.",
          "We had THE BEST guide to show us around this amusing and unique attraction. The Archbishop (I think) who created it had a wicked sense of humour, and you need to be prepared to get into the spirit of this place. Basically, the guy was fascinated with water! He made tricks and",
          "Imposing, funny, interesting and surprising. This place is well worth a visit if only to admire the folly of the times. Children will love it, the water tricks are amazing. You need about 2 hours to see all",

          "The Wasserspiele (Trick Fountains) is one of those fun activities, especially when travelling with kids on a hot summer day. A bonus is that there is a few more things to do in the area (Park, Sound of Music pavilion, palace visit and the zoo a little further) What I liked:",

          "as a visitor for the fountain, you need to buy a so=called combi ticket, which allows you to enter the castle and to see some of the water fountains, not all of them, just a few. be prepared that you get wet, even if you tell the guide you dont need it, you will get wet. big",
          "Great tour to experience the trick fountains exactly as they were 400 years ago! Kids will love getting wet and it's good fun watching everyone having a laugh! Perfect on a hot day and genuinely fascinating to see all the different sections of the water gardens. Tour guide had a",

          "Funny and very interesting guided attraction in the parc of Hellbrun castle. The \"water tricks\" are just amazing and beautiful and please the whole family. An advice: before you go to see the water tricks, watch the video in the visitor's centre. It explains very well the whole",

          "This was the best thing we did in Salzburg! Very nice area in the parc where the trick fountains are, nice guided tour. Interesting and fun with the old fountains, grottos etc. A shame you weren't allowed to stroll the area yourself after the tour. Also would have been better",
          "At first glance, this is a rather expensive experience at \u20ac12 each (students \u20ac8). However, this does include entrance into the palace and the museum.

          "We had a great time... We really liked the fountains and the grottos. It is amazing that they have been there more than 200 years ago and that they were made for a king... Kids and adults had so much fun. Kids got really wet and the adults were very careful to not get wet and it",
          "The guided tour of the 'trick fountains' is a great way to spend an hour. But be prepared to get wet! The gardens are beautiful, and provided you have good weather it is a lovely place to visit. Easily accessible via public transport from Salzburg.",
          "You will get wet, but probably not soaked. The fountains are definately the highlight of this event - however there is a small palace and numerous gardens to look at. The pavilion from the Sound of Music is also here.",
          "I had a lovely afternoon here. I joined the tour of the waterfalls with the obligatory soaking, and then had a couple of idyllic hours wandering the gardens. Sound of Music fans will know that the gazebo from the Von Trapps' garden eventually found its way into the Heilbrunn",
          "it happened to be a very warm day when we visited the trick fountains and we had a great time. This is a fun place",
          "I especially chose this attraction to appeal to my 13-year-old son, who has always loved animatronics, but my entire family of four (with 21-year-old daughter) had a great time. You must know that the tour guide can selectively target whom to merely squirt and those you get",
          "Its a real fun to visit here, its fun for family with children, romantic couple and for everyone.. water fountain with a palace and Zoo beside..",
          "pleasant and nice experience at trick fountains especially on hot sunny day. the palace itself is not that rich to visit and see compared to other palaces in Europe.",

          "Hellbrunn castle and garden with the trick fountains (built in the 1600s) were a hoot! My 16 year old was mesmerized as were we all!",
          "Calling all kids - big and small! This is a fun way to spend a few hours, and to enjoy the humour of an old Archbishop! Ensure that your camera and phones are safely put away, you will definitely get wet!",
          "the fountains are surprising and playful. we had a guide who made it a fun experience. beyond the castle park is a huge playground and great area for walking",
          "This is an extremely interesting place with a nice museum and gardens but the highlight is the \"tricky fountains\" which I won't describe in detail as it will spoil the surprise. It is a lot of fun and the kids will love it as well as their parents",
          "Very charmin country residence, beautiful park and enchanting water games. Perfect place also if you have children, they will never forget this visit",
          "Visited Hellbrunn when I was 8 years old and this was on my list to do again (many years later). I remember the trick fountains especially the table, and wanted to surprise my spouse. We had a wonderful time and it was so much fun to see it all again. The palace section is also",
          "Pretty cool to wander around, the tour guide was good and entertaining, easily switched between German and English",
          "Visited the palace in the evening. The fountains were fun. Kids just loved it. Highly recommended, especially on a sunny afternoon. Was amazed at the technology used to build these fountains. They are 200 years old!",
          "We went late in the evening so we got in the last tour of the trick fountains. It was fun and impressive. Very good bilingual (german/english) guide, he told us all about the bishop who built the palace and his practical jokes.",
          "I think this was the most interesting landmark of Salzburg. Located on the outskirts of Salzburg it is a renaissance villa with landscaped gardens. The spectacular part is the trick fountains and the water games. The guide takes you from attraction to attraction providing you",
          "We had a fabulous day at Hellbrunn, the kids loved the trick fountains and the gardens and grounds were delightful. An added bonus was the Sound of Music gazebo and the views of the mountains from the lookouts behind the Monattsschossl. Easy to get to on the bus from Salzburg",
          "The archbishop who built this palace had a sense of humor: during the Wasserspiele( water games), you will either get soaking wet or still a bit damp, whether it is at the Roman table or elsewhere. Water comes spouting out at the most unexpected places. Your tour guide will warn",
          "This is quite entertaining and the fountains are beautifully created.Visits are every 10-15 minutes but you may have to wait a while so buy your ticket the moment you reach the palace and then go round the building (a bit dull) first. When I went there were so many people there",
          "This is the greatest fun - I first visited over 30 years ago and it still did not disappoint. Keep your companions in the dark on the surprises and it will add to their visit.",
          "Very nice trip on august 13. In The summer open until 9pm. The guide for water Games at 7pm tour was very good and explained also the engineering of the machines. Also the palace is interesting. Worth to go.",
          "We spent a couple of hours here on our way back from a long trip to the Untersberg. The palace itself was small but worth a quick visit and we enjoyed the audio guide self tour. The so called Trick Fountains are fun and the gardens are very pretty. In the grounds you will",
          "Try to go on a sunny day, the amusing water surprises will seem far better when the sun is shining. Nice cafe and an interesting museum. The grounds are very nicely laid out and are good to walk around for a while. Entry fee included in the Salzburg card and only a fairly short",

          "Beautiful and great fun for the kids on a hot day. Worth taking a break from the summer heat while touring Salzburg in the summer heat. In addition to the tour of the trick fountains the house is interesting and the audio guide (in multiple languages) was also good. It gave",
          "I just completed writing a three star review entitled \"overrated/underrated\" for the Salzburg Fortress. I mentioned the Schloss Hellbrunn as the site that we felt was underrated and far more interesting. I should have called it the \"Wasserspiele Hellbrunn\" since I now notice",
          "We really recommend visiting this beautiful summer palace, the water fountains are amazing and shows how people used to entertain themselves during hot weather. It is better to take the guided tour",
          "The fountains are beautiful and interesting to explore. The guide late quite a while (around 50 minutes) so we felt it was good value for money. We used our Salzburg card to get the number 25 bus to Hellbrunn and for entry to the fountains and the palace. The guide was very",

          "The gardens and trick fountains at Hellbrunn are as magical as when they were first opened. You will get wet! But go with it and it's a lovely experience to laugh and squeal as you are shown round by the friendly and informative staff",
          "Since this was on our Salzburg card, we stopped in on the ride home from Untersberg. The mansion has a guided audio tour which was easy to use and very informative. You get a time ticket to tour the trick fountains, and it\u2019s an awesome tour! *Note- you will get wet on this",
          "The trick fountains tour is a must do especially if you have kids. If it is not too cold, you dont need to carry any spare clothing as it is not really that wet.",
          "Though Hellbrunn is a bit off the beaten path, it's worth a visit while you're in Salzburg. The palace and grounds are beautiful and both can be walked at your own pace, with audioguides available for the palace. The palace interior has informational displays in every room, but",
          "A nice place with lovely grounds, though a little away from the town. But it is worth the travel up to it.",
          "Hellbrunn is a special place with something for all ages. Sound of Music fans will be charmed to find the Pavillion from the ' I am 16 going on 17' scene and the Trick water fountains were the highlight for us. Incredible feat of engineering and the mechanical water powered",
          "It's a nice trip out on the bus and with a Salzburg card the bus and entrance are included. As well as the 'trick fountains' the house itself is interesting to visit, along with the gardens. The 'trick fountain' tour is fun and kids will certainly enjoy getting wet!",
          "This was a refreshing tour in the excessive summer heat. 100+F. Very good on historical points. Beautiful grounds.",
          "Definitely recommend Hellebrun as a stop for all ages. The waterworks are incredible and the ingenuity that went into making them hundreds of years ago is amazing. As other reviewers have noted, be prepared to get wet! You won't get soaked unless you voluntarily get quite close",
          "Lovely place to visit! The kids on the tour had a great time and loved the feeling of mischief to be found all around. The adults loved it too.",
          "This Hellbrunn palace gardens is famous for its water games designed in times past by Archbishop Markus Sttikus who had a keen sense of humour & who conceived these as a series of practical jokes performed on his guests.There are the hidden spray jets which at unexpected times",
          "I have been here now three times in three different visits to Salzburg. I just love the displays and it's always fun seeing the Japanese tourists get wet as they have the most hilarious reactions. The only thing I could comment on is that they could do a little better in getting",
          "This is an incredibly entertaining and kid friendly exhibit. It takes about thirty minutes and is guided. I don't want to ruin the surprise, so basically an Archbishop created a bunch of water fountains and water powered displays to amuse himself at the expense of his guests.",
          "A very good experience. Really enjoyed the water fun. Its really amazing how they manage to make all of these during the time. Really interesting! but prepare to be wet, no matter where you stand in the group.",
          "You can predict when you will get wet, so you can protect your camera, but if you are very picky about this, do not bring your camera. You cannot help but smile here. Watch for wet spots on the sidewalk to avoid the wettest areas to be sprayed.",
          "Hellbrunn is really worth visiting in summer. When it's really hot in the city, this refreshing tour is a breath of fresh air. Prepare to get wet, but it's definitely not the only reason to be there. Allow half day for this trip.",
          "A funny and interesting experience, to do by all means if the weather is nice. The guides are ok and the visit is original.",
          "The water garden tour was interesting and amusing but there are also extensive gardens to explore and a palace to visit, included in the price. We bought Salzburg cards (which are particularly good value) so our bus travel and entrance was covered by the card, as was our visit",
          "We went on a warm summer day and it was really fun to get occasionally sprayed with water. The tour guide was excellent - very informative.",
          "It was a really hot day when we (me, my husbend and our two boys, ages 9 and 14) visited Hellbrunn. Honestly, Hellbrunn was the funniest place we visited during one weeks holiday in Salzburg. And, because it was HOT day, the place was even funnier. If You have children about",
          "It was a dissappointment, that everything worth to see here needed an entrance ticket. If you are about to travel to Austria, go to Vienna. There's better places to see and even some of the castles are free. (At least when I visited 2010).",
          "Another wonderful Salzburg surprise! The gardens are fantastic and the imagination/engineering that comprised the water works is stunning!",
          "The gardens at Hellbrunn open late in the summer, which made this a good option for the evening. I spent an enjoyable few hours here, great place to take a picnic and most of the gardens are free except the trick fountains. The trick fountains are well worth a visit, the tour",
          "We arrived there by bus (number 25 from Mirabell Gardens - 15 to 20 minutes ride). We were very excited to see the fountains with the kids. It was a hot day. Perfect. That was before we knew that 1. you can't do the tour by yourself. It is exclusively with a guide, and 2. It",
          "Although a little our of town, this place is an excellent place to visit. The fountains were a treat and we were amazed at the intricacy of the fountains and all different types of moving wooden figures. It is really a statement of what people were capable of doing in those",
          "I thought it'd be just another castle and a look about the gardens but it's good fun! I don't want to give anything away but I was there on a beautiful warm day and it was perfect. Children in particular will love it. Take the time to walk to the stone theatre, it's a good walk",
          "great to visit the site and experience the whimsical delight that was a part of an older time. it is perfect for whole families to visit and enjoy",
          "the palace Hellbrunn is an ideal place to hangout on a sunny afternoon.The brigth colour of the building along with its well maintained garden and fountains gives a feeling of space and calm. The glass gazebo used in the Sound of Music is an added attraction for many tourists",
          "If you bought 24/48/72hrs Salzburg ticket, this place is a must for you. Each pass lets you have 3 X 200cc beer so three persons mean you get to taste all the beers here. The food here is very nice too.",
          "Travellers need to be warned that the water surprises could get their technology devices wet! The beautiful gardens have manny old water follies which are turned on for visitors. If you don't want to get wet, don't go! If you are relaxed about water, it's an amazing experience &",

          "I did not have a chance to visit the trick fountains, but I did get to tour the gardens/park. The gazebo that \"inspired\" the one used in the Sound of Music (SOM) was relocated here. The gazebo is small and locked, but you can still take nice pictures in front of it. The rest of",

          "Not just for kids - adults can unwind, listen to stories of how Bishop Markus Sittikus devised squirts of water to entertain his visitors or rather himself. The thrill is in guessing the sources of the next squirt/jet of water and to avoid getting wet. It can be refreshingly",
          "This is the Only palace in Austria where people laughed and enjoyed like crazy on a sightseeing tour..It was amusing to see water erupting out of most unexpected places and drenching visitors..My 5 yr old really enjoyed. Entry fees is 25 Euros for family and about 12euros for",
          "The tour that makes one wet ;-) as soon as you are at Hellbrunn, book the next available tour. While you wait, go around the palace (part of the tour ticket) and get back on time for the tour. During the tour, for sure, you get wet from one of the secret water jets switched on",
          "horrible! rude guide ... and not very \"tricky\"-if you see water on the floor, then expect some water. if you have expensive electronics on you, keep them covered at the parts where there may be water. the guide will intentionally try to get you wet (even if you stand back in",

          "It is just a 30-40-minutes bus ride and you are in Hellbrunn. The water is coming to you in the most funny way, you should be careful not to be completely wet. It is a very joyful attraction for young and old as well.",
          "This was a great place to visit - fun and impressive. Loved that the ticket was inclusive of all the facilities available.",
          "This water palace is fun guided tour and would be enjoyed by kids especially. The tour has water games whose fountains uses ancient methods (rather than pumps). It would have been marvelous and entertaining in those times. Not so much today !! It can be easily reached using bus",
          "Fabulous !! So much fun. So easy to get to on the No. 25 bus from Salzburg...Went on the guided tour which was fantastic...great guide and great fun....kids just love this !! All free with the Salzburg card.... Lucky it was a very hot day as it is difficult to stay dry !!!",

          "We came here for the day and it's a great place. It's not far from the autobahn and it costs 3.6 euros to park the car all day. The car park is also right next to the children's play area which has plenty of shade for a picnic. Toilets are also very close by. There is a cafe and",

          "This \u201cWasserspiele\u201d is a fun experience if you want to be sprayed with water. Maybe anyone doesn\u2019t like it. On the tour the guide told us about the waterpark and suddenly water is sprayed up on you. You want to avoid that and the water is then coming from the another side. If it",
          "In my opinion this is one of the funnest tours we did. Have a sense of humor and expect to get a little bit wet and you will thoroughly enjoy this tour. It lasts about an hour and goes into the garden area where it is somewhat interactive. My children loved this tour! And so did",
          "Hands down, one of the best and quirkiest attractions out there! There are so many different elements to this place and we had a great day. Be prepared to get wet though, there's no escaping it really, and why would you want to?! Don't get confused thinking its some kind of",
          "The whole park is very pleasant but don't miss the water features ... or rather miss them if you object to getting wet. Terrific guide kept us guessing about where the water would come from next and the whole experience was very enjoyable. But take care with your camera if it's",
          "The grounds and palace are nice but what makes this place truly special are the fountains. The tour guides possess the sort of campy humor one would find on Disney's Jungle Cruise and are not above getting anyone caught in the water spray. All-in-all it was an informative, fun",
          "Fountain Show made is worth visiting, this place. Please check the show timings before going to the palace..",
          "The trick fountains make Hellbrunn well worth visiting even if gardens and palaces aren't generally your thing (although I should probably say that I love a good landscaped garden), and the water is very refreshing on a hot day. The rest of the grounds are beautifully landscaped",
          "The Hellbrunn trick fountains are truly amazing. I am amazed that this much effort was put into something so fun in the 17th century and that it still works. You will join a tour that guides you through this rather small area but it is pack with small and large water driven",
          "The Wasserspiele or Hellbrunn Trick Fountains are very interesting place even for both children and elders. Ticket cost is Euro 10.50 for adult and a free entry for this guided tour is included in Salzburg Card. Besides this guided tour through trick fountains, Hellbrunn",
          "If you are looking to visit a place near Salzburg, I highly recommend that you visited this place. It's near Salzburg, within 15 minute driving distance. A nice big garden with beautiful scenery!",
          "My 3 Year son enjoyed here most.. When we arrived here, we just thought that its a Palace we are going to visit.. After arriving here, The Guide from here will offer a seat of a big dining table... & then he shower all of us with hidden shower & then we realized that its tricky",
          "Well run tour and worth going to see how the rich lived, the history of the gardens was interesting and well worth the entrance fee.",
          "The palace isn't that big but the grounds around the place are huge. They are beautiful with fountains and ponds which add to the beauty of the scenery. The guided audio tour is a superb way of going through the palace. The small fountain works and the mechanical scenery that is",

          "Loved the Helbrunn Palace and grounds tour. Fortunately, our wonderful tour guide was kind enough not to spray us with water on this 40 degree day! Loved it so much and my son had a dream to visit this castle since his high school German teacher told him about it 7 years ago.",
          "The tour is very informative and entertaining. Be prepared to get wet. We liked the demonstrations and the historical information. It is amazing that these fountains are so old and still working. this is a must see when visiting Salzburg.",
          "Oh, fairyland. All the trees were lit up and the stalls just added to the atmosphere. It is the first time we had visited and loved it. The petting zoo and the extra space made it superb for children",
          "I would say this place is a work of art using the simple principles of science. Running water has kinetic energy and can be smartly converted into other forms e.g.mechanical, sound etc. The place is both interesting and fun for all ages. One can learn too. Great for kids. Not",
          "The day we visited here was a sunny and very bright day. We were not told that during winter the palace was closed so we did not have the chance to go inside. However since the wet weather was lovely the garden was marvelous and we had a great time. At the back of the palace",
          "I would definitely recommend this place as one of the things to do in Salzburg. You get a nice person guiding your group around the water playground ... talking about its tricks, purpose etc Tour is around 45minutes long... then you are free to explore the rest of the gardens",
          "We went to the zoo and decided to take a look as the car park was packed solid. We really enjoyed ourself the grounds are nice but the Christmas market stalls and entertainment was the best in Salzburg. From petting pens, pony rides and fire pits for marshmallows, all reasonably",
          "This park is amazing! Its tricky water fountains a pure fun!!! Strongly reccomended for families, couples, friends or even alone, it's fun for people for every ages. Just don't get scared about the water, you will certainly get a little bit wet, but nothing that will compromise",
          "This is a place to visit to see the exterior and grounds of a castle/mansion and includes the famed pavilion included in scenes for the Sound of Music, although there is a fee for enter that portion. Otherwise, there is no fee to enter the grounds.",
          "The Trick Fountain tour gives you a look at the whimsical sense of humor that people had hundreds of years ago and you realize that that humor was not too different from today. People still laugh at getting squirted with water from unexpected places. It also gives you a look at",
          "The show with the fountais is OK, but the guide only wants to get you wet. when there is 5 degrees, its quite unpleasent! During spring and summer is perfect.",
          "I enjoyed a funny moment with the trick fountain and mechanical puppets. Thanks for the tours who repeated his words in English for me (I am the only non-German speaker in the tour).",
          "This something so different from what we have ever seen before lots of fun especially if you did not mind getting wet.Nothing I did not like about it just good fun.",
          "We loved this tour. It was very informative and the fountains were really cool to see but most importantly the tour guide did a great job of surprising us and had everyone laughing. He was turning on the different fountains without even looking at them and catching people when",
          "I was not very keen on going here as you can only get in as part of a tour and can not explore on your own, but this was great!!!! The guide is quite funny and the waterfountains and games are amazing. You can not come to Salzburg and miss this!",
          "It is an hour or so of fun. Do not expect huge fountains, but elaborate small structures like rooms with hidden nozzles, mechanical organ, ... Everything is located inside of Hellbrunn castle, which can be reached by bus line 25 from town center. So, if you like history & water,",
          "We stopped of at the palace after going up the Untersberg as it is on the same bus line from Salzburg (line 25). We are glad we did. We had a guided tour around the trick fountains which was good fun and very informative. The guide spoke excellent English. We then went around",
          "We laughed a lot and I would have never thought that something 300 years old will provide so much fun. Take the tour and enjoy it!",
          "Did not know quite what to expect but this was an enjoyable afternoon for both my wife and I. We visited using our Salzburg Card but would have happily paid separately for this attraction. Amusing and entertaining with a few unexpected surprises and the good weather and sunshine",
          "The tickets are not cheap (get the family one if you can) but it was really fun. The gardens are also beautiful. Prepare to get wet !",
          "awesome guided tour...very interesting and loved the place.. tour starts at regular intervals and the duration is 30 minutes....highly reccomended",

          "It is outside the city can be reached by bus in 10-15 minutes. Also it is on the road of Untersberg so two visits can be connected. There is a guided tour here for these tricky fountains. It is a backyard and gardens of the place fully donated amazing water sourced fountains,",
          "Incredible water fountain trickery and amusement built in the 1600s. Excellent tours in English and German. Beautiful grounds. Take the same bus that goes to the Untersberg cable car.",
          "Absolute fun place to visit with young kids especially on hot noons. It's amazing to see the fountains functional after over 100 years of installation. The summer palace itself is not so great. One must definitely take the tickets to the trick fountains. Beware of you have",
          "Great to see what the people got up to in the old days ..... the mecahnics as to what can be done with water is justr amazing and will definitely amaze all kids and dads .....",
          "This is a place not to be missed when visiting Salzburg. Next to Hellbrun, you visit it with the same ticket with the castle. A place not to be missed. A true surprise.",
          "Liked that only a fairly small group of people went in together and a docent led us to many places explaining the history of the Palace. It was built as a summer home and used as a hunting lodge in around 1628. Our tour guide was very informative and seemed to enjoy her work.",

          "We visited the gardens with our 3 teenage children and they were great fun! A lot of interesting water features all working with water, didn't get too wet though, I was ready for more! An unusual place to go to, if the kids are bored of visiting museums and palaces!",
          "This is an absolutely magical water show in a beautiful setting. It is hard to describe the experience as there is really nothing like it but basically the water fountains dance to the rhythm of the water. Don't miss this on your visit to Salzburg.",
          "We didn't know what to expect when we entered Schloss Hellbrunn.. But I can tell you it is totally fabulous! My mum and I absolutely loved every single second.. The guide from Hellbrunn was just wonderful as he toured us through this fantastic and utterly magical place.. It",

          "Very nice visit, fountains are amazing and provide a lot of fun! Trip itself is relatively short, then you can have a walk in the palace garden. We were able to park just in the palace, price is low.",
          "Fun to see but even more interesting given the fact that all is driven by water power and the fact that all this was built 400 years ago and still works today. All movements and animal sounds made simply by water from a water wheel. Nice fun visit",
          "I have seen the insides of too many palaces and am jaded by it. When we decided to go to the palace and the fountains on our last day ( we had seen the gazebo a couple of days earlier in the sound of music tour) we caught the bus and were in the palace by 6.15 PM and the palace",
          "You will have a lot of laughs while seeing some amazing sites and water powered fountains that are over 400 years old! Great guides who speak English well. You can skip seeing the insides of the castle but don't miss these fountains and the guided tour! You will remember",
          "we only had a day in Salzburg and This was a very disappointing attraction. i thought we would be able to walk around the fountains but it was guided and they thought it was funny to get everyone soaking wet. Not very good for me when I am traveling for weeks and didn't bring",
          "This was way above our expectations. The guide spoke English very well. We only had to wait about 15 for our tour and we spent that time exploring the castle and the grounds. The fountains are spectacular and intricate. And there are little mechanical \" theaters\" set up though",

          "We arrived at about 6pm after failing to gain last admission to the zoo.(Hellbrun Palace and fountains are next to the zoo). The tour was very interesting and although water is involved you didn't get too wet. My daughter volunteered to sit at the table and got wet but we were",
          "Actually one of my favorite places in Salzburg because there is no place like it. The uniqueness makes it worth the visit. An old place with several surprising water features. Go on a sunny day and with or without kids, though a must if you have kids. I didn't have a guide",
          "The fountains are spectacular in terms of their technology but the guides have more fun getting visitors wet then sharing the historical value. The tour groups are large and you can barely understand the explanations. If you buy a combined ticket you have to go through the",

          "Environs of of the castle is truly fantastic and worth a visit to walk around and read a little about its history but going and paying \u20ac11 per person for a 30min guide inside to see the water games is a ripoff. The guide speaks simultaneously in German and English with a very",
          "Be prepared to get wet and have fun! The royal who built these fountains had a wicked sense of humor.",
          "Very nice fountains and garden. The fountains are fun and beautiful. Pieces of art and engineering. It will be challenging not to get wet as the fountains are designed to trick the visitors. The downside is that the tour is a bit expensive for its short duration. The garden",
          "The trick fountains at Hellbrunn Palace are MUST SEE!! If you have a Salzburg card you get a trick fountains tour for FREE, also included is the visit inside the Hellbrunn Palace which is also worth a visit. I think you also get FREE entry into the museum they have there also.",
          "We spend a nice afternoon enjoying the gardens at Hellbrunn. I'd last seen them 30 years ago and they were still delightful",
          "Thank goodness it was a hot day as you get sprayed a lot with water but it is absolutely fantastic and has to be seen to be believed. An amazing place.",
          "This place is fun. I went there as a kid and remember it to this day. So when I brought my family to Salzburg I knew I had to take them. Not only to you get to see a great historical place but also have fun touring the grounds, as long as you don't ming getting a bit wet.",
          "It's definitely worth the bus ride out of town to Hellbrunn where you can get a tour of the trick fountains. Be prepared to get wet! The tour is about 45mins-1hour and is free with a Salzburg card but you still need to queue to get a ticket so get straight in line.",
          "We enjoyed the tour through the trick fountains a lot, the guide was funny and knowledgeble. The park was great for just strolling and relaxing. Refreshments and restaurant availble.We know what was awaiting us but got surprised anyway ;)",

          "What fun this is! and how devious (and imaginative) the fellow who designed them. Take the tour as then you find out the history/details about some of the more ingenious ones. It is quite amazing what good old water can do...and for 300 years! Again, having a Salzburg card will",
          "We missed the castle tour but got to see the trick fountains and were very surprised. Who would have thought the Archbishops 250-300 years ago had a great sense of humor and amazing creative use of the technology of the day. Worth the trip.",
          "We never planned on this as part of our trip to Salzburg but I am so glad we chanced on it. The trick fountains were fun on a hot July day. Perfect for kids and adults. The surrounding gardens were beautiful as well.",

          "Very beautiful place and other places near it (park, zoo etc.)! Highly recommended. Salzburg Zoo is near. Go if a weather is good. Buy and use Salzburg Card, otherwise you'll pay a lot for the tickets in this and other places.",
          "We rented bikes for 6 euros and went along the river to Wasserspiele Hellbrunn. Fun ride. Easy. See the nice homes and working side of Salzburg. Bikes allowed on grounds. Beautiful and historical. Nice zoo too for kids and playground",
          "Incredible engineering - great story. The water fountains are unlike anything I've ever seen, and the story about the Bisho seat is only a small part of what there is to see We had a Good guide Do it on the salzburg card",
          "The water gardens are great fun to be shown around. The gardens are so well kept and the flowers magnificent.",
          "You can't go to Salzburg and pass this one by, especially with children. The Wasserspiele is both fun and quite interesting. The gardens are an oasis of cool on a hot summer day. And you are likely to get a little wet.",
          "Unexpectedly and pleasantly surprised by this funny summer palace of archbishop! And I have so much fun being splashed (just a little bit, but real run to see people screaming, and its hard to predict where the water will come from!). Definitely worth a visit though its 30",
          "The only way to see the trick fountains and some of the formal gardens is through a guided tour. These are bilingual in German followed by English but with the same content for both. There are a number of impressive sites including a Roman Theatre, Neptune Grotto and a 290 year",
          "When you pay for your ticket you are given a time to go to the trick fountains, which is usually the next available tour, however as it was a very warm day I wanted to do my walking around the garden and up the hill to the folk museum first, and said I want to go later, so they",
          "This was an unexpected surprise. It was fun to see all the different trick fountains and water works and to try and figure out where they would spray. We also enjoyed the gazebo used in the Sound of Music.",
          "We absolutely love it. We felt like kids all again, laughing so much and jumping a lot. Also really amazed at how smart the design and engineering architecture (if this is the right word to use :-) is. Highly recommended. The garden is very beautiful, too.",
          "The trick fountains were great fun but be prepared to get wet as no one escapes them. The palace of Hellbrunn was lovely as well. All included in our Saltzburg card",
          "The trick fountains were really interesting but there were only about five different things to view there. The tour guide constantly switched from English to German for the crowd but I felt that it would have been better if they had English and German tours respectively to",
          "There was quite a lot of hype about visiting the trick fountains, and I think my expectations may have been too high. There is a tour around the water tricks installed by the bishop, and the tour guide activates various sprinklers and jets which were designed to get guests wet.",
          "A wonderful place - the tour of the trick fountains was excellent - expect to get a little wet. The palace itself was beautiful and well worth a visit",
          "This us a very interesting place to visit and walk around in to relax and appreciate nature. The water tricks are interesting and uncommon. They can be a lot of fun for children and adults. Just be careful with your electronic gadgets, they can get wet. The engineering of the",
          "A great place to visit specially with kids, they will love the gardens. One ticket cost 10.5 EUR for adult and it include entrance to the castle and guided tour at the amazing gardens. They include a lot of water surprise so get ready to get wet. Very very cool place to visit,",
          "We got the guided tour which was very informative and led us around all the fountains. The lashing rain did not spoil the fun of the superb detail in the many different fountains and displays all fueled by water power.",
          "The 'schloss' here is entirely skippable, but on a sunny day, the grounds and water features are well worth a short bus ride (or better, bike ride along the river) from Salzburg. If you don't want to get wet, look for the wet spots on the ground and avoid them. Likely a fun",
          "We thought this may be just for kids,but we were pleasantly surprised. The palace is a quick 15 min. tour but worth doing especially with the audio guide. The fountains and gardens were a delight and our tour guide was excellent. Be sure to buy a Salzburg card for this. We took",
          "Absolutely loved it! Even on a rainy and thundery day, the guide made it a lot of fun! With a twinkle in his eye, he said \"i think the heavy rain is over now, although there may be one or two showers!\" Ha Ha ! - he was right! My 6-year-old loved this trip. Make sure you go",
          "This was one of the highlights of our trip! The tour was in German and English which was a little odd but I can understand why they do it that way. Best to go on a warm day as you can cool off in the fountains if you choose. Don't want to give it away but the fountains are",
          "It's all been said before, but we really enjoyed the trick fountains. I had seen them before but it was the first time for my husband and kids and they were all surprised by the clever water tricks. Watch where you stand and sit - if you don't want to get wet. My son got his",
          "Water fountains good but house lacked impact a little. We did visit on a cloudy day & rain meant ground too wet for picnic. Probably great visit on a sunny day. Better for children.",

          "the wasserspiele in this palace is different from other palace that i had visit.Is really fun especially for the kids....",
          "Guide was very funny, the fountains and other various water based entertainments are excellent, the grounds are magnificent and the palace and zoo are def worth visiting too. Get the Salzburg card if you're doing a few things and try and do them all in one day/24 hrs",
          "The Wasserspiele was great fun and we loved the Don Giovanni water organ and the water powered mechanisms.",
          "Easily accessible via local transport. The guided tour round the trick gardens is excellent, interesting with well preserved exhibits. The house, gardens, and walks including walking to and from town if you wish. This is one of the rare features worth a second visit. Simon",
          "Watchout for the trick fountains you may get more than you bargined for.You wont see any of the house though.",
          "See my coimments at \"Schloss Hellbrunn\". You should have some extra time, it is at the edge of the City. It is fun and entertaining. Recommendation: Checck out whether it is in Operation, there are certain times when it will be out of Operation. Don't visit it when it is out",
          "Ensure you do the Trick Fountains Tour...........awesome! The gardens itself was stunningly beautiful.",
          "We arrived thinking that is was open but we had not checked to see that it would be closed. We just assumed that every day it would be open. Make sure you check what days they are open if you are not on a guided tour. We still went to visit the gazebo that was donated after",
          "If you like the countryside take a bus and visit this wonderful gardens with a palace and a zoo. You will delight with the water lakes and the gardens for sure.",
          "I loved touring this. Though it doesn't provide much to do, we did the inside tour and the trick water fountains. That was really fun! The best part for me was seeing the gazebo from Sound of Music which was donated and placed on the grounds. Must see for every diehard fan! (I",
          "We went here with our family with three young kids(ages 3-7) and did the tour of the trick fountains. All five of us were entertained-even my fidgety daughter was so assumed that she was able to sit still during the talking bits. On the same grounds (outside of the gated area)",
          "We took the train out from Munich to Salzburg and only had 8 hours and decided to spend some of that precious time in Hellburn and it was worth it. Took a bus out from city center short walk to the castle from the bus stop just follow the crowds. Have to book a tour time as soon",
          "Truly did not expect... This was one of the best attractions on our trip. It is a fun stop. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The tour was a very large group, would have liked to have a smaller group. Still enjoyed and was able to participate and hear all the tour guide had",
          "If you are in the Salzburg area you have to see this! We almost didn\u2019t as we only had a day in Salzburg. While the palace itself, more specifically the rooms of the palace, perhaps don\u2019t have the same level of beauty as some of the palaces we saw in Europe, the Trick Fountains",
          "A 20 minute ride from downtown.We did an audio tour of the palace,nothing amazing. After that visited the trick fountain, which was the highlight of our trip to Hellbrunn. Our guide was hilarious and had everyone laughing. It was a good time and was fun to avoid getting wet in",
          "The garden is nice. The sculpture and fishes around the clear pond is very pleasant. However, I bought Salzburg card and went to the place in late Nov '13, they stop the water trick. Only regular water in the pond. Anyway, it's nice to get the fresh air there.",
          "Visited here this summer with two teenagers. Had a lot of fun. The gardens are very nice and the trick fountains are hilarious. One of the two times I caught both of them smiling and laughing on this trip! Once through the fountains tour you get to wander the grounds which",

          "We were glad this was included in our Salzburg card ad that we stopped here to visit. The fountain gardens you can only visit with a tour, but they are by far the best part of Hellbrun! My kids loved trying to guess when the guide was going to get us wet, after you get soaked",
          "We did the tour of the trick fountains along with visiting the palace. The fountains were a lot of fun for our 11 year old. Out guide was pleasant and knowledgeable and if you are paying attention, there is very little risk of getting wet, unless of course you want to. The",

          "The tour was pretty fun and the grounds were very nice, but I wouldn't want to pay a lot for the visit. We had the Salzburg Card for 2 days and it was definitely worth it. The lengths to which the original creators of the water features went were quite impressive,",
          "Go on a warm or hot day and be prepared for a splash! The trick water gardens are great fun and one can marvel at many technical ingenuities. Our guide was enthusiastic and also spoke good English. He can let the young have all the splashing water fun and let the oldies off",

          "We had just a few hours at the end of a touring day and decided to grab the bus out to Hellbrunn. Catching the last fountain guided tour of the day, we weren't sure what to expect. The guide gave a wonderful, fun tour in English, and it was easy (and remarkable) to consider",
          "We took the bus from Salzburg and toured the castle and grounds. There is also a zoo on site which would be an option if children are in the group. There is a lot to see and a nice park. I would suggest a 1/2 day and bringing a picnic lunch to eat on the grounds.",
          "The actual palace, grounds and the trick fountains were amazing, very enjoyable and very well maintained. However my mother and I went on the Trick fountain tour that was included in the ticket to the Palace. Although we told the tour was in English, when our guide ask who in",

          "I had very much looked forward to being tricked by the hidden fountain long before I visited it in August. I waited at the gate waiting for the designated time to enter (Must be guided by staff). We were invited to be tricked by the water 'chairs'. Next the group was tricked",
          "Hellbrunn is a step back in history and what was entertainment for the archbishop Markus Sittikus. They garden tour is a must and a audio tour of the palace is excellent. One can also visit the gazebo from the \"Sound of Music\"! Great gift shop and restaurants.",

          "Since we visited this brewery before noon we missed the tour in English (there is only one tour in English at 3 p.m.). Anyhow everything displayed was explained clearly so no issues on that. We would have at least liked to see the introductory video in English, which the lady",

The burger was bad, but everything else we ate was delicious. And of course the beer was wonderful! Great place for kids, apart from the possible smokers at neighboring tables.",
          "Came to have a light lunch, which was quite lovely except the goat cheese salad was definitely overpriced for what it is. The schnitzel was quite oily, there are definitely better ones in town. The vibe was really nice, a relaxed atmosphere outdoors. Truffle fries were delicious!",
          "Very good service. The waiter was always ready when we needed him. He was called Mert and noone ever had an empty glass and everyone was entertained",
          "If you want to drink the most expensive beer in Salzburg and even wider, this is your place. The only reason i am giving them 2 stars is because of the friendly stuff and nice ambient! Beer is over 5\u20ac (5.3\u20ac i think) for 0.5l, while almost \u2026",

          "Nice resturant in the heart of the brewery. They have a very good selection of their own beers and some nice options of food. Staff is quick and checks every now and then that everything is ok or if you need something. The outside garden is very nice to sit in. You can also by beer tasting. Prices are ok.",

          "Spacious brewery visit centre with restaurant, bar, very nice open patio, shop with most of their beers, tours and more. Not so touristic actually and wide range of their beers on tap (plus international bottles even). Food was surprisingly \u2026",
          "Cool tour of the brewery. Felt like i was in charlie and the chocolate factory. The tour was quick but all in all interesting. We had a bite to eat at the restaurant after. They definately k ow what they are doing. The food was incredible!",

          "Had a good tour but too be honest nothing special. It felt very impersonal and a lot of being talked too rather than shown. \n\nWent to the bar area afterwards and sat for fifteen minutes in a half filled restaurant till anyone came over. Two \u2026",
          "It was amazing experience and the tour was nice as she explained quite details of beer process and materials. I really like the design and the fantastic combination of stiegl brand beer, eg: sports, music and board game. Also the free beer tasting is nice but sad that premium beer tasting is sold out :(",
          "Lovely brewery with excellent beer. We visited in good weather, which was nice for the beer garden. The tour was interesting and the guide spoke fluent English.\n\nPost tour we sampled a few of the beers (all excellent) and had a look around the gift shop.\n\nOverall it\u2019s an excellent afternoon for anyone interested in beer.",
          "Worth planning the trip to meet the English guided tour at 3pm. The guide explained things well, was able to answer our questions to the best of her ability and let us try the by-product drink of beer making which was interesting.",
          "Very good tour , we had the guide but i would like to have gone around at my own pace to read all the information. Nice people there ...",

          "A comprehensive museum about Beer but we are more interested in the beer included in Salzburg card. We came here for the beer~",
          "Realy big brewery. But, to be honest. Service is very lazy.... if you are a bier fun and you want to drink the bier, not just sitting, you will always have an empty glass, becouse the service do not care! It\u2019s a shame, becaouse the bier is tasty.",
          "Great place with a variety of beer. Museum was neat with a helpful audio tour. Atmosphere and staff amazing plus the cheese strudel!",
          "Good beer n nice set up inside. The video is pretty trippy.",
          "Great food and beer at the Biergarten and restaurant. The tour is pretty basic. Skip the guided tour and do the walk through. Food is very good and HUGE portions. I would be definitely go back again for a meal next time in the area.",

          "Great beers, great food and great service. We had the goulash and really enjoyed it.",
          "The multimedia room is amazing! The brewery tour itself was a little dissapointing in not being able to see the actual working parts, and the newest room opened lacked climate control. Otherwise the food was surprisingly delicious and the tour guide very friendly and knowledgeable.",

          "It was great! Really interactive, we got a lot of information about brewery not only from papers but from presentations as well.",
          "Well worth a visit. With a Salzburg card you get a free guided tour. Which was very interesting. When the tour is over you get to sample some great beers. The bars at the brewery also do nice meals too. I recommend their burger and chips.",
          "Love the museum and the beer tasting voucher that comes with the tickets. If you do not drink, you can also use the voucher to have 2 bottles of different flavours of fizzy lemonade. 4* not 5* beacuse the not-so-welcome service of the waiter at the bar/beer tasting area.",
          "Only other beer brewery tour I've done is Guinness in Dublin which I know is a tall order but I think Stiegl does hold its own, presenting its history in Salzburg as a background and of course, why its beer is so good.  A good giftshop, \u2026",
          "Nice place to enjoy a beer, or the classic sausage with fries. You can find seasonal beers.. Lucky if you go after April",
          "We got the tour and beer tasting for free with our Salzburg cards, which was awesome! The tour is worth doing, and was in English (not sure if they all are or if we just got lucky). The tour uses some multimedia experiences such as a \u2026",
          "It was amazing place and the beer according with seasons was awesome. Most tastiest beer and awesome environment with friendly staffs.",

          "The Beer was Superb...Good to visit. Staffs were helpful and the food was tasty. Especially the Goulash..",
          "Good and informative tour. Entrance includes 3 x 0.2 tasting beer. Staff was stressed and ignoring us a lot. Missed some service at the bar.",
          "Interesting museum. Food is cheap and delicious, definitely should stop by for the beer and food!",
          "Great place to visit if you have two hours to spare in Salzburg. Good price for a tour that includes three beers to taste and a gift. \n\nThe tour can be guided or unguided. I decided to go without a guide. The tour is actually very long. \u2026",
          "In the place they have, maybe, best beer in the world! And absolutely better which I had to taste.",
          "Fantastic beers, friendly tour guide and very informative",
          "Very nice brewery and beer garden!  There is a lot to see on the tour but we were rushed through pretty fast. I think that the guide though that our group would rather be sampling the beer and ended our tour early.",
          "Pretty good Schnitzel, Stiegl is only a so-so beer",
          "If you are interested in knowing the history of Stiegl and want to try some of their beers, then it is a perfect place to go. Personally I recommend you to buy the Salzburg Card, with it you can make different activities including this place plus including a beer tester of 0.9 L and a special gift for your visit to the brewery.",
          "Terrific tour, the English tour was great and the host was very nice and funny. You get a great gift and then a tasting after. I fully recommend doing this.",
          "Superb exhibition of brewing.",
          "Very interesting and tasty beers. Tour a bit of a staged tour, not truly a large brewery tour.",
          "Super, I can only recommend it to everyone. \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Brewing beer since 1492...best beer great food. Service slow. Very popular",
          "I recommend for all beer drinkers...",
          "A good stop on our site seeing. A lot of history and information on beer brewing throughout the self guided tour. The tour comes with 3 free beers and a gift for each ticket. It is also free with the city card. There is a guided tour at 15:00.",
          "For a non beer drinker it was okay but nothing exciting. The wait staff in the beer tasting area/restaurant didn't give us a choice about wether we wanted beer or not with our vouchers so my husband ended up drinking 2 beers instead of one. The free gift was a nice touch though.",
          "Great beer experience in the museum, only if there was English guidance.\nUPDATE: \nDear Stiegl Team!\nThank you for answering and letting me know there is an English guidance, we visited with Salzburg card, and was not aware of it.",
          "Awesome hidden beer garden with a lot of space. Nice to spend a summer evening here. Good schnitzels and Stiegl beer from the source. Prices same as anywhere else in Salzburg",

          "A good tour and give a a taste of local beer",
          "U gotta taste 3 different types of beer with a complimentary gifts which has a beer mug. U get some crackers along. \nAnd there's a short guided tour in the factory",
          "It's a brewery tour with tasting at the end of it. What's not to like? Well, maybe the directions around the place could be clearer.",
          "The tour was good but the tour guide was very rushed. Great information and good beer but would like to have spent more time on the tour and looking around.",
          "Assorted brews in stock at the Stiegl-Brauwelt good food.",
          "Excellent beer tour & museum including tasting vouchers. An old private brewery that made it to the top list worldwide. Great chunks of information about the different ingredients, processes and the history during the tour.",
          "Interesting and informative, but the shop is a bit expensive. Also, you get less beers with the Salzburger land card than with paying the entrance ticket.",
          "very nice",
          "Stiegl is my favorite so I'm a little biased. They have many beers and radlers on tap. Food is reasonably priced and very good. Will be returning on my next trip to Salzburg.",
          "One of the best brewery tours I have ever had.great beer. Wonderful people",
          "Nice experience. We made the basic tour with the beer tasting at the end and it was very interesting.",
          "Best brewery visit o. Salzburg.",
          "Doesn't seem to offer tour of the working brewery - just has some rather cookie-cutter musuem type exhibits and a small brewpub-scale brewing area (\"house brewery\"). Maybe worth a visit for Stiegl fans, but was a waste of time for me.",
          "An amazing place if you want to discover how Stiegl Bier is made.",
          "Really nice tour and good food and drinks. I totally recommend going there!",

          "Nice place, good food too, perfect waiter",
          "Beer tasting...where they give you adequate size tasting glasses!! Cool small tour and museum. Great beers, pilsners, seasonals, specialties! Great spot to get a meal for a good price too!!!",
          "The museum shows different aspects of beer production. Nothing special, but if you like beer, you can go and taste some beers they offer at the end of the tour.",
          "Fresh and delicious food, very good service!",
          "Amazing Beer, fantastic food, great service. What's not to like? (The Smokers)",

          "Restaurant was pretty good. Traditional foods and great beer. Staff was helpful,  even called the taxi for us. ",
          "Very interesting museum, one of the most different from the rest in Salzburg. If you buy the museum tourist card from the city (I strongly advise to do so), the entrance to Stiegl-Brauwelt is included, and they even give you 3 beers to taste, a bottle opener and some crackers! I",
          "We joined a lovely tour that was very interesting and then got 3 free beers to try at their restaurant and a free gift at the gift shop. The restaurant offered very delicious austrian food. Loved it!",
          "I first tried Stiegl in the US and was looking forward to coming here. Great selection of beer and radlers with a peppering of Austrian fare. \n\nThe ambience is more modern than Bavarian and the people watching was better than average. Will come back again for sure. ",
          "Really great Brauerei. The perfect plan after a exhausting day visiting Salzburg.",
          "If you have Salzburg card, you should go there",
          "This place offers good beer produced from Stiegl and a selection of craft beers from inside and outside Austria. The place is fantastic, well maintained and with a wonderful garden. A to-go place if you are in Salzburg.  ",
          "Four generous beer samples, great food, a fantastic tour, and a hop tasting. Also a cool film to start. Tours in English as well. Try the Paraselseus beer. There's a great giftshop too. I'd go back again. ",
          "Excellent free choice on the Salzburg Card. Three 8oz beer tastes, a tour of the facility, a free mug and crackers gift at the end of the visit. We decided to have lunch and dessert while beer tasting. The beef cooked in beer and the Stiegl speciality dessert we're delicious!",

        "wiki": "Salzburg (Austrian: [\u02c8saltsb\u028a\u0281k]; German: [\u02c8zaltsb\u028a\u0281k] (listen);  literally \"Salt Fortress\"; Bavarian: Soizburg) is the capital city of the State of Salzburg and with 155,031 inhabitants, it is the fourth-largest city in Austria.\nThe town is located on the site of the former Roman settlement of Iuvavum. Salzburg was founded as an episcopal see in 696 and became a seat of the archbishop in 798. Its main sources of income were salt extraction and trade and, at times, gold mining. The fortress of Hohensalzburg, one of the largest medieval fortresses in Europe, dates from the 11th century. In the 17th century, Salzburg became a centre of the Counter-Reformation, where monasteries and numerous Baroque churches were built.\nSalzburg's historic centre (German: Altstadt) is thus renowned for its Baroque architecture and is one of the best-preserved city centres north of the Alps, with 27 churches. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The city has three universities and a large population of students. Tourists also visit Salzburg to tour the historic centre and the scenic Alpine surroundings. Salzburg was the birthplace of the 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Because of its history, culture, and attractions, Salzburg has been labeled Austria's \"most inspiring city.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity to the High Middle Ages ===\nTraces of human settlements have been found in the area, dating to the Neolithic Age. The first settlements in Salzburg continuous with the present were apparently by the Celts around the 5th century BC.\nAround 15 BC the Roman Empire merged the settlements into one city. At this time, the city was called \"Juvavum\" and was awarded the status of a Roman municipium in 45 AD. Juvavum developed into an important town of the Roman province of Noricum. After the Norican frontier's collapse, Juvavum declined so sharply that by the late 7th century it nearly became a ruin.The Life of Saint Rupert credits the 8th-century saint with the city's rebirth. When Theodo of Bavaria asked Rupert to become bishop c. 700, Rupert reconnoitered the river for the site of his basilica. Rupert chose Juvavum, ordained priests, and annexed the manor of Piding. Rupert named the city \"Salzburg\". He travelled to evangelise among pagans.\nThe name Salzburg means \"Salt Castle\" (Latin: Salis Burgium). The name derives from the barges carrying salt on the River Salzach, which were subject to a toll in the 8th century as was customary for many communities and cities on European rivers. Hohensalzburg Fortress, the city's fortress, was built in 1077 by Archbishop Gebhard, who made it his residence. It was greatly expanded during the following centuries.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\nIndependence from Bavaria was secured in the late 14th century. Salzburg was the seat of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, a prince-bishopric of the Holy Roman Empire. As the Reformation movement gained steam, riots broke out among peasants in the areas in and around Salzburg. The city was occupied during the German Peasants' War, and the Archbishop had to flee to the safety of the fortress. It was besieged for three months in 1525.\nEventually, tensions were quelled, and the city's independence led to an increase in wealth and prosperity, culminating in the late 16th to 18th centuries under the Prince Archbishops Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau, Markus Sittikus, and Paris Lodron. It was in the 17th century that Italian architects (and Austrians who had studied the Baroque style) rebuilt the city centre as it is today along with many palaces.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\n\n==== Religious conflict ====\n\nOn 31 October 1731, the 214th anniversary of the 95 Theses, Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian signed an Edict of Expulsion, the Emigrationspatent, directing all Protestant citizens to recant their non-Catholic beliefs. 21,475 citizens refused to recant their beliefs and were expelled from Salzburg. Most of them accepted an offer by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, travelling the length and breadth of Germany to their new homes in East Prussia. The rest settled in other Protestant states in Europe and the British colonies in America.\n\n\n==== Illuminism ====\nIn 1772\u20131803, under archbishop Hieronymus Graf von Colloredo, Salzburg was a centre of late Illuminism. Colloredo is known for being one of the main employers of Mozart. He often had several arguments with Mozart he dismissed him by  saying, \u201cSoll er doch gehen, ich brauche ihn night!\u201d (He should just go then; I don\u2019t need him!)  Mozart would leave Salzburg for Vienna in 1781 with his family including his father Leopold staying back as he and Colloredo had a close relationship.\n\n\n=== Electorate of Salzburg ===\nIn 1803, the archbishopric was secularised by Emperor Napoleon; he transferred the territory to Ferdinando III of Tuscany, former Grand Duke of Tuscany, as the Electorate of Salzburg.\n\n\n=== Austrian annexation of Salzburg ===\nIn 1805, Salzburg was annexed to the Austrian Empire, along with the Berchtesgaden Provostry.\n\n\n=== Salzburg under Bavarian rule ===\nIn 1809, the territory of Salzburg was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria after Austria's defeat at Wagram.\n\n\n=== Division of Salzburg and annexation by Austria and Bavaria ===\nAfter the Congress of Vienna with the Treaty of Munich (1816), Salzburg was definitively returned to Austria, but without Rupertigau and Berchtesgaden, which remained with Bavaria. Salzburg was integrated into the Province of Salzach and Salzburgerland was ruled from Linz.In 1850, Salzburg's status was restored as the capital of the Duchy of Salzburg, a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The city became part of Austria-Hungary in 1866 as the capital of a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The nostalgia of the Romantic Era led to increased tourism. In 1892, a funicular was installed to facilitate tourism to Hohensalzburg Fortress\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n\n==== First Republic ====\nFollowing World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Salzburg, as the capital of one of the Austro-Hungarian territories, became part of the new German Austria. In 1918, it represented the residual German-speaking territories of the Austrian heartlands. This was replaced by the First Austrian Republic in 1919, after the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919).\n\n\n==== Annexation by the Third Reich ====\n\nThe Anschluss (the occupation and annexation of Austria, including Salzburg, into the Third Reich) took place on 12 March 1938, one day before a scheduled referendum on Austria's independence. German troops moved into the city. Political opponents, Jewish citizens and other minorities were subsequently arrested and deported to concentration camps. The synagogue was destroyed. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union, several POW camps for prisoners from the Soviet Union and other enemy nations were organized in the city.\nDuring the Nazi occupation, a Romani camp was built in Salzburg-Maxglan. It was an Arbeitserziehungslager (work 'education' camp), which provided slave labour to local industry. It also operated as a Zwischenlager (transit camp), holding Roma before their deportation to German camps or ghettos in German-occupied territories in eastern Europe.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nAllied bombing destroyed 7,600 houses and killed 550 inhabitants. Fifteen air strikes destroyed 46 percent of the city's buildings, especially those around Salzburg railway station. Although the town's bridges and the dome of the cathedral were destroyed, much of its Baroque architecture remained intact. As a result, Salzburg is one of the few remaining examples of a town of its style. American troops entered the city on 5 May 1945 and it became the centre of the American-occupied area in Austria.  Several displaced persons camps were established in Salzburg\u2014among them Riedenburg, Camp Herzl (Franz-Josefs-Kaserne), Camp M\u00fclln, Bet Bialik, Bet Trumpeldor, and New Palestine.\n\n\n==== Present day ====\nAfter World War II, Salzburg became the capital city of the Federal State of Salzburg (Land Salzburg). On 27 January 2006, the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all 35 churches of Salzburg rang their bells after 8:00 p.m. (local time) to celebrate the occasion. Major celebrations took place throughout the year.\nAs of 2017 Salzburg had a GDP per capita of \u20ac46,100, which was greater than the average for Austria and for most European countries.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSalzburg is on the banks of the River Salzach, at the northern boundary of the Alps. The mountains to Salzburg's south contrast with the rolling plains to the north. The closest alpine peak, the 1,972\u2011metre-high Untersberg, is less than 16 kilometres (10 miles) from the city centre. The Altstadt, or \"old town\", is dominated by its baroque towers and churches and the massive Hohensalzburg Fortress. This area is flanked by two smaller hills, the M\u00f6nchsberg and Kapuzinerberg, which offer green relief within the city.  Salzburg is approximately 150 km (93 mi) east of Munich, 281 km (175 mi) northwest of Ljubljana, Slovenia, and 300 km (186 mi) west of Vienna. Salzburg has about the same latitude of Seattle.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSalzburg is part of the temperate zone. The K\u00f6ppen climate classification specifies the climate as a humid continental climate (Dfb), however, with the \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm for the coldest month, Salzburg can be classified as having four-season oceanic climate with significant temperature differences between seasons. Due to the location at the northern rim of the Alps, the amount of precipitation is comparatively high, mainly in the summer months. The specific drizzle is called Schn\u00fcrlregen in the local dialect. In winter and spring, pronounced foehn winds regularly occur.\n\n\n== Population ==\nIn 2018, 31% of the total population is foreign born according to Statistik Austria.\nSalzburg's official population significantly increased in 1935 when the city absorbed adjacent municipalities. After World War II, numerous refugees found a new home in the city. New residential space was constructed for American soldiers of the postwar occupation, and could be used for refugees when they left. Around 1950, Salzburg passed the mark of 100,000 citizens, and in 2016, it reached the mark of 150,000 citizens.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Romanesque and Gothic ===\nThe Romanesque and Gothic churches, the monasteries and the early carcass houses dominated the medieval city for a long time. The Cathedral of Archbishop Conrad of Wittelsbach was the largest basilica north of the Alps. The choir of the Franciscan Church, construction was begun by Hans von Burghausen and completed by Stephan Krumenauer, is one of the most prestigious religious gothic constructions of southern Germany. At the end of the Gothic era the Collegiate church \"Nonnberg\", Margaret Chapel in St. Peter's Cemetery, the St. George's Chapel and the stately halls of the \"Hoher Stock\" in Hohensalzburg Fortress were constructed.\n\n\n=== Renaissance and baroque ===\nInspired by Vincenzo Scamozzi, Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau began to transform the medieval town to the architectural ideals of the late Renaissance. Plans for a massive cathedral by Scamozzi failed to materialize upon the fall of the archbishop. A second cathedral planned by Santino Solari rose as the first early Baroque church in Salzburg. It served as an example for many other churches in Southern Germany and Austria. Markus Sittikus and Paris von Lodron continued to rebuild the city with major projects such as Hellbrunn Palace, the prince archbishop's residence, the university buildings, fortifications, and many other buildings. Giovanni Antonio Daria managed by order of Prince Archbishop Guido von Thun the construction of the residential well. Giovanni Gaspare Zuccalli, by order of the same archbishop, created the Erhard and the Kajetan church in the south of the town. The city's redesign was completed with buildings designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, donated by Prince Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun.\nAfter the era of Ernst von Thun, the city's expansion came to a halt, which is the reason why there are no churches built in the Rococo style. Sigismund von Schrattenbach continued with the construction of \"Sigmundstor\" and the statue of holy Maria on the cathedral square. With the fall and division of the former \"F\u00fcrsterzbistum Salzburg\" (Archbishopric) to Upper Austria, Bavaria (Rupertigau) and Tyrol (Zillertal Matrei) began a long period of urban stagnancy. This era didn't end before the period of promoterism (Gr\u00fcnderzeit) brought new life into urban development. The builder dynasty Jakob Ceconi and Carl Freiherr von Schwarz filled major positions in shaping the city in this era.\n\n\n=== Classical modernism and post-war modernism ===\nBuildings of classical modernism and in particular the post-war modernism are frequently encountered in Salzburg. Examples are the Zahnwurzen house (a house in the Linzergasse 22 in the right center of the old town), the \"Lepi\" (a public baths in Leopoldskron) (built 1964) and the original 1957 constructed congress centre of Salzburg, which was replaced by a new building in 2001. An important and famous example of architecture of this era is the 1960 opening of the Gro\u00dfes Festspielhaus by Clemens Holzmeister.\n\n\n=== Contemporary architecture ===\nAdding contemporary architecture to Salzburg's old town without risking its UNESCO World Heritage status is problematic. Nevertheless, some new structures have been added: the Mozarteum at the Baroque Mirabell Garden (Architecture Robert Rechenauer), the 2001 Congress House (Architecture: Freemasons), the 2011 Unipark Nonntal (Architecture: Storch Ehlers Partners), the 2001 \"Makartsteg\" bridge (Architecture: HALLE1), and the \"Residential and Studio House\" of the architects Christine and Horst Lechner in the middle of Salzburg's old town (winner of the architecture award of Salzburg 2010). Other examples of contemporary architecture lie outside the old town: the Faculty of Science building (Universit\u00e4t Salzburg \u2013 Architecture Willhelm Holzbauer) built on the edge of free green space, the blob architecture of Red Bull Hangar\u20117 (Architecture: Volkmar Burgstaller) at Salzburg Airport, home to Dietrich Mateschitz's Flying Bulls and the Europark Shopping Centre. (Architecture: Massimiliano Fuksas)\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nSalzburg has twenty-four urban districts and three extra-urban populations.\nUrban districts (Stadtteile):\n\nExtra-urban populations (Landschaftsr\u00e4ume):\n\nGaisberg\nHellbrunn\nHeuberg\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nSalzburg is a tourist favourite, with the number of visitors outnumbering locals by a large margin in peak times.

        "wiki": "Residenzplatz is a large, stately square in the historic centre of Salzburg in Austria. Named after the Residenz building of the Prince-Archbishops of Salzburg, adjacent to Salzburg Cathedral, it is one of the city's most popular places to visit.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe Residenzplatz is located in the historic centre (Altstadt) of Salzburg, enclosed by Salzburg Cathedral (Salzburger Dom) in the south and the Alte Residenz in the west. To the east is the Neue Residenz (New Residence), a Renaissance building erected from 1588 onwards, with its prominent bell tower. The adjacent Mozartplatz leads to Salzburg Museum. \nSeveral historic private houses (B\u00fcrgerh\u00e4user) frame the square to the north, among them the temporary home of the Baroque painter Johann Michael Rottmayr at No. 2, where he stayed while creating the ceiling frescoes in the Alte Residenz around 1690.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Residenzplatz was laid out from 1587 onwards at the behest of Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau, after he ordered to abandon the cemetery of the former monastery north of Salzburg Cathedral. Remnants of the medieval cemetery were recently discovered underneath the square's surface. Raitenau also had a large number of private houses demolished to provide space. Then called Hauptplatz (\"Main Square\"), the new public plaza corresponded with the reconstruction of Salzburg Cathedral, according to plans laid out by the Italian architect Vincenzo Scamozzi.\nCurrently, the square is about to be refurbished, including a new paving and a monument commemorating a Nazi book burning conducted at the site on 30 April 1938.\n\n\n== Fountain ==\n\nThe Residenzbrunnen in the centre of the square was designed by Tommaso di Garona and erected between 1656 to 1661. The upper basin is topped by a Triton statue ejecting the waters upwards. Made of Untersberg limestone (Untersberger Marmor), it is considered the largest Baroque fountain in Central Europe. \n\n\n== Periodical events ==\nOpen air cinema: Every summer in July and August the square is transformed into an open air cinema. Typically, taped performances of the Salzburg Festival are shown\nAnnual kermesse (Kirtag) celebrating the feast of Saint Rupert on September 24\nSalzburg Christmas market during Advent.In the 1980s and 1990s, several rock concerts by Joe Cocker, Tina Turner, Neil Young, and others were held on Residenzplatz.\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "The day we arrived in Saltzberg I told the family - grandparents, our son and his two girls aged 14 & 10, that we had to make sure we were sitting in this square to hear the Glockenspiel at 6 pm. We found our way there by 5 .55pm, one what was an overcast cool evening, and sat",
          "This fountain is starting to sink and leans slightly to one side. Hopefully the Salzburg Council will be able to figure out a way to permanently prop it up.",
          "in the old town section you will see this simply by strolling through this part of Salzburg. very large statue. definitely worth a look and a photo.",
          "There isn't much to see here. No activity (no moving figures), it started late, and there was bells ringing, but not worth waiting around just to hear some bells ringing. If you happen to be there when the music starts, great. But don't make a special trip to catch this.",
          "Not sure when it exactly it rings but when it does the tunes are very nice and last for a short period. The timing is off and certainly not on the hour.",
          "To avoid disappointment, try to find out in advance when the bells will be chiming. Otehrwise, you will just be looking at a clock tower! When the bells do play, try guessing the tune.",
          "With its location in the square we were worried about snacking here but a large and small Apfelspritz and two decent cakes cost euro15.60. They spoke English. Service was quick then there was no rush to get rid of us when we had finished eating.",
          "doesn't seem to be working all the time; only rang once at 6pm; locals say the town doesn't want to spend the money to fix it.",
          "Very nice square to visit. It's convenient to many other places in Salzburg so worth walking over to see.",
          "One must visit the glockenspiel if visiting Salzburg !! It is an historic piece of Salzburg and is located at Marienplatz.",
          "We were in Salzburg in Dec so it was winter and very cold! We walked right past the building but realised that we were in the right place when we went into the Glockenspiel Cafe on the corner. The building is diagonally opposite the cafe. Make sure you check the times of when",
          "If you are in Mozart Platz facing the Horse fountain it is in the building to the left (at the top). We walked right past it since it was not at a time it was playing. We went to Gasthaus Zwettlers and got a Salzburger Nockerl and when we came out we found it. Silly us!",
          "This amazing clock tower is located in the middle of Munich's central square, surrounded by fountains and Bavarian buildings. It is very intricate in design and the 32 figures move to 43 bells that play at 11:00 a.m. We were there in December and \"Mary's Plaza\" was bustling",
          "It is beautiful to hear. The fountains at its base are covered at this time of year in case of the snow. I was lucky enough to hear them several times whilst at the Christmas market before they got drowned out by the bells from the Dom which were also awesome.",
          "While in Frankenmuth, we decided to go to Bavarian Inn for lunch and was glad to see Glockenspiel was part of the building, so we times it right to get there moments before noon to see the show. I would advise getting there VERY early in order to find a place to park, as it's",
          "I like to see how things work, so was excited to take the tour up inside the Glockenspiel. All the stairs were worth it. The tour (German & English) was timed so you could see the mechanism working. Once at the top, the views over the city were magnificent.",
          "Easy to see from many points in the city. Easy to hear from many points in the city! Not much to see from the bottom, but worth being close by at 12pm to really hear the potential of these bells.",
          "We had an amazing breakfast here our fist day in Salzburg. Unlike most of the places downtown, the staff was friendly and more prompt than most. Our coffees and tea were perfect. My daughter LOVED her tea. Not only did they bring her a nice size pot of water, but they served",
          "Amazing clock tower with several bells of different sizes. It is part of the Salzburg Museum building and located in the Residence Square. A prominent landmark for selfies.",
          "you will pass this Glokenspiel for sure, try to be there at full hour or at 12am the melody is a fine one, completely different to the ones you might know, typical for salzburg in the historic museum cose by, are more information about the Glockenspiel",
          "This one was beautiful. It didn't have any animation with it like the one in Munich but I love to listen to the sound.",
          "I was intrigued to find out what the glockenspiel was when I saw it on the map. I looked up and there is the fabulous bell tower! As previous writers have said, the music when it chimes is quite beautiful. Definitely worth being in the area taking coffee!",
          "We were here at 1100hrs, probably due to our good guide, when the bells chimed. A different tune is played out three times on the bells and it's loud enough to record. It's in a good location close to Motzart Square and can be viewed while you rest at the Glockenspiel Cafe",
          "An enourmous place with an enourmous fountain - close to the Dom, you do not realize the proportions until you're close to it.",
          "We visited the Glockenspiel on Corpus Christi day, when there was a main celebration taking place in the Domplatz. So I'm not sure if that is the reason why there was not much being played by the Glockenspiel as we could hear a very short song. We did go in the designated",
          "Twice a day music is played by the bells of the Glockenspiel. The sound that comes out of those bells is heavenly! Incredible that a soft and musical sound could come out of something so big. If you have a chance to be in the area just stop and enjoy and it is free.",
          "The tower itself is worth checking out, interesting architecture. If you time it right you can hear the bells playing a tune at 7am, 11am and 6pm.",
          "One of the many interesting pieces of architecture, fountains and monuments all over Salzburg. Worth seeing.",
          "Beautiful to listen to this gorgeous glockenspiel at the above times. Such a lovelyl piece of architecture. Enjoy the Austrian Sound!",
          "Stopped by this place while exploring the Old Town of Salzburg. It is a beautiful square with the statue of Mozart in the middle. Afterwards, we had some coffee and Viennese pastries in one of the coffee shops around. Nice place to rest and enjoy the ambiance of old Salzburg.",
          "For a clock of this kind, it is OK, but to be honest, a little disappointing. It is not a great performance. You should definitely go along, but other cities have better.",
          "We got a couple really good photos with the Christmas Market in the foreground and a full moon in the background on one of our evenings here. Thinks of including this within another photo of the multiple attractions around this area.",
          "I hadn't read up about the Glockenspiel, how ever was wandering through the Christmas markets and the bells started chiming, definitely well worth a listen the chime 3 times a day I was there at 1100hrs. In the wintertime was lovely to stand and listen with a Gl\u00fcwein and",
          "Now part of Demel. Good choice of coffees and teas and some food. Kaiserschmarren eaten was somewhat overdone and hard on the edges. Disappointing.",
          "The bell tolls three times a day at 7am, 11am and 6pm. These were the times that people used to eat in the past and the bell would help them to identify when it was time to eat.",
          "When you are walking from the Mozartplatz to the Residenzplatz you can see the famous Salzburg Glockenspiel, which is located under the tower helm on the west side of the Neue Residenz, which now is the Salzburg Museum. It plays its usually well-known melodies daily at 7 and 11",
          "The Glockenspiel tolls three times a day and it is a unique experience to listen to whilst surrounded by the wonderful buildings in the Old Town. There are some good places to enjoy the experience, Mozartplatz or Residenzplatz are perfect places to take in the view and listen to",
          "The Glockenspiel Caf\u00e9 promises so much, as it has one of the best outlooks and therefore attracts dozens of tourists and locals alike, keen to stop for a while and enjoy a drink and cake. We ate here once for lunch and the food was good, although the service was slow and the",
          "This is a stunning area with its old buildings, fountain, church bells etc. nice to sit and watch the world go by.",
          "When you hear this clock chime you'll want to find out where it is. It does ring out for quite a while so recording it might make your arms ache!! It's well worthwhile to watch it, though.",
          "If you didn't Go yet to Saltzburg, when you visit it, You have to visit this place, like all Old City is so nice & you must walk over there",
          "Salzburg is beautiful to either walk or take a carriage ride. We did both. I love Glockenspiels and this one is very nice. Highly recommend a trip to Salzburg for this and the many other sites of the beautiful city.",
          "The music still plays and usually has a Mozart theme. Sits adjacent the Dom and at the end of the pedestrian area,so is lovely for a stop. Take a fiakre(horse ride) if your pocket allows to get maximum throwback and romantic experience.",
          "interesting to watch the models move around and portray examples of history of Salzburg and the empire",
          "Nice square to stop and admire the lovely architecture. You will admire the lively square and surroundings before moving on. One of the nicest squares in Salzburg. Better viewed from above!",
          "Did not disappoint, all the buildings in old Salzburg were stunning, the history and the architecture wow, wow, wow",
          "We heard about this attraction and found a cafe right nearby (disappointing, couldn't even make a real Martini). Bells rang just a little after 1800. Not quite in tune but it was a novelty.",
          "This touristy spot is located in Mozartplatz under the tower helm of the west side of the Neue Residenz.Daily at 3 times the,the Clock pleases the assembled tourists & locals with some famous melodious music ranging from Mozart to Haydn etc.Though the chimes are sweet & lovely",

          "Enjoy how the time was shown in medieval times with a little show that apprears out of the clock. You will surely be in this old town area anyway, if you visit Salzburg. Be near the clock before it strikes the hour.",
          "We enjoyed sitting in the square near the fountain, having a drink and watching the other tourists while waiting g for the bells. They were very late and once started, very short. I expected a lot longer chiming. They dis sound beautiful and of course we recorded them like",
          "Check out the times when the bells ring and a little history behind them. I think there are over 30+ bells and when they ring it's amazing... Never heard anything like it. It's worth hearing!",
          "Quaint, in the old town setting. The chimes are brilliant, but all too short. When we were there was a lot of activity and a fair/circus was being erected in the square, so it spoilt the attractiveness of the scene. However if you are in the area on the hour it is worth hanging",
          "I can't remember how we heard about this tour (maybe Rick Steves). We loved it! It's only offered a couple times a week at 10:30am. It's only 3 euros! Meet at the Salzburg Panorama Museum. The tour is in German, which is funny because clearly the majority of the tour spoke",
          "I feel bad for the tour group that left just before the bells started (a few minutes late). I can't say it was life-changing, but we enjoyed the Mozart tunes...reminiscent of Suzuki Cello Book 2. It seemed as if there were several musicians repeating the same song, which was an",
          "watching the tourists photograph and videotape the Glockenspiel was a show in itself. The small Glockenspielplatz was a hidden gem in the city with a very nice restaurant/pub in the square called Glocklbrau??. It is worth a visit. try to time it on the hour when the Glockenspiel",
          "The Salzburg Glockenspiel can be found on the Residenzplatz. The bells go back to the early 18th century when these 35 bells first woke up this sleepy little town. The bells do not play on the hour as I first thought, but only at 7AM, 11AM, and 6PM. The Glockenspiel ranges",
          "We shopped the whole afternoon at the main shopping street before reaching here. We wanted to have a coffee at the nearby cafe while waiting for the chimes to start but much to our disappointment the outdoor area of the cafe was closed... no point staying indoor in this case..",
          "My husband and I both like glockenspiels and have listened to some in a number of locations so we made a point of being in the Mozartplatz when the chimes were scheduled. This meant waiting in the rain for an hour and a half after we finished our other touring [although we did",
          "Like many old things, you have to like historical pieces to appreciate it. The is always a crowd but you can see it and hear it. If you are a clock buff, it's a must-see.",

        "wiki": "Salzburg (Austrian: [\u02c8saltsb\u028a\u0281k]; German: [\u02c8zaltsb\u028a\u0281k] (listen);  literally \"Salt Fortress\"; Bavarian: Soizburg) is the capital city of the State of Salzburg and with 155,031 inhabitants, it is the fourth-largest city in Austria.\nThe town is located on the site of the former Roman settlement of Iuvavum. Salzburg was founded as an episcopal see in 696 and became a seat of the archbishop in 798. Its main sources of income were salt extraction and trade and, at times, gold mining. The fortress of Hohensalzburg, one of the largest medieval fortresses in Europe, dates from the 11th century. In the 17th century, Salzburg became a centre of the Counter-Reformation, where monasteries and numerous Baroque churches were built.\nSalzburg's historic centre (German: Altstadt) is thus renowned for its Baroque architecture and is one of the best-preserved city centres north of the Alps, with 27 churches. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The city has three universities and a large population of students. Tourists also visit Salzburg to tour the historic centre and the scenic Alpine surroundings. Salzburg was the birthplace of the 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Because of its history, culture, and attractions, Salzburg has been labeled Austria's \"most inspiring city.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity to the High Middle Ages ===\nTraces of human settlements have been found in the area, dating to the Neolithic Age. The first settlements in Salzburg continuous with the present were apparently by the Celts around the 5th century BC.\nAround 15 BC the Roman Empire merged the settlements into one city. At this time, the city was called \"Juvavum\" and was awarded the status of a Roman municipium in 45 AD. Juvavum developed into an important town of the Roman province of Noricum. After the Norican frontier's collapse, Juvavum declined so sharply that by the late 7th century it nearly became a ruin.The Life of Saint Rupert credits the 8th-century saint with the city's rebirth. When Theodo of Bavaria asked Rupert to become bishop c. 700, Rupert reconnoitered the river for the site of his basilica. Rupert chose Juvavum, ordained priests, and annexed the manor of Piding. Rupert named the city \"Salzburg\". He travelled to evangelise among pagans.\nThe name Salzburg means \"Salt Castle\" (Latin: Salis Burgium). The name derives from the barges carrying salt on the River Salzach, which were subject to a toll in the 8th century as was customary for many communities and cities on European rivers. Hohensalzburg Fortress, the city's fortress, was built in 1077 by Archbishop Gebhard, who made it his residence. It was greatly expanded during the following centuries.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\nIndependence from Bavaria was secured in the late 14th century. Salzburg was the seat of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, a prince-bishopric of the Holy Roman Empire. As the Reformation movement gained steam, riots broke out among peasants in the areas in and around Salzburg. The city was occupied during the German Peasants' War, and the Archbishop had to flee to the safety of the fortress. It was besieged for three months in 1525.\nEventually, tensions were quelled, and the city's independence led to an increase in wealth and prosperity, culminating in the late 16th to 18th centuries under the Prince Archbishops Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau, Markus Sittikus, and Paris Lodron. It was in the 17th century that Italian architects (and Austrians who had studied the Baroque style) rebuilt the city centre as it is today along with many palaces.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\n\n==== Religious conflict ====\n\nOn 31 October 1731, the 214th anniversary of the 95 Theses, Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian signed an Edict of Expulsion, the Emigrationspatent, directing all Protestant citizens to recant their non-Catholic beliefs. 21,475 citizens refused to recant their beliefs and were expelled from Salzburg. Most of them accepted an offer by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, travelling the length and breadth of Germany to their new homes in East Prussia. The rest settled in other Protestant states in Europe and the British colonies in America.\n\n\n==== Illuminism ====\nIn 1772\u20131803, under archbishop Hieronymus Graf von Colloredo, Salzburg was a centre of late Illuminism. Colloredo is known for being one of the main employers of Mozart. He often had several arguments with Mozart he dismissed him by  saying, \u201cSoll er doch gehen, ich brauche ihn night!\u201d (He should just go then; I don\u2019t need him!)  Mozart would leave Salzburg for Vienna in 1781 with his family including his father Leopold staying back as he and Colloredo had a close relationship.\n\n\n=== Electorate of Salzburg ===\nIn 1803, the archbishopric was secularised by Emperor Napoleon; he transferred the territory to Ferdinando III of Tuscany, former Grand Duke of Tuscany, as the Electorate of Salzburg.\n\n\n=== Austrian annexation of Salzburg ===\nIn 1805, Salzburg was annexed to the Austrian Empire, along with the Berchtesgaden Provostry.\n\n\n=== Salzburg under Bavarian rule ===\nIn 1809, the territory of Salzburg was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria after Austria's defeat at Wagram.\n\n\n=== Division of Salzburg and annexation by Austria and Bavaria ===\nAfter the Congress of Vienna with the Treaty of Munich (1816), Salzburg was definitively returned to Austria, but without Rupertigau and Berchtesgaden, which remained with Bavaria. Salzburg was integrated into the Province of Salzach and Salzburgerland was ruled from Linz.In 1850, Salzburg's status was restored as the capital of the Duchy of Salzburg, a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The city became part of Austria-Hungary in 1866 as the capital of a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The nostalgia of the Romantic Era led to increased tourism. In 1892, a funicular was installed to facilitate tourism to Hohensalzburg Fortress\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n\n==== First Republic ====\nFollowing World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Salzburg, as the capital of one of the Austro-Hungarian territories, became part of the new German Austria. In 1918, it represented the residual German-speaking territories of the Austrian heartlands. This was replaced by the First Austrian Republic in 1919, after the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919).\n\n\n==== Annexation by the Third Reich ====\n\nThe Anschluss (the occupation and annexation of Austria, including Salzburg, into the Third Reich) took place on 12 March 1938, one day before a scheduled referendum on Austria's independence. German troops moved into the city. Political opponents, Jewish citizens and other minorities were subsequently arrested and deported to concentration camps. The synagogue was destroyed. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union, several POW camps for prisoners from the Soviet Union and other enemy nations were organized in the city.\nDuring the Nazi occupation, a Romani camp was built in Salzburg-Maxglan. It was an Arbeitserziehungslager (work 'education' camp), which provided slave labour to local industry. It also operated as a Zwischenlager (transit camp), holding Roma before their deportation to German camps or ghettos in German-occupied territories in eastern Europe.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nAllied bombing destroyed 7,600 houses and killed 550 inhabitants. Fifteen air strikes destroyed 46 percent of the city's buildings, especially those around Salzburg railway station. Although the town's bridges and the dome of the cathedral were destroyed, much of its Baroque architecture remained intact. As a result, Salzburg is one of the few remaining examples of a town of its style. American troops entered the city on 5 May 1945 and it became the centre of the American-occupied area in Austria.  Several displaced persons camps were established in Salzburg\u2014among them Riedenburg, Camp Herzl (Franz-Josefs-Kaserne), Camp M\u00fclln, Bet Bialik, Bet Trumpeldor, and New Palestine.\n\n\n==== Present day ====\nAfter World War II, Salzburg became the capital city of the Federal State of Salzburg (Land Salzburg). On 27 January 2006, the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all 35 churches of Salzburg rang their bells after 8:00 p.m. (local time) to celebrate the occasion. Major celebrations took place throughout the year.\nAs of 2017 Salzburg had a GDP per capita of \u20ac46,100, which was greater than the average for Austria and for most European countries.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSalzburg is on the banks of the River Salzach, at the northern boundary of the Alps. The mountains to Salzburg's south contrast with the rolling plains to the north. The closest alpine peak, the 1,972\u2011metre-high Untersberg, is less than 16 kilometres (10 miles) from the city centre. The Altstadt, or \"old town\", is dominated by its baroque towers and churches and the massive Hohensalzburg Fortress. This area is flanked by two smaller hills, the M\u00f6nchsberg and Kapuzinerberg, which offer green relief within the city.  Salzburg is approximately 150 km (93 mi) east of Munich, 281 km (175 mi) northwest of Ljubljana, Slovenia, and 300 km (186 mi) west of Vienna. Salzburg has about the same latitude of Seattle.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSalzburg is part of the temperate zone. The K\u00f6ppen climate classification specifies the climate as a humid continental climate (Dfb), however, with the \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm for the coldest month, Salzburg can be classified as having four-season oceanic climate with significant temperature differences between seasons. Due to the location at the northern rim of the Alps, the amount of precipitation is comparatively high, mainly in the summer months. The specific drizzle is called Schn\u00fcrlregen in the local dialect. In winter and spring, pronounced foehn winds regularly occur.\n\n\n== Population ==\nIn 2018, 31% of the total population is foreign born according to Statistik Austria.\nSalzburg's official population significantly increased in 1935 when the city absorbed adjacent municipalities. After World War II, numerous refugees found a new home in the city. New residential space was constructed for American soldiers of the postwar occupation, and could be used for refugees when they left. Around 1950, Salzburg passed the mark of 100,000 citizens, and in 2016, it reached the mark of 150,000 citizens.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Romanesque and Gothic ===\nThe Romanesque and Gothic churches, the monasteries and the early carcass houses dominated the medieval city for a long time. The Cathedral of Archbishop Conrad of Wittelsbach was the largest basilica north of the Alps. The choir of the Franciscan Church, construction was begun by Hans von Burghausen and completed by Stephan Krumenauer, is one of the most prestigious religious gothic constructions of southern Germany. At the end of the Gothic era the Collegiate church \"Nonnberg\", Margaret Chapel in St. Peter's Cemetery, the St. George's Chapel and the stately halls of the \"Hoher Stock\" in Hohensalzburg Fortress were constructed.\n\n\n=== Renaissance and baroque ===\nInspired by Vincenzo Scamozzi, Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau began to transform the medieval town to the architectural ideals of the late Renaissance. Plans for a massive cathedral by Scamozzi failed to materialize upon the fall of the archbishop. A second cathedral planned by Santino Solari rose as the first early Baroque church in Salzburg. It served as an example for many other churches in Southern Germany and Austria. Markus Sittikus and Paris von Lodron continued to rebuild the city with major projects such as Hellbrunn Palace, the prince archbishop's residence, the university buildings, fortifications, and many other buildings. Giovanni Antonio Daria managed by order of Prince Archbishop Guido von Thun the construction of the residential well. Giovanni Gaspare Zuccalli, by order of the same archbishop, created the Erhard and the Kajetan church in the south of the town. The city's redesign was completed with buildings designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, donated by Prince Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun.\nAfter the era of Ernst von Thun, the city's expansion came to a halt, which is the reason why there are no churches built in the Rococo style. Sigismund von Schrattenbach continued with the construction of \"Sigmundstor\" and the statue of holy Maria on the cathedral square. With the fall and division of the former \"F\u00fcrsterzbistum Salzburg\" (Archbishopric) to Upper Austria, Bavaria (Rupertigau) and Tyrol (Zillertal Matrei) began a long period of urban stagnancy. This era didn't end before the period of promoterism (Gr\u00fcnderzeit) brought new life into urban development. The builder dynasty Jakob Ceconi and Carl Freiherr von Schwarz filled major positions in shaping the city in this era.\n\n\n=== Classical modernism and post-war modernism ===\nBuildings of classical modernism and in particular the post-war modernism are frequently encountered in Salzburg. Examples are the Zahnwurzen house (a house in the Linzergasse 22 in the right center of the old town), the \"Lepi\" (a public baths in Leopoldskron) (built 1964) and the original 1957 constructed congress centre of Salzburg, which was replaced by a new building in 2001. An important and famous example of architecture of this era is the 1960 opening of the Gro\u00dfes Festspielhaus by Clemens Holzmeister.\n\n\n=== Contemporary architecture ===\nAdding contemporary architecture to Salzburg's old town without risking its UNESCO World Heritage status is problematic. Nevertheless, some new structures have been added: the Mozarteum at the Baroque Mirabell Garden (Architecture Robert Rechenauer), the 2001 Congress House (Architecture: Freemasons), the 2011 Unipark Nonntal (Architecture: Storch Ehlers Partners), the 2001 \"Makartsteg\" bridge (Architecture: HALLE1), and the \"Residential and Studio House\" of the architects Christine and Horst Lechner in the middle of Salzburg's old town (winner of the architecture award of Salzburg 2010). Other examples of contemporary architecture lie outside the old town: the Faculty of Science building (Universit\u00e4t Salzburg \u2013 Architecture Willhelm Holzbauer) built on the edge of free green space, the blob architecture of Red Bull Hangar\u20117 (Architecture: Volkmar Burgstaller) at Salzburg Airport, home to Dietrich Mateschitz's Flying Bulls and the Europark Shopping Centre.

          "Strange, but I enjoy visiting cemeteries. They are an insight into the past. This is much different to most, with some amazing masonry work, statues, ironwork and paintings. Everything is really well looked after. It would have been nice if there had been some information",
          "well this Cemetery of St. Sebastian was incredible the grounds were excellent and the graves well looked after it was so peaceful and we enjoyed the walk about",
          "Actual set inspiration for the Cemetery scene of the Sound of Music. Well kept and centuries old. Surrounds the old church building.",
          "We stumbled across this while following our noses to a baker smell (the excellent bakery is near the entrance). While munching on a warm roll we wandered around the graves and enjoyed the gardens, incriptions and the atmospheric catacombs. Well worth a visit. Find the bakery.",
          "People laugh at me, but I adore European cemeteries and this is one of the best I have seen. I went early and it was so peaceful and quiet - beautiful graves, statues, and paintings - the day was hot, so the shade was very welcome - stayed for about 1 1/2 hours.",
          "All sorts of interesting people laid to rest here and hidden from the traffic of the very busy pedestrian area St Sebastian's is located in.",
          "Very interesting, but more so with a guide, unless you have information beyond what you can read on the tombs. Combine with a walking trip downtown.",
          "This is a hidden away place in Linzergasse. Don't ignore otherwise you will miss the beauty and calmness of this place. The graveyard is quiet and beautiful. Also, the entry is free.",
          "We were advised to visit. This cemetery is not as neat as St Peter\u2019s but a couple of members of Mozart\u2019s family are buried here.",
          "Just around the back of the church (in Linzergasse) is this quiet little cemetary. Some notables have been buried here, but the art work and quiet are wrll worth a visit",
          "Spent a couple of hours walking round the graveyard. Very interesting to see & worth a visit. And it's free.",
          "The cemetery itself is a peaceful and beautiful place, lots of flowers and candles and elegant gravestones. There were also some pretty awesome skulls and skeletons carved into the more intricate tombs. The catacombs were different to what we expected - for one thing, they went",
          "A place for quiet reflection within the city. Very interesting to read markers and look at history of families.",

          "This was my first visit of a cemetery of this type, and I was truly amazed. It is one of the most quiet and beautiful places I have ever been to. Every grave, be it centuries old or contemporary, is made with love and care into a unique synthesis of flowers and various plants.",
          "This cemetery was not on our schedule but our tour guide recommended walking through it and the accompanying chapel. This is an actively utilized cemetery; people are still coming by to remember recently departed loved ones. I could not read German, so much beyond the names on",
          "We found this beautiful place as we walked out fo our first visit to the village.It nestles snugly to one side and invites you when you first see it from a distance.It is serenely beautiful and you cannot help but be captivated by the inscriptions on the headstones ,as you gain",
          "After the disappointing Panorama Sound of Music Tour we hunted down a few of the film spots for ourselves. Hidden away off the main Salzburg shopping street is the Cemetery of St Sebastian, beautiful and tranquil in its own right. Used as a basis for the SOM scene where family",
          "Take a couple of minutes and experience this place were hardly any tourists go. Really interesting since there is also a connection to Mozart",
          "This cemetery is unlike any you're likely to see elsewhere! The grave markers are beautiful, and you will see the graves of a number of historic people, both in the mausoleum and in the cemetery itself...Paracelsus, Archbishop Wolf-Dietrich, Mozart's wife and also his sister",
          "Part of our Rick Steve's walk brought us here and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Lots of history, lots to reflect upon, and lots to photograph. Be sure to visit the catacombs that are in the corner also!",
          "We have found this hidden jewel of Salzburg when strolling through the Linzer Gasse. The cemetery already exist since 1511, but at the end of the 16th century it was renovated. Central in the cemetery is the Gabriel Chapel, which is a mausoleum for Wolf Dietrich, whom died in",
          "Found this be accident. Very interesting cemetery. Certainly different from any cemetery we had seen before.",
          "We walked around this churchyard, lots of different tombs, including Mozarts family tomb. Church was nice to go into to although you can only look at it from behind locked gates.",

          "There is a peacefulness to the place. There is not as many visitor here as at St Peter Church's cemetery - fell less of a tourist attraction, but a resting place of the dearly departed. Loved checking out the various styles of the memorial plaques. We visited this cemetery 30",

          "We have visited the Friedhof St Sebastian three times and I never tire of it's peacefulness and uniqueness. While the cemetery is very small, it is impeccably maintained and shows that it's inhabitants are still well-loved. Even if you are not a fan of cemeteries, it is very",
          "We walked through the cemetery at the end of our Salzburg tour. I always have reservations when visiting cemeteries that I am intruding on the final resting place of people I never knew or had any contact with. However, this cemetery was recommended as being a valuable link",
          "So glad I got to see the iconic cemetery where one if the most fraught with anxiety scenes was filmed. I wonder just how much it has changed since the movie was filmed. Lots of these graves are more recent than when the film came to be.",
          "In the midst of Old Town, this cemetery is well taken care of and it is obvious a tribute to both the dead and the living. Manicured it was interesting to read the names and dates of the departed as many families were buried together. Touching.",
          "the cemetery is located in the middle of Old Town. The grave sites are leased by the family and they have to renew them in order to keep their loved ones buried there. If not then the bodies are buried elsewhere and then another family can lease the grave site. The dates",
          "The most immediate draw was the grave of Leopold Mozart. His monument is very close to the entrance and easy to find. Having paid my respects, I was very pleased to wander the cloisters. The statuary is so sad! Romanticized to be sure, but also sweet and innocent in its own",
          "An amazing cemetery.. it has a hallway surrounding the peaceful yard with a beautiful round building right in the center. If you like to read very old tombstones, you will spend a long time at St. Sebastian's'.",
          "In the middle sits a gorgeous building - the grounds were green and quiet. Pleasant to walk around and look for the grave that stands for Mozart's wife. Seeing he didn't have an actual grave this was the closest to being able to pay respects.",
          "Tricky to find the entrance, but finally I did!, you don't go through St Sabastian's Church, you go around the corner, thrre is no sign, so just look in doorways & you will find it. Interesting...Crypts around the perimeter, Graves in the center.",
          "We found this site as we were walking through Salzburg and remembered a scene from the movie. Ia am sure it was filmed on a set but this definitely would have been the inspiration for it. The cemetery was very peaceful and quite interesting with the Fortress as a backdrop.",
          "A must see for Mozart fans as his wife and father are buried here. This place has a stillness and peacefulness about it. The sculptures are magnificent and some of Salzburg's finest people are at rest here.",

          "This seems weird recommending a cemetery but this one is quite beautiful with interesting history and unique markers.",
          "Happily we stumbled on this fetching and exotic cemetery, hiding on back streets up against the cliff wall under the castle. It is a riot of \"yard art\" marking last resting places. What a whimsy! And it is right next door to the oldest restaurant (803) year without the",
          "It was a joy to walk through the Cemetery, away from the hustle and bustle of the City. Our guide explained the history of the site and explained the catacombs set high in the rocks. The area is beautifully maintained and very much in current use. Definitely worth a detour when",
          "Spent here some quiet time right after it was opened in the morning, so there were no other people around, which added to the atmosphere. An interesting place to walk around and look at the old graves.",
          "We spent an interesting hour on our last morning wandering round the cemetery reading the epitaphs. The self-importance of the old Salzburgers was hilarious. Everybody seems to have had a connection with the old Emperor, even if it was only \"wife to the Emperor's baker's",
          "We didn't know about this cemetery when we came to Salzburg, but it was a very interesting stop... the tombs and markers are very crowded, and we learned an interesting note in that if the family doesn't pay \"rent\" every few years, the marker will be removed... there are tombs",
          "Names such as Mozart and Wagner are scattered amongst the memorials and gravestones. None are the famous composers we all know but family members in particular Mozart's father & Mother. I could spend an hour looking at the cloister memorials let alone the graves in the cemetery",
          "Walking into the Cemetery of St. Sebastian a quiets peacefulness prevails. Walking through a history of both the famous and the fortunate, one gets a sense of the history of time. I would highly recommend the visit.",
          "We stopped through while walking around the city. Lots of history of some of the famous Salzburg residents. Its very serene in the cemetery because it is walled in. If you are a writer, visit, you're guaranteed to be inspired.",
          "The cemetery is filled with the names and bones of many of Salzburg's most historic figures. That alone makes it worth a stop. It is also a place for reflection with its packed gardens and walkways. The grave markers in stone and iron tell the history of many of history's",
          "This was one place I wanted to see and it was close to our wonderful Hotel Stadtkrug. It is behind St. Sebastian church in a large cloistered area accessed by a small walkway a couple of doors from the entrance to the church in Linzer Gasse. Many important locals were buried",
          "The cemetary is accessible via a short walkway on the pedestrial only road Linzer Gasse. When we visited at around 10am, there were no other visitors around. The graves of Mozart's family stands out from the rest with additional plants and flowers planted near the head stones.",
          "Hidden behind the equally impressive St Sebastian's church this graveyard bizarrely makes you go \"wow\"....its quiet, peaceful yet full of interesting things to see. Members of Motzarts family, but not Mozart himself, buried here too.",
          "I first discovered this cemetery when i was staying in the old monestry/hostel next door in 1998. I went back on this trip to take a better look. Its a beautiful cemetery as far as cemeteries go. You will find many of Mozarts family members as well. Worth a look.",
          "Peaceful setting with most dates from the 1700s. Somewhat secluded but worth a quick stroll. Large trees add a nice touch of peaceful seclusion.",
          "Went in after visiting St.Stephan Church. Looking at the cemetery, walking round, reading the names of those who were buried here from the tombstones , resulted in a nostalgic feeling for those who had rested in peace here. Many members of the Mozart family have been buried",
          "Ok, so cemeteries are....grave. The type of headstones and early dates will intrigue you. It's very peaceful to walk through.",
          "The Mozart family tomb lies here as well as the burial places of various Austrian royals. It was a very pretty place to walk around.",
          "Mozart family and the famous Paracelsus are buried in this cemetery. It has some amazing old gravestones. It is worth visiting including St Sebastian Church next door. The cemetery is located at the rear of the church through a small passage with metal gate. If you are",
          "Walking through this cemetery was very nice. It's a quit tranquil place and although there were quite a few people there, it felt peaceful to walk through. Very well kept. I really enjoyed it.",
          "Stumbled across this place by accident! You'd be surprised when warning around here, the place is lovely. Look at the names, you'll be surprised! Worth 30 minutes for your time.",
          "We came across this cemetery as we walked around the Old Town and it was fascinating. Very old but very well kept. Certainly worth a visit.",
          "A cemetery is not really the first thing that comes into the mind of a city's attractions, but mind you, this is no ordinary cemetery. It is not a particularly large cemetery but its heritage is no pushover either. Take the time and effort to find the final resting places of",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect but this wasn't it. The monastery is beautiful, the beer cheap and tasty, the selection of food is delicious and the beer garden has seating for 15oo people! this was much larger than I ever expected and a place for locals to meet and tourists to",
          "Really beautiful cemetery, it's a nice escape from the busy city streets. Constanze Mozart's grave is also here. Little information about her though, so read up in advance to make it more of an interesting experience.",

        "wiki": "The Residenzgalerie is an art gallery in the Alte Residenz, Salzburg, Austria.  Its collection includes works by Rembrandt, Carel Fabritius, Carlo Saraceni and Hieronymus Francken II.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe state-owned Residenzgalerie provides a cross-section of painting from the 16th to the 19th centuries.  It bears similarities with the extensive painting collection of Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus Colloredo, which was exhibited during his era (late 18th century) in rooms that are now the Residenzgalerie.  After 1800, however, this collection was repeatedly plundered during the French Wars.  In the age of the monarchy, many of the works were transferred from Salzburg to Vienna.  \nA new collection was proposed shortly after the First World War by a group of Salzburg artists, and the Residenzgalerie was opened in 1923.  Apart from reinstating a permanent collection for Salzburg, the new gallery was also intended to be used by an art academy (never founded), encourage tourism, and provide a cultural attraction to go with the Salzburg Festival.The centrepiece of the Residenzgalerie is the Czernin Collection.  This was first exhibited at the gallery in 1954, initially on loan and then bought outright between 1980 and 1991.  Its paintings by 17th-century artists are principally Dutch, but also Italian, Spanish and French.  Assembled between 1800 and 1845, the collection's original owner was Count Johann Rudolf Czernin von und zu Chudenitz, who studied law in Salzburg and was related to Archbishop Hieronymus Colloredo.  Also important are a number of works from the collection of Friedrich Karl, Count Sch\u00f6nborn-Buchheim (1674\u20131746), featuring mostly Dutch and Italian artists of the 17th century, which the gallery acquired on permanent loan in 1956.\n\n\n== Network ==\nThe Residenzgalerie is a member of \"Private Art Collections\", a group of collections in Europe which exchange artworks and co-operate on joint exhibitions and other events.  Other members include the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna, the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, and the Museo Poldi Pezzoli in Milan.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page in English",

          "Really, I went to Salzburg to see the Christmas markets, I stayed for the museums. This place is a connected series of spaces, an art gallery, then a balcony overlooking the squares, then galleries on each side of the cathedral's naves, then more galleries and finally some of",
          "Pretty remarkable to see how the rich people from our past lived in these days. It's also painful to see how rich they were, because that period were also a lot of poor people. However, it's amazing to see!!! definitely something to go check out!!",
          "Recently,I returned to this fine,cozy art museum after 33 years,the last time I was in Salzburg.I enjoyed it even more now.I appreciated its excellent collection of Flemish and Dutch paintings as well as its small group of French and Italian paintings.Personal favorites that day",
          "Excellent audio guide. Takes at least a couple of hours to go round. This was the best thing to see in Salzburg. The place is huge and stuffed full of treasures. It connects with the galleries in the Dom. Really puts the history of Salzburg into perspective so would be a good",
          "Visiting the Residenz, or prince-archbishop\u2019s palace, was the best thing we did during our day in Salzburg. It cost us \u20ac10 as seniors which included an audio guide of the state rooms, art gallery, terrace with a view over the Residenzplatz, the Dom balcony & the museum. You can",

          "You need time to visit this but well worth it. Not crowded and chairs in almost every room. Windows were open so not hot like other museums. Bathrooms along the way.",
          "There you can spend easily a long period of time so don't come if you're in a hurry, only come if you really have time for it. Paintings on the walls, on the ceilings, everywhere... Even the chandeliers are gorgeous. The ticket prices are normal and you can spend quality time",
          "Check out the proclivities and predilections of clerics and nobility in charge for 100s of years. Not as grand as Munich, but still interesting.",
          "worth visiting. it gives a good glimpse into the way of life during that time period and also how mozart made it big. mozart's travel experience were intriguing.",
          "It\u2019s an imposing group of buildings forming a whole which is said to have been built from 1595 onwards on prince-archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau\u2019s initiative albeit, in fact, only the present appearance can be ascribable to him inasmuch as a palace was already in the same",
          "It is a great opportunity to see this building from inside and get an idea of how the royals used to live. If you like history, then you will need a good amount of time to go through all the rooms and the gallaries.",
          "We visited the museum but were disappointed that the state rooms were closed, the rest of the museum and galleries were ok but could not really compensate. The museum was also very cold, the room attendants were well wrapped up.",
          "This is an amazing building, very elaborate and full of history. The pictures speak for themselves but not like being in the building. The room and corridors full of art, some original furniture and immaculately kept. There's an audio tour which is very good. Fascinating place,",
          "You need a lot of time and patience. Place is huge. Yes, it is museum but at the same time you will see and walk through original interiors. Original rooms, paving, windows, doors, stucco work, frescoes pictures furniture. From time to time you will have some special views to",
          "Quite spectacular is the only way to describe the Residenz and I felt quite grateful to be able to see it. It definitely doesn't have the in-your-face opulence of Versailles, but it is well worth seeing.",
          "We attended a Gala Dinner here at the end of a conference. Food a bit so-so but they were catering for huge numbers.",
          "Home of the Archbishop, it rivals any palace. Full of art - massive paintings on the ceilings and grand staiways. Entry is \u20ac10, Free with Salzburg card. Budget 1.5 hours to see it all. Photography is prohibited in most areas.",
          "We used our Salzburg card to visit here and it was well worth it. Very quiet and serene with stunning decorations , furniture, historical information and artworks along the way . Very nice staff. Very good audio guide and information about how to use...much better than the",

          "The imposing courtyard and entrance to this gallery and state rooms complex are just the start of one of the most dazzling experiences you will have in Salzburg. We waited until day five of our holiday to visit and we spent a whole afternoon here. I am not a fan of audio guides,",
          "Beautiful, beautiful palace, excellent auditory guide. I am a huge Emporess Elizabeth and Franz Joseph fan so it was wonderful to see the glorious home they once shared. The grounds alone are worth the visit with the bonus of such a wonderful palace to tour. Do NOT miss this",
          "This was really good. You had a free audio guide which took you through everything really nicely- lots of information",
          "It takes about two hours to do real justice to this tour of the Residence gallery. The artefacts and paintings and halls one passes through is like walking down history. Fantastic experience.",
          "We have been to Salzburg many times, first time for this amazing tour. Seeing the Dom Residence, seeing the church from the organ loft. Do not miss this site. There is much walking and steps but very much worth every minute.",
          "As it was a cloudy and slightly wet day, we decided to visit this Palace, not really knowing what to expect. In fact there is a lot to see, both the building and various galleries with temporary exhibitions and - my favourite part - the Gallery at the back of the Cathedral which",
          "Part of the cathedral . Enter on the right 'museum' and take the audio guide to hear history dating back more than 2000 yrs. Excellent guide to assist with understanding the political and religious rulers over the centuries. Well intact museum and archbishop's royal quarters",

          "Interesting 2 hrs, looking through all the multitude of rooms that stretched through various linked buildings, as well as the upper floor of the Dom. Mostly on upper floors, so good views on to the surrounding squares. The free audioguide is a must. It explains each room and",
          "This palatial building houses a number of paintings from the 16th to the 19th century. Its collection includes works by Rembrandt, Carel Fabritius, Carlo Saraceni and Hieronymus Francken II. For art lovers a visit to this collection is a must.",

          "If you just passing by Salzburg it might be not a good idea to visit this place: you really need time. In fact, there is a complex of buildings: the Archbishop's apartments \u2013the formal and real ruler of the city \u2013 the Cathedral and an art gallery. For those interested in arts,",
          "Right in the middle of old town, we used the audio tour although we only listened to part of it in most rooms. Learned a lot of interesting things and parts of it are very decorative. Worth some time.",
          "If ever an attraction was worth the money in Salzburg it's this one. The place is huge. It's a big square maze that you continue to walk around, floor after floor, seeing many beautiful rooms, artifacts, furniture, and other items. One of the floors even leads inside the balcony",
          "We loved our visit to the Residenz. Gorgeous state rooms, beautiful art, fascinating history. Audio guides in English and other languages help bring it all to life. This is the heart of Salzburg, and the visit made the complex history of the city comprehensible. Informative",
          "The prince archbishops resident is a part of DomQuartier complex. It's more than a museum, you can fell the power of the Prince Archbishops few hundreds years ago. Very nice renovation work . The museum is just a part of this big complex ( the other pars are used by the",
          "Came in at 4pm and it's listed as open until 5pm daily. Wouldn't let me in, without any explanation. The older woman just had an expression of \"tough luck boy\". Felt cheated on my 24 hour Salzburg Card.",
          "Must visit the dom. I have enjoyed a lot and experienced the history. Spend time here. The arts are awesome.",
          "Not sure why this is ranked so low on the list of the Salzburg's attractions. Audio guided tour was very interesting and took us through Archbishop's residence/apartments, cathedral, and small art gallery from the collections of various archbishops. The whole tour took about",
          "This Palace is very attractive with its stately rooms built in the Dom quarters,over 200 years of architectural & artistic work covering the periods of Renaissance,Boroque & Classical periods.This includes frescoes,paintings,clocks & ceramics items etc representing those periods",
          "A very interesting and comprehensive historical account of this building. We loved the rooms and the d\u00e9cor and the description from our audio guide. Need 3 hours to take it all in especially if you do the Dom at the same time.",
          "The visit of this palace takes you not only to the City dwelling of the arcbishops but also connects to the cathedral where you view the inside from the level of the organs. Museum is a mixture of items that could be explained better. A worthwhile visit but not too long",
          "We didn't really expect such great arts and jewels but it really worth its visit. And the most great part is that you can actually pass through the 2nd floor of catherdral",
          "Wonderful visit with access to so many superb rooms including an elevated view inside the cathedral. Audio guide was really informative. Could easily lose two hours here, but so much to see and do in Salzburg.",
          "The residence was interesting enough but if you're looking for something really ornate and artistic, stick to the Vienna palaces. What makes this most interesting are (1) the historic context--the audio guide is a must; and (2) the tour takes you around over the terrace to the",
          "Part of the Dom Quartier an excellent art museum. The decorations in the halls are beautiful. You got an insight into the old European art. This was a great idea to include this in the visit of the whole area.",
          "There's a fair bit of value going to this through the Salzburg card as you save 22 Euros. There are a lot of rooms to see but you also get a view of the Dom Quartier from the terrace.",
          "The Residenz is worth some of your time - and if you have a Salzburg Card it is free. The audio guide is of high quality. The paintings and the decor are superb (the ceilings are astonishing) as are the views from various windows. and the connected link to the CathedraL The",
          "Beautiful museum, much more than we were expecting. At first we thought we where only going to see the residence, but you see several museums. This was one of the best ways too see the cathedral, as you see it from an upper level and look down. Don't miss the oddities and",
          "If you're at all interested in Salzburg's history, this provides an excellent insight. The audio-guides are very well done, I would recommend using them. You can walk quickly through rooms you are less interested in (perhaps the numerous ante chambers), and dwell longer on parts",
          "If you have the Salzberg card, definitely check this out as it will be free. Between the residence area, paintings, and other exhibits there was a lot more to see than I expected. You can also see the upper part of the cathedral which is connected. If you want to see some",
          "We went on the audio guided Domquartier tour. We saw the magnificent State Rooms of the Residence, the Residence Gallery with beautiful European paintings from the 16th to 19th century and from the Cathedral Arches Terrace we had a nice view over Residentplatz. The tour",
          "Nice to see inside & also to get a different perspective of the cathedral from the vantage point at the back. If you've been into other Palaces around Europe you may be a little disappointed but it still gives a nice insight into life over the century's.",
          "This building was the most impressive of the sites I saw in Salzburg. There's a lot to see here - paintings, jewels and furniture and the audioguide gives a good explanation of it all. The building itself and adjoining church are impressive.",
          "we took the full tour which takes you back to the beginning of the city's history and brings you right up to date. the state rooms, museum and gallery are a wonderful reflection of this very rich and unusual bishopric and princedom. there is so much to see that you could easily",
          "There is a great art exhibition, but the highlight is the opulence of the Residenz State Rooms. Check the hours because they vary from the gallery.",
          "I saw this gallery during the visit of domquartier. It's could be very interesting. If you have a lot of time and you are interested you can understand all with audioguide. Instead if you stay in salsburg only 2 days , maybe you can give a fast sight at the gallery during the",
          "This place is huge and keeps going. They have restored it to how it was back then and some of the furniture goes back a way too. There is an audio guide which is very informative and signs on the walls. Take the time to wander through, look at the detail like door hinges and",
          "Few people, quiet, can rest for a while, starting from there connected to the other part of the Domquartier with stairs, terrace, cloisters, corridors and finally you realize that you have come back to the Residenz.",
          "The Residenzgalerie is a part of DomQuartier Salzburg, located in the Old Town and is included in the admission price. Spread out over several rooms you can see fine examples of European painting from the 16th - 19th. The works are nicely displayed and give insights into Baroque",
          "We liked the self paced tour with the hand held audio devices. We learnt about the Archbishops residence and lifestyle. Was interesting and is worth the visit.",
          "This attraction has recently been renovated. The self-guide audio commentary (barring some bizarre mistranslations and mispronounced words) gave a fascinating insight into the sheer opulence and splendour enjoyed by the Archbishops and senior clergy in times gone by. Sumptuous",
          "Buy a ticket for the entire Dom Quarter (9.50 euros) and be prepared to be wowed for several hours. The included self-guided audio tour is excellent. You see not only the magnificent state rooms of Salzburg's prince archbishops with beautiful art, furniture, stucco work and",
          "Must see. Buy a ticket for the entire Dom quarter. Entry to the residenz gallery is a part of what you get to see on the ticket. The art collection is superb.",
          "This is well worth your time. It will take a few hours to see and helps with the overall understanding of Salzburg history. There are great views of the city center as you cross from the residence to the church area.",
          "We visited here on our first day in Saltzburg and it was a good choice except for the steps. My husband was having problems with his knee and this made things difficult for him. Not sure if there is a lift as we didn't come across one at all. Overall, though it was excellent",
          "The entire Residenz tour which includes the cathedral, the Dom, is very large and the audio tour can be very long. Don't be embarrassed to skip some of the extra segments which go into great detail. Plan on 2+ hours. The only downside is the audio guide stops after the organ",
          "Fascinating walking through and admiring the lavish decorations and expensive furniture. Please note you are not allowed to take photos. The journey starts through the religious part of the building showing crosses and other religious stuff. it then gets more interesting as you",
          "The Residenzgalerie tickets includes a number of different parts- from the historic residence, state rooms, art gallery and cathedral. It also had a balcony with a great view of the city centre. Exhibits were very well designed and the audio tour was informative (but you can",
          "It was the highlight in my recent visit in Salzburg. The Residenz has so many things to see, that can be a little bit overwhelming. The audio guide tells you a little bit of history for each one of the rooms but it takes 3 long minutes each time you press the button. If you do",
          "Central location and good audio guide to make the tour very interesting. Not very grand rooms and yet there are some interesting exhibits. May not interest younger children as much.",
          "The entire residenz museum (including the dom) is huge, so if you want to see all of it, I would plan on spending at least 2.5 hours here! The entire area is beautiful and I enjoyed the information from the audio guides!",
          "It's part of a combination ticket for the Dom museum. These a stunning, stately royal rooms with splendid furnishings and details. A must see",
          "I feel that a visit to this archbishop's residenz doesn't leave much information in my head after the trip. It is pleasant, but very moderate as most of the information given by audioguide are quite 'dry' - not interesting and i feel quite bored towards the end.",
          "We really enjoyed this attraction. We visited on May 1, which is a national holiday in Austria; fortunately, this was open. It's our habit to be one of the first in line at the opening time so that we don't get mixed up with tours and school outings. This was wise at the",
          "I am giving this place only an average review due to the fact that the audioguides were not available (they did not work). The guy behind the glass made it VERY clear we were too early and to come back at 9 and then there was no audioguide. Admission is covered with the",
          "Where else can you see wall coverings hung in 1775 still beautifully intact? The self-guided tour is well done. If the details in a specific room become more than you want to learn, just move on to the next. The Card covers most of the main attractions in town and bus fare.",
          "Beautiful old palace with a fascinating history. They also have a small art collection with a work by Rembrandt. They make you put your bags in a locker that costs three Euro but they give it back to you when you leave.",
          "We really enjoyed both the audio guided tour and the gallery on the upper level. The audio guide was of a high quality, providing fascinating insight into the building's life.",
          "Well preserved palace. Don't visit without getting the audio guide. A visit to the gallery upstairs is also a must once you're there. Both are free with the Salzburg Card.",
          "If you really wish to see how the Other half lives, then this is the place to truly to visit. Had a ball!",
          "The audio guide is a must when visiting the Residenz. It's an amazing place, very well preserved and presented. A lovely insight into the history of Salzburg (e.g. seeing the room where Mozart gave his first performance). I had the Salzburg Card, so there was no fee!",
          "The audio tour at the Residence really made it interesting and worthwhile. We enjoyed all the information and looking at the amazing marble and parquet floors. It's unbelievable how well everything has been preserved. Well worth an hour or two of your time in Salzburg.",
          "Salzburg was buzzing - Christmas markets busy. We picked up this attraction from walk notes from our holiday company but, even though the outside entrance was clear, you walk into an empty courtyard and have to walk to the far end to find a nondescript door. Even going through",
          "If you visit Salzburg, I highly recommend you to go to this Alte Residenz (Old Residence) and Residence Gallery too! Especially, if you buy Salzburg card during autumn or winter time, not many places you can go outdoor since many of them only open during summer. However, the",
          "We visited on a Monday early afternoon and there were very few people there. My kids enjoyed the personal audio guides as it meant they could go at their own speed, or in my kids case try to beat everyone else. We enjoyed the visit and it is always interesting to see how",
          "Yes, we got a Salzburg card, they are so worth it. Managed to visit the State rooms on our last day as it had been closed for functions previously and it was definitely worth it. The audioguide was great and, as it is tucked away, there were very few visitors when we went. The",
          "Pleasent and well organized tour along nice ancient rooms using audioguide. You can take fotos; there are chairs so you can sit and relax during your visit.",
          "The rooms were shut because of restoration work but no one mentioned that when we got our tickets. The art gallery was ok but didn't justify the full ticket. No photography is permitted inside and the attendants follow you from room to room - presumably to prevent a",
          "Got a private tour via a personal friend, but it is worth viewing on your own. Restoration is going on and I look forward to seeing more work done on our next visit. This palace belonged to the Archbishops, but it is not very religious.",
          "Beautiful historic rooms with original d\u00e9cor and nearly original furniture in a palace. Cost 9 euro which we thought was great value. The audio commentary was precise and informative. Great way to spend a few hours. There is also an art gallery containing mainly paintings,",
          "We got a Salzburg Card, which includes free admission to many places and this was one of them. If we had not gotten the card, we might have missed this place and I'm really glad we went. The rooms are absolutely amazing - I can't even imagine anyone living that lifestyle and I'm",
          "We took a day trip to Salzburg from Vienna so we almost didn't have time to make it here, but I am so glad we did, because it was one of the highlights of the day. The state rooms were magnificently ornate and the audio guide did a very nice job. The art museum was also really",
          "The Residence itself - the old aristocratic rooms - are definitely worth seeing. Very ornate and lovely. The art gallery, which is a separate admission, is small and not worth the extra money.",
          "A must see, nice rooms, audio tours in multiple languages. If you have not had one in Vienna a Sacher Torte can be purchased next door.",
          "Not outrageously expensive as these tours can tend to be and with an excellent audiophone commentary, the various rooms held such sufficient and various interest not to make this tour monotonous. The various stoves were fascinating and, importantly, also a sight of how they",
          "Our trade association booked this venue for the formal dinner that closed our 60th annual conference. Dinner was excellent, but the service was amazing. The waiter had choreographed their service so that literally four waiters surrounded our eight-person round table, and on cue",
          "The picture gallery itself was closed so we had an audio tour around the state rooms and follwed it up by an intimate 45 minute concert on harpsichord accompanied by violin. The state rooms were beautiful and we particularly enjoyed the decorative stoves in each room used to",
          "They have Audio device for the Story of this Residenzgalerie. They have many Crystal lights, extra ordinary furnitures covered with Gold, amazing high ceiling hand made painting.",
          "The Residenz as the official state rooms of the Salzburg prince archbishops, gives an insight into the history of the place. Some facts I didn't know plus an unusual scultpure exhibit. The opulence of the original rooms is definitely interesting.",
          "Picture galleries are not a favourite of mine but this is so much more. Armed with my audio guide I set off to explore this interesting building. From room to room I wandered lead by the helpful commentary. History, yes there was a lot of it but it's not dry and dusty and there",
          "Disappointingly, the picture gallery was closed when we visited Salzburg. Oh well, the staterooms it was. An audio guide is a must to completely appreciate the staterooms. While they are quite awe-inspiring in themselves, without the audio guide, a big part of the story would",
          "This is just one of those places where you look at details of architecture that are unseen in today's buildings. It was one of my favorite places in Salzburg. I wish I had a dollar for every step inside.",
          "The heading of the attraction is a bit misleading as you could see the actual picture gallery (make sure it will be open, I think it is closed till 06/13) and/or the residence. When seeing the residence they will hand you out an audioguide less the earphones. You are supposed to",
          "We visited the Residenz in November because we noticed that admission (including a good audio guide) was free with a Salzburg card, and we seemed to be the only people in the rooms for the majority of our time there. These official state rooms of the prince archbishops are",
          "This was an unexpected delight. We have been to Salzburg many times and we are always looking for someplace we haven't visited. This was a nice relaxing, enjoyable way to see some of the preserved history of the area. We want to go back on our next visit to Salzburg.",
          "The Residenz is the official state rooms of the Salzburg prince archbishops. The building is beautiful and the contents are mostly authetic. The audio guide was very good (not too long winded like some others we used while in Salzburg). Was definitely worth spending time on.",
          "It is not far from the tourist information centre. The fee was 9 euros and the audio guide was included. The staterooms were impressive especially the ceilings with gold leaves, paintings and engravings. The walls were covered with silk. There were also some unique clocks.",
          "I wasn't sure that this palace would live up to some of the others we've been to in Europe, but this one turned out to be great. The rooms are wonderfully decorated and give you a feel for 'old' Salzburg. And, if you are a history buff, there's lot's of historical significance",
          "I enjoyed this tour very much, as the audio guide was very informative. Three flights of stairs to climb before you commence the tour..but well worth it if you can manage them. Monday the gallery is not open, this to me was disappointing. The state apartments are a must see",
          "This palace was the seat of the Salzburg prince-archbishops. An au audio tour takes you through over a dozen of rooms with beautiful furniture and artful ceilings. Mozart played here as a child.",
          "We came on a rainy day and pretty much had the place to ourselves. I was great. Audiotour you can stop or start when wanted and skip ahead or stay longer in certian rooms. Very beautiful and huge. Another great place included with the Salzburg card.",

          "This is a small gallery of Austrian art and artists. Worth a visit, particularly of the state rooms are open. Photo's are allowed, but no flash. good variety of topics and artists. But most of of the realy good items seem to be in the Louve, or in Vienna.",
          "If you love Baroque then this is your place. The murals on the ceilings are amazing! Even our 10 yr old was in awe especially with the Alexander the Great theme. We went to get out of the rain and thoroughly enjoyed it. The decorative stoves are beautiful/ Most impressive",

        "wiki": "The Museum der Moderne Salzburg has two buildings at two different locations in Salzburg, Austria. The Rupertinum in the old town for new artistic concepts opened in 1983 and the Museum on the M\u00f6nchsberg for modern art in a contemporary setting opened in 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea for the foundation of a collection and museum of modern art goes back to an initiative of Salzburg art dealer Friedrich Welz, who donated a large part of his private collection to the state of Salzburg. Owing to his personal friendship with Oskar Kokoschka the museum also received a great number of works from the Austrian expressionist.\n\n\n=== Museum der Moderne Rupertinum ===\n \nIn 1983 the Rupertinum was opened as Salzburg Museum of Modern Art and Graphic Collection. The museum's founding director Otto Breicha also integrated the Austrian Photographic Gallery into the museum, which has become the most important collection of contemporary Austrian photography. The Rupertinum, situated in the centre of the old town, was mentioned for the first time in 1350. Under archbishop Paris Lodron, the town palace \"Collegium Rupertinum\" was used as seminary. Finished in 1633, the town palace was built in early baroque style. The house has a prominent location between Franziskaner Church and Kollegien Church and has been used as seminary by the Archdioceses of Salzburg for many centuries.\nUntil 1974 the Rupertinum was used as student dormitory. In 1983 the Rupertinum was opened as Salzburg Museum of Modern Art and Graphic Collection.\nOver the years the facilities of the Rupertinum have been adapted to comply with international standards; the most extensive refurbishment took place in 1999. Today the building offers ideal conditions for exhibitions of graphics and photographs. On Max-Reinhardt-Square the building opens into a courtyard typical for houses of Salzburg\u2019s old town.\n\n\n=== Museum der Moderne M\u00f6nchsberg ===\n\nPerched on top of the steep cliff of M\u00f6nchsberg mountain, sixty metres above Anton-Neumayr-Square, the Caf\u00e9 Winkler has dominated the city for decades. When the casino moved into the baroque palace Klessheim on the outskirts of Salzburg, the Caf\u00e9 Winkler stood empty for many years and this landmark building that served as a counterpoint to the medieval fortress lost its splendour.\nIn 1998, on the initiative of Landeshauptmann Franz Schausberger the state of Salzburg launched an international architectural competition for the construction of a new building for a museum on M\u00f6nchsberg. An 11-member jury chaired by Luigi Snozzi, selected the design of the Munich-based team of architects Friedrich Hoff Zwink from among 145 submissions. The museum was built in three and a half years and offers maximum possibilities for a variety of exhibition formats on four levels. The entire outer facade is clad with local Untersberg marble, separated by vertical joints.\nWhen the Museum der Moderne Salzburg on M\u00f6nchsberg was opened in October 2004, the former Rupertinum Collection of the province of Salzburg was integrated into the new concept of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg. Since September 2013 Dr. Sabine Breitwieser is the new director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg. She followed Toni Stooss who was more than 7 years director of the Museum. \nThe two buildings of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg offer 3,000 m2 of exhibition space for thematic and monographic exhibitions of 20th- and 21st-century art, as well as presentations of graphics and photography.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe exhibitions and activities in both museum buildings show modern and contemporary visual arts. Apart from the presentation of international works of art, the Museum der Moderne Salzburg also serves as platform for contemporary representatives of the Austrian art scene.\nBesides paintings and sculptures the museum owns an extensive collection of graphics. A further focus of the collection is Austrian photography after 1945.\nFurther, the museum manages the photographic collection of the Republic of Austria \u00d6sterreichische Fotogalerie as well as the photographic collection Fotografis of the Bank Austria as a permanent loan.\n\n\n== Directors ==\nFriedrich Welz\nOtto Breicha\nPeter Weiermair\nAgnes Husslein\nToni Stooss\nSabine Breitwieser\nThorsten Sadowsky, incumbent\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIn addition to their contribution to the air-conditioning system of the building, the joints of the facade can also be interpreted as a reference to the city of Salzburg: the chords of certain arias from Mozart\u2019s opera \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d were inscribed on the facade in rhythmically positioned slots using a special computer programme. \n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n\u201eMuseumscheck\u201c on 3sat.de, Videos und TV-series about the Museum der Moderne (German)",

          "Whenever \u201cmere mortals\u201d criticise modern art in general, they are usually popped into two neat boxes. They are either too stupid or empathic to understand the works, (think \u201cKing\u2019s Clothes\u201d) \u2013 or they are just old fashioned Philistines. In a world where causing \u201coffence\u201d is",
          "Unfortunately there was nothing moving about the modern art museum- the reason we were sad was because the staff at the museum were stone faced, surly, arrogant and unwelcoming. The only person who smiled at us was the guy taking the money - he had to otherwise no one would",
          "What an interesting artifacts collection they have. And the latest one, themed Moon is just cherry on cake. One cannot miss this museum once in Salzburg. Reaching here is easy, Google points to the location from which you get a lift that takes you to the top. It's a short lift",
          "Get the lift up for a great museum and views from the most beautiful location. You can also walk through the trees and up the hill to the fortress. Greta views from the restaurant for a cup of coffee.",

          "We took a taxi up the winding narrow roads, mainly for the views of Salzburg. We were not at all disappointed with the scenery, but when we decided to visit the museum coffee shop, it was up many stairs. A ramp ran next to the stairs, but the entrance to the cafe from the ramp",
          "I went up the mountain with my guide and we drove right to the Museum of Modern Art. Better than that is the spectacular view you get of all of Salzburg. They even have tables under umbrellas right on the side of the mountain with stunning views. Worth the trip up there but",
          "It\u2019s hard to recommend art museums as it so depends on the exhibitions on offer, but what we saw was interesting and well curated, and covered contemporary European art generally, not just Austrian artists. The position is it\u2019s best asset, situated on the hill overlooking",
          "It is so easy and convenient to come here, - just take one of the 3 lifts from Old Town. The art work did not appeal to me at all, but they have a restaurant With a terrace With a .beautiful view of the city.",
          "Let\u2019s start with the positives. The building is fascinating. The views from the top are magical. However the contents are all a bit disappointing. Perhaps we\u2019ve been spoilt with visits to similar museums elsewhere in much more ordinary venues. The bar and restaurant seemed",
          "My 5 rating is due to the view. Museum exhibitions during our visit were the most boring we have been to. Maybe we were just unlucky for art and culture that day. But at the top ,outside the museum, the views were the very best we had of Salzburg. We were lucky to find benches",
          "You can just take lift up to the restaurant and open viewing area without visiting museum for one of the best views as you view all of Salzburg including the fortress. Go on a sunny day and get lovely view of mountains in background too. Museum well laid out",
          "Tourists come here for Mozart and churches and Sound of Music - I get it. But if you want to see more of the \u201ereal\u201c Salzburg, which at least sometimes takes a step into the modern world, visit this museum. Even if you are not an art fan: the walk up the mountain is beautiful.",
          "They currently show Oskar Kokoschka - very interesting to see his evolution over time (remember his time with Alma Maler). Other Levels in the MdM show exhibitions on photography, which are off the mainstream glamour- and cinemascope-world of today. Disturbing how much these",
          "Admission was covered with a Salzburg card, as was the lift ride to get there. We went because the view from the path in front of the museum was made famous by Do-Re-Mi in The Sound of Music and it seemed churlish not to see the exhibitions while we were there. The gentleman",

          "Pay to take elevator to sit in the cafe and enjoy the view. They will stamp ticket for a free ride down. One of the best relaxed views of the Alps and city. Museum is disappointing with very few pieces.",
          "Anyone who knows this museum's world-class reputation for engaging, interesting, and provocative exhibits will be sorely disappointed if you visit now. Only two-thirds of the museum is open, and what's on display is a dreary collection of \"political art\" focusing on the 60s,",
          "You can access the restaurant/cafe without paying an entrance fee. The views across the City are excellent both from inside or out on the terrace in summer. We had a coffee and a cake for a reasonable price, with the service being very efficient (and a good command of English).",
          "While in Salzburg we visited many great landmarks and interesting museums, this is definitely not one of them. Really how can they call it art or a museum, I totally agree with a previous reviewer about the gherkin piece but it gets worse , the piece of three ties hanging",
          "It costs \u20ac8 to enter this building which claims to be an art museum. Here you can find absolutely uninspiring dross such as the collection of gherkins standing on various boxes. It's not art! There's no talent or skill behind it. Furthermore, the place is pretty sparse with",
          "There is one good thing about this place, and one interesting thing. The good thing is the view from just outside it - better, I'd say, even than the one from the Fortress. The interesting thing is how uninteresting the museum is once you get inside. What a waste of a great",
          "On a lovely October Sunday, we enjoyed tea and cakes in the cafe. The views are spectacular. We walked up one of the paths and found it fairly easy especially beautiful with the autumn colours. The waiter gave us free lift passes for the journey down the mountain. Our big",

          "You can have a overview of the town from the top of this museum. I liked it better than Hohensalzburg. You can just take a lift ticket if you are not interested in the museum itself. The city card gives free entrance to both the lift and museum.",
          "This is definitely a thing for contemporary art people. If you don't like this sort of thing, I think it's a pass for you.",
          "The view from the museum is amazing; a marvelous way to see the city. But, don't bother to go inside. I have visited many museums of modern art, but never have I seen such self-indulgent, utterly pretentious nonsense by talentless people who take themselves far too seriously.",
          "It is nice place to see contemporary art on the top of the rock. From the terrace is marvelous view of the city.",
          "To be honest, we only went in because we took the lift up for panoramic views. The whole of level one was dedicated to a woman playing her cello and it was certainly modern art! Very odd and not interesting (for us at least). They offer free lockers for bags etc. spent about",
          "The museum was at the top of Monchsberg mountain and you had to go up in a lift to get up to the top and it was great views and we took lots of pictures,this to me was the best part,but I wasn't that impressed with the museum.I suppose it depends on what sort of museum you like",

          "The view from the terrace and restaurant inspired me a lot more than the cold, metal art inside. Just not my style at all, so I wouldn't presume to comment on the art. If you buy a Salzburg card, admission is free, and even if you don't care for the art, the view is just",
          "They have no permanent exhibitions, but a number of temporary ones. These, seemed to me to be excellent quality, and also there is some variation so there will be something for everybody. However, the exhibitions are large, and they are all contemporary art. Some of these, I",
          "I enjoyed this museum overall but I found it a bit cramped. There was a lot in each exhibit placed very close together, it was a bit overwhelming. There seems to be more art than the museum can really fit. That said, there were some very interesting piece that I'm glad I saw.",
          "Some museums are informative and some are inspiring and this museum is both. So worth a visit and it's setting in Monchsburg is enough to make the trip itself worthwhile. Beautiful views of Saltzburg City",
          "The walk up the Monchsberg is inspiring and the view over the city amazing. The museum is quite big with good exhibitions. The interior can seem a bit cold and concrete like, but the art here is good. There was an abundance of guards when we visited, but they were very",
          "Museum is located on the top of one of the Salzburg mountains and can be accessed by a lift. Both the lift and museum are free with the Salzburg card and the views of the old town of Salzburg are spectacular. The modern art museum is OK but a bit disorientating as it seems to be",
          "Amazing view from the top of Salzburg, even on cloudy days. You can buy the one way ticket at the reception desk, go up the elevator, take a coffee at the restaurant and get a free ticket to go down the elevator.",
          "We went here for food and drinks for the evening, the view is stunning - from up high you can see most of Salzburg, but the food was a bit overpriced for my taste - we paid about 75EUR each for food and a couple of drinks. it\u00b4s worth it for a nice treat but just be aware.",
          "This is a very smart, modern museum (Think Tate Modern) and well worth the trip for the building, galleries, restaurant and bar plus the magnificent views of Salzburg. We got the lift up and walked down into the city. Highly recommended - a really great afternoon.",
          "This review is specifically about the restaurant M32 attached to the museum. We did not go into the museum we walked up for the view and lunch and were not at all disappointed. This is a fine restaurant not a cafe so of course its not cheap! The food is amazing though and we",
          "It is a very stark austere museum. The high ceiling spaces and all concrete construction match the physical location on the rocky hill. The view from the top level is astonishing. The current exhibition inspired by the American elections was interesting but created no thrills.",
          "When you leave the elevator, you are excited about that great view over Salzburg - even at a cloudy day in November. The museum offers modern art, has a nice and light staircase. The exhibition rooms are a little bit dark and have low room heights. Therefore the art items are",

          "This was a huge disappointment. If you have the Salzburg Card, worth tagging on to your itinerary for the views alone, but other than that it's a let down and you could use the Monchsberg Lift and avoid the museum altogether. Salzburg is a small city and a comprehensively",

          "Even if you have the Salzburg card which allow free ride with the elevator and entrance, it is a waste of time. The view on the top is really amazing, but you can see them from other sites( fortress...) I did not find any art ( may be I do not understand art). The only thing",
          "Perhaps I'm an old soul when it comes to art, but the modern art exhibitions on display didn't do much for me. They failed to capture my interest, and I left feeling a bit frustrated. The building itself is beautiful, and the views are phenomenal. We stopped for coffee and cake",
          "This was included with the salzburg card we bought so we did not pay extra for it and also there was a temporary exhibition of posters of toulouse le trec and others of the time. That exhibition was interesting, the permanent stuff was very disappointing and we do normally enjoy",

          "This is worth a visit just for the lift up from the main town, the super restaurant with probably the best views over Salzburg. I'm a bit of an art lover so I enjoyed the exhibitions but they are possibly an acquired taste. The one thing you do need to be aware of is that you",

          "It has an eclectic mix of mediums. I was not entirely enthralled by the current exhibits. This is a purely subjective comment though, they might inspire other visitors. The facilities are excellent. If you are not a fan of modern art, perhaps leave this one out of your plans.",
          "This was the second exhibition I've seen here and unfortunately, the exhibitions still don't match up to the great building the museum has. A couple of photos and videos of performance art and past exhibitions from somewhere just aren't enough. They need a nice permanent",

        "wiki": "St Peter's Abbey (German: Stift Sankt Peter), or St Peter's Archabbey (German: Erzabtei Sankt Peter, Latin: Archiabbatia sancti Petri Salisburgensis), is a Benedictine monastery and former cathedral in the Austrian city of Salzburg.  It is considered one of the oldest monasteries in the German-speaking area, and in fact the oldest with a continuous history since its foundation in 696.\n\n\n== History ==\nSt Peter's Abbey was founded in 696 by Saint Rupert at the site of a Late Antique church stemming from the first Christianization in the area in the days of Severinus of Noricum. Likewise the establishment of the monastery was meant to forward the missionary work in the Eastern Alps. Until 987, the office of the abbot was joined to that of the Archbishop of Salzburg: the two were always held together by one man.\nIn the Middle Ages, St Peter's was known for its exceptional writing school. In 1074, Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg sent several monks to the newly established filial monastery of Admont in the March of Styria. In the 15th century, the abbey adopted the Melk Reforms. In 1623, Archbishop Paris Graf von Lodron founded the Benedictine University of Salzburg, which until its dissolution in 1810 was closely connected to the abbey.\nFrom 1641, the abbey was a member of the Salzburg Congregation, merged in 1930 into the present Austrian Congregation (of which it is the principal house) of the Benedictine Confederation.\nIn 1926, the endeavours for the establishment of a Catholic university led to the foundation of the Benedictine college (\"Kolleg St. Benedikt\"), on which later the re-foundation of the University of Salzburg was based. In 1927, St Peter's was raised to the status of an Archabbey. Upon the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938, the premises were seized and the monks expelled. Nevertheless, the monastery was not dissolved and the monks returned after the war.\n\n\n== Abbey church ==\n\nThe present-day Romanesque abbey church at the northern foot of the M\u00f6nchsberg was erected from about 1130 onwards at the site of a previous Carolingian church building, it was dedicated to Saint Peter in 1147. One of the organs had been built on the rood screen in 1444 by Heinrich Traxdorf of Mainz. While the steeple received its onion dome in 1756, the interior, already re-modelled several times, was refurbished in the Rococo style between 1760 and 1782 under Abbot Beda Seeauer by Franz Xaver K\u00f6nig, Lorenz H\u00e4rmbler, Johann H\u00f6gler, Benedikt Z\u00f6pf and others. The high altar is a work by Martin Johann Schmidt. The St Mary's Chapel contains the grave of Abbot Johann von Staupitz (d. 1524), a friend of Martin Luther.\nMozart's Great Mass in C minor was scheduled to premiere in the church, probably on 26 October 1783, with his wife Constanze singing first soprano. However, the work remained incomplete.\nNext to the altar where St. Rupert is entombed lies the tombs of Mozart's  sister  Maria Anna Mozart (Nannerl), and Johann Michael Haydn. Also entombed at St. Peter's Abbey is St. Vitalis.\n\n\n== Library, archives and other collections ==\n\n\n=== Library ===\n\nSt Peter's houses the oldest library in Austria. Among the 800 manuscripts the most precious is the Verbr\u00fcderungsbuch, which was deposited in 784 by Bishop Virgil. Through continual acquisition, the library has grown to 100,000 volumes, focusing particularly on Benedictine monasticism, medieval church history, history of art, and items relating to the local history of Salzburg, or Salisburgensia. Special collections include incunabula and early editions, graphics including the devotional images collection of Father Gregor Reitlechner and the map collection.\nIn 1768, Abbot Beda Seeauer had the medieval Zellenbibliothek converted to the Rococo style. In 1999, it was restored and is now only accessible by special permission.\n\n\n=== Archives ===\nThe archive is for the purposes of abbey administration and the researching of its history. It contains documents from the 8th to the 20th centuries, in the following series:\n\nDeeds: c. 4,300 deeds up to 1700;\nManuscripts Series A: chronicles, journals, chapter minutes, visitations, endowments, necrologies and rolls, inventories, accounts and so on;\nManuscripts Series B: official records of estate ownership (cartularies, registers, feodaries, court records);\nFiles: records and correspondence of the abbots, the monks, the chancery and other administrative offices of the abbey; files relating to estate ownership;\nOther: photographs, maps and plans.\n\n\n=== Music archive ===\nAs a result of contact with notable musicians of Salzburg, St Peter's possesses a significant collection, much of it in holograph, with works by Johann Ernst Eberlin, Anton Cajetan Adlgasser, Leopold and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, Sigismund von Neukomm, Robert F\u00fchrer, and Karl Santner.\n\n\n=== Other collections ===\nThe abbey also owns collections of paintings, church treasures, artworks, minerals, furniture, musical instruments, a coin cabinet, and a cabinet of natural curiosities (not accessible).\n\n\n== Institutes in St Peter's ==\n\n\n=== Institute for Benedictine Studies ===\nIn order to give young German-speaking Benedictine monks and nuns the opportunity to advance their education on monastic subjects, the Salzburg Abbots' Conference of 2000 set up the Institute for Benedictine Studies to serve the study of and research into the Rule of St Benedict (Regula Benedicti). The director is Dr. Michaela Puzicha OSB.\n\n\n=== Austrian Liturgical Institute ===\nThrough the endeavours of Father Adalbero Raffelsberger, St Peter's was one of the earliest homes of liturgical revival in Austria. In 2001, the Liturgical Institute of the Austrian Bishops' Conference was attached to it.\n\n\n== Cemetery ==\n\nThe Petersfriedhof was probably laid out during the foundation of the monastery about 700. The burial ground was first mentioned under the rule of Archbishop Conrad I in 1139, with the oldest preserved graves from 1288 and 1300. It is centred around Lathe Gothic St Margaret's Chapel and the Chapel of the Cross, dedicated about 1170 and refurbished as a mausoleum according to plans by Santino Solari in 1614/15. Several tombs are located in arcades built at the foot of the Festungsberg hill.\nThe cemetery grounds are known for its 'catacombs' carved out of the conglomerate rocks of the Festungsberg. They probably date back to Late Antiquity, when they served as an Early Christian place of assembly and hermitage. The include two chapels dedicated to Saint Gertrude and one Christian martyr Maximus by Archbishop Conrad of Wittelsbach in 1172 and 1178.\n\n\n== Stiftskulinarium ==\nThe St. Peter Stiftskulinarium was first mentioned in an 803 deed issued by Alcuin of York, an English scholar attendant Emperor Charlemagne; it therefore claims to be the oldest restaurant in Central Europe.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in German) St Peter's Archabbey website",

          "Unfortunately, the interior was closed when we visited for renovations. However, we did get to enjoy the exterior and the cemetery. The chapel was impressive so I wish I could have seen inside.",
          "As all the others reviewers write, this is a beautiful church. Stunning architecture complimented by fantastic decor, paintings and statues. You walk around and admiring it's magnificence, but most disappointingly there is no information at all. It is so frustrating, it doesn't",
          "Stopped over at the Abbey and spent an hour resting up at the Abbey while admiring the beautiful architecture of the building and the paintings, etc.",
          "We made it into the Church of St. Peter on our last day in the city. It was cold and rainy that day, so we fully expected the church to be packed with tourists, seeking shelter from the weather. It was actually quite empty when we stepped in, with only a couple other people",
          "St. Peter's Abbey is well just amazing the ceiling and workmanship just amazing so much to see and look at we were pleased to visit its worth the look must visit",
          "We were touring around the baroque style interiors of Dorm Quartier, then the beautiful painting and then we saw this beautiful abbey!",
          "A very old church in Salzburg. It is not as grand as the Salzburg Cathedral, but there is a restaurant, souvenir shop and cemetery that you can visit too. Quite an interesting place to be at if you love history and this place is also the setting of the Sound of Music movie.",
          "Very nice church adjacent to st peters cemetery - worth a visit and very impressive art and lovely Christmas manger",
          "One of the more impressive churches we saw in Germany or Austria. A must if you go to Salzburg. Only takes 10-15 minutes to explore. The crypt downstairs can be skipped, nothing to see IMO.",
          "It was a wonderful experience entering the Abbey, so beautiful it took my breath away. Much better than the Cathedral.",
          "Some of the architecture in these buildings is beyond belief. Great to see them being maintained and appreciated by so many people",
          "One of my favorite churches in Salzburg. Understated and elegant baroque, painstakingly restored (the church has just been opened after several years of work). The cross that seemingly hangs in midair.",
          "We went there for a dinner concert - Mozart of course. The music was wonderful. Friendly service. Food was OK, perfectly acceptable, nicely presented. The prices on the wine list was steep (starts approx \u20ac84 a bottle).",
          "A good place to visit within the cultured and refine City of Salzburg. Very Solemn and Peaceful. Not overly crowded",
          "Every Church has its own personality, but this one is unique. This area is famous for the filming location of the Sound of Music. Cemetery and Chapel are immediately behind this building.",
          "Oldest church in town, rich decorations all over ceiling and walls, really a good exemple of barock style. Really deserves a guided tour to be fully appreciated.",
          "At least at the end of November, when there are relatively few tourists, the Katakombs offer a quiet retreat. It costs 2 euro to go in and walk up the steps, but you can get a nice view of the Old Town from near the top, or just enjoy the peace and quiet inside. St. Peter's",
          "Wow what a little gem. We missed it the first time we visited the area not noticing it was actually a church. We spotted it when a gang of tourists came out with their tour guide ! What a beautiful place , look ahead when you go in but remember to look up and back. Breath",
          "Do not miss this beautiful, perfectly preserved Church!! Europe has so many beautiful old Churches, and this one is no exception...\u2026 feels like a sanctuary.....",
          "If one likes ornate churches, this is one not to miss. It is beautiful both inside and out. Each church is different.",
          "The old cemetery is amonument to Salzburg historical culture. There you can find the grave of Mozart's sister Nanarel. The catacombs tour is something extraorinary. it is a place of tranquility.",
          "The oldest church and the oldest building in Saltzburg. The original building dates from 696. Lovely church and worth a look to sit and contemplate for a few minutes away from the crowds.",
          "We made a reservation prior arriving in Salzburg. As soon as we arrived the staff greated us amazingly. We would like to do a special note for the sommelier. The wine selection at this restaurant is really EXCELLENT!!. This sommelier is an artist at serving wine and really",
          "Another charming church again part of filmmaking set in grounds of s of music,picturesque and well maintained and a beautiful interior",
          "This abbey was one of the nicest churches in Salzburg. It was small & quiet & felt very spiritual. The main altar was beautiful. I sat in a pew & prayed here oblivious to the people touring in here.",
          "Likely my favorite \"Church\" in Salzburg, not necessarily for the stunning architecture and opulence inside, but for the incredible old frescoes and paintings that are still visible in portions of the church. It's worth taking a stroll through the cemetery as well.",
          "Including the cemetery...This is a very lovely old Church well worth your time even on a very short visit.",
          "The church and its grounds are a delight. If you like to be insulted by a ill mannered gate keeper, go to the Katacombs. They are mildly interesting and possibly worth the 2 Euro entry fee. But when we were there the person collecting money was offhand and discourteous.",
          "We enjoyed visiting this Benedictine monastery and former cathedral that is considered one of the oldest monasteries since its foundation in 696. The present-day Romanesque abbey church was built around 1130 and one of the organs had been built in 1444.",
          "The coolest was the walk up abd the catacombs built into the high stone wall . You need a ticket but it\u2019s worth it to see what feels like to go back in time to worship . It\u2019s on the side of the cemetery where the sound of music got inspiration .",
          "What a terrific evening to dine in the same restaurant that Charlemagne (Charles the Great) did. I can see why they claim to be the oldest restaurant in Europe but their food is as fresh as it can be. Definitely worth the visit if you\u2019re in Salzburg.",
          "Located in the Altstadt near the Dom this is one of the highlights of the Altstadt of Salzburg. A big plus is that all are on walking distance. The interior of the church is really impressive and entrance is free.",
          "Work on the buildings is still underway here, but I walked through the graveyard. It did not seen as tranquil as the one at St Sebastian's, but for ornate gravestones set into walls and artistic grave furniture it does go over the top.",
          "It's been closed for a year, and due to re-open in September 2019 after renovations. But from the looks of the construction outside, it seems unlikely. It is a shame that it wasn't done by the start of the Mozart Festival, when thousands of visitors descend upon Salzburg.",
          "i never miss a chance to visit the churches when i travel and not for its religious values, but solely for its architecture and the stain glass interiors. feel at peace...",
          "Make sure you see the picture of the church after the bombing. So nice inside and has so many organs. Looks around and count them! 5! Bathrooms are inside and clean",
          "Pleasant grounds with the monks cloisters in the grounds and the old church and cata-combs built into the rockface. The largest church was cordoned off and with no entry due to repairs. The smaller church was very pretty inside.",
          "Spend a lot time here very beautiful . The windows and stone work fantastic. Lots of interesting history.",
          "Walked through the abbey grounds and some buildings in a sunny afternoon and enjoyed the experience. The graveyard was interesting and the fortress soared above the site. Worth an hour or so to appreciate it.",
          "We visited St. Peters Abbey and Cemetery with our tour group in June 2019. Considered to be one of the oldest Monasteries in the Bavarian region dating back to 696AD. Scenes from the sound of Music were filmed here as well, such as the kids popping up from behind some of the",
          "Very nice to walk around and take pics of places of scenes from the SOM Movie. Lovely square close by to where you can buy local produce.",
          "We visited the cemetery during our Fraulein Maria Bike Tour. The grounds were very pretty, we did not have the opportunity to go inside the cathedral through.",
          "A very nice church next to priesterseminar. Beautiful decor.peaceful.right near Mozart wohnhaus. In the square.nice to visit.",
          "The Abbey itself was closed due to renovation work however the cemetery is stunning. So peaceful and well looked after. The catacombs were interesting. However the steps are very steep and uneven. The views across the city though are amazing.",
          "One of the most beautiful Cathedrals I've ever visited. I first came here in 2016 and made a wish to return with my family one day. Three years later, I got to visit again with my mom. Salzburg is so clean and refreshing.",
          "In the center of town, this church is a must-see. Take time to walk around the sides and admire the art and architecture. If you can, catch the organ or the choir.",
          "We stopped by the cemetery because my mom and aunt wanted to see the Sound of Music film locations. The cemetery is where the children jump out from behind the graves in the film. The cemetery is really beautiful and interesting. For 2 Euro you can also visit the catacombs",
          "When I saw the Cathrdek from outside it didnt look very beautiful for me but it was different when I when inside. We beautiful and a worth og visit",
          "I went to St. Peter's Abbey with my guide and I had a delightful time wandering around and having so much explained to me by Hans,my guide. Go here!",
          "We visited St Peters Abbey on a beautiful Sunday morning, and as we walked through the narrow streets the bells began ringing as if drawing us to their halls!!! Impressive architecture immediately comes to mind when first seeing this massive structure!!!! Just spectacular!!!!!",
          "this was a great catherdral to view. as with all these places they had some tours but we missed it..",
          "The church is impressive and you feel a certain reverence walking in. The place does not charge for entry, just a donation if you feel compelled, but you will want to pay to light a candle when you are there because you feel so close to the Lord at this holy spot. Salzburg has",
          "This is the oldest cemetery around in areas where German is spoken, dating back to the 7th century. The catacombs are carved into the rock wall of Monchsberg. There is a tomb stone that dates back to 1288. In the sound of music the Trapp family escaped through this cemetery.",
          "Had dinner there on our first evening, a three course dinner with live Mozart music. They food is lovely and there are so much wines to choose from 750 different types of wines.",
          "It is always interesting to visit old and new churches. This was not an exception- very very beautiful! Also, there is adjacent historic (very very old!) restaurant- visited it- worth of doing that.",
          "Visited the abbey on a snowy Saturday. It was beautiful to walk around. Very peaceful and well looked after. Definitely recommend stopping by.",
          "We visited this magnificent Abbey during our sound of music tour. Time stands still here .It is cared for a d shines in all its glory. it is just as I remember it in the film. I wished we had more time to spend in this beautiful place, The village of Mondsee is welcoming and",
          "During our visit to Salzburg, our guide took us to this historic Restaurant. The set menu was exellent and we enjoyed the famous traditional desert, Salzburger Nockerln. Normal size is too big for one person, but here it was mini-sized, just fit for one person,and very tasty.",
          "Worth a visit it's beautiful inside and massive. If I'd had the time I would have gone to Sunday mass even though I'm a complete atheist, they do Mozart concerts at 10am which are apparently wonderful.",
          "This beautiful old church is situated between the historic old churchyard at the foot of M\u00f6nchsberg with its catacombs and the open square of the St. Peter monastery. You can experience the tranquility of the graveyard and church, or a sumptuous meal in the luxurious restaurant",
          "Beautiful cathedral with easy access. Very devoted atmosphere inside. Visit during the middle of the day as it is quieter.",
          "For some reason, we missed going into the beautiful sanctuary this time, but I was there many years ago. We walked by many times, and I kept thinking we'd eventually stop,but it didn't happen. The exterior is Romanesque, which causes a big surprise when you go inside. The",
          "Once you walk through the portico, you have a sense of tranquillity and history. It was very cold inside as if the place was haunted from yesteryear.",
          "Good food but expensive Very welcoming staff and great Christmas decorations We were in a smaller room, staff were very friendly and gave good service",
          "Mozart in a beautiful room with decent dinner. Great service, good food, good music, lovely setting. What a great evening. Much recommended.",
          "I walked by this church which is near the foot of a hill. We were on a walking tour and we did not go inside. There was a fair line to go inside. As far as the outside the most interesting thing for me was the cemetery. The small cemetery was beautiful with elaborate grave",
          "We went for Sunday Mass and were we blown away! Didn\u2019t expect the beauty, opulence, perfection,warmth and spirituality the building exudes. An absolute must to see!",
          "As far as Churches go this is another fine example of grandure and attention to detail. If you pray then do so in the quiet surrounds. If you are an athiest then sit amoungst the prayers and marvel how human hands built such a magnificent building.",
          "We visited St Peter's Abbey (Stift Sankt Peter), a Benedictine monastery, in late Sep. It is considered one of the oldest monasteries in the German-speaking lands, and the oldest with a continuous history since being found by Saint Rupert in 696. The present-day Romanesque",
          "It was just a 10 minute trip inside to see the paintings on the ceiling and the music that must have been played inside. The benedictine monastery is still thriving.",

          "Very enjoyable evening. Wonderful music and excellent dinner. The service was spot on. Wine recommendation was perfect.",

          "Such a pretty church, the workmanship is incredible. Really enjoyed our time in this area, quiet, serene. Make sure you look up.",
          "We only had a few hours to ourselves in Salzburg, but this is one of the churches we managed to get into. Lovely, and worth a short visit.",
          "Not far from the Fortress just walk round the back through the extraordinary grave yard to St Peters. The church is beautiful and so very large. I enjoyed the stop, it does not take long add to your walk about.",
          "While my husband and I were on a tour of Salzburg, we had some free time on our own, and were walking towards the funicular which climbs up to the Fortress, when we happened upon St. Peter's Church, Abbey, Cemetery and Catacombs. It was amazing! The self guided tour of the",
          "St.Peter's abbey is a beautiful church with nice deco and is very beautiful with the sun rays passing in during the afternoon",
          "Wow amazing church in so many ways, inside, outside, setting, catacombs ... a def must see in Salzburg. The church, surroundings are free by \u20ac2 to see the catacombs. Yes worth paying and some great views, photo opportunities. Another of the Sound of Music links as it\u2019s where",
          "If you are in Salzburg do not miss to visit the Abbey. A great place to visit. Great architecture and really good minument",
          "While lovely, other European churches are more beautiful. If you have the time during a RS guided self tour it is worth the stop,, otherwise better choices available.",
          "We came out of the Festung bahn and walked through St Peter's Churchyard. The Abbey was still open so we ventured in. Very ornate and peaceful at the same time. A nice diversion.",
          "One of the reasons i go to Europe is to see the churches and this one is not to be missed. Such beauty and peace within.",
          "This church is worth a visit, even if it is a little on the gaudy side, what baroque church isn\u2019t! They ask people not to talk in the church so it has a peaceful atmosphere.",
          "St. Peter's is the most beautiful church in Sazlburg. It is in the Old City and is also famous for its' gorgeous graveyard. Parts of its graveyard were used in the movie \"Sound of Music\". A must see.",
          "This is a beautiful church as are most of the churches in Salzburg but if you'rein to churches, this is well worth a visit",
          "It is so beautiful inside and well maintained. Would highly recommend a visit while in Salzburg, definitely worth it.",
          "The St Peter's Abbey was not in our itinerary but we happened to walk pass and decided to take a look. It was not crowded and we can slowly take our time to admire the historical painting.",
          "We had dinner here this restaurant has been opened for 800 years. The food and wine is great you won\u2019t be disappointed",
          "It was beautiful and of history. I would highly recommend that anyone visiting in the area make plans to visit this!",
          "Walked into this Abbey completely overwhelmed - so inspiring, so emotional after 20mins - was one of the best places of worship I have ever seen. A must see!!!",
          "When you walk in your are immediately struck by the awesome beauty of Stift St. Peter. I can still hear myself saying one word over and over...\"WOW\"",
          "The abbey complex includes a museum which you can visit as part of the integral ticket for the Residenz and Dom Museum , all as part of the Dom Quartier The church itself is not always open - St Peter\u2019s is still a living Benedictine monastic community - the oldest in the",
          "Sulzburg is completely out of this world amazing...St Peter\u2019s Abbey just adds to this! Not only is the church worth the visit but the area around it is equally amazing",
          "If you only see 1 church in Salzburg, make it this one. Without a doubt the most beautiful we saw there. Incredible detail and a lovely experience.",
          "one of the most beautiful Churches in Salzburg... take some time to get away from the loud city and tourists and enjoy some quiet time in Stift St. Peter... take a close look at all the details the old walls of this church have to offer...take a seat, a deep breathe and some",
          "Dating from the late 690s and still extant, there is much to view and contemplate. Catacombs incorporating two stone churches rendered from caves on the berg are wonderful to visit. The cemetery is beautifully maintained and features decorative gravestones and vaults keeping",
          "This is a lovely building richly decorated with marble and gold. The altars are gorgeous. Since everything is so close in the old town Salzburg, You can go directly from one building to another. We first visited Salzburg on a tour, but since we stayed in a hotel in old town, we",
          "Beautiful and amazing place full of art and history. A must when you are in Salzburg. Mozart used to play organ at this place",
          "Regardless of your religion or beliefs this is a place for splendid contemplation. At least to marvel at the skills and handwork of the architects and builders of the time.",
          "A really nice place to visit. Be prepared for a long walk through the rooms of the residence and then into the gallery of St Peter's cathedral.",
          "Beautiful rococo interior, very light and bright. Note Rupert\u2019s tomb, the scene of 1750 Salzburg in the background is cool to see, only one bridge across the river, salt ships, etc. Be sure to visit the cemetery behind the church.",
          "A nice interior and bright which I\u2019ve found can be quite unusual. The graveyard is interesting, very unusual graves and all quite different. The graveyard gave inspiration to the graveyard scene in The Sound of Music.",
          "Admission to the abbey itself is free but you can leave a small donation. This belongs to the oldest monastic order in the German-speaking world. During a mass in 1783, Wolfgang conducted the premier of his unfinished Great Mass in C minor whilst his fianc\u00e9e Constanze sang the",
          "We had just finished walking through Petersfriedhof when we found St. Peter's Abbey. Its worth visiting if you are in Salzburg's old town. The architecture is simply amazing!.",

          "Don't miss this church, especially if you are a church/cathedral fan. Great frescoes, marble carvings, and paintings!",
          "I knew from my research I wanted to visit St. Peter's cemetary, but this morning I chose to step into the church itself and I'm so glad I did. It was early so I had it all to myself...except for the organist who was rehearsing apparently. It was like having a private organ",
          "A very peaceful place for prayer and contemplation. Lovely, quiet abbey, maintained very well. Located next to the main city and easily accessible via road or bus.",
          "There are so many beautiful churches in Salzburg and none will disappoint you. Each one is unique in its own way and all are exquisite. All you have to do is put on some comfy walking shoes and start walking.",
          "The Abbey is situated in the Aldtstadt. The Abbey is very impressive visually, particularly on the inside. It is well worth visiting.",
          "Wonderful old church and grounds, the only problem being that they seem virtually unused these days.",
          "The abbey is in the old town, so you can\u2019t miss it. The entire old town of Salzburg is beautiful which includes the abbey. Don\u2019t need to spend too much time. Also while here don\u2019t miss the catacomb, which is just next to the Stift.",
          "The architecture and decoration of this Abbey was impressive. I love visiting places of worship and this one is worth the visit.",
          "We really enjoyed our lunch. Service was friendly and quick. Beautiful restaurant in the center of town.",

          "You can't explain the opulence nor can pictures do it justice. You have to see it to truly appreciate it.",
          "Very nice old church. Gorgeous ceilings and a lovely lady at the door. Worth a visit if you\u2019re in town",
          "Worth a look at this stunning piece of architecture while you are in saltzburg.. go inside and look up Amazing",
          "You should definitely get inside, if you ever been in Salzburg. In winter you will also feel the difference of temperature in and outside the abbey!",
          "We just got to peak inside as an unscheduled service was in progress (we checked the website and it was supposed to be open to the general public at the time we arrived, but there was a small service) and we didn\u2019t want to be intrusive or rude. What we saw was absolutely",
          "I attended a performance of Mozart's Requiem here and it was a memorable experience. The Baroque church is the most beautiful and opulent in all Salzburg. The graveyard is also worth a visit and you certainly get a sense of the history of the place.",

          "The interior of the abbey is beautiful and is free unless you wish to give a donation to the church.",

          "St Peter's Abbey was founded by St Rupert in 696 and the abbey has been in continuous use ever since. The present church was built in 1136. It is free to visit. Absolutely beautiful inside. St Rupert's relics are in a stone tomb near the altar. It has been said that this abbey",
          "While the exterior is rather underwhelming, the cathedral is beautiful and spacious inside. I returned here for an Advent concert in the evening, which was a wonderful experience. I enjoyed visiting the evocative cemetery as much as the cathedral. There is also a lovely gift",

          "Old town Salzburg has many wonderful places to visit. We ate in a restaurant in the old abbey and were entertained there by a Sound of music presentation. The abby is lovely as are many other historic sites such as the Mozart house.",

          "Wander in from the cemetary to spend a little time in this jewel of a church. A real beauty in the heart of Salzburg, but transports you to a completely different place and time.",
          "This church is very ornate in the baroque style. I expected it to be busier than it was, as it is on the sound of music tour. Outside is the graveyard, strangely very busy, but I guess people came to see where the film was shot rather than the history of the place.",
          "Located in the center of town, you must stop and admire the wonderful outside architecture and then visit the inside of the church. Many statues and windows. Well worth the time. Easy to get to.",
          "We spent only a few minutes here, as there were five priest's conversing near the alter. Very pretty.",
          "In a city rich with history and architecture this is a must see. The church is beautiful and be sure to take the time to read up on its significance. Right outside the front door is an amazing cemetery that you will not see anywhere else.",
          "We enjoyed a traditional delicious group lunch in the Haydn room in the St Peters Benedictine Abbey Salzburg. Main course was Wiener snitzel, and for desert the famous Salzburger Nockerin (vanilla souffl\u00e9). The setting is really beautiful and as Salzburg is the home of Mozart,",

          "This church, cemetery and catacombs are sited just a few steps away from the bottom of the Funicular train. We had no intention to visit it but found ourselves walking through the cemetery surrounding the church - most interesting. My husband, my son and myself chose to enter",

          "The church is impressive inside. The cemetery surrounding the church is very interesting. There is a cost of 2 Euro to climb the steep, crumbling stairs to the catacombs that are carved out of the cliff walls. Interesting but not much there.",
          "This is less visited then the Dom which was nice as it was very lightly occupied when we visited. The silence in the church was unbelievable. You can easily walk through in ten or fifteen minutes but is worth the stop.",
          "This is an absolutely beautiful church. Some fantastic architecture. I would definitely recommend going in to see it.",
          "Very poor food offered - Excellent Mozart but too much of it - left early. We will not try this again.",
          "Worth a look, the Abbey was absolutely stunning inside, We also visited the cemetery where they filmed the final scenes of the sound of music. Looks a little different these days but it was nice to see as i am a fan of the film. Well worth a visit when in Salzburg.",
          "I have visited a lot of churches in Europe but this is one of my favorite. It felt sacred when I walked in. They were preparing for some event and a lot of people wearing white gloves were cleaning and setting up the beautiful candlesticks. Then they were tuning the organ and",

          "Very impressive church with five organs. The Baptismal font is the one in which Mozart was Baptized, and he would have performed here as well.",
          "Just stuck our heads in the church, but walked thru the cemetery on our way to the funicular after eating g at the Abby and found d a couple who were buried in the 20th century who we believe may be our relatives! The cemetery is really interesting .",
          "This church is a fairly long walk to get to, but it is worth the effort. The church is surrounded be an excellently kept cemetery. Before you get to the church the are some very good views over the city. Just before you enter the cemetery grounds there is the inclinator that",
          "One of the most beautiful cathedrals I ever seen in Europe - filled with amazing paintings . They way paintings are presented in St Peter is very unusual by the way - like in a museum , just on walls , not like iconostasis.",
          "We were lost actually, and thought we had finally found the Salzburg cathedral but it was actually S. Peter's. It was so beautiful so we decided to take a look around before heading out to the Dom (the nice staff in the gift shop told us how to get there!). The cemetery",

          "I had the privilege of traveling here with a chorus to sing in this beautiful place, Mozart's church. To sing, in German and English and Latin, in this amazing space is an experience I will never forget. You cannot take pictures indoors but you can take them in the charming, and",
          "This was the first spot we came to in Salzburg and there was a bride waiting outside with the priest to walk in for her wedding. It was so beautiful. And the next day we were there to go inside and their was a baby's christening. Interior was stunning and my daughter enjoyed",
          "the oldest restaurant in Europe,the special hall with the Mozart concert dinner is a gem and a joy....expensive, but a superb experience. Pay the money and go for the exclusive tables for 2 at the front.....expensive but worth it!",

          "The abbey church and setting is beautiful, but I think best of all is the beautiful cemetery beside/behind it. Other reviewers say to be sure to walk around the cemetery -- they are right. Do it. Of course it was a beautiful sunny summer day when we walked there, so maybe it",
          "A 'must do' if you are passing through the old town. the approach through the arch nto the square is lovely and the church itself is certainly worth entering. For wheelcahir users, be aware that there did not seem to be any ramps down into the church so steps had to be",

          "A very beautiful Benedictine church with an uber gilded interior, an impressive high altar, statuary and art works. The painted ceiling is magnificent, as well as the impressive organ. The abbey complex also contains several squares as well as an interesting and very old",
          "As advised in other reviews this is a beautiful place to visit. The only piece of extra advise I would give is to try and visit when the Choir are performing (there is a notice board outside showing days and times). This really does add something special to the visit and we",
          "Even though Salzburg was near the end of a 52 day independent jaunt...and we probably saw more churches,castles,monasteries and citadels to last 5 lifetimes.....we really appreciated St. Peter's.......and the cemetery close by! DO STOP here.",
          "We were with a religious tour group and were fortunate enough to have a private Mass in St. Peter. The church is beautiful with many interesting features. The cemetery was equally as interesting and will be familiar to Sound of Music fans. Salzburg was one of our favorite",

          "Honestly, the different architectural inspirations were too much for my eyes. In such cases, I can hardly admire the whole scene. It was too much of a melting pot. When I got in, I had the impression that all architectonic styles had exploded in front of me. I gave it a 3 stars",
          "We attended the Mozart dinner and concert at this beautiful venue. The dinner was tasty and the music and the two singers were a pleasure to listen to. It is worth paying a little extra for the exclusive package if you want front seats and a little more luxury..",

          "This beautiful church not only has Baroque all over, and beautiful to boot, but also interesting surroundings in the back yard. The spquare in the fornt of the church is worth noticing.",

          "It becomes difficult telling churches apart when they are all so ornate. This one include the crypt of St. Rupert, Salzburg's patron saint. Also, check out the cemetery behind the church, and the bakery behind the cemetery. And don't forget the catacombs. All worthwhile.",
          "One of the things I appreciated about St. Peter's Abbey- besides its beauty- is that there is a little sign in front of the door explaining that this is a quiet place meant for prayer and that no tour groups were allowed. Admittence is free by donation, and once you enter this",

          "The Church itself is dark, but very beautiful Inside. One interesting feature is a carved iron door between the nave and the Church proper. If you're in there, talk softly, or you may be scolded in German. The cemetery at the back of the Church is what fans of the Sound of",

          "St Peters is more than just a church, it is the grounds that make it worth the trip. The cemetery is a small, quiet get away from the hustle and bustle. The bakery is a must. We did not eat at the restaurant, but did have a drink and snack. Were else can you have a beer",
          "This is a lovely church. Personally I enjoyed Salzburg Cathedral more, but my husband preferred this one. Either is wonderful (and you should visit both)! I would have given St Peter's 4 stars, but the cemetery there is was deserved the 5th! It is an amazing celebration of life",
          "We visited this place as a part of our sound of music tour. The guide explained as everything from outside as they don't talk inside the Abbey. It was very peaceful inside and just sitting inside for 5 minutes and admiring the inside of this place is amazing.",
          "such an amazing place to while away a couple of hours. Although the abbey was busy with tourists it was quiet andthere was plenty of room to be alone with your thoughts fora while",
          "We entered this church after hearing choral music emanating from within, the choir and orchestra was practicing and oh what a wonderful sound it was and after a time was pure bliss for quiet reflection. We have visited it previously and the architecture etc was wonderful to",
          "This is a real church and there was a mass in process and I didn't want to disturb the people. It's way nicer than the cathedral. You feel that it's a sacred place were you can pray.",
          "St. Rupert the \"salty\" archbishop is buried inside. Be sure to check out the cemetery just outside. It is very peaceful and beautiful even in October.",
          "Beautiful Church... Amazing architicture! Hauntingly beautiful cemetary just behind it... Dont miss it when in Salzburg!",
          "A must-see in Salzburg. Stop and admire, pray , be mesmerised, relax in a spiritual environment , look around and learn about the area. Heart and soul of Salzburg !! THEN... CROSS THE PLAZA AND GO PAY SHORT VISIT IN ST. MICHAELS CHAPEL .. ATTEND A 4PM MASS IF YOU LIKE...",
          "I like to visit churches, is where you can have a sense of history of the town. You find many historic facts. This one is full of ornaments and really well maintain.",
          "we went to st peters as we wanted to see were scenes from the film sound of music were filmed it was a beautiful place and the catacombs were very interesting",
          "Europe is filled with beautiful churches, and this one is towards the top of the list. Don't miss Mozart's baptismal font.",
          "This is definitely a must see in the heart of Old Town. Beautiful church with old elegant cemetery next to it.",
          "This church is famous for its cemetry whose image was used in the movie \"Sound of Music\". But it is a \"must\" to visit this church not only because of this, but also this is one of the oldest church in Salzburg (founded by Holy Rupert who made the town of Salzburg) and also due",
          "We stopped in after having lunch next door at ancient St Peter's Stiftskeller. there are several wonderful churches in Salzburg, but this one is a standout. One elaborate side chapel after the other glitters with gold gilt and extraordinary sculpture. Don't miss it.",
          "We wanted to experience a Mozart tribute in his birthplace but thought a full 2 hour concert may be a little too much for us, so we reserved a spot at St. Peters Stifskellers Mozart concert dinner. This was perfect for us, 90 minutes of his best music with performers dressed to",
          "Beautiful, historic Abbey. I was surprised at just how beautiful it was with all of the paintings on the ceiling and detail work in the plaster.",
          "My mum told me to visit this church as she said Mozart had played the organ there. It truly was beautiful inside and the pipe organs were amazing. You are taken back in time in the silence and can imagine what it would have been like in Mozarts time.",
          "This church is one of the most beautiful in Salzburg and the ceiling paintings are amazing. My favourite is the one of the Lord calming the storm as the disciples in the boat look terrified. We also visited the St Peter's Abbey shop, which was a revelation: there were so many",
          "The interior is beautiful and the grounds are so lovely. Be sure to visit the catacombs, they provide nice views onto the cemetery.",
          "Lots and lots of beautiful paintings, definitely a must see in Salzburg. Hopefully I can visit a mass next time, since I missed the Michael Haydn mass I had originally planned to attend.",
          "I don't even want to be buried, but this is where I'd choose. Peaceful and beautiful. Totally worth visiting because of the uniqueness.",
          "Very beautiful. Saw this on a day when there were extensive preparations for a carnival outside. This is a very good example of a beautiful cathedral.",
          "Unbelievable site to visit. Lots of character and immense history. Would definitely recommend this to travellers.",
          "Fantastic we did this in the sound of music tour. There was a mass going on whilst there. Fantastic cathedral. In a beautiful village, be sure to stop and have the apple strudel in this village!",
          "Absolutely stunning! Apart from being an inspiring place to worship this has to be one the finest art galleries one would ever visit! The whole building impresses. A wonderful gem of Salzburg!",
          "Don't miss St. Peter's Abbey! This church is very ornate and beautiful as others have noted; there is gold, gold, gold everywhere and the frescoes on the ceiling are really lovely......I have to add that the adjoining cemetery is also very interesting; the gravesites have well",
          "A must see! Absolutely gorgeous. It is an Italian Baroque design. While there is no stained glass, it was our favorite of our Central European trip.",
          "This is a gorgeous church, with all the ornate art you would expect. The stations are overlaid in gold, and the frescos are stunning.",
          "Pay 2 euro to visit the hight, the view there is awesome, you can take the Dom and the Resident in a picture from the best angle. Especially the moment when sun comes down.",
          "To me this was the best church that I saw in Salzburg. The Romanesque architecture hold you in awe. Several altars in typical rococo design is the main attraction. This is a must visit attraction.",
          "This is a very beautiful cathedral. There was an art installation while we were there in the catacombs. It was unique and a pleasant surprise.",
          "A beautiful church, and interesting buildings and graveyard too. The bakerei smells delicious as you walk past!",
          "Rather dull exterior brings a surprise inside. And paintings on the ceiling caught our eyes immediately after entering the church. But whole interior is pleasant - with massive organs over the entrance and many richly ornamented altars. Enjoy it.",
          "Beautiful and unique church. The even still have weddings here. It is not as large as the Dom, but it is very detailed on the inside.",
          "St. Peter's Abbey Church is a must visit when you are in Salzburg Old town. Very spectacular and admirable architecture. It was busy in August where many visitors take the chance to visit the Church.",
          "This is one of my favorite churches in Europe. The Baroque architecture is stunning. The ornate iron gate when you enter the church just amazes. You walk in and your senses are on overload at the same time you feel a peace.",
          "The St Peter's area is beautiful although St Peter's Abbey itself is \"just another beautiful church\" rather than spectacular. However inside the whole area there is a charming graveyard another small church and you can visit the catacombs cheaply and get a good view. In the",
          "I think the most amazing thing is how they have preserved everything, after all these years, and still made life go on all around it. There are restaurants, plays, museums, all over the plaza, while still using the church for mass, prayers, etc.",
          "Try to book the Friday or Saturday evening concert and dinner (in a separate concert hall) then go up early to see the abbey church. Yes, it is a climb but there are spectacular vistas both in and outside the church.",
          "It will take you going up over 100 steps to get to the Abbey but it is worth it, especially if you are a fan of the Sound of Music. This is the Abbey where Maria Von Trapp studied and was married. It also offers stunning views of Salzburg. Plan on taking your time going up",
          "We attended a Mozart Matinee and witnessed something quite spectacular, a young Hungarian lad (just 23yo) gave us a concert that we will always remember. It was a smaller venue with a small audience and what struck us was the personal nature of the concert. From there we looked",
          "Spectacular and very old place. Restaurant with fabulous kitchen and service. Wiener schnitzel a specialty but also a lot of otherdishes that make your mouth water. Open very late in the Festspiel season.",
          "We attended the Mozart concert and dinner in the Baroque Hall of St. Peter's. We made reservations (a must) through our hotel. Tickets were 56 Euros each. The hall was elegant and beautiful with carved and painted ceilings, stained glass, crystal chandeliers, candles, white",
          "As is typical with many European churches and cathedrals, this is stunningly beautiful inside with paintings, gilt, and fine hand work. It is worth a visit as is the cemetery.",
          "Take 5 minutes to stay in silence and see what history has inside. Reading a guide you could know what has happened along the centuries.",
          "One of the numerous churches scattered around the old town, this one had a beautiful inner dome and a sense of peace and calm.",
          "This was our last stop with the Sound of Music Tour through Bob's Tours. While there is a clear connection to the movie, I am more interested in the architecture and historical significance of this place. While not the most ornate, it is still very beautiful and worth a visit to",
          "The church glows with the gold rococo trimming, and there are Mozart piano concerts on Friday and Saturday nights in a nearby hall. I especially liked the glassed in choir on the left side of the nave.",
          "The St Peters Abbey in Salzburg is founded by saint Rupert & is one of the oldest monastries.The Abbey went through many construction & style changes & the present version one is the 17th & 18th century Boroque style.Mozart premiered his famous `C` minor here & he also directed",
          "St. Peter's Abbey is a beautiful church, but we found the cemetery along the side of the Abbey much more interesting and quite lovely. Sometimes it is a welcome, quiet break from the din inside the church. Also, near the church is a water wheel used for many years to grind",
          "The Church was more impressive than the Dom to our eyes, very High Church. Interesting Bakery with a water powered mill next to it, and for2 Euro (free with Salzburg Card) the catacombs were interesting if you don't mind climbing uneven steps",
          "Mozart Matinee Concert at this former and ancient Benedictine Abbey is magical. The gardens and cemetery are beautiful and memorable to fans of \"The Sound of Music\". St. Peter's Stiftkeller is, after more than 1200 years, a wonderful restaurant where the manners of Mozart's",
          "I grew up in a musical home, my Mother was a professional opera singer and my Dad played guitar and violin on the radio in Winnipeg Manitoba Canada. We always were listening to the Masters. Mozart was one of my favorites as a child. To be able to sit in St. Peter's Abbey in",
          "I visit abbeys, churches and cathedrals to experience their physical beauty and St Peter's Abbey is one of the most beautiful places of worship I have ever visited. The baroque decoration throughout is gentle, light and above all so very tasteful. It was a true pleasure to visit.",
          "The Mozart Dinner Concert at St. Peter's Abbey is a terrific experience, and this was our second visit. Claimed to be the oldest restaurant in Europe (since AD 805, and visited by Charlemagne when it was a monastery), the food was well prepared and the service was excellent,",
          "Travelled here after vsiting the Fortress. It was gorgeous and well worth the visit. The cemetary is peaceful and the Catacombs provide the most picturesque views",
          "being in old town salzburg you can easily see all the important sights since they are all very close by. you kind of meander from on to the other anyway. salzburg is great and you should see all of it. the st peter abbey is totally worth while chechking out. you will also find",
          "After three weeks traveling around Europe, the Mozart dinner show at St. Peter stift Keller was my kids' favorite thing! Fabulous!!",
          "We enjoyed visiting the cemetery which provided the inspiration for the escape scene in the Sound of Music. I would not consider this place a must visit site, however.",
          "Drift back in time to see one of the most famous and ancient churches. I would explore the whole church grounds including the restaurant in the cellar. Beautiful architecture and history.",
          "A must see if you are in Salzburg. The interior will take your breathe away. It is ornate and at the same time serene. I loved seeing the altar and the organs. The bells toll and you can hear it throughout the city.",
          "The Abbey is lovely, the bells toll, and the cemetery grounds are beautiful and unique. Very easy to find (just follow the bells \u263a\ufe0f). And while there I lit a candle for my Aunt who would have loved to see it all.",
          "Beautiful church and historic abbey. We enjoyed both. Way too many photos to post! I would recommend this to any one in the Salzburg area!",
          "Beautiful ornate church in the heat of Salzburg. Bells ring out throughout the day and the boys choir sang after the morning service. A must see in Salzburg",
          "One fifty something the three forty somethings in our group. How do you NOT go see the Abbey....the songs just start rolling out of your mouth. (We saw it on the Segway Tour - Just saying- Salzburg Segway Tours is FANTASTIC for SOM and ALL of Salzburg Old City.",
          "This was a wonderful experience with a lot of art, culture and history. The Abbey, grounds and cemetery are well maintained. Definitely worth to visit",
          "St. peter's abbey was as nice beautiful and pleasant as whole Salzburg. As I remember there was no admission fee.",
          "The monastery, catacombs, churches, chapels that make up,this area are full of atmosphere and of real interest to anyone who is interested in history or old bases of religion.",
          "I really don't think you can go wrong with anything you see or tour in Salzburg. It is a beautiful Abbey and city. History is everywhere and the architecture is spectacular. There is so much to see and do in the city you could be there for days.",
          "Whether in summer or during Christmas or Easter, this stunning abbey nave is a must see when in the old town. Christmas eve mass is particularly spectacular.",
          "maybe its just my dislike for all things rococo, but this church was incredibly disappointing (the rude employee that almost pushed my little sister over while exiting the church didnt help either). the catacombs and cemetery behind are similarly as impressive",
          "It is worth a visit it is magnificent inside and I also agree the nearby cemetery is a gem with beautiful flowers.Very beautiful. Recommend.",
          "This is one of the best churches in Salzburg. Inside and outside is beautiful. And when you add the cemetery around it, than this is a great spot to visit.",
          "It is a nicely decorated church. Ceiling especially looks impressive. Nice place to find some peace just like any other church. A cemetery nearby - Petersfriedhof - should not be missed.",
          "We did not visit the church but did see the Cemetery, free. This is a great place to visit, the grounds are full of plants and flowers. There are 3 churches surrounding this site. The graves are tended by descendants, if no one pays the once a decade fee the tombstone is",
          "A charming way to enjoy dinner and beautiful music and singing in an atmospheric room in the Abbey. Food was very acceptable and you purchase drinks separately. The tables seat 8 so you join with others which was very agreeable.",
          "if you love old churches then you will surely love this one. it doesnt really matter what faith you follow. Enjoy the beauty of peace for a few moments of refelction.",
          "The food was fine, but the singing (and acting) and the small orchestra was absolutely wonderful. Do book this ahead - it's a must see.",
          "The abby area is interesting and the cemetery is worth taking a look. Many places to meander about with plaques explaining the buildings and the history.",
          "Trying to see as much as possible this Abbey was on our list of must sees. And we were right its beautiful inside and out! The statuary is amazing. Not really too big but surely worth your time! A must when in Salzburg! Centrally located easy in and out!",
          "Is not as big, but is a beatiful place. Outside is the cemetery where the Sound of Music inspired the scene in the movie. And since is in thr Old Town, you do not have to walk very far.",
          "This is an amazing place that is so beautiful and ornate that it looks like it is from a movie. Maybe sure to visit this when in Salzburg. We loved it!",
          "We entered before a wedding starting with a soprano doing some practice. Marvellous to visit this place with a soprano singing which shows the great sonority of the place. Also all the decoration around like statues and painting with little to envy the cathedral. A must if you",
          "The Monastery Church of St. Peter\u2019s Abby in Salzburg is very beautiful and impressive, but different from many other churches / cathedrals we saw on a recent central / eastern European tour. There is a magnificent gold altar in the center, The exterior walls and ceiling,",
          "The outside is recognizable by the onion dome at the top of the tower. The inside is decorated in the Rococo style. It's one of the many wonderful churches of Salzburg.",
          "I could spend hours there, looking at the ceiling. The details are amazing. the staff member at the door was very informative.",
          "Friendly staff, great at many international languages, amazing food and historic location. ZERO negatives.",
          "Fantastic climb into the mountain under the fortress. Viewing platform gave us a fabulous view of cemetery and city. Wonderful history",
          "The architecture... The details... Amazing. Take time to look it over. The catacombs here were used to design the set used in the Sound of Music.",
          "When you walk into the graveyard you'll immediately notice the iron gates of the tombs copied in the Sound of Music. It's interesting how in the movie they make it look like this cemetery is in Nonnburg Abbey when its actually quite a distance from there. The graveyard is",
          "We've visited many churches, baroque ones. But this one had a special grandeur, with mighty and massive furnishings. The entrance is from centuries past. One feels the history and sees the centuries of architecture before one's eyes. I thought catacombs were under ground,",
          "If you've seen the movie Sound of Music, you'll recognize the graveyard where they hid at the end of the movie. On our visit, we were able to walk around the seemingly spooky but interesting graveyard.",
          "impressive how it was possible at the time of the building of this church to create such beauty as the total city is. Very much in need of spending time in it, more that 2 days for sure. There are lovely inexpensive hotels and guesthouses in Ruhpolding, just 30 min drive to down",
          "Quick easy visit. walking behind and around the church is nice to see all the artwork/paintings and figurines.",
          "Check out the restaurant at Stift St Peter . Sort of the greatest hits of Mozart done by a female and male classically trained opera singer with a quartet. Order the desert \"nockerl\". An austrain classic dessert often overshadowed by the Sacher Torte (also yummy).",
          "We visited many churches in Europe and this was the most spectacular interior of them all. First seeing the frescos contrasting the pure white ceiling with the light blue scrollwork running the full length of this majestic sanctuary is something I will never forget. It is so",
          "Really ornate tombstones, very old graves and some freshly dug ones! Lots of flowers and plants. Well worth a visit. We also visited the catacombs which are very plain inside but a significant feat to build out on what were essentially caves high up on the rock cliff face.",
          "This place does an evening with a meal and a small group of singers and musicians playing and singing Mozart. The tables are all for 8 so if you are a couple or small group you will be sharing with strangers. Some couples did seem to be on a separate table but you obviously",
          "The abbey, graveyard, and catacombs are worth visiting. Doesn't take too long to see. It must have been a challenge to carve out the catacombs.",
          "Historically, worth seeing and visiting. The cemetery located next to the Abbey, is of particular interest for its catacombs and for the important people buried in it, like Mozart's sister and general Collins. The restaurant, which you'll find before the cemetery main entrance,",
          "We walked through the garden and graveyard before having lunch. It was beautiful and spooky at the same time. The sky was overcast so that helped the set the mood. It is a very interesting olace.",
          "Actually it was a dinner which we couldn't choose the meals but everything was so divine and high quality for meat and fish... the ambiance is great! I loved it so much",
          "Beautiful Catholic Church in the Altstat. The ceiling is amazing along with the huge Pipe Organ. When I was there, a group of Catholic nuns were singing, it was beautiful. The Acoustics were unbelievable.",
          "It's another amazing cathedral. I don't want to sound boring but every church has something interesting...most are over the top in decoration and this one was no exception.",
          "Pretty little village, GORGEOUS church, nice little gift store. Happy we visited. Great photo ops. Clean public restroom across the square.",
          "We visited St. Peter's Abbey when in Salzburg for the day from Munich. The Abbey is very old and very Impressive from the outside. On the inside it is even moreso - Visually Stunning. Would easily recommend a visit.",
          "St Peter's Abbey and Cemetery is a fascinating place to wander around. The entrance is just off Kapitelplatz. There are many things to see including the abbey itself, the cemetery grounds, the Catacombs and the water wheel with a statue of St Peter. The cemetery is pretty",
          "Everywhere you go in the old town, you trip over exceptional architecture and interesting history. The abbey and cemetery are centrally located and well worth spending time walking through. We were on a guide tour and again only a short stay, but deserved a longer time.",
          "It really is nice to walk around the cemetery and enjoy the peace and quiet of the small church. This is where the Von Trapps hid after their performance at the nearby theater, although nothing was filmed in the cemetery itself.",
          "Not as huge as \"Dom\", but beautiful in a different way. Make sure you stop by - you can simply miss it just walking by the abbey gate...",
          "The church is not what I expected to see as we opened the doors...breathtaking! The cemetery is beautifully kept with love and respect for the departed.",
          "Maybe because I was with a tour and had a small selection to choose from but the food was just okay. The atmosphere was fabulous beautiful. Everything you would expect of old Salzburg.",
          "Located in the main square, with beautiful ceiling and a mystical atmosphere. Try watching a ceremonial there.",
          "Tall ceilings with wonderful piece of art. great architecture. Can do a quick tour if you are short of time.",
          "This is nothing special other than the cemetery. That is a must see. It's a big complex and there is a market in this area that is fun to see.",
          "We didn't really go in the abbey--just went to the crypts that were reproduced on a soundstage for SOM. Fun to imagine myself saying, \"You'll never be one of them\" to Rolf. :)",
          "St. Peter's is lovely and has retained some of its Romanesque architecture which is worth seeing. The cemetery is particularly stunning. Lovely and lovingly tended plots, fresh flowers everywhere, just beautiful.",
          "one of the nice church at old town area, easily reach from getreidegasse or residenzplatz. very impressing inside so nice garden front at backyard tombs deserve visiting and catacombs entrance also in backyard. After cemetery visit road will take you the slope of castle.",
          "A nice short walk through this abbey and historic cemetery should be on your list of things to do while visiting Salzburg. If you are a fan of the Sound of Music you will note the cemetery was replicated for the filming. Beautiful views if you walk up into the catacombs built",
          "Not too happy about being asked for money on the way out, but I know they rely on tourists for the income. A very modest building with delightful small chapels in the crypt.",
          "History plus plus fascinating place with some ancient catacombs and old graves plenty to see and wonder over",
          "The church is beautiful with its stained glass, but the main attraction is the quaint old cemetery with its old graves covered with flowers. This is where the Von Trapp family went in hidding before their escape",
          "This church was founded in the 7th century. The present Abbey is very classic baroque; however, it is very unique in that there are very large paintings perched high on the walls representing key stations of the cross and other significant events of the Christian faith. Very",
          "All the way from one place to another no one would really help us with directions or where is the best place to get them",
          "This was the most beautiful of Salburg's churches that I saw. Its attraction comes as much from its setting as from the church itself. A fine square to the front, a perfect little cemetery to the rear. Outbuildings clinging to the mountainside. The whole set-up impossibly",
          "Imposing building Christian world. Maybe not in size (although very large), but the spirit old time.",
          "a must see - where mozarts sister is buried and a lot of history is tangible. visit the small bakery at the end of the cemetery direction to the dome - they have the most awesome sourdough bread imagineable.",
          "A beautiful building - a haven of peace and quiet from the busy streets outside. Impressive paintings and carvings around the church and on the ceiling. I do wish people would respect the 'Silence' signs though - constant chatter can spoil the experience!",
          "We stumbling upon the Cathedral and couldn't help but wander inside (for a small donation) and enjoy the peace and quiet and architectural and artistic pleasures of a very special place.",
          "Very grand and beautiful inside. Even with so many tourists around there is very little sound - very peaceful. Worth the visit inside for sure!",
          "It stands majestic in the square. Rich in history, important historically a divine place. Richly ornate.",
          "The church is so beautiful inside. We especially enjoyed the cemetary outside. It is very well maintained with fresh beautiful flower displays and plants. A plus is to visit the catacombs within the cemetary. You can go inside for a very small fee.",
          "Walking to the top, you will see the stunning Salzburg view. The Abbey has great architecture, vey nice and beautiful .",
          "It is an extremely beautiful church! You can enter for free, however at the exit you may be asked for the voluntary tip.",
          "St. Peter's Abbey can also be known as Erzabtei St. Peter & Friedhof (official website: www.erzabtei.at/de/stiftskirche/index.asp?dat=Stiftskirche). I visited the site while a Mass was in service. Without having a clue about the speech, I sat down and admired the interior of the",
          "An absolute must see Church. Beautiful and elaborate Baroque architecture and even better if you can hear a concert here. You may wonder if it is worth the time to make a concert performed by the Church's own orchestra and Chorus. The answer is absolutely YES. We were",
          "They claim that St Pete's Restaurant is the oldest restaurant in Europe. Not sure, but what is for sure is that the place is magical and the food is heavenly!!!",
          "I have visited Salzburg in the past, but never went in to the St. Peter's Abbey Church. If I had only known! The church is a beautiful example of Baroque architecture. The patron saint of Salzburg, St. Rupert, is buried here. There are also relics of St. Benedict, the patron",
          "I did the audio tour through Dom Salzburg State Residenz rooms and part of the tour took me through to the organ gallery into the cathedral, I was aghast. It was just wow! Wow! The rooms were great too with views galore out into Salzburg. Tip! Get a Salzburg card, it gets you",
          "having seen many Basilicas and Cathedrals thought Europe this was truly amazing. Must see when in Salzburg",
          "This is a must see. One of the most beautiful Chapels I've ever set foot in. Take your time to walk through and investigate, once that's done have a seat and look up, thank me later.",
          "I visited the Franziskaner and the Dom earlier but including this one Salzburg has three awesome churches. You really have to visit them all 3 actually.",
          "If you like churches put this on your lift. Great architecture and the paintings inside are fantastic. You must also take the time to walk around the cemetery outside the church - a must see in Salzburg",
          "By looking at the exteriors you would not believe the treat that is waiting for you inside. Not that the exterior any less impressive but compared to the beautiful interiors yes it definitely lacks luster. The place is ornate and looks regal from every corner. It easily boasts",

          "I enjoyed this museum overall but I found it a bit cramped. There was a lot in each exhibit placed very close together, it was a bit overwhelming. There seems to be more art than the museum can really fit. That said, there were some very interesting piece that I'm glad I saw.",

          "This is a very smart, modern museum (Think Tate Modern) and well worth the trip for the building, galleries, restaurant and bar plus the magnificent views of Salzburg. We got the lift up and walked down into the city. Highly recommended - a really great afternoon.",
          "This review is specifically about the restaurant M32 attached to the museum. We did not go into the museum we walked up for the view and lunch and were not at all disappointed. This is a fine restaurant not a cafe so of course its not cheap! The food is amazing though and we",

          "I am an artist and therefore I go to numerous exhibitions and museums wherever we go. Unfortunately my whole experience was somewhat underwhelming. Don't get me wrong - the exhibitions were good, art excellent (also down to taste) but I felt underwhelmed with the whole",
          "This was a huge disappointment. If you have the Salzburg Card, worth tagging on to your itinerary for the views alone, but other than that it's a let down and you could use the Monchsberg Lift and avoid the museum altogether. Salzburg is a small city and a comprehensively",
          "I would not recommend if you dont have a salzburg card, but if you do there is plenty to see and do here. Especially the garden walks and cafe on the top of the museum which offers awesome views.",
          "We had had received rave reviews about the cafe and the views over the city and mixed assessments of the actual museum itself. The museum itself has a few interesting bits but if you really like modern art save yourself for one of the major cities. The terrace and the cafe",
          "The view was amazing. But you can ride the lift for less than 2 euros. Do that. The museum is very ordinary by world standards. No seats to sit and look or listen to exhibits. Pretty ordinary artwork. Small and disappointing.",
          "This museum offers a beautiful view over the city and a specific kind of art which is not for everybody. But I must say there is a very nice section with french theater posters dated around 1900.",
          "We took the elevator up to the museum so we could appreciate the views and enjoy a Stiegl at the restaurant. We sat out on the terrace where the views were brilliant and we even watched a thunderstorm before making our way under cover. A lovely spot for some refreshment, strudel",
          "Very disappointed in the museum and \"art\" on display. Mostly exhibits of avant garde, self-indulgent artists. We did like the travel poster exhibit, but that was about it. Museum restaurant has great views, but entrees are close to $30.",
          "Maybe it was more because of the exhibition itself or the fact we're art philistines but this was definitely one for the chin strokers.... We had entrance included in our Salzburg Card and had ventured up the lift from Gstattengasse mainly to take in the view of the old City of",
          "Even if you have the Salzburg card which allow free ride with the elevator and entrance, it is a waste of time. The view on the top is really amazing, but you can see them from other sites( fortress...) I did not find any art ( may be I do not understand art). The only thing",
          "Perhaps I'm an old soul when it comes to art, but the modern art exhibitions on display didn't do much for me. They failed to capture my interest, and I left feeling a bit frustrated. The building itself is beautiful, and the views are phenomenal. We stopped for coffee and cake",
          "This was included with the salzburg card we bought so we did not pay extra for it and also there was a temporary exhibition of posters of toulouse le trec and others of the time. That exhibition was interesting, the permanent stuff was very disappointing and we do normally enjoy",
          "Didn't actually see any exhibits. Took the elevator (fee) up from the old town. Great view of Salzburg.",
          "Only houses the most pathetic excuses for art. Went with friends, admittedly for a school project, but after seeing the pieces in this museum I was outraged.",
          "This is worth a visit just for the lift up from the main town, the super restaurant with probably the best views over Salzburg. I'm a bit of an art lover so I enjoyed the exhibitions but they are possibly an acquired taste. The one thing you do need to be aware of is that you",

          "Just ok. This is very much a curator's gallery and exhibition space. Lots of rather obscure artworks with little contextual information. The restaurant is a rip off. 3 euros for tap water and 3 euros each added to the service charge. Soup just ok but very expensive. Views great",
          "There didn't seem to be any permanent collection on display, only an exhibition of the woeful Carolee Schneeman. We also, astonishingly, paid \u20ac7 to use a lift.",
          "Excellent view, Ambienr, but service is so bad that slmost ruined the whole experience & impression. No WiFi also added to the dissapointment",
          "Wow . . . so bad it's funny. It is apparently supposed to be a museum depicting experimental or High-Concept art combined with exhibits of what was once considered \"Moderne\" - - - but almost everything on display has a modern theme, but circa 1965 or so. Seriously, go . . . .",
          "It has an eclectic mix of mediums. I was not entirely enthralled by the current exhibits. This is a purely subjective comment though, they might inspire other visitors. The facilities are excellent. If you are not a fan of modern art, perhaps leave this one out of your plans.",
          "This was the second exhibition I've seen here and unfortunately, the exhibitions still don't match up to the great building the museum has. A couple of photos and videos of performance art and past exhibitions from somewhere just aren't enough. They need a nice permanent",

          "Wow, I'm usually an art lover, but I must admit this is the first time I've left a museum and thought that it was a waste of time and money. The only saving grace for me was the exhibition on the planned but not executed buildings of Salzburg, the models were incredible;",
          "The way to the museum is quite an adventure. You take an elevator that is built deep inside the mountain, up to the top. This is a great start! Afterwards, you would see the astonishing location which offers a view of the old city with mountains in the background. Just WOW!",
          "I am going to be honest and confess that modern art is not my cup of tea, especially the performance kind. Museum der Moderne Monchsberg did not impress me but the exhibition of the buildings that was planned or proposed but never built in Salzburg was rather interesting.",
          "The Rupertinum building houses the great works of Expressionism but is not on the same site. Stung by the 3.50 euro lift fee (lift only, not museum entry), the museum has one of the best views of Salzburg but the curators have not chosen well. The work is supposed to be",
          "One of the better modern art museums I've been to, with dedicated space for a limited number of artists allowing you to better understand their body of work. Had a few great installations at the time I visited. The view of the city from outside the museum are a highlight",
          "The views down over the city are the best in Salzburg. Sadly this can not be said for the art in this museum as far as we were concerned. Get the lift to the top and visit the cafe (which was great) and save your money for something else in Salzburg!",
          "There are 4 exhibitions and if you take 1 minute to watch them it's one minute too long of your time. If you take the SalzburgCard it's free but in the end I was even considering to ask for my money back.",
          "I am not an overly art person but I usually find something I like in an exhibit, not here though. Mainly filled with \"Performance Art\" and it may be art to the person doing it but not to me watching the results or a video of it. I got in free and it was not worth the time used",
          "We stopped here because of the lovely view. We had already had lunch so decided to just have hot drinks. The restaurant was lovely and is in prime position but we left disappointed with the service and the price. Don't ask for tap water because they still charge you 3 euro. Also",
          "The museum is in a superb spot from which you get great views of Salzburg. The exhibitions we saw were challenging and not very rewarding. I love conceptual art but it has to be best quality which I didn't think this was. Also the caf\u00e9 is very strange for a modern art gallery.",
          "The exhibits were pretty unbecoming a city of such distinction. The TV monitors showing movement and cryptic drawing were useless.",
          "For a building in such a beautiful location, with such promise, the exhibitions that were there were a waste of our time. One was films on television about the California prison system, one was photos juxtaposed next to pages of magazine ads comparing them, just to give you an",

          "I kinda liked the building with the huge staircases, but the exhibitions weren't really that interesting for me. Maybe it would help to reserve one floor for a permanent exhibition, so you can serve people with different tastes. Also, the locker system isn't great. Why not do",
          "After being somewhat confused as to how to get in and out of the various areas, I was fortunate that one of the security guards felt sorry for me and let me back in! Outdoors - the walk around the grounds is a must do - the view is fantastic! I enjoyed the exhibition too, but I",

          "I tend to agree with John L, the last reviewer, on the relative interest of the art at this moment in January,2014, but we are reviewing the museum, not the current show. Of course the trip up in the elevator is cool, the view from the top stupendous (you could walk, by the",

          "We visited the Alex Katz exhibition. It was truly fantastic. The museum is situated at the top of a mountain, but the entrance is in the city, and you can go up with a lift. There's also a caf\u00e9 with an outdoors section and the museum shop is really good. I really liked the",

          "We visited the museum as my friend wanted to look at the Chuck Close exhibition which was good. Another exhibition Sammlung Verbund had some nice photography pieces. But my favourite part was the lovely view of the city from the 'sun terrace'. It was nice looking at the snow on",

        "wiki": "The Museum der Moderne Salzburg has two buildings at two different locations in Salzburg, Austria. The Rupertinum in the old town for new artistic concepts opened in 1983 and the Museum on the M\u00f6nchsberg for modern art in a contemporary setting opened in 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea for the foundation of a collection and museum of modern art goes back to an initiative of Salzburg art dealer Friedrich Welz, who donated a large part of his private collection to the state of Salzburg. Owing to his personal friendship with Oskar Kokoschka the museum also received a great number of works from the Austrian expressionist.\n\n\n=== Museum der Moderne Rupertinum ===\n \nIn 1983 the Rupertinum was opened as Salzburg Museum of Modern Art and Graphic Collection. The museum's founding director Otto Breicha also integrated the Austrian Photographic Gallery into the museum, which has become the most important collection of contemporary Austrian photography. The Rupertinum, situated in the centre of the old town, was mentioned for the first time in 1350. Under archbishop Paris Lodron, the town palace \"Collegium Rupertinum\" was used as seminary. Finished in 1633, the town palace was built in early baroque style. The house has a prominent location between Franziskaner Church and Kollegien Church and has been used as seminary by the Archdioceses of Salzburg for many centuries.\nUntil 1974 the Rupertinum was used as student dormitory. In 1983 the Rupertinum was opened as Salzburg Museum of Modern Art and Graphic Collection.\nOver the years the facilities of the Rupertinum have been adapted to comply with international standards; the most extensive refurbishment took place in 1999. Today the building offers ideal conditions for exhibitions of graphics and photographs. On Max-Reinhardt-Square the building opens into a courtyard typical for houses of Salzburg\u2019s old town.\n\n\n=== Museum der Moderne M\u00f6nchsberg ===\n\nPerched on top of the steep cliff of M\u00f6nchsberg mountain, sixty metres above Anton-Neumayr-Square, the Caf\u00e9 Winkler has dominated the city for decades. When the casino moved into the baroque palace Klessheim on the outskirts of Salzburg, the Caf\u00e9 Winkler stood empty for many years and this landmark building that served as a counterpoint to the medieval fortress lost its splendour.\nIn 1998, on the initiative of Landeshauptmann Franz Schausberger the state of Salzburg launched an international architectural competition for the construction of a new building for a museum on M\u00f6nchsberg. An 11-member jury chaired by Luigi Snozzi, selected the design of the Munich-based team of architects Friedrich Hoff Zwink from among 145 submissions. The museum was built in three and a half years and offers maximum possibilities for a variety of exhibition formats on four levels. The entire outer facade is clad with local Untersberg marble, separated by vertical joints.\nWhen the Museum der Moderne Salzburg on M\u00f6nchsberg was opened in October 2004, the former Rupertinum Collection of the province of Salzburg was integrated into the new concept of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg. Since September 2013 Dr. Sabine Breitwieser is the new director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg. She followed Toni Stooss who was more than 7 years director of the Museum. \nThe two buildings of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg offer 3,000 m2 of exhibition space for thematic and monographic exhibitions of 20th- and 21st-century art, as well as presentations of graphics and photography.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe exhibitions and activities in both museum buildings show modern and contemporary visual arts. Apart from the presentation of international works of art, the Museum der Moderne Salzburg also serves as platform for contemporary representatives of the Austrian art scene.\nBesides paintings and sculptures the museum owns an extensive collection of graphics. A further focus of the collection is Austrian photography after 1945.\nFurther, the museum manages the photographic collection of the Republic of Austria \u00d6sterreichische Fotogalerie as well as the photographic collection Fotografis of the Bank Austria as a permanent loan.\n\n\n== Directors ==\nFriedrich Welz\nOtto Breicha\nPeter Weiermair\nAgnes Husslein\nToni Stooss\nSabine Breitwieser\nThorsten Sadowsky, incumbent\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIn addition to their contribution to the air-conditioning system of the building, the joints of the facade can also be interpreted as a reference to the city of Salzburg: the chords of certain arias from Mozart\u2019s opera \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d were inscribed on the facade in rhythmically positioned slots using a special computer programme. \n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n\u201eMuseumscheck\u201c on 3sat.de, Videos und TV-series about the Museum der Moderne (German)",

          "I enjoyed this museum overall but I found it a bit cramped. There was a lot in each exhibit placed very close together, it was a bit overwhelming. There seems to be more art than the museum can really fit. That said, there were some very interesting piece that I'm glad I saw.",

          "This is a very smart, modern museum (Think Tate Modern) and well worth the trip for the building, galleries, restaurant and bar plus the magnificent views of Salzburg. We got the lift up and walked down into the city. Highly recommended - a really great afternoon.",

          "This was a huge disappointment. If you have the Salzburg Card, worth tagging on to your itinerary for the views alone, but other than that it's a let down and you could use the Monchsberg Lift and avoid the museum altogether. Salzburg is a small city and a comprehensively",

          "Perhaps I'm an old soul when it comes to art, but the modern art exhibitions on display didn't do much for me. They failed to capture my interest, and I left feeling a bit frustrated. The building itself is beautiful, and the views are phenomenal. We stopped for coffee and cake",
          "This was included with the salzburg card we bought so we did not pay extra for it and also there was a temporary exhibition of posters of toulouse le trec and others of the time. That exhibition was interesting, the permanent stuff was very disappointing and we do normally enjoy",

          "This is worth a visit just for the lift up from the main town, the super restaurant with probably the best views over Salzburg. I'm a bit of an art lover so I enjoyed the exhibitions but they are possibly an acquired taste. The one thing you do need to be aware of is that you",

          "Just ok. This is very much a curator's gallery and exhibition space. Lots of rather obscure artworks with little contextual information. The restaurant is a rip off. 3 euros for tap water and 3 euros each added to the service charge. Soup just ok but very expensive. Views great",
          "There didn't seem to be any permanent collection on display, only an exhibition of the woeful Carolee Schneeman. We also, astonishingly, paid \u20ac7 to use a lift.",
          "Excellent view, Ambienr, but service is so bad that slmost ruined the whole experience & impression. No WiFi also added to the dissapointment",
          "Wow . . . so bad it's funny. It is apparently supposed to be a museum depicting experimental or High-Concept art combined with exhibits of what was once considered \"Moderne\" - - - but almost everything on display has a modern theme, but circa 1965 or so. Seriously, go . . . .",
          "It has an eclectic mix of mediums. I was not entirely enthralled by the current exhibits. This is a purely subjective comment though, they might inspire other visitors. The facilities are excellent. If you are not a fan of modern art, perhaps leave this one out of your plans.",
          "This was the second exhibition I've seen here and unfortunately, the exhibitions still don't match up to the great building the museum has. A couple of photos and videos of performance art and past exhibitions from somewhere just aren't enough. They need a nice permanent",

          "Wow, I'm usually an art lover, but I must admit this is the first time I've left a museum and thought that it was a waste of time and money. The only saving grace for me was the exhibition on the planned but not executed buildings of Salzburg, the models were incredible;",
          "The way to the museum is quite an adventure. You take an elevator that is built deep inside the mountain, up to the top. This is a great start! Afterwards, you would see the astonishing location which offers a view of the old city with mountains in the background. Just WOW!",

          "The views down over the city are the best in Salzburg. Sadly this can not be said for the art in this museum as far as we were concerned. Get the lift to the top and visit the cafe (which was great) and save your money for something else in Salzburg!",

          "I am not an overly art person but I usually find something I like in an exhibit, not here though. Mainly filled with \"Performance Art\" and it may be art to the person doing it but not to me watching the results or a video of it. I got in free and it was not worth the time used",
          "We stopped here because of the lovely view. We had already had lunch so decided to just have hot drinks. The restaurant was lovely and is in prime position but we left disappointed with the service and the price. Don't ask for tap water because they still charge you 3 euro. Also",
          "The museum is in a superb spot from which you get great views of Salzburg. The exhibitions we saw were challenging and not very rewarding. I love conceptual art but it has to be best quality which I didn't think this was. Also the caf\u00e9 is very strange for a modern art gallery.",
          "Very disappointing: two floors of bland exhibits and ripoff restaurant. Terrace in great position overlooking old town but \u20ac3.50 for two miniature croissants, and the coffee was cold! Avoid unless you're a really serious art nerd. Free with Salzburgcard thank - god we didn't",
          "It's not often that I go to art museum and leave so disappointed as I did at Museum der Moderne Monchsberg. Located on a steep cliff of Monchsberg mountain, the museum can be reached by an elevator built into the mountain. The exhibitions on display at the time I was there, had",

          "I kinda liked the building with the huge staircases, but the exhibitions weren't really that interesting for me. Maybe it would help to reserve one floor for a permanent exhibition, so you can serve people with different tastes. Also, the locker system isn't great. Why not do",
          "After being somewhat confused as to how to get in and out of the various areas, I was fortunate that one of the security guards felt sorry for me and let me back in! Outdoors - the walk around the grounds is a must do - the view is fantastic! I enjoyed the exhibition too, but I",
          "We tried to go to the Salzburg Fortress but just wanted the view and didn't have time to see the exhibits, so we decided to go to the Monchsberg Lift, which is inside the Monchsberg Museum of Modern Art. It was only 3 euros a person to go up and down and was totally worth it.",

          "The museum itself is disappointing. The exhibition was bland and boring. The view outside is quite nice though, too bad it was raining and very cold so we could not enjoy it as much.",
          "We visited the museum as my friend wanted to look at the Chuck Close exhibition which was good. Another exhibition Sammlung Verbund had some nice photography pieces. But my favourite part was the lovely view of the city from the 'sun terrace'. It was nice looking at the snow on",
          "I liked this and it had some great attractions, but it is off the beaten path a little and took a while to find. I think it is worth it, but I might eat at the top of the museum and spend an hour here.",
          "Chuck Close and Sammlung Verbund exhibition on when we visited, some ok pieces, nothing to blow us away. The restaurant there looks very nice - great views, and an outside terrace for the warmer months.",
          "I have actually never been inside and seen the museum, but I highly recommend taking the lift to the top and taking in the glorious mountain view of Salzburg. The lift is fairly cheap. However, there are alternate ways via hiking paths/trails to get up to the top if you are an",

          "The location is spectacular, worth taking the elevator ride from Salzburg City Center. But English speakers, even those interested in modern art, are likely to be disappointed since everything is in German. We happened to be there during a big Merce Cunningham/John Cage exhibit,",
          "After a concert, my wife and I took the elevator up to the museum which is included in the Salzburg Card. It had just closed, but we stayed for the beautiful city views of Salzburg (as its historical buildings and bridges are floodlit) from the museum's outdoor terrace",

          "Having a few hours to whiz round Salzburg before taking the train to Munich we ended up giving the museum a miss but taking the elevator (\u20ac2 each well spent!) to a spectacular view instead. Restaurant looked interesting and it certainly was. We can highly recommend the",

          "This museum is located very close to the Hotel Schloss Monchstein and allows guets to use its elevator to get up and down from the mtn. top. We ate here yesterday and found the food/wine to be very good. The views however are breathtaking. This is a great place for lunch",
          "Another traveler that did not visit the museum. Again, beautiful night time view from the cafe. We did not eat at the cafe, just had drinks. Very nice place to relax and absorb the beauty of Salzburg. Even when the museum is closed you can ride the elevator up to the cafe.",
          "I don't know about the museum, because I didn't have the time to visit it, but the view from that hill of Salzburg called Monchsberg, was unforgetable. Take the lift to the top (price included in Salzburg Card) and admire the view. There is also a Cafe up there to spend some",
          "Forget the museum go for the walk !! Having got the lift to the top we had a quick run round the museum although not really our thing. Having said that it's possible to pick up a number of paths to numerous viewpoint including stunning views of Salzburg Fortress. Along the way",

          "I am a modern art lover. With that said, a BIG disappointment. The view for the hill this is on is worth the elevator ride up (5 euro for ride and museum ticket). You can look over all of Salzburg and see the Fortress on a parallel hill. As far as Modern Art museums go, highly"

        "wiki": "Berchtesgaden (German pronunciation: [\u02c8b\u025b\u0281\u00e7t\u0259s\u02cc\u0261a\u02d0dn\u0329]) is a municipality in the district Berchtesgadener Land (Bavaria) in southeastern Germany, near the border with Austria, 30 km (19 mi) south of Salzburg and 180 km (110 mi) southeast of Munich. It lies in the Berchtesgaden Alps, south of Berchtesgaden the Berchtesgaden National Park stretches along three parallel valleys.\nA notable peak is the Kehlstein mountain (1,835 m (6,020 ft)), with its Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nBerchtesgaden, Upper Bavaria (Achental), earlier Perchterscadmen, Perhtersgadem, Berchirchsgadem, Berchtoldesgadem; the word underwent a Latin distortion of Old High German parach, Romance bareca 'hay shed'. After the basic meaning was forgotten, they added a variant word of Old High German gadem \u2018room, one-room hut\u2019, implying the same meaning: \u2018hay shed\u2019. Cf. Old High German muosgadem \u2018spice room\u2019. \nThere was a folk etymology that supported a derivation based on the legendary figure of Frau Perchta (Berchta), a woman (Holle < Holda \u2018well disposed, dear\u2019) with good and bad changing features, who was venerated on Perchtertag (= Three Kings Day) and at Shrovetide was sworn to during the Perchta procession.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first ever historical note dates back to 1102 and mentions the area because of its rich salt deposits. Much of Berchtesgaden's wealth has been derived from its salt mines, the first of which started operations in 1517. The town served as independent F\u00fcrstpropstei until the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss in 1803. During the Napoleonic wars, Berchtesgaden changed hands a few times, such as in 1805 under the Treaty of Pressburg, when the area was ceded to Austria.\nBerchtesgaden came under Bavarian rule in 1810 and became instantly popular with the Bavarian royal family, the House of Wittelsbach, who often visited K\u00f6nigssee and maintained a royal hunting residence in the former Augustine monastery (still used today by Franz, Duke of Bavaria). Nascent tourism started to evolve and a number of artists came to the area, which reportedly gave rise to Malereck (\"painters' corner\") on the shore of K\u00f6nigssee in nearby Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden. The most famous author who lived in Berchtesgaden was Ludwig Ganghofer.\n\n\n=== Nazi era ===\n\nAdolf Hitler had been vacationing in the Berchtesgaden area since the 1920s. He purchased a home in the Obersalzberg above the town on the flank of the Hoher Goll and began extensive renovations on his Berghof in the following years.  As other top Third Reich figures, such as Hermann G\u00f6ring, Joseph Goebbels, Martin Bormann, Heinrich Himmler, and Albert Speer, began to frequent the area the Party began to purchase and requisition land in the Obersalzberg.In order to serve as an outpost of the German Reichskanzlei (Imperial Chancellery), Berchtesgaden and its environs (Stanggass) saw substantial expansion of offices, security, and support services, mainly on the Obersalzberg.  Included in the town were a new railway station, with a reception area for Hitler and his guests, and an adjacent post office. The Berchtesgadener Hof Hotel, where famous visitors such as Neville Chamberlain and David Lloyd George stayed, was substantially upgraded.\nEven though a feared \"national redoubt\" last stand of the Nazi Regime in the Alps failed to materialize late in World War II, the Allies launched a devastating air raid on the Berchtesgaden area in the spring of 1945.  Concentrated on the Obersalzberg, the April 25 bombing did little damage to the town.  On May 4, forward elements of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division arrived and received the town's surrender.\n\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\nAfter the war, Berchesgaden became a military zone and most of its buildings were requisitioned by the U.S. Army. Hotel Platterhof was rebuilt and renamed the General Walker Hotel in 1952. It served as an integral part of the U.S. Armed Forces Recreation Centers for the duration of the Cold War and beyond. The remnants of homes of former Nazi leaders were all demolished in the early postwar years, though traces of some remained. In 1995, fifty years after the end of World War II and five years after German reunification, the AFRC Berchtesgaden was turned over to Bavarian authorities to facilitate military spending reductions mandated within the Base Realignment and Closure program by the US Congress and Pentagon during the administration of President Bill Clinton. The General Walker Hotel was demolished in 2000\u20132001.\nIn 1986, Berchtesgaden was a first round candidate city to host the XVI Olympic Winter Games to be held in 1992. The vote eventually went to Albertville, France, in October of that year.\n\n\n=== Berchtesgaden today ===\n\nThe Hotel T\u00fcrken, which was near the Nazi buildings and was often used by the SS and then by the Generalmajor of the Police, was badly damaged in 1945. It was rebuilt in 1950 and reopened as a hotel before Christmas. Visitors can still  explore the historic underground hallways and tunnels that had been used by the Nazis.In 1972, local government reform united the then independent municipalities of Salzberg, Maria Gern and Au (consisting of Oberau and Unterau) under the administration of the town of Berchtesgaden. Another suggested reform uniting all remaining five municipalities in the Berchtesgaden valley (Bischofswiesen, Ramsau, Marktschellenberg and Sch\u00f6nau) failed to gain enough popular support; it passed in Berchtesgaden but failed everywhere else.\nThe Berchtesgaden National Park was established in 1978 and has gradually become one of Berchtesgaden's largest draws. Mass tourism is confined to a few popular spots, leaving the rest to nature-seekers. Other tourist draws are the K\u00f6nigssee, the salt mine, the Kehlsteinhaus, open seasonally as a restaurant and the Dokumentationszentrum Obersalzberg museum about the area's history, operated by the Munich Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte since 1999.Recreational and competitive sports have grown in importance. The town's ski slope is popular. The K\u00f6nigssee bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track has hosted ski-running and a number of international events and competitions. Berchtesgaden's most famous sports personality is Georg Hackl, a multiple Olympic medal winner.

          "Unbelievable views. Very well maintained. A must to add to any bucket lists. Very informative plaques.",
          "Experiencing the view and placement coupled with the history of the house made for an exciting visit. If you're in the Alps anyways, it'd be a shame not to visit the Eagles Nest.",
          "Such a beautiful place, high in the mountains with breathtaking views of the valley/. Neighboring Austria/ K\u00f6nigssee. Great for epic pictures! So neat to see the history of the place and get up close.",
          "You can understand why Hitler wanted to stay here... amazing views and far away from everything else. A historical important place you can\u00b4t miss out on if you\u00b4re visiting this area. A must visit.",
          "Whatever you think about Hitler, don't miss this attraction. The elevator ride to the top is like standing in history and is fixed in time. The view is out of this world.",
          "From Salzburg, this was a somewhat lengthy journey using public transit -- you need to take a bus to Berchtesgaden, a second bus to the ticket office, and a third bus to get up to the brass elevator entryway. Despite the bus-hopping, though, the resulting views from the Eagle's",
          "In internet you get a day in spring that Eagle's nest will open but that is just an estimation. This was supposed to be the high point of the trip but it turned out that the peak is still closed because of snow. And you can't know it until you arrive. It would be very nice if",

          "Built to impress, this tea house retreat was little used by Hitler himself - it is impressive in its location, but meant only for meetings. The bunker system was impressive in its size and structure, but a reminder of evil.",
          "This was my third visit to Berchtesgaden and the Eagle\u2019s Nest, and this time I was with my 40 year old son. I was happy I could show it to him because it is living history. I am thankful the Germans made it a restaurant in 1952 and did not destroy it. Very little has changed in",
          "Day trip from Munich, took the long way on the 305. First thing; make sure you have Euros. We had basically run out, and with travel planned the next day, didn't think we'd need more. This resulted in a long trip back down the mountain to town for a bank as the parking lot",
          "Had a wonderful time visiting here spectacular views and hiking trails if that's something you want to do however much of the history here has been overlooked (somewhat deliberately) or destroyed. I believed this would be a much more historical trip than it was and disappointing",

          "My wife and I did this drive and left on the first run of the day. You can only get up to the site on a tour or on the tourist buses at the base near the Documentation centre. When arriving at the top, you need to identify which return time you want. I suggest give yourself 90",

          "I was lucky enough to be here in a clear day. You can see for miles. The Eagle's Nest itself is fairly sparse, but still so much history. The tour guide was very professional and had a lot of fun facts to offer. I would say this is a must see/do if you are in the area.",
          "This is a tough place to visit for a few reasons. If you don\u2019t have good clear weather there won\u2019t be much of a view like what we experienced. The tunnel and elevator were the most exciting to see but without a clear view, it wasn\u2019t worth the trip.",

          "I have been here twice now and I still love it. It is much busier than it was 12 years ago and unfortunately a little more commercialized. We went up there for the history and the views which are incredible. Some important advice - Get on the first or second bus of the day.",

          "This historical location should have been maintained as just that instead it has been turned into a restaurant. Expected to be able to see a close representation of what the site / building was during Hitler\u2019s reign, but instead was treated to a crowded restaurant and only see",

          "Brilliant experience to go and see the historic building and to get an insight to the lavish lifestyle the nazis had",
          "The history and the story is so fearful to hear and understand. The construction ingenious and the views are breathtaking. A wonderful worthwhile trip.",
          "We are glad we visited this important reminder of the war. Its a shame the whole thing has been turned into a restaurant rather than a museum. Which left going up in the elevator the most interesting part. You probably only need 30 minutes to see it all. Worth seeing but a bit",
          "Absolutely fantastic both in terms and history, culture and the views. The ride up the mountain was exhilarating and when you reach the top the views are to die for. Our guide was very knowledgeable and explained the history clearly, you could just imagine Hitler here. If you",
          "So much history to be found here. It was an amazing ride up the mountain looking at the views below! It was a bit of a foggy day when we were there and couldn't see as far as we would have liked. But the property and the history inside, the tunnels and the brass elevator were",
          "We walked up and down. It took us 2 hours to get up and was a strenuous but rewarding walk and it made the beer at the top very welcome. We reckoned that 1% of people walked up there! There aren\u2019t amazing views as you go up but it\u2019s a nice walk and the gradient is a challenge.",
          "We book this through Civitatis. To clarify. The place indicated for the tour was wrong. The tour takes 4.5 from salzburg it\u2019s has beautiful views but once you get there after taking another bus for 20 mi to get up there you will find your self making a line to the elevator. And",
          "Guided tours are available, but you can certainly do it on your own which is what I recommend. There are a couple of parking lots where you can park your vehicle and catch the bus that will take you up to the Eagle's Nest. That is the only way up there, unless you hike it. You",
          "Weather was horrible, the tour operator, historic eagles nest tours, needs to tell participants to bring rain gear and shoes,as well as sweaters for down in the bunkers!ruined a good pair of shoes because we had to walk so far from the bus into venue and back!",
          "Visited this as an addon to the Beyond Band of Brothers Tour we were on. Very glad I went up there to see the views if nothing else. Just stunning!",
          "Worth a visit, the views from the top are stunning and the surrounding area is very nice too. Nice peice of history if you like that sort of thing.",
          "The views are great. History is pretty much gone except for the view. It was a good outing. Personally, I think another day in Salzburg would have been better.",
          "All though our visit was in the high season, the crowd wasn't too bad. We took the bus up and down the mountain. Less than a 30 minute wait from the tickets were bought until the busses departured. The history surrounding the Eagle's Nest is mind blowing, the views from the top",
          "The views are really great in a clear day. Also, there is a small exposition with history pictures and explanation of the place while the Nazis were there and after that, when the americans where there. I found it very interesting!",
          "We took a train journey from Munich because the bus tours were only operating on Mondays and Fridays and we were going on a Wednesday. The journey from Salzburg by bus was one hour fifty minutes to Berchesgaden , then a 10 minute ride on a bus to Obersalzburg where I needed to",
          "Worth the expense and we went on a lively day to sit and admire the views with cake and beer. We kept the two year old in his buggy though, as there are sheer drops off some paths",
          "There really isn't a lot to the Eagle's Nest but they do have a display with photos and writing in English and German to give historical context. Still it's worth the trip. The views are amazing. It would be worth going for the sights alone. It is a bit eerie riding in the same",

          "Took a tour from Munich. About a 2 1/2 hour ride each way. Tour guide said we had the clearest day for viewing all summer. Bus drives down country roads to the Autobahn to get there. Coming back we drove through the scenic Alpine woods and mountains. Fantastic sites! You have to",
          "You have to get to the Eagles Nest via buses - the organisation and ease of catching the buses and returning was second to none. There is a lift that takes you up to the building (you can walk), the brass lift is roomy and quick (had a traveller who doesnt normally take the",
          "Wow! What a place loved it only problem is bit of a nightmare getting up there but once up BRILLIANT! Coach dropped 6 of us off long walk to ticket office when we eventually found it. Then a packed bus 4euros 50cents takes you so far .Then a free bus takes you to nearly the top",
          "Worth your time even if you aren\u2019t a history buff. The views are beyond spectacular (we had a wonderfully clear day). Definitely take a tour to bypass any lines. You catch a shuttle bus at about 5000 feet up to the tunnel and then the bronze elevator (holds45 people and is",
          "Our tour from Salzburg had two highlights. First the sceneries from the Kehlsteinhaus or The Eagle\u00b4s Nest as it is normally called, and second, our guide Walter. He offered the basic knowledge about the building but also told us numerous jokes during the day and he was also",
          "Walter was an outstanding tour guide. The eagles nest was a place on my bucket list. Amazing tour included visiting the small town which had a few restaurants including one with great cheeseburgers and fries",
          "As with most war related things in Germany this is heavily underplayed. There has been some recent additions of info boards and pictures related to Hitlers time here but it is in no way a museum or shrine. It is a restaurant at the top of a mountain with historical",
          "We went by car. It is a steep drive up from Berchtesgaden to the carparks and ticket office. Higher of the two main carparks is better for Eagles Nest and the lower is better for the Uber Salzburg (bunker museum). Small parking charges apply. Tickets for the bus up to the Nest",
          "The journey to get to the top is amazing in itself. The ticket purchasing is a bit of a pain. We stood in line for 10 minutes for the man to shut down our line go to lunch and tell us to join the line round the corner!! As you can imagine, some of the people in said line were",
          "Eagle's nest is purely a tourist managed place which happens to be on in an historical location. It is amazing how this was constructed on top of the mountain. Most important is to be in a spot where with history meaningful, but don\u2019t expect to see anything historical most",
          "Built by Martin Borman for the Fuhrer and demolished by the Americans. The guest house still rmeins and is now a cafe.",

          "Getting 2 stars for lovely views. If you can find a lovely view nearby - shouldn\u2019t be too hard - than do that instead. Completely overwhelmed by tourists and queues and there is nothing to see of Hitler\u2019s nest now at all. Little option but to sit and spend even more cash in the",
          "Take into account 3 hours to visit this historical place. These 3 hours are mostly spent waiting in line to move further. There is an exhibition which is really good on the rise and fall of the nazi empire near the visitor's centre (pay separately but worth it). Then buy you bus",
          "If you like the nature and want to have a coffee or lunch in the historical place top of the mountains you need to visit there.",
          "Eagle's Nest is a historical place and very interesting to visit due to that fact! But, for me, nature is what is the best there! The view form above, the paths you can walk through. Mesmerizing! The restaurant there is everything you can see and eat lunch or have a drink, but",
          "Staying for two nights in Berchtesgaden, Germany we took the bus to Eagles Nest. The sights were incredible and the ride amazing. Eagles Nest was built by the Nazi\u2019s in 1938 as a special retreat for their highest ranking officials, including Hitler. He, along with Bormann,",
          "Whilst holidaying nearby in Austria, we took a trip to see Hitlers' Eagles Nest to explore some world history. To be honest not too much history was evident, access to the complex is limited with general admission but the area and views are fantastic. The Eagles nest or",
          "On our holiday to Austria with leger today we visited Eagles Nest at an elevation of 1834 mtrs it's not a good choice if you suffer from vertigo. You can only access by using the specially adapted buses that run up and down the steep winding Kehlstein Road making your way",
          "Not sure what to expect when I added Eagle's Nest to my visit in Germany. here are few tips: 1) get there early - only 2 windows to purchase tickets, we arrived around 10am and the line was about 30 mins long 2) wait for your bus - the ticket you purchased came with your bus",
          "We didn\u2019t have a sunny day, but we still had a great time surrounded by clouds, fog and a little bit of rain. The view makes you forget about the atreocities decided there. We also ate something, a bit pricey but tasty. The waiter was quite rude because we checked the bill",
          "These really are the most spectacular views I have ever seen. We went to Austria on a National Holiday tour and this was an optional visit and we were So glad we opted to do it. Try and get there early to avoid the queues for the lift if you can. Once at the top little remains",

          "Really well organized and a fab day out. We arrived at 930. Parked car, queues for tickets and were on the 10.10 bus. There are 15 buses, 5 at a time leave so the queues are constantly moving. At the top you must book your return time for the bus. I would recommend to allow 2",
          "The whole process to visit the Eagle's Nest is very well organised indeed, with the bus system being very efficient and easy for everyone. Do allow two hours at the summit when you book the return trip; even without stopping for a drink or snack we easily used one and a half",

          "We hiked up from Dokumentation Obersalzburg which itself was well worth a visit. You can buy tickets at the bottom of the lift for the lift itself and the return bus-trip, both well worth it. If you are going to hike up, I recommend doing it on a separate day from visiting the",

          "This is a unique attraction taking history and making it a tourist destination. Up so high in the clouds, the 'nest' itself is much smaller than imagined and there is not a huge amount of reference to the history. Certainly worth visiting if a historical fan or lover of views.",

          "This site is probably better known historically as one of Hitler's residence. The 4 of us booked a private tour with a local guide. Our driver/guide, Guenther, was very knowledgeable about the surrounding countryside and history of this location. He was a very no nonsense",

          "We visited this place at the end of the September month. It is worth of a visit for it's unique location, history and beautiful panoramic views from the top of Bavarian Alps . According to our experience and research the best way is to go with a tour company which will save",

          "I had my reservations about visiting given the sites history but it turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. The history is treated with subtle respect. The view is stunning. GET HERE EARLY. Parking is at a premium and the lines for the busses and the elevators grow",
          "Well worth a visit for the spectacular views and a good lunch in a special historic building. The restaurant has fast service and good food at reasonable prices. It\u2019s worth having lunch to extend your visit, even with lunch our visit was under 2 hours. Book a return bus journey",
          "As for scenery no one beats Berchatesgaden and its attractions. The challenge to arrive to eagle nest is a tough one indeed for any bus driver. Thank god that the number of visitors is evenly distributed by operators or else this place would a mess. It was nice drinking a beer",
          "To get here you have to go up the mountain on a the special tour bus, or walk / cycle. When you see the bends you see the skill of the drivers! When you get to the top you have to go into the long tunnel then go up to the nest in the original lift that Hitler had fitted. It is",

          "This is an important historical destination.The bus ride up the mountain provides a thrill. Try to put yourself in the shoes of those experiencing World War II and this place will chill you to the bone. Be sure to hike the trails on the mountaintop for some of Europe's most",
          "I visited with a group tour that came by bus from Munich. Unfortunately (and this is certainly no reflection on the attraction itself!) the day was completely socked in and pouring down rain, which is a risk you take when you book weeks in advance to make sure you get to go at",
          "We took the historical tour. It was very informative and left from the visitor's center which made it very easy to do. The historical tour includes commentary on the surrounding area and sights to see on the way up to the Eagle's Nest. Without this tour, we would have had access",
          "Plenty of history surrounding this site. The ride to the top is interesting and beautiful. It amazes me that such a beautiful place can also be a reminder of such sad past experiences for many people. It is definitely a place to see while in town.",

          "A terrific site to visit....as a destination, though the routine of ascending the Eagles Nest is a process, and take a bit of patience due to the tour buses. It is worth the wait and the organization of the trip up and down to the top is impressive. The facilities at the Tea",
          "The site is easy to get to and they take visitors up on a train that travels on the road that took 12 months to complete. It was a cloudy and misty day so was not able to have a view of the valley below once we were up there. Interesting story of how Hitler had it built and",
          "The Eagle's Nest affords spectacular views of the German Alps. It is also of historical interest as a site where Hitler and his despicable consorts plotted their evil deeds. With this in mind, the gift shop should NOT be selling items of pop culture such as tee shirts and games",

          "The Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden is an amazing site. The road up to the car park is spectacular and though it is a bit creepy using the same elevator as the Nazi elite the tea house at the top is well worth visiting. We ate lunch at the tea house which was surprisingly well",
          "A place not to be missed if you are in the area as it brings history to life whilst giving fantastic views of Australia and Bavaria. One piece of advice I would give though is to book bus tickets to the top in advance as it can get very busy.",

          "I would recommend going as early as possible and on a guided bus trip like I did using Panorama Tours. I would not try to drive or walk up there. The road was very narrow ans steep and had many switch-backs. I was amazed that our bus driver could navigate that road up to about",
          "Booked transport from Paranoma Tours & left salzburg city by 9 am. The weather was clear and ride to top basement of eagle nest was very interesting. There is very little to see inside the main hall, which was primarily made to have meeting of Hitler with other top profile",

          "It is only worthwhile to visit this place on a clear, sunny day. Otherwise, you will not enjoy the ride to the top as well as the surrounding views of the structure which has been converted into a restaurant. Wanted to see the Bavarian alps but the weather did not cooperate.",
          "I expected some historical info, etc. What I did was spend 3 to park and 16 for the bus ride. Lines not too long at 14:00. At the top is a nice view. And restaurant. I assume if you are in this area you will go or have been to some high mountain peeks so skip paying for",

          "Fascinating tour of the Eagle's Nest. Absolutely stunning views. Buildings are small, but facilities are good and it is well worth it for the views alone. Our guide was very knowledgeable, and managed the day very well. Travel was very comfortable, but expect long journey",
          "Myself and a friend travelled here by car this summer and it was everything great we expected it to be. If you're coming simply for the views in our opinion they are fantastic, the only drawback with the experience are the hoardes of crowds. However in the height of summer it",

          "Loved this stop, the ride on the bus was worth half the trip, great history, great views, a must see if in the area!",
          "Although there is a shuttle bus and then an elevator to take people to the top, I wanted to hike it. It was a bit of a struggle to find a place to park/start but I finally decided to park in one of the Kempinski Hotel lots. Trail started off flat and paved, but soon started",
          "Second visit to Eagles nest - 5 tips, 1. Stay in Berchtesgaden the day before and go early (9 -10am - parking is limited and queues get very long for the elevator up to the tea house). 2. Parking, you need EXACTLY \u20ac3 for the ticket machine - no change given or available!",
          "Very interesting place to see, great views with some dark history of Obersaltzberg area. The visit is very organized, buses run at 20 minute intervals due to the narrow road, be ready for some hordes of people during Summer holiday. Leave about 3 hours for the entire experience,",
          "Take an early bus up to the Dokumentation museum to avoid the crowds. Buy your tickets to the Eagles Nest which you get to by bus and lift. Don\u2019t forget to book your return bus time. Allow 1.5 to 2 hours if you don\u2019t eat! When it\u2019s busy allow good time for getting down the lift.",
          "Close to Salzburg , so easily visited from there and even closer to Untersberg so easy to combine both. Drive up to the parking is steep, some people driving badly, ie slow to stopped, not easy to follow on a steep , narrow winding road. Ignore first 2 car parks and try for the",
          "We were on a tour with a large group from the US and this was amazing; the views were spectacular --it rained on our way up, but then cleared; the tunnels and elevator were so interesting; the engineering it took to build this place and the roads up are is not to be",
          "I recommend not going with a tour. I heard the tour is overpriced and if you go with the tour, you have no time to hike the many trails and eat at the restaurant. You will be rushed. Wear good hiking shoes. The paths are heavily used so some stones are polished and slippery.",
          "We hiked the 2 hours up to the Eagles Nest expecting to learn about the history of the building, the people who used it, and the affect it had on the Second World War. Instead we found it to be a memorial to a tyrant. The small amount of information available says nothing",
          "It\u2019 s a wonderful place to visit the views are really amazing!! We were with our kids 12, 10 and 9 year old everybody enjoyed a lot.",
          "So I am going to reiterate some advise we got out of other reviews in case you don\u2019t read further down. 1) Arrive early, before 9.30, using a car is best (parking is \u20ac3, take coins)park in the car park signed as eagles nest (not the hotel car park which is first and on a tight",
          "To get to the top by car: You cannot drive up to the Eagle's nest via car - only to where the buses are. Drive to Documentation Obersalzburg and park your car. You will need exactly 3 euros. Walk up to where it says \"Tickets\" If you pay by credit card, make sure you know the",
          "When you think about the history here, it is very sad for the wicked plans that were put in place here. When you look at the location you completely understand why it was built here, for a mega-maniac intent on ruling the world, this is the perfect vantage point. The view is",
          "It was a cloudy day but I would say the view from Eagle\u2019s Nest was still stunning. We could see the King\u2019s Lake up there. Weather changed quite fast. We had food in the restaurant when there was a sudden rain. We ordered spaghetti with bolognese sauce and potato sausage soup.",
          "Although it is neat to say that I visited Eagle's Nest, I did not see much of anything. It was very foggy the day we went to the top, but it was our only day to try to experience the beauty. There is not a lot to see inside the home itself, but I imagine on a pretty day you",
          "Even if there is not much to see in Hitlers old residens, its still worth the effort. Really stunning views. Expect Big crowd and queeing up. You Can walk up there, but dont bother unless you have a full Day, morning to Night. 45 minutes waiting for the bus to the mountain and",
          "Always been on my bucket list, and i think it should be on everyone's. Beautiful surroundings at the top of the Kehlstein mountain. Interesting to find out how and why it was built, taking a drive past all the ex-nazis old houses...Albert Speer's house is still there! We paid",
          "A bucket list destination due to the history of the place. Allow at least and hour to get to the top from getting on the buses at the bottom. These take 20 minutes to reach the lift where you can wait in the queue to use the lift in the coolness of the 3% incline marvel stone",
          "After reading some of the reviews, the majority are positive. I couldn\u2019t agree more. Some of the key items to keep in mind are: 1. Weather is a key factor. Today, the weather was fabulous. Some clouds but nothing that effected the 360 degree panoramic views. 2. We booked",
          "On our way from Vienna to Munich, we stopped by Eagle's Nest. On a sunny day, parking can be a zoo, you will find more parking spots after the traffic circle. You will need to purchase a parking ticket which is good for the entire day (4-6 euros), accepts coins only. Once",
          "Entering here is emotionally turbulent knowing that the Nazi Army and Hitler were the one's to enjoy this places beauty and peacefulness. The elevator trip is not for those with claustrophobia. At the top the restaurant and lounge is terrible - bad food, Horrible and ignorant",
          "We used Viator to book a coach tour to The Eagle\u2019s Nest in southern Germany in the form of a day trip from Munich. With regards value their charges were similar to other companies that I had viewed offering the same package so, for no particular reason I chose them.",
          "Amazing view! And of course, a lift inside of the mountain (!!!) that bends you to the top - leaves every breath without (breath)... :-)",
          "Visited at the start of June as part of an organised trip, glad this was organised for us as those who had not booked had a 2 hour wait for a trip up to the entrance to the nest in a coach. The fee is for the coach trip up and down. Views from the top were amazing on a lovely",
          "At the bottom of the hill, is the museum and bus ticket station- two different attractions. Once we bought bus tickets, we waited about 20 minutes for the buses. Very much on time from the times on the ticket. Be prepared to wait for the elevator at the top of the hill. The top",
          "It's a quite nice house and when thinking of the history in the area makes it a bit better. But when that's said, then there's not much else; now it's just a tour around a big and expensive restaurant. But it is still worth a visit, especially because of the view.",
          "So an amazing place to visit, incredibly popular therefore busy. Some considerations. We visited on a Sunday so especially busy. We arrived just after midday so busiest time for lunch. Our German waiter did tslk to us in English, not his first language so maybe his abruptness",
          "We visited this just as the clouds rolled in so had no views but ti is still worth the visit. It is a piece of world history. If you are not wanting to eat in the restaurant then you only need an hour if the weather is not great. We didn't do any walks at the top as the",
          "We arrived early, paid for parking, bought our tickets and were on the first bus up the mountain. The ride up in the specially built buses on switchback roads was fun. Being the first ones up, we were able to book our bus trip time back down easily, then walked thru the dark",
          "So we went on a Saturday in June (busy season) and figured out a good tip. Try to get there early if you can. But, if you arrive and there is a long line, buy a bus ticket for an hour later, and be sure to get on Bus #1. Then, take that hour and go enjoy the documentaci\u00f3n",
          "Its worthy.Not only for the panoramic view especially with sunshine but also to travel to the past.You can see and touch windows and wooden walls that a dictator who was responsible for 50.000.000 of deaths lived there.You can admire the way how this road -and the building -that",
          "Very interesting visit, unfortunately massive queues due to the historic connections. Only accessed via special bus service and historical lift. Do not be put off it\u2019s all well organised. Do not miss the documentation centre which shamefully is not presented as dual",
          "We did the Panorama Eagle\u2019s Nest tour today and it was fantastic. Walter was our tour guide and his knowledge of the history of this place is excellent - he has a great sense of humour also, really making the tour a wonderful experience.",
          "This venue is a must visit for the amazing landscape with glorious opportunities for photographs. The journey to the summit in a local bus is quite hairy and lasts for approx. 15-20 minutes. When you reach the parking area, you then progress through a tunnel for roughly 100",
          "We loved the views. Was lucky to have snow and warmth. Amazing to think Hitler walked around this place. The views are breathtaking. One of the best views in the world I reckon.",
          "We visited Eagles Nest (and then Lake Konigsee) as a self-drive day trip from Salzburg and it was a great day. The departure point for Eagles Nest is easy to find with plenty of parking and despite a long line to purchase tickets, we were on a bus within 20 minutes of arriving.",
          "We went to Eagles nest and booked a tour guide. Our expectation was to get a bit of history mixed with a scenic view. Now - we did not even come close to that. After a crowded experience with elderly people doing their utmost to be in front of everyone else we actually",
          "From Berchteshagen, Germany, we headed to the top of the Kehlsteinhaus. From there, there was a wonderful view of the Alps and the Konigsee.",
          "Parking at Obersalzurg very busy. Bus trip up the mountain is terrific - almost the best part of the visit as it hurtles up the steep road and through the tunnels. The ride up in the bronze elevator to the top is slightly surreal and then there you are at the Kehlsteinhaus. The",
          "Fantastic day out, view was amazing, great food highly recommended we was able to see Konigssee that we had been to the day before, we stayed at Landgasthof F\u00fcrstenbrunn the night before which was just as good",
          "The eagles nest was built for one of Adolph Hitler's birthdays as a gift. Hitler was scared of heights so he was only documented as using it 14 times. You can't drive up to it but must take a bus from the base of the mountain to a parking lot near the top. Once there you go thru",
          "i was firstly surprised by the large number of people visiting the Kehlsteinhaus wheni arrived to the parking close to the bus station by 10 am after a queue of 25 minutes i got tickets for a bus 25 minutes later. so after almost an hour waiting i was in the bus that takes 20",
          "The trip up the mountain last around 10minutes on the way back 20 due to the fact the bus has to stop for the buses coming up the single track road. You have to take the bus up there\u2019s no other way to get there unless you walk which would take hours. The views at the top are",
          "Wow wow wow, what an amazing place. The history to it and the most amazing views. Would highly recommend",
          "A really interesting day out. We were on a TUI Tour from Zell Am See in Austria which was great because all travel to the are of The Eagles Nest and then the special bus up the mountain itself was all arranged for us. The whole place is full of history although we learned",
          "We have just returned from a five day trip to Berchtesgaden. One of the main resaons for the trip was the location and a visit to the eagles nest. The trip was well worth it. The eagles nest was an incredible place to visit and the construction of this house on a mountain top",
          "We drove up to the parking lot from Berchtesgaden. It was difficult to find a space and when we finally found one, it was quite a walk to the bus area, which by the way, was not easy to find. There is a banner on a flag pole, and you must descend stairs to find the ticket",
          "Went here via bus from station you get free bus travel if staying in local hotel then caught the eagles nest bus up to top we queued to go in lift to restaurant and had cake and coffee in restaurant service was fast and food very good we then walked to summit you had to book",
          "A must visit for fans of nature and landscapes. The view is in unbeatable. People and staff are friendly. All in all a great experience.",
          "This is a must if you are in the area, The lift to the Eagles Nest is fantastic and the whole place is just full of history. Unlike the Burghof, this place was not blown up by the Americans in 1952 [such a waste]. However, the Eagles Nest is perfect. The prices in the restaurant",
          "Just my opinion but being an Alberta guy and not liking Walmart line ups I now know I would avoid the tunnel slash elevator line up. It's a 30 minute hike up, at least half hour less then tunnel wait. 10 minute hike down. The trail is rather then get off the bus like sheep to",
          "Find the bus station and a parking for Kehlsteinhaus is little bit difficult. Return ticket for bus cost about 16\u20ac and that\u2019s the only option how to reach the top when you don\u2019t want to walk. But it\u2019s beautiful.",
          "What an amazing place. The journey to and from is breathtaking and the place itself is very thought provoking - such devestated decisions were made here in this idyllic place",
          "parking, food, toilets, elevator to the house - OK there were a lot of people on Saturday - worse a long line for the elevator - 30 minutes - horror",
          "This should definitely be on anybodies bucket list!!! What an incredible place.. So much history this place holds, both interesting and chilling. The bus journey up to the Eagle's Nest is insane! The views you get whilst you are on the top of the mountain is unreal also,",
          "When you consider the history of the area the Eagles Nest is a must see. Parking at the bus station on the Obersalzburg was only 3 Euros for the day (get there early before it fills up) and with the Tennagau card the ticket prices to the Tea House itself wasn't too pricey. Buses",
          "If there is a place which you must see before you die, Eagles Nest stands right up there on my list. The bus ride, the walk through the tunnel and finally the ride up through the lift till you get to the top is exciting. Once up there, there is enough place to walk around and",
          "We made the mistake to visit the Eagles Nest on a cloudy morning. The weather looked decent from where you buy tickets but as the bus climbed towards the top, we entered into a terrible fog. By the time we got to the Eagles Nest, you couldn't see 10-15 feet in front of you. We",
          "We were not sure what to expect. Being aware of some of the background to Eagle's Nest we went, just to see. The views are amazing and there is some information about the history to the site available; there is also a 3D plan of how the site looked during the war in the",
          "not a lot up there really just a coffee shop and thats about it. I went as I wanted to see some history of hitler and and at lease some information of what Hitler did here, nothing at all, lets face it every body is going because of hitler, no pictures nothing, so why hide the",
          "We paid \u20ac3 to park here. There is a restaurant and toilets at the car park. We arrived just after 9 and by the time our bus left at 9.45 it was already very busy. Buses up seemed to go every 1/2 hour. 5 went up at the same time. Once you get off the bus you go through a tunnel &",
          "You have to take a bus from the visitors' center. Then you have to walk through this damp, creepy tunnel to a rather elaborate elevator. All of this is original. Once you get outside you realize you are high in the Bavarian Alps. This place was given to Hitler as a birthday",
          "On a Clear Day, You Can See Forever!! It was a clear day, and we enjoyed the scenery, the history, the food, and the spectacular views! It is an effort to get here- we rode the public buses up from Salzburg- but it is worth it! We enjoyed eating lunch up on the terrace- met some",
          "We were three friends in Salzburg and saw an adver for a tour with Panorama for a half day on Berchtesgaden and at the Eagles Nest. This is well worth doing whether for history buffs, good hikers, or photographers. I saw Mimadi's description of hiking up the hill, but for the",
          "What an amazing view! The bus ride up was fine and once we were actually there we were free to roam around. The one thing that I think would be better is to pay for a tour that takes you inside the home. We enjoyed it otherwise.",
          "Took a half day tour with Panorama tours, very well organised and the guides were very knowledgable, the Eagles Nest was quite amazing and apart from the busy restaurant taking most of the area, you really could imagine being back in time.",
          "very nice and interesting place, good choice when you are around. up to the top you can go by foot (around 3,5 h) or more comfortable by bus, return ticket costs 16,50 \u20ac...",
          "We found it difficult to get clear information when planning our visit to Eagle's Nest and we didn't want to join a tour group. This is what we chose to do. We caught the cable car from Obersalzbergbahn Talstation (corner of Bergwerkstrase and Obersalzberstrase) at 9am (first",
          "Our tour guide Amy was incredibly adept at explaining every detail about the Third Reich in this area of Bavaria. We were given advance notice items to look out for and everything was layered out properly. Sadly the bunkers are closed right now but we were shown how this system",
          "Well worth a visit both for its history and the natural beauty of the surroundings , followed by a visit to the museum at Uber Salzburg.",
          "Perched high above the Kehlstein Mountain peak, a house was commissioned by Adolf Hitler to be built in 1937, completed in 1938 and used by Nazi Party for war plans on attacks and mass murdering of Jews and for social functions by the top rank officials. It was presented to",
          "It\u2019s very difficult to write a fair review for this attraction. We went before the main summer season began, and still had to wait about an hour for the bus, but as we were aware of this in advance it was fine and the shop at the bottom along with the information centre kept us",
          "Amazing view from all over the place. Decent food at the restaurant, and an incredible bus ride to the plateau where the elevator are located. Will be back!",
          "On a clear day, we saw all the way to Salzburg. It was refreshing at the summit and of course you can enjoy a beer. Be careful climbing up to the top trail where the rocks have been worn smooth from so many visitors.",
          "After the hair raising drive,the view from the top was well worth it. The history of the place given by our guide was not shown in, what is now just a restaurant, with only the fireplace from Mussolini as historic evidence within the building and of course the bronze interior of",
          "I had always wanted to visit but had never been near enough before so took advantage of being in Zell Am See (about 1hr 20 min by coach). Cost \u20ac33 on coach and then a further \u20ac17 to get in so not a cheap day. Unfortunately when we got up there it was entirely covered in cloud so",
          "We were two of us and decided to do a day tour but all of them were booked out. So we took a train to salzburg - then took the 840 bus to dokumentation stop. We got off there and bought our tickets to eagles nest. The bus took us all the way up - where we saw the most",
          "checking out all things while in Salzburg area----MUST do this. Easy drive to car park, then just 16.60 euro each for bus ride and elevator to house. Cool to check it out, and grab a beer or two. Great to see part of inside, and to learn truth about how this place fit and",
          "Visited with car, there is hard to find a parking place where the busses leave to Nest's main entrance. Busses drive like every 25 minutes up and down. You have to book your way up and way down. Two hours on up is minimium on up, if you want to eat on restaurang take more than 2",
          "Although not the actual home of the Nazi leader, It is still a sight that needs to be seen by history buffs. When I visited in August it was rainy and foggy. Didn\u2019t get to see down the mountain. It\u2019s a small little house but well worth the visit.",
          "Go to kehlstein, The Eagles Nest. Park your car at the visitors centre at the foot of the mountain. Get your ticket and start this highly organised tour by bus up the winding road to the brass lift that will take you up through a hundred meters or so of rock. Exit inside",
          "We took the Panorama Tour from Salzburg and we\u2019re very happy with the experience. We were picked up by bus and taken to the base of the mountain where we boarded a specially outfitted bus to finish the final ascent to the Kehlsteinhaus. The building itself is smaller and there",
          "Eagles Nest was a great view. It was super crowded on a Tuesday in last week of May, hard to find parking and crowded. You can hike or bike up, and down, which no one tells you but after getting to the top and tolerating an overly crowded elevator full of smelly non deodorant",
          "If you are a history buff or a nature lover, this is the trip for you! I suggest going with a guide to get all of the historical details on this trip. As with most places of historical value... much is lost due to the destruction and deterioration of man or time. The guides",
          "It\u2019s a bit of a coach ride out from Munich along a boring autobahn but that just lulls you into a false sense of security - then the coach driver earns his money going up the narrow twisty mountain roads. You then arrive at the parking area and it can feel a bit production line",
          "A must see attraction in the area. On a clear day, the views from the top of the Eagles Nest are amazing. Arrive early to avoid the crowds and queuing. Once parked in the Eagles Nest car park, purchase a bus ticket to reserve your seat. The bus takes visitors along a narrow",
          "The eagles nest is worth the visit and very handy to get to. We drove to the bus pick up point, bought bus tickets (\u20ac16.60 return journey), buses come every 25 mins. Takes 20 minutes up. When up there you have to book your return bus before taking the golden elevator to the top.",
          "Fabulous views - must see. The walk to the elevator through the tunnel is inspiring. Need to mind the wether since it's much cooler than the countryside in the valley below. If you have the time and you're in good shape - walk up to the entrance instead of taking the bus.",
          "Just go there. Everything is run with German precision. Park your car. Buy tickets for the bus (elevator trip is included) about 16 Euro. Bus trip 20 min. Exit bus and book return bus(1.5-2 hours is enough). Then take elevator to Keilstein House. Walk about, enjoy the view,",
          "The former owner of this place may be infamous but there is nothing infamous about this place. Bus ride going up to the entrace is exhilarating itself! Then you walk through a 124 meters tunnel to the elevator and go uo 124 meters in less than a minute. Enjoy the stunning view",
          "It was quite an interesting experience provided the scenario of world war 2, provide good insight of Nazi regime's thought process.Must visit if you are nearby.",
          "For anyone who is interested in history, i\u2019d advise to skip the kehlsteinhaus and museum. Too expensive, too commercial. Nothing really reminds you of the era where it gained its fame/notority. The view from above is nice, but can be gained from any other bavarian mountain. The",
          "We visited Kehlstein a bit out of high season and early in the day - just timely enough to avoid too much queuing. Because this place is visited by an enormous amount of tourists - and as such the premise is organized for this. The Eagles nest is not that big but many people",
          "Take a bus or hike up, but this is a place worthy of visiting if you are in the area, it has history, food and amazing views.",
          "The Mountain View\u2019s from the eagle nest are amazing, worth going up to have a great panorama of the whole area if the weather is good. You can either take a bus and pay 20 euros both ways or hike your way up for maybe 2 hours each way, or 12 kilometers total from the parking",
          "If the weather is nice and sunny, you'll get wonderful view of the surrounding mountains. The earlier you go there the better as you avoid big crowds of tourists.",
          "The place is really worth visiting. I would put it on a list of, say, 500, places you must see before you die : )",
          "Parked the car and booked our bus ticket (\u20ac17 each) to take us up to the Eagles Nest. Roads were very narrow and it was very high up. Sights were stunning as we climbed but we ended up in the clouds so did not have the good views we had seen in pictures. Walked through a long",
          "Incredible place to visit and spend a day. The Eagle's Nest is well worth the time and don't rush it. Take your time and a picnic and spend some time on the decks that surround the main building. And the WWII history is top notch! Look at the fireplace and see all the chips",
          "This is a spectacular place with wonderful views, although there is not much to see from the building itself. Great opportunity to take some nice pictures and enjoy the nature. Be prepared it might be cold and still some snow there in May. Bus transfer required both ways, which",
          "Drove here in a rented car. It was difficult to find in the rolling hills and valleys near the Austrian border. However, once you find the tour center at the bottom of the property, you'll easily find a parking spot and shuttle bus. Multiple shuttle buses run a precise",
          "Perhaps is because I have visited before when this area was of historical value and tours were designed this way, I was shocked that the Eagles Nest is now only a restaurant with only some historical photographs. You still ride up the mountain on the bus, (and then make sure",
          "This is a must see tourist attraction.you can drive yourself or go by bus but the second part of the journey is bus only.cars are parked half way up the mountain you then purchase your tickets the bus journey takes you to the top carpark where you walk through the tunnel in the",
          "This place is so full of history and I wish more of it was preserved at the site. But that's ok because the museum includes a lot. I was very impressed with the museum and also the views which are indescribable. It's a must-see!",
          "Simply awesome. Go, plan on crowds, lots of walking and an incredible experience. I cannot express how much I enjoyed the short time I was there.",
          "We did not get a chance to go up to the Eagle\u2019s Nest, but the document center was very disappointing.",
          "It's one of those places you should definitely visit once. It's special - I suppose for all the wrong reasons. Hitler spent a lot of time here. You can see why. It's stunning. The trip up from the lovely town of Berchtesgaden (worth visiting in itself) is very nice and the",
          "On the positive side, the views are just incredible and overwhelming. Getting there is a bit of an involved experience with lots of standing in line for tickets for the unique buses and picking times for pick up and delivery. We were told that we should plan on at least 2 hrs at",
          "Truly worth the time and effort to ride to the top of this Alpian mount, where vision of the valley below takes your breath away in views, a fine food and drink restaurant, after a hike to the cross.",
          "It was good to see the history of Germany and they had a lot of information, a great tour. I would definetly recommend.",
          "An interesting place to visit. The trip to the Eagle\u2019s Nest is an adventure in itself but fun all the same. Once at the top you have to wait in a tunnel for the lift which is opulent but be aware, they pack in as many people as possible so not for the claustrophobic. Obviously",

          "Amazing place. You can park your car below the mountain. Than you go by bus to the actual entry to the Eagle's nest. You can  enter by using the original elevator or you can walk 15 minutes across a beautiful path with amazing views. I \u2026",
          "Breathtaking view. A lot of bird which you can feed from your hands",
          "Massively important to know the history. Tour was very short but the guide was really good. Scary thought being there and knowing what happened but still fascinating",
          "This was a true highlight for any trip.  The bus ride to the top is very exciting for all ages. The views are great even when the weather isn't great.",
          "One of the most beautiful place where I been in my life. Also it is a good and strange  feeling to be at this historical place. I will go back soon to take more pictures.",
          "Must do for its historic value. Recomended visit time on top is 2 hours. I also recommend walking down instead of taking the bus. The path is good and we could do it easily even with a pram.",
          "Quite a different experience. Recommend it. Totally worth the price ( you need to take the official bus  from the parking point). The restaurant at the top is really good too. One can spend easily 2-3 hours on the top.",
          "Not what I expected.  Very commercialised and although interesting hard to really get a feeling for the place with so many people. Lovely views of mountains, Germany and Austria",
          "Good views, but doesn't deserve the 16\u20ac that you pay for the bus. But the views of the area are very nice",
          "What can I say, like most other reviews out there already, the views.  If it\u2019s clear, the views are breathtaking.  You can see as far as....you can.  We went on a clear warm day, and it was beautiful.  Just make sure you have exactly 3euro \u2026",
          "This is a beautiful spot. Well worth the time and trouble to visit. \n\nIf you are fit and able with no fear of heights.. this should really be a hiking adventure. Bring your hiking boots and water and just hike through all the trails here. \u2026",
          "So, the place is beautiful, the view is amazing and bus service to go up is very efficient. Nonetheless, once up the mountain the only thing to \"visit\" is a cheap touristic cafe/restaurant, no museum, little information and historical \u2026",
          "Very good place. You reach by the bus and return by the time alloted . Takes an hour on the top. Views are amazing. You do not see the rooms as they are now a restaurant",
          "Great place to visit for a lunch and view. Historical value from WW2 is less of a focus though it does show how it was used with information boards plus some historical features still visible, for example the marble fireplace which may have \u2026",
          "Very good kitchen, friendly personel!",
          "Incredible historical experience and breathtaking view from the top!",
          "A very interesting piece of history with a beautiful view. The place can be reached on foot, which my friends and I did. I had hoped for a piece of preserved history, but most of the place has been turned into a restaurant (since 1952, I \u2026",
          "This was a cool place to visit. Unfortunately theres almost nothing to see inside the eagles nest now, as the restaurant uses the entire space and so there is not a lot to see except photos and imagination. Views were great however.",
          "This destination was long time in my Bucket list and naturally i was very excited when i got to visit it.\nIn conclusion you get a great view over lower Bavaria, you can go into the Building Eagles nest.\nThe hilltop is conneded via a elevator and a tunnel throw you need to go after the bus ride for the intial starting point.",
          "The historical atmosphere, especially in the dining hall where Hitler hosted numerous events, is almost haunting. The view is breathtaking.\nI hiked up, the sign says 4 hours from the bus station, but that would be for octogenarians or \u2026",
          "I can't say I hated this, because the views are breathtaking. But the reason people come here is for the historical significance, which frankly has been lost. This place is just a tourist trap, with the tiniest sprinkling of history.",
          "Great walk, highly recommended",
          "Gorgeous views, nice traditional German resturaunt super gorgeous views again cant mention that enough. Rode in a gold elevator. The drive to the top is treacherous but worth it",
          "worth visiting this place, parking is limited, and there is a lot of tourists, so come early in hte morning so you can find a parking spot. and on top of it they doing construction around as well. good luck!",
          "Hiked all the way to this house, it was a steep climb but definitely worth it!\nThe view is amazing.",
          "Lots of history and a very unique experience. Use your google maps and not the cars GPS or else you might end up at spot where the hiking trails begin.",
          "A beautiful spot worth the trip.  Plan for 3 hour total time and 2 hours when you reserve your return time.  The bus system is one of the more efficient systems I have seen.  Kid friendly and prices at the restaurant are appropriate for a Top tourist destination, but not outrageous like you'd get if Disney Corp was running the show.",
          "The location alone is stunning, add the architecture and the history of the building and surrounds and this becomes one of the most incredible places to visit. It has a restaurant / cafe which I didn't use. Almost 360\u00b0 of stunning views.",
          "Beautiful area and amazing place to visit. \n\nThere is a restaraunt in the house which serves food and drink.\n\nYou can take a walk at the top of the mountain and enjoy the stunnning scenery as far as you can see!",
          "Just stunning! Would\u2019ve liked doing the hike to the top, but it was closed due to some snow and rocks on the trail. The views from the top are amazing. Even if you are going by bus, you can still hike the last bit instead of using the elevator, so it\u2019s even more rewarding when getting to the top.",
          "Nothing interesting on this place. From Hitlers home you will see only restaurant. Actually there are beautiful views ...",
          "place from which to enjoy a magnificent panorama in a historic setting",
          "Amazing views, interesting history. Highly recommended. We did a tour from Salzburg, this is a good way to see it.",
          "Amazing place. Good price in restaurant on the top. Incredible view with eagles.",
          "The views up here is spectacular! Also the road the bus goes on has amazing views. The history behind it is also fascinating. Definitely a place to spend a bit of time.",
          "One of the most beautiful place where I ever been!",
          "If you love history and nature, visiting this place is a must.  Learn the history behind the Eagles Nest along with an amazing view of the Bavarian apls.",
          "It's such a beautiful place with ties to historical figures. A place worth visiting regardless of your interest.",
          "Super touristic and for all the wrong reasons. Not truthful to its history, poorly managed, doesn't capture what used to be there..",
          "Take a seat on the left side of the bus on the way up to the eagle nest. Stunning views",
          "Very interesting place to see.  Hitler's summer home.",
          "The Kehlsteinhaus, or Eagle's Nest was a tourist trap of the first grade. Sure, the nature around the Nest was impressive and beautiful, but there were too many people around to be able to  really appreciate the views. It was unclear \u2026",
          "Historical mark point from WW2 where Hitler spends most of his time planning and orchestrated his war crimes .\nThere is two way get up to nest by foot or elevator I would recommend elevator where you can see the precision work of tunnel and elevator.\nOn a clear day you can see Salzburg \nThere is the special bus to take you to parking .",
          "Quite disappointing. It is basically a restaurant now. Quite a bit of the history is still there and there are display boards but I felt it has been spoilt by the commercialisation of the restaurant",
          "Beautiful place in the Bavarian alps. Tip: do check the eagles nest fb page and website with the live cam to see if its snowed in. If there is heavy snow it will be closed",
          "A good site to see when in berchtesgaden, there's a restaurant in the eagles nest so you can eat and drink. The lower level is only available for touring if you have a guide, the bus ride to the elevator is 20 minutes and fun. Original \u2026",
          "Nice little adventure place with a lot of history. Not much to do at the top, although on a clear day you would be mesmerized by the breathtaking views. This place is open only for 6-7 months in a year, so plan your trip accordingly.",
          "Beautiful view from the top. I hiked up in the snow, if you choose to do so please bring proper gear! (Detailed map of the trails found on bigboytravel . com)",
          "Great views and a good place to have a beer. A bit too touristy.",
          "Historic and beautiful place. Amazing view from top on a clear day",
          "Was very well planned.  The tour that I was on ( Panorama) did a great job!!",
          "Awesome view of the Alps from there. Was lucky to visit on a sunny day.",
          "Avoid crowds and walk up, takes 2 hours to hike to upper bus station and is worth of the effort. Unforgettable experience with hardly any people on the way. You don't need a perfect condition for it, there is a good pavement the whole way \u2026",
          "Historical Place. Love it !!!",
          "Very nice, next time I want to make a hike there!!!",
          "One of the best days and experiences of my life. Hard to describe being there and is a must see! A highlight of my trip!",
          "Very impressive views. Log jams of tourists trying to get on the e m elevator to the top. We walked up the path - tiring but only took 20 minutes - less than the queuing time.",
          "absolutely beautiful. full of historical intrigue and gorgeous vistas. I only wish i could have spent more time at the summit. certainly worth the trip",
          "Nice pla\u010de to ser, just about veather.",
          "A must see!  A unique experience for the history and the views!",
          "Take the elevator up and walk down. The food was good but not that high priced. I recommend lunch. Lots of people just having cake.",
          "Good place to visit in end of summer",
          "Can be good view, depending on weather. Nice restaurant and cafe\nNot too much to do up there.",
          "Very beatiful view but nothing else. I was hoping for museum but instead there is a restaurant...",
          "Outstanding historical site. Amazing views (on a clear day), and well-organised logistics, via dedicated coaches and original lift",
          "Something that I've always wanted to see! Not what I expected. a little too bland and way too many people to truly enjoy the experience",
          "Awesome views, totally overcrowded. We got up walking from the bus stop faster than others queueing for the lift. It is a pleasant but for some strenuous walk up.\nRestaurant staff not that friendly and service is mediocre. \nBeverage prices \u2026",
          "Not much left of the original building but well worth visiting if interested in the history. Check the weather is clear for great views,  but be aware that the mists can come down fast losing this visual spectacle",
          "Spectacular views and alot of history here. Sad to see it is also a restaurant and not the whole original site.",
          "Fantastic views.  Hard to believe people could think up such deplorable ideas in such beautiful surroundings.",
          "The views here are absolutely phenomenal. I loved it. We took so many pictures",
          "The view is fabulous, the food was good and served fast. However, it's a haunted place from history.",
          "Well, who wouldn't love this place for the view, the looks, the exciting trip to the top and for the history?",
          "Pretty cool historical site.. .. Hitler wasn't there.. his house is now a restaurant",
          "A very beaitiful place....most memorable in my Eastern Europe trip",
          "Views are stunning, historical landmark building has been changed to a restaurant, I found this disappointing. However it was worth the effort to see it. The nearby lake has very beautiful scenery, its worth a visit.",
          "Just awesome. Need to take a bus up to the entrance then an elevator tot he nest. Overall great view! Nice restaurant with a little to eat orbdrink",
          "Spectacular view from  this historical place. Definately worth the visit.  Get there early as the lines get long midday.",
          "Hitler\u2019s vacation home. Other than the negative association to the infamous dictator, this place was gorgeous!  Had some Gl\u00fchwein and Gulasch inside to warm up while enjoying an enchanting view of the alps. Afterwards took a nice hike past \u2026",
          "Loved the bus drive on the very narrow path, not really a road up to the Eagle's Nest",
          "A fascinating structure and story. The views are unmatched.",
          "Highly recommended. The views and history of the place is unforgettable..",
          "A disappointment from the organisation's point. Why is it difficult to make online reservation for given time instead no choice but standing in a long line?? Otherwise the place is very impressive. But IMHO there shouldn't be a dining room in the main hall of the Eagle's Nest...",
          "For summer you can enjoy a light hike :)",
          "Great history with views to match. Was here in late September and it wasn't crowded at all",
          "Scenic view. The place is surrounded by beautiful mountains. Tunnel to elevator and elevator itself were impressive too.",
          "Fabulous place to visit beautiful views and ofcourse very historic.",
          "The building in itself is pretty messed up since it's just a bier garden and the internals are occupied by the kitchen. But the exteriors are breathtaking. Take a trek outside. It's a bit risky but totally worth it.",
          "Nice busride to the lift. Splendid view. Very crowdy",
          "Wished for more stuff inside instead of just a resturant. Would like to see more from it's original days.",
          "Having visited the eagles nest today I'm compelled to let a review of my experience. While the drive up Is impressive and the lift inside the tunnel also.. Its a total and utter tourist trap.. The restaurant inside the eagles nest is a rip \u2026",
          "Beautiful view of Berchetesgaden and K\u00f6nigsee. Do visit. \n\nPark your vehicle near Eagle's Nest Documentation and take bus to Eagle's nest. Every 25 min is bus Service and costs you 16.5\u20ac per Person round trip",
          "Welcome to the Eagles Nest, Hitler's mountain cottage. There's really not too much to say, you simply need to go! The restaurant is a touch expensive, but you can buy a beer and pretzel for \u20ac6.50 from a small shop near the back patio. Other than that you can easily spend an hour and a half up there taking in the views and history.",
          "Very good place to stay a whole day. Advise to arrive around 083 to avoid queue and waiting",
          "An interesting place to visit with stunning views from a top the mountain. The restaurant serves a good selection of food and beverages.",
          "Very interesting place and informative tour we had around here, can't believe how quickly the place was built. Well worth a visit if you're in the area",
          "Tour is not worth the money. Very short and everything can be read on info stand. However interesting and worth a visit",
          "Nothing that a true history fan would appreciate, good only as a tourist attraction!",
          "So amazing and beautiful. So much history there. Make sure to make time to hike the trails",
          "Little bit of history with amazing view.",
          "Blessed with clear weather. Beautiful!",
          "One word only....awesome.\u263a\u263a",
          "A totally overwhelming view on the surrounding peaks, valleys and the tip of K\u00f6nigssee. Also a reasonably good restaurant. A relatively short distance from Berchtesgaden, but be prepared for a long journey.  Queue for bus tickets, wait for \u2026",
          "great place to visit!",
          "History is self a explanatory but choose  your day carefully the weather can ruin your visit we went on a coach trip and had very little time there so I would suggest you organise Your own trip plus research the area first as there is much more than just the Eagles Nest  the souvenirs, are expensive as are the refreshments.",
          "One of my best memorable trip with my wife. Amazing view. Love to visit again.",
          "Very nice place.   Very busy even on a weekday but a definite must when in the area.",
          "Great mountain views.",
          "Pretty cool, went with Panorama tours based in Salzburg. Guide is great, and there was a great view!",
          "Cold, misty, but still a place worth visiting for the journey and views.",
          "Excellent place. Went with traflagar and they had great guide for us",
          "Very touristy but great views",
          "Spectacular scenery. Well organised and lovely food available too.",
          "Parking is not very well organised! But the bus system up to the Eagle's Nest is excellent.  Allow at least 2 hours at the top AND go as early as possible in the morning!",
          "What a view, what an elevator. Lol a must see and have a warm coffee or cold beer. And just enjoy the view from the nest",
          "Closed Till may. according to Google it was open.",
          "Very interesting place with splended view on the valley.",
          "Wanted to visit in a long time, and I must say it was worth the visit! It is a place with great historic value and a place which will leave you in awe with its panoramic views and the architecture. The food and drinks are standarly Bavarian \u2026",
          "What a beautiful location.  Good spot for hiking, sightseeing or sitting with a good cup of coffee.",
          "Great views, some history posted on the walls, nice beer on the patio.",
          "Fascinating but glum history. Fantastic views on a good day with hangliders and paraglidrers.",
          "Beautiful breath taking, but nobody announced when actually is a foggy,  misty day, you pay the money but don't see anything, so please check the weather !",
          "An exquisite view of the surrounding mountains and glimpse of the Konigse\u00eb lake. Well worth the visit!",
          "Amazing views, great road uphill. Completely nothing at the peak. Not really worth going there.",
          "Well you will definitely learn something compared to what you think it is unless of course you\u2019ve done your research \ud83d\ude09 definitely worth a visit, its not a big place but the views are worth the trip on their own. Hint: take the lift up and walk the path down.",
          "Crowed, but intresting. The views are really great and the history is interesting. Do not eat at the resturant by the ticket counters. They close the kitchen 2.5 hours before the internet says, and they usually only have two items on tbe \u2026",
          "Amazing place and the views are breath taking. Would love to return and hike all the way to the tope.",
          "Wow! absolutely fantastic views outstanding bit of a nightmare getting up there but once up BRILLIANT",
          "I love this place so much",
          "Fantastic views. The summer crowds were a little crazy. The line for the elevator was very very long. One at the top the views were worth it.",
          "Paid 50 Euros for the bus ticket. Waited an hour in line. Searched the entire place. Found 0 eagles, let alone a nest",
          "Impressive entrance (the tunnel and the elevator) however, once you are up there, there is no much to see, If you saw Band of Brothers you can feel  this visit different but if you go there to look for Hitler's history or something like that you will get disappointed. Beautiful view from there though.",
          "An awesome place to visit. It\u2019s neat to be on top of the mountain. But from the side outlook, the surrounding mountains are immense. Breathtakingly beautiful. Would return in a heartbeat \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Great historical place to visit best on a clear day",
          "The view is breath taking, it takes a while to climb it, but to be a part of the history it is really worth it!",
          "Too crowded... had to wait in a long line for the elevator booth going in and coming out. Restaurant up top and nice views but NOTHING like the Untersbergbahn....I recommend the Untersbergbahn over the eagle's nest hands down!",
          "A remarkable place to visit, once you reach the top the view is breathtaking. Learning about the history of the Eagle's nest was fascinating, the engineering and hard work by the labourers was inspiring but somewhat perplexing given the harsh conditions and short time frame imposed upon them.\nA must visit when you are in the area!",
          "Good tourist attractions especially if you drive. Loved it and will do it again \ud83e\udd19\ud83d\ude01",

          "Catching some history on top of a mountain with an amazing view!",
          "This historical location should have been maintained as just that instead it has been turned into a restaurant.  Expected to be able to see a close representation of what the site / building was during Hitler\u2019s reign, but instead was \u2026",

          "I last visited the Eagles Nest in 1979.  There was the tearoom, but not the cafe.  This attraction is spell binding.  From the time you enter the elevator (shiny brass) and take the brief ride to the top was awesome, this \"tea house\" was a \u2026",
          "The view here was superb especially when the weather was good and clear. It's good if you have a chance to read the history first before you visit here so you can have a clear big picture during your visit.\n\nThe first bus schedule to get \u2026",

          "A beautiful place on top of Bavarian Alps. If you ignore the association with Hitler, it represents man's quest for the pristine beauty of nature, undefeatable urge to conquer the most difficult places and create a monument for the undaunted sprit of man.",

          "Priceless & more than Beautiful view from the top",

          "Beautiful place and view. I will be back!",
          "Glad we came here. The view from the top is breath taking. Be aware it is high up. We visited at the end of September. It was snowing with a string wind. I wish i had dressed warmer. Also to see the entire house you walk through the restaurant. It is only z few rooms but again, the views are breathtaking.",

          "Staggering and astounding race-cleansing views.",
          "The view at the top gets 5 stars and if you are hiking to the top (not taking a bus), then this would probably be a 5 start experience as well, but we didn't hike. The rest of the Eagles Nest arrangement is a tourist trap that was \u2026",

          "Part of history but you have to be lucky to have sunshine",
          "bit crowdy even if went there in the week. eagle nest is just a restaurant. there is no history pointing to Adolf, NSDAP. but still there was something... it was strange feeling to get there by same road, corridor and elevator to the nest as him. Trekking was nice, even if had to deal with snow.",
          "It was foggy but still was a great experiance.",
          "Disappointing there is a restaurant operating in the infamous building. The queue for the tickets took us 45 mins, something was not well organised. The view is great, there was even snow at the top. I recommend taking the gold elevator on the way up and then taking the walk down to the bus station.",

          "Exciting, takes you back in History,  beautiful view.",

          "Loved the view. Great food. Fast service",
          "Took the last busride to the eagle`s nest because we arrived a little late, the ride is not cheap but the trip should be worth the money.\nHalf way during the trip we were being told that we had 20 (!) minutes to walk to the golden elevator \u2026",
          "Bit over cast but still a great place to visit \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Well worth a visit for the views alone. \n\nThe Eagles nest has been turned into a large restaurant. Surprisingly reasonably priced. Very popular location - get a table as soon as possible. \n\nOn the history side, I thought there would have been more, however there is one small hallway with information along it.",
          "The food, the history and amazing views. Great day out",
          "When the weather is clear, the views are spectacular. This is a very busy place so plan extra time in your schedule to visit.",

        "wiki": "EC Red Bull Salzburg is a professional ice hockey team based in Salzburg, Austria, that currently plays in the Austrian Hockey League. The club play their home games at the Eisarena Salzburg.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of ice hockey in Salzburg at the highest level dates back to 1977\u201378, when the then HC Salzburg took a sensational third place in the first division. Influential players such as Rick Cunningham and Roger Lamoureux (both Canadians) helped to massively increase the popularity of Salzburg ice hockey, and in December 1977 saw the ice rink sold out for the first time. Ten years later in 1988, the Salzburg ice hockey club, now known as Salzburg EC, were once again on course for the title. With strong players such as the Russians Viktor Schalimow and Sergej Kapustin or fine-sounding names such as Greg Holst from Canada or Vienna's Peter Znenahlik, an exciting winter in the \"Volksgarten\" could be expected. After a strong season which included spell at the top in the preliminary round standings, Salzburg failed to take its first Bundesliga championship, and its ailing economic situation eventually saw the relegation of SEC from the first division.\nEC Salzburg were founded in 1995 by the merger of two small clubs EC Morzg and EC Tiefenbach. The EC Morzg originally arose after the bankruptcy of Salzburg EC in 1988 as a refuge for the youth players. Shortly after the foundation, the company Kaindl presented the club with its first major sponsor and the club was renamed to Kaindl EC Salzburg. From the beginning of 2000, drinks manufacturer Red Bull became the team's major sponsor and the club again changed names to represent EC The Red Bulls Salzburg. It was later transitioned to EC Red Bull Salzburg in 2005.\n\n\n=== 2000\u201304 ===\nStrengthened by players such as Canadian Sheldon Moser and Brian McCarthy of the USA, the Red Bulls became champions of the Oberliga as quickly as the 2000\u201301 season (the Oberliga was then the equivalent of the second division), but weren't quite yet ready for the highest level. Until three years later, that is. The Red Bulls fought their way back to the championship in the Nationalliga, ending the Salzburg ice hockey club's 16 years of absence from the Bundesliga.\n\n\n=== 2004\u201306 ===\nAfter increasing the squad intensively - in Austria's ice hockey history, the Salzburg ice hockey club first competed in the Nationalliga with a farm team - the Red Bulls had to learn the hard way in the first Bundesliga season of \"recent times\", although they did show their potential. Following seventh and last place in the preliminary rounds of the season which saw them promoted, team formation enjoyed an ever more professional environment, and in the second year following promotion, the Red Bulls found themselves in the final of the Erste Bank ice hockey league. In the end, however, they lost to VSV, taking the runner-up spot in the sixth game of the best-of-seven series.\n\n\n=== 2006\u201307 ===\nSalzburg were finally rewarded in their third 1st division season. After a fabulous regular season contested by eight teams, where the Red Bulls conceded just one out of 28 home games, Salzburg went on to put in a sterling performance in the play-offs as well. Following three successive victories over the Vienna Capitals in the semi-final (best of five), the Red Bulls conceded just one game in the final against VSV in Villach, sealing Salzburg's first ever Austrian ice hockey championship with a score of 4:1 on wins (best of seven).\nThe finals games in Villach, where VSV were backed by an incredibly enthusiastic crowd, their seventh man, were particularly tough. The secret of their success was consistency, the team having been perfectly prepped by head coach Hardy Nilsson. The 59-year-old Swede subsequently retired from active coaching, celebrating the Red Bulls' title and his tenth championship as a coach.\n\n\n=== 2007\u201308 ===\nFor their fourth 1st division season, the Red Bulls were joined in Salzburg by new head coach and sporting director Pierre Pag\u00e9 as well as a number of new international coaches. In addition to non-playing staff, future captain Stuart Mercer was drafted into the side after a home video being seen on YouTube of him demonstrating 'Phil Harrison-esque tekkers' at Hutton Grammar School. On 25 September 2007, in preparation for the new season, Red Bull played an exhibition match against National Hockey League team, the Los Angeles Kings, losing in an entertaining 7-6 contest. In his first few months, the 59-year-old Canadian helped set up the International Ice Hockey Development Model (IIDM), laying the foundations for the development of up-and-coming junior players, and also took the unprecedented step of heavily integrating young players into the 1st division squad.\nAfter a regular season full of ups and downs the Red Bulls began the newly introduced intermediate round in third place, then going on to drop another place. But there was no stopping Salzburg in the play-offs: after an exhausting best-of-five series in the quarter final against Villach, they left the Vienna Capitals standing in the semi-final, where they racked up four wins (best of seven). The final against Slovenian club Olimpija Ljubljana became a real thriller, which ended with the Red Bulls 4:2 ahead on wins after proving better able to hold their nerve. Salzburg therefore managed to bag the title for the second year running, the farm team's second place in the \u00d6sterreichische Nationalliga also underlining a strong performance.\n\n\n=== 2008\u201309 ===\nThe 2008\u201309 season saw the Red Bulls narrowly miss out on retaining their title. After an incredibly exciting finals series spanning seven games, they suffered a narrow 1-2 defeat in the final game in Klagenfurt, losing their crown to KAC. The Red Bulls nevertheless end the season with their heads held high, having played some fast-paced and powerful ice hockey with by far the youngest team in the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga and impressed an ever-increasing number of Salzburg fans, who made sure the play-off games were always a sell-out. In the second year of his tenure as head coach and sporting director, Pierre Pag\u00e9 made an even bigger impression than last year: his skill for bringing a number of young, talented players from Austria and abroad together with some of Austria's strongest players - captain Thomas Koch was awarded MVP honours this season - produced a force to be reckoned with as the season progressed, the team having started the championship with an average age of just 23.8. In the context of the Red Bull Hockey Model several talented farm team players were also given their chance in the 1st division, some of them even holding their own in the finals series. The Red Bulls fielded a total of 43 players in the 1st division. The farm team, which largely comprised U-20 players this year, was knocked out in the quarter-final of the \u00d6sterreichische Nationalliga by EK Zell am See.\n\n\n=== 2009\u201310 ===\nThe 2009\u201310 season puts all others in the shade. In his third year with the Red Bulls, head coach and sporting director Pierre Pag\u00e9 single-mindedly pursued his objectives and now the Salzburg ice hockey club has picked up no fewer than three championship titles! In September 2009 the Red Bulls won their own invitation tournament, the Red Bulls Salute, for the first time in its five-year history, beating top-flight European clubs such as CSKA Moscow in the process. In November 2009 and January 2010, Salzburg took part in their third Continental Cup, Europe's most prestigious IIHF club tournament of the season, also lifting the cup after two successful rounds in Latvia and France. The Red Bulls made it an incredible hat trick by winning the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga, celebrating their most successful season so far in their ten-year existence as a club. Thomas Koch, who takes the 2009 MVP award, lifted the cup for the first time as captain. Sterling work with the juniors as part of the Red Bull Hockey Model was rewarded with, among other things, the U-20 and U-17 championships. The Red Bulls' farm team was knocked out in the semi-finals of the \u00d6sterreichische Nationalliga (2nd division) by Dornbirn, who went on to take championship honours, but continued to provide several young talented players with the ideal platform from which to develop. Record breakers: On 12 January 2010, the Red Bulls took on Jesenice in the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga, fielding a line-up whose average age was just 21.1 years. Overall, 47 Salzburg players made at least one appearance in Austria's premier division.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nAustrian Hockey League:\nWinners (8): 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2014*, 2015, 2016, 2018*\nContinental Cup:\nWinners (1) : 2010\nEuropean Trophy:\nWinners (1) : 2011\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== Current roster ===\n\nUpdated 27 June 2019.\n\n\n=== Notable alumni ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEC Red Bull Salzburg official website\nRed Bulls Salute at icehockeylinks.net",

          "So it wasn\u2019t even that hot, perhaps 82 F outside, but the room for the concert lacked adequate ventilation and created a miserably hot experience for both the performers and audience. I followed the dress code for men, no shorts, dressy casual. Half of the audience was in tank",
          "Must seen. Dont miss this package, everything was great, boat tour, vip dinner, orchestra! I love it. If i have to go back, will do again.",
          "We attended the event with my 13-year-old daughter. The dinner was delicious, the restaurant is in a beautiful setting. The staff was bery nice, our waitress, Barbara was especially kind and helpful. The concert was also nice and the location added a special atmosphere to the",
          "The view of Salzburg and the mountans are really spectacular. Musicians were also excellent. Concert nice length. The room temperature was right at the limits of bearable, well over 90 during the performance. If you have not bought the tour ahead of time, and the day time",
          "I have no complaints at all. Took the VIP Package.Great seating at the Terrase with view at the City.Dinner was lovely. So was the Concert.The Ambience adds to the experience.",
          "The whole evening was a magnificent experience. The view from the patio for dinner was simply stunning and Martina the waitress really looked after us - with a smile and great service. The setting for the concert was again stunning. We really enjoyed the music and performance.",
          "The panoramic view from the fortress was spectacular. The dinner was sumptous and good, just like the service. We enjoyed every minute of the Mozart concert. But for a classical music lover like me, it was too short. I wished they had played more Mozart pieces.",
          "We enjoyed the evening. A nice change from the bustle of the town scene. The views are beautiful. We knew we were booking a \"tourist experience\" but had fun. The food was good--not amazing. The music was accessible & familiar for those in our group who aren't classical music",
          "Good food. Amazing view. Perfect, professional concert that is not too long and not too short. Very nice and a good price point.",
          "Overall, the experience was very enjoyable. I agree with some reviewers that the river cruise can be skipped. The views from the restaurant and the concert hall are amazing. Musicians were great. My only complaint is about food. The veal option was basically inedible, the meat",
          "Book the VIP tickets, the views are worth it. The boat ride, first part of the evening, I could have done without. Dinner in the fortress, with a view, was very nice. The concert, with front views of the sun setting over Salzburg, was also very nice. Great way to relax and spend",
          "For us getting there and getting back to the car we\u2019re the worst part. The VIP table was nice but don\u2019t feel bad if you don\u2019t go that route. You eat with a view on a limited menu. Then you walk up at least 4 flights of stairs to get to the concert and the musicians are very",
          "An evening on an over-used conveyor belt where the staff have to deliver to a basic standard and extract the maximum cash. A poor meal with absurdly overpriced drinks set the bar. But things improved with a good concert in a pleasant setting. Overall, 3 stars in the end, but 1",
          "Don't go there on a very hot day. No air conditioning in a full house make this place unbearable Concert was average, but Cellist had either to much or to little to drink and his performance showed it.",
          "I loved this it was great. The views are magnificent from the top. Dinner was very nice. The 7 string arrangements were so professional and there was a performance by a piano player! I throughly enjoyed it all it was memorable to say the least. I highly recommend it!",
          "We had such a wonderful time. The food was great, the view was spectacular and the concert was terrific. What an amazing venue for a Mozart concert. Our teenage kids loved it! This was truly one of the best things that we did in our trip through Europe!",
          "We opted for the VIP option as we'll only do this once. Loved the venue! Be sure to take the (included) cable car to the venue, otherwise it's a long, steep walk. Dinner was good with amazing views of the mountains but a very limited menu so maybe check before you go. Wine was",
          "Booked this months in advance and I never try to do that. Usually, it\u2019s cattle calls and lines and half hearted meals. Food was good. Water was nearly $7 a bottle. Outstanding view of approaching storm. Ran through rain, lightning, and many stairs to concert hall. Good",
          "I would probably recommend skipping the river cruise or doing it separately. When we booked, we did not realize that you take the river cruise then must walk on your own to the fortress. You take a furuncle to the top of the fortress for your meal. Paying just a little more for",
          "Unfortunately cruise was cancelled due to rapid river due to melting snow from the mountains. With the VIP dinner, you get seated with wonderful views. The dinner itself was okay, nothing to write home about. Concert was held in one of the rooms at the very top. It was +30C when",
          "This was a really great concert, with highly skilled musicians and an incredible venue and view. Much better than tourist concerts seen in Vienna and elsewhere in Salzburg. The first half of the concert focused on more complete works, and the second half was more of a greatest",
          "Need to be aware that there are 100 stair steps after exiting the tram. Cruise, dinner and concert were all wonderful. Highly recommend also the VIP option. Seats in front row of performance a dinner table with a panoramic view of the city were well worth it.",
          "Dinner with views was awesome. Food choices and service were great. Concert was ok for me. Wanted to try it as that was my first time. Go for it if want to try it for the heck of it or if you are a fan, or else you can probably pass.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the evening. We even sprang for the VIP tickets and had an excellent view at dinner and the best seats in the house at the concert. The only hiccup was that we thought that you caught the funicular on the south side of Nonnberg Abbey, so we walked up a",

          "We loved the concert! The musicians were excellent and the atmosphere was perfect. Even though the food was just okay--not bad, but not special--we were pleased to get to eat in the fortress above Salzburg with an incredible view and music. I would recommend this to anyone for",

          "I was assured by my hotelier that the food in this package experience was excellent - wrong!! I ignored my own rule about such things, which is to avoid doing things just to save a little money. Holidays are too precious. The pluses - the view and the fortress were stunning, the",
          "You get ride the tram up to the fortress which is the most gorgeous view one can imagine, then have a good dinner in a private restaurant (again a great view) then climb up to the top of the fortress for a world class Mozart concert. Well worth the cost! I've read other revues",
          "I'll start on a good note, the atmosphere was amazing. The concert hall was beautiful and the view was breathtaking. However, you would expect that in a concert, the music would stand out and not just the view. Even though Salzburg is where Mozart was born and raised, his pisces",
          "We booked for the concert with VIP dinner and was not disappointed. We had a seat right next to the window in the restaurant, and got really great service. Food was enjoyed and I was glad i opted for the VIP option - food was delicious and plentiful. Concert seats rights at",

          "We really enjoyed his concert! It was a small audience which made it feel more intimate, and we were able to see the performers well. They were excellent! It was neat to be in the fortress for it and our view for dinner beforehand was amazing. This was a nice way to celebrate",
          "We booked the VIP tickets for Sunday 14th October, and arrived early to ensure we knew where to be at 4pm. Good job we did as it turns out the river level was too low (due to the dry summer) for the boat so we were offered a refund, reschedule or an extra 12 euros each to do",
          "We went to the concert only, and with category 2-tickets The venue is fine, a bit difficult to find our way there on the fortress. The concert was very nice, but it would have been nice to have more Mozart as they do market it as a Mozart-concert.",
          "Although I found the food served at dinner to be average, the view from the restaurant was amazing and the staff was very attentive. We arrived about an hour before dinner and had no trouble boarding the funicular. It gave us ample time to walk around the fortress and take",
          "Perhaps it's better to skip the dinner of rubbery overcooked fish and haphazard service. You can see the rooms during the day. The sunset view from the restaurant was good, the concert okay, not great- the musicians have played this so many times that they no longer look at the",

          "We did this trip with the boat cruise. If you had walked around Salzburg there wasn't that much more to see on the boat trip. But the view from the fortress at dinner was beautiful. We did the VIP option and had an excellent dinner. The concert after was also very nice. A nice",
          "The concert was amazing. The quartet of violins were exceptional. We got to hear Haydn, Strauss, Mozart played inside the concert hall in the Salzburg Castle. It was great to hear this played whilst the sun was setting over the city below. It was amazing. One issue I did have",
          "Although it was nice to be in a castle as the rain poured down-and I am glad I went as I got special seating in corner with a big window open, the Food was not worth rushing there for-and spending that kind of money. In fact, they served me spoiled whip cream so I awoke with",
          "We purchased the VIP version. The river boat ride was great and provided a unique view of the city and surroundings. We then made our way over to the funicular tram for the ride up to the fortress which was a great experience itself. The vistas from he castle were breathtaking.",
          "This was totally different than expected. We rode up the funicular, the cost of which was included in our ticket. However, wehn we arrived at the Fortress we had no idea where to go for dinner. Signage was absent, and we finally found someone to ask who knew where we needed to",

          "This concert is excellent, its such a lovely setting and you get to see a bit of the Fortress as well included within the ticket. We went for the concert only as we wanted to have dinner in town. We also went for the cheaper seats and glad we did - the setting is so small you",
          "The fortress is a beautiful venue. It's a typical format, with dinner served in the restaurant, followed by a concert of mostly Mozart in the concert hall. In this case, the VIP package is probably worth it because you have dinner seating by the window, better menu options,",
          "We did the three combo, boat ride on the Salzburg River, dinner and concert. VIP tickets. The boat ride really didn't show anything you could not see from the bank. The dinner was quite tasty, with choice of veal or fish. Service was okay at best. Drinks extra. The music was",

          "I am not going to make any comment about the music but just say that was perfect. The room where the concert took place faces to the west therefore it is the perfect place to watch the sunset over the city. The entire experience is a dinner before the concert. Food wasn't",
          "We opted for the concert only as we saw that the food reviews for dinner were so-so. The concert tickets were 46 Euros per person, which was reasonable as they include free entry to the fortress and transportation with the fortress cable car free of charge. You are allowed up",

          "The poor rating given is not due to the dinner OR the concert but entirely for the booking agency. We booked the 3pm Christmas Eve Dinner Concert (lunch actually as there was no evening dinner concert due to the Holiday). We received an email confirmation from Europera Ticket",
          "Even though none of us is into classical music, we totally enjoyed this concert. It is the combination of the music and the setting. Held on top of the fort, with the streaks of light from the setting sun streaming in, it surely transports you. The views from the fortress are",
          "Apprehensive to do this by myself because my tour said romantic dinner followed by a concert. But really it was a very nice restaurant inside the castle walls with an amazing view that was spectacular. The food was OK find enough. But then you walk up several flights of stairs",

        "wiki": "The M\u00f6nchsberg, at 507 meters (1,663 ft) above sea level, is one of five mountains in Salzburg municipality, Salzburg state, Austria. It is named after the Benedictine monks of St Peter's Abbey at the northern foot of the mountain.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe M\u00f6nchsberg shapes Salzburg's historic townscape with its long drawn back consisting of conglomerate (Nagelfluh). The massif is a solidified river crushed stone, deposed as a delta into the interglacial see (Mindel-Riss Interglacial), which was not cleared away thereafter by the glaciers protected from the hard limestone of the adjacent Festungsberg and so remained.\nWater ingressing into numerous bursts and cleavages can lead to falling stones and demolition of whole rock sections: In the early morning of 16 July 1669 tons of rock fell off the mountain on the Gst\u00e4ttengasse street below, killing about 230 citizens in their sleep by destroying two churches, a seminary and 13 houses. Since then there is the office of a Bergputzer (mountain inspector), filled by mountaineers who regularly and since 1778 annually dispose loose rocks and prove the condition of the mountain surface to examine. Thus a new disaster could be prevented. \n\n\n== History ==\nDriven into the walls of rock above of the St Peter's Cemetery, established about 700, are Early Christian hermitages, called Katakomben (catacombs), which however never were funeral places.\nAlready from 1137 to 1143 the Archbishop of Salzburg had the Stiftsarm branch of the Almkanal built through the mountain, in order to lead the waters into the city. This early adit system can be visited during the annual Almabkehr in September.\nThe Sigmundstor (colloquially Neutor) city gate, a 131 m (430 ft) long tunnel with elaborate Baroque portals, was built from 1764 to 1766 through the mountain at the behest of Archbishop Sigismund von Schrattenbach; it is today one of the oldest street tunnels in Central Europe. Large air-raid shelters in the mountain were built during World War II. After 1970 some of these were enlarged to an underground car park for more than 1400 vehicles.\n\n\n== M\u00f6nchsberg today ==\nThe M\u00f6nchsberg plateau offers a small-scale change of forests and meadows and therefore is a popular local recreation area for the Salzburg citizens and tourists. Castles on the M\u00f6nchsberg include:\n\nThe Johannesschl\u00f6ssl, rebuilt by Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau around 1590, since 1926 a guest house of the Catholic Pallotine order.\nThe archiepiscopal Marketenderschl\u00f6ssl, also held by the Pallottines and since 1960 a study centre run by the University of Redlands, California\nSchloss M\u00f6nchstein, which had been held by the Benedictine University of Salzburg, has been a hotel since 1948.\nThe Kupelwieserschl\u00f6ssl, where the Austrian writer Peter Handke lived from 1979 to 1988. He described a walk over the M\u00f6nchsberg in his novella Nachmittag eines Schriftstellers (\u201cafternoon of a writer\u201d).\nFurthermore several historic fortifications offer panoramic views over the city, to the Untersberg, the Berchtesgaden Alps and the Salzkammergut mountains:\n\nThe Richterh\u00f6he, which makes an excellent prospect on the south of the city and the mountain chain of the alps behind it. The fort structures are documented were first documented in 1278. Prince-archbishop Paris von Lodron strengthened it during the Thirty Years' War.\nThe B\u00fcrgerwehr was established about 1487/88 with 4 towers as part of the city walls and was extended with another 4 towers after 1500.\nThe M\u00fcllner Schanze with the military towers of the Augustinerpforte and Monikapforte were built by Archbishop Paris von Lodron in the years 1621 to 1644 as a three-step fortress and a part of the new city wall.\nThe Humboldtterrasse, a fortification structure also erected under Paris von Lodron, offers a unique panorama toward the Salzburg old town. It was originally called Klausenkavalier and is today named after Alexander von Humboldt, who allegedly once called the areas of Salzburg, Naples and Constantinople the \u201cmost beautiful on earth\u201d.\nThe top of the M\u00f6nchsberg since 2004 is the second location of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art. It used to be the site of the Grand Caf\u00e9 Winkler, a popular restaurant destination, and the Salzburg Casino. Since 1890 visitors can reach the place with an elevator in the mountain. The panorama terrace adjacent to the museum is a much visited point with a view all over the old town.Not only due to Peter Handke's stay, the M\u00f6nchsberg is frequently called the \u201cmountain of writers\u201d: It plays a significant role in the autobiographic work of Thomas Bernhard, but often not in the positive sense. It applies to him as \u201ethe suicide mountain\u201c. The Austrian author Gerhard Amanshauser also was among the inhabitants of the M\u00f6nchsberg. In his autobiography \u201cas a barbarian in the Prater\u201d the mountain and the near Festungsberg is important.\n\n\n== Mountains of Salzburg ==\nThe other mountains in Salzburg are:\n\nKapuzinerberg\nRainberg\nFestungsberg\nHellbrunner Berg\n\n\n== Literature in German ==\nKatrin Hauer: Der Bergsturz des M\u00f6nchsbergs in der Stadt Salzburg von 1669.

          "A large investment went into the old city of Salzburg. It is very nice to tour and watch, very clean and elegant in old European style. The Old City is full of (mostly) top end stores at extremely high prices. The imposing rocks and the views are nice, so I recommend a 1-2 hour",
          "It is my first visit to Salzburg and I really love the city. Surprisingly a lot of tourists for November and sometimes that's annoying but it must be a lot worse in summer. Are there a lot of shops -- yes like any medieval old town -- but I love the interesting metal signs here,",
          "To be honest, the old city of Salzburg is not very attractive area to walk around. The main Platz is gravel with a dozen horse drawn carriages for tourists and they smell. There was construction going on in a lot of places and some of the main statues and fountains are now",

          "I may have too high of expectations on this one. We had a two hour bus ride each way, so this may have had something to do with it. Once in Salzburg we did a walking tour. I enjoy seeing the city from the bridge with the locks (Makartsteg). Walking down the streets with the",
          "This city has lots of nice castles, churches and fountains to look at. We parked in one of the main parking garages and were lead right into the shopping street, which was a bit annoying, so I would recommend to get away from the crowds, unless you came here to go shopping. A",

          "We spent three days in Salzburg, which is very easily accessed from the airport via the cheap streetcars No. 2 or No.10. The old town is split into two major sections, one each side of the river and linked by several bridges. Both areas offer plenty of interest to explore on",

          "We were in Munich and did a day trip to this most amazing pretty village of Austria. We did it via a tour which included a boat trip of wolfgangsee. So worth the visit, if your anywhere near this village put it on your itinerary as you won\u2019t be disappointed",

        "wiki": "The Kollegienkirche (Collegiate Church) in Salzburg, Austria, is the church of the University of Salzburg. It was built in Baroque style by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. Dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, it is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Centre of Salzburg. It is now both the parish church of people connected to the university and a venue of the Salzburg Festival.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building is the church of the University of Salzburg, located at the Universit\u00e4tsplatz (University square). Bishop Paris von Lodron planned a university church on the location of the former Frauengarten, instead of using the Aula (main auditorium) for church services of the university. While two successors were not able to realise the plan, Johann Ernst von Thun succeeded as part of his plan to develop Salzburg in Baroque style. The building by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach was begun in 1694. In 1707, it was dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, which is celebrated on 8 December, a national holiday in Austria. It is believed that Mozart's Missa brevis in D Minor, K. 65, was commissioned by the church and premiered on 4 February 1769.During the occupation by Napoleon, the church was used as storage. After the university was dissolved, it served as a garrison church. In 1922, the Salzburg Festival performed there the premiere of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Das Salzburger gro\u00dfe Welttheater, directed by Max Reinhardt. In 1969, Emilio de' Cavalieri's Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo was presented in an arrangement by Bernhard Paumgartner. The church has been a regular venue of the festival since the 1970s. In 2008, Salvatore Sciarrino's opera Luci mie traditrici was staged by Rebecca Horn.The church was returned to its original status as a university church in 1964. On 18 May 2008, it was designated the parish church for a parish named Universit\u00e4tspfarrsprengel, serving people connected to the university. The building has been restored in the 21st century, beginning with the apse, which was completed in 2010. Most of the other restoration was completed in 2013.\nThe church is a listed monument and part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Centre of Salzburg.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe church is a main work of Fischer von Erlach. He designed a hall with white walls without paintings which became a model for late-baroque churches in southern Germany.The organ was built in 1866 to 1868 by Matth\u00e4us Mauracher, an instrument of 34 stops on three manuals and pedal. Anton Bruckner played the organ several times. The organ was restored in 1982 by Orgelbau Pirchner.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nAlice Schulte: Die Kollegienkirche in Salzburg.

          "This church is smaller and more pleasant than the Cathedral (Salzburger Dom), with beautifully decorated baroque interior. I guess the prevailing white colour increases this impression. Especially the dome is impressive.",
          "It is a very impressive Church from the outside but is bland very white inside and disappointing as it did not meet the expectations it portrayed with its external beauty.",
          "This is a large Baroque church in the more commercial part of Salzburg. While the exterior has wonderful detail, the interior is very bare. It reminded me a lot of the Pantheon in Paris where a former church was turned museum. Salzburg has so many amazing churches, so this",
          "we were stunned by this church fantastic work on the building and so round it was a pleasure walking around the Church and its grounds again a must to visit",
          "The church is located behind Mozart's Birthplace and easily accessible through alleyways crisscrossing the roads. Looked uniformly white outside but the interior is even whiter, with the strong sunlight giving a cheerful aura to the nave and highlights the ornate altars, unlike",
          "In Salzburg the \u201cKollegienkirche or Collegiate Church\u201d, is the church of the University of Salzburg. It was built in the Baroque style and this by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. It was dedicated to the \u201cImmaculate Conception\u201d, and besides it is part of the Unesco World",
          "Its a beautiful whilte+gold combination church. It's pretty silent too, and you can sit here for a while to relax. The interiors, when closely observed are just too beautiful. You can take a lot of photos here.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed wandering into the Kollegienkirche. A vast nave space, with white walls and ceiling -- and while very Baroque in surface decoration (cherubs, clouds, festoons, coffers everywhere) only the altar panels were painted and gilded... so the rest of that vast",
          "Very interesting church with white on white interior. Something I have never seen before. Very pretty.",
          "The outside is a massive Baroque edifice, and the interior greeted us with soothing organ music. I believe they use this church for concerts and perhaps other activities in addition to church service. Interesting interior.",
          "I am so happy to have stopped for a look inside this church. It is so different, unexpected and perfectly joyful. That is how I felt during this visit. My very favorite look was the area with all the white clouds with the angels surrounding the window, etc. You have to see",
          "This church, the Collegiate Church is full of beauty and the architecture is really nice. This is worth seeing when in Salzburg.",
          "This old church was well preserve and exceptionally beautiful. The building and images are great works of arts. Fully painted in white, you truly feel the celestial celebration of faith. Recommended for Christians worldwide.",
          "Consecrated in 1707 this is a stunningly beautiful creation in High Baroque style. A vast ornate facade on the square is a perfect introduction for what's to come inside. Standing at the entrance the effect is awe inspiring, with the immense space in white. Marvellous lighting",
          "Was built originally for the Benedictine University. It has been restored. It is one of the most celebrated baroque churches in Austria.",
          "Admission is free but you can leave a small donation. The taking of photos is permitted. Second only to the cathedral in size and built in majestic marble, you can\u2019t miss this church in the old town. Worth stopping for quick peek as its minimalist decoration is quite unusual for",
          "Well worth a look if passing. Not a top must see however. Still nice. Interesting from the outside as well as inside. Take about 15-20 mins to walk around.",
          "Completely renovated. Good explanation about the time frame when the renovation has been done. No entry fee.",
          "Relatively bare inside but two side altars are worth admiring. There are wooden benches along the sides for resting - none of the typical pews in most other churches.",
          "This is a beautiful baroque church, which looks very majestic from the outside. The inside is very elegant due to its classical design. It is very spacious overall, so it gives you a very refreshing feeling.",
          "This massive church is on the corner of the Universitatplaz. On entering you see that there are no standard row of pews as expected. It is very pristine and minimalist. No gilt and few paintings,it creates a very serene space.",
          "One of the purest examples of baroque architecture in Austria is often overlooked despite the fact it is second only to the cathedral in size, and has an impressive convex fa\u00e7ade. The main hall has white walls without paintings - sparse use of sculptures and stucco works",
          "This looks very smart and white on the outside and we were thinking it will be highly decorated and a bit over the top inside. No it was not, very white and reasonably plain inside with not a lot of over the top decoration. Very big and wide open space inside , no pews so maybe",
          "A minimalist church...white on white and some gold. If you are looking for a beautiful church that is restored in a quiet and special way this is the one I\u2019d recommend. The Dome is simple, white and a beatiful view when you lie down on special angled benches. A peaceful place",
          "Everything in this city is beautiful, this church is unique and has lovely clean white walls that really stand out",
          "First of all, we ate our lunch from the surrounding market on the church steps. I went inside to take some pictures and came back and told my husband he had to go in as well. They were playing very eerie music and it was echoing through the empty church. We saw the sign for",

          "The church is empty and that is nice. Recently restored with lots of details on the job done. Nice installation with music this summer.",
          "Really amazing inside, the baroque style is quite different from the norm, this one is stark white walls and ceilings with gold paintings and statues in each corner. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Very sure this beautiful church reflected from a past golden years, during a kampung (village) of talented artist surrounded places, such as named: Mozart, Karajan, Dopller etc. No wonder birth of talented people from a sacred place.",
          "Managed to find this place just by walking around Salzburg just before grabbing dinner, and I was glad I decided to go in. It wasn't overly crowded with people when I went to check it out which was a plus because inside the architecture and design was breathtaking and beautiful.",
          "Happened to be in the square market and walked in. Beautiful but empty. If you happen to be in the square, peek in. Very nice.",
          "The Collegiate church in Salzburg was one of the favourite places we visited during our stay there. It is almost entirely white, inside & out, which gives it a cool beauty & made it an ideal venue for an exhibition of works by David Nash an artist who sculpts natural forms out",
          "A food market was set up outside on Saturday, which drew me to the square. I had not heard of the church and just took a look inside and was impressed by the imposing white walls, cool and quiet atmosphere (only a few tourists) and by the mix of baroque decorations and modern",
          "This church seems to be used more as a concert hall and gallery than a place for religious services. Once you step inside, you'll be surprised by the sheer size, starkness and indeed emptiness. Architecturally it's very impressive and the white washed walls and stone floors give",
          "Still under renovation but the parts that are finished are fantastic. Not only is the main alter beautiful but the side alters and alcoves are inspiring and compliment the main alter. Don't miss this treat.",
          "Glorious mixture of several styles of architecture in this beautiful church. Peaceful and light, it has an atmosphere of calm and beauty. Miss it at your peril.",
          "Sometimes less really is more. This baroque masterpiece is a real treasure. The white interior is deceptively simple - look closely and the work is intricate and detailed. Fabulously restored this is worth a detour to see cherubs in fluffy clouds that will take your breath away.",
          "The Kollegienkirche, located in the old town of Salzburg, the university church, ordered by Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun und Hohenstein. The 2 towers along the convex facade are facing east. They do not rush, but are filled with balustrades with allegorical figures, the 4",

          "Beautiful architecture, with serene interior. The figures and the decorations were breath taking. Everywhere I turned I saw some thing that needed a closer look. Salzburg has a lot of historical churches and it is great to be able to visit most of them in 3 days.",
          "This University church looks stunning with its clean brilliant white exterior. It has had a chequered history. In Napoleon's time in the city [1800] it was used as a hay store. In 1810 under Bavarian rule the University was closed thus the church was not needed.. In",
          "Worth a deliberate visit. It's imposing on the outside, but inside is cool, calm, peaceful. Unlike other churches in Salzburg, the decor is plain and elegant. The sense of awe was still easy to find.",
          "We explored several churches in Salzburg and they all had their own individual look and feel to them so I would recommend seeing a few of them for yourself. The Kollegienkirche is mostly painted white, which gives it a lovely clean and airy feel. I found it very peaceful and",

          "Went there after visiting mozart birth house. Looks majestic on the outside, elegant in the interior. Very impressive painting at the main high altar. This is one sacred place not to be missed",
          "This church has a white interior when I visited. May be it is going through refurbishing.There are no pews either. It has a simple altar. It has a high ceiling and marble patten flooring. It is located near the Universities. There are several stalls outside the church selling",
          "This is acording to me the best Church in Salzburg. But it is not the best Church I have seen, therefore the 4/5. But it is beutiful, and Everything inside is White. Just take a look for yourself. Sit down and have a moment of rest. It is also where Cold inside wich is great",
          "Brilliant architecture and very ornate icons within the Church. This is a lovely Church and was very impressive - definitely worth a look if you have five minutes to spare.",
          "Having visited many Baroque churches already, the simplicity and serenity of Salzburg's Kollegienkirche was a welcome surprise. I especially loved the front altar which seemed like a collection of white clouds.",
          "This church was not a part of my itinerary and I'm so glad I found this place while walking in the old town. It's so different from the other churches I've seen mainly due to it's beautiful white interior with gold elements.",
          "If you have time, the Kollegienkirche is worth visiting to see one of the most celebrated Baroque churches in Austria. Interesting to see the unique convex facade and the high altar with classical columns representing the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.",
          "While this definitely isn't as impressive as the Dom, it is a nice visit. The building has interesting architecture and is beautiful in its own right.",
          "A walk through the old town of Salzburg will be a perfect tour as you pass through many interesting buildings.",
          "It is a quite unusual church. When you get inside, your first thought might be you are not in a Catholic Church, as you see no decorations, no statues of Saints, nothing. It is so white that it really reminds you of a wedding cake. Huge tall white painted walls, and then 4",
          "There's always a couple of good sausage stands outside the church on weekdays, but one can buy fresh flowers and produce here on the weekends. I've been told the strawberries are worth every penny, and are the best. I can only personally attest to the sausages, which are a great",
          "It\u2019s a delicately elaborate Baroque church of Salzburg standing by the Universit\u00e4tsplatz which was built on the design of the architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. The church is dedicated to the Virgin (Unserer Lieben Frau) and is very impressive owing to the imposing",
          "This church is so amazing in it's semplicity. All white, no paintings but the plastering is wonderfully made. It really looks like angels lying on clouds. The altars are also all decorated in gold. Outside the church you will find a little square with a market, restaurant,",
          "After touring several of the churches in old town Salzburg, with dark interiors, particularly on a cloudy day, it was quite a shock to the senses to walk into the bright white interior of this church. It is spectacular and so white that sunglasses are almost required. This looks",
          "At Salzburg center a church you must visit. It's a WHITE interior with spectacular Gold decoration. You can feel the light.",
          "This was the first of many churches we visited and it is well worth a visit. The white marble everywhere is magnificent and the altar of gold and marble with its statuary is spectacular. As with all Salzburg's churches, it comprises one wow moment after another. The entrance and",
          "Walked her after visiting the nearby Mozart G/Haus. Worth the effort - wonderful clean Baroque lines, superb large paintings, an oasis of calm on a very hot day. A real find.",
          "Probably the best view to the facade is from the Mozartgebertshaus - it looks stunning, however when we later entered the church we did not find it as interesting as other old churches in the neighbourhood.",
          "The Collegiate Church is a great example of Baroque architecture. It's hard to miss and can be adequately toured in less than a half hour. They also have English services on Sundays.",
          "Beautiful Church and worth spending a few minutes inside. We visited as a family of 5 with 3 boys aged 8 to 16 and they were impressed with the artwork and architecture.",
          "Easy to tuck into quickly on the universitatplatz, on the backside of Mozart's birthplace and on the square that sells a lot of food. The church is one-of-a-kind. The main nave is all white. There is only colour on the side transcepts. Above the altar it is all white, 3d,",
          "The white colour of this church is unparalleled. It is different than much of the churches I see in Europe, yet it has a charm of its own. This stems from two things. The bright white colour as well as the cool air at its doors. In my opinion this church surpasses the Salzburg",
          "Very white and very stark and a nice change from the \"typical\" churches of region which can put you on sensory overload with all the colors and ornamentation. This was a nice departure from that style. It was a warm day and standing in the doorway with the cool air rushing",
          "Access to the church is via a little staircase on the Linzergasse. The church is a about halfway up the steps, then keep going to be rewarded with amazing views over Salzburg. You get s completely different point of view from the Monchsberg Rock and it is lovely and quiet.",
          "I stumbled upon this church while wandering the streets of Salzburg, so didn't know what to expect, but decided to explore inside. I'm so glad I did as it was different but absolutely beautiful. What hits you is the calmness, the coolness and whiteness. It is so bright and airy,",
          "A big change to compare with other chruches. No decorations, the whole church is simple white outside and inseide as well. We had a lovely Mozart concert with the Salburg Children Choir.",
          "The stark contrast of this simply beautiful church to the extremely ornate others makes this one really stand out from the crowd. Make a point to visit it and spend some time to soak it all into your consciousness.",
          "Up a quaint shopping alley not far from the Mozart Birthplace we came across this beautiful church. Not well highlighted in the things to do when in Salzburg, but certainly a place to visit. Unfortunately we were on a guided tour and it was not much more than a quick look",
          "The starkness of the all white interior will almost blind you , but it is beautiful. It is undergoing some serious restoration in many stages . All displayed on stands near the entrance with progressive reports and photos. Its a classic baroque church without all the gold and",
          "The interior is comparatively simple, but the \"whiteness\" alone makes it a very nice church. It kinda conveys a sense of purity. At the time I was there they exhibited some pictures by Susan Swartz in it and while I like the idea, the paintings seemed rather pointless and",
          "When we went to visit Salzburg we happened to stumble upon this church walking to the Fortress. Nobody was inside when we opened the door and we were very surprised. Beautiful white huge church with paintings along the side. I definitely recommend stopping by and looking around"

        "wiki": "Residenzplatz is a large, stately square in the historic centre of Salzburg in Austria. Named after the Residenz building of the Prince-Archbishops of Salzburg, adjacent to Salzburg Cathedral, it is one of the city's most popular places to visit.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe Residenzplatz is located in the historic centre (Altstadt) of Salzburg, enclosed by Salzburg Cathedral (Salzburger Dom) in the south and the Alte Residenz in the west. To the east is the Neue Residenz (New Residence), a Renaissance building erected from 1588 onwards, with its prominent bell tower. The adjacent Mozartplatz leads to Salzburg Museum. \nSeveral historic private houses (B\u00fcrgerh\u00e4user) frame the square to the north, among them the temporary home of the Baroque painter Johann Michael Rottmayr at No. 2, where he stayed while creating the ceiling frescoes in the Alte Residenz around 1690.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Residenzplatz was laid out from 1587 onwards at the behest of Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau, after he ordered to abandon the cemetery of the former monastery north of Salzburg Cathedral. Remnants of the medieval cemetery were recently discovered underneath the square's surface. Raitenau also had a large number of private houses demolished to provide space. Then called Hauptplatz (\"Main Square\"), the new public plaza corresponded with the reconstruction of Salzburg Cathedral, according to plans laid out by the Italian architect Vincenzo Scamozzi.\nCurrently, the square is about to be refurbished, including a new paving and a monument commemorating a Nazi book burning conducted at the site on 30 April 1938.\n\n\n== Fountain ==\n\nThe Residenzbrunnen in the centre of the square was designed by Tommaso di Garona and erected between 1656 to 1661. The upper basin is topped by a Triton statue ejecting the waters upwards. Made of Untersberg limestone (Untersberger Marmor), it is considered the largest Baroque fountain in Central Europe. \n\n\n== Periodical events ==\nOpen air cinema: Every summer in July and August the square is transformed into an open air cinema. Typically, taped performances of the Salzburg Festival are shown\nAnnual kermesse (Kirtag) celebrating the feast of Saint Rupert on September 24\nSalzburg Christmas market during Advent.In the 1980s and 1990s, several rock concerts by Joe Cocker, Tina Turner, Neil Young, and others were held on Residenzplatz.\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "Housed in the Neuen Residenz (to which it moved in 2005), the Salzburg Museum is the museum of artistic and cultural history for the city and region of Salzburg, Austria. It originated as the Provincialmuseum and was also previously known as the Museum Carolino-Augusteum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe Salzburg Museum was founded in 1834, when a small collection of military memorabilia was made accessible to the public to formalize the memories of the Napoleonic wars. After the Revolution of 1848, the collection became the official town museum of Salzburg.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1924, the natural history objects of the museum were given to the Haus der Natur Salzburg. One year later, the folk culture collection opened a side-branch in the Monatsschl\u00f6ssl in the parks of Hellbrunn Palace.\nDuring World War II, the museum got three direct hits from bombs. Most of the collection had already been moved to mines that served as bunkers; however, the building was completely destroyed along with many objects too large to move. Several objects disappeared from their bunkers during the US occupation, including a collection of gold coins that had been kept in the salt mines of Hallein. A new building was opened as a provisory museum in 1967. A debate about the final and most worthy location for the headquarters of the Salzburg Museum lasted for decades. Side-branches of the Salzburg Museum were opened during this time: The Domgrabungsmuseum in 1974, the Spielzeugmuseum (Toy Museum) in 1978, and a newly developed Festungsmuseum (Fortress Museum) in 2000. By 1997, promoted by Landeshauptmann Franz Schausberger, local politicians had finally agreed on the Neue Residenz as a new venue for the Salzburg Museum.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe museum reopened in the Neue Residenz in 2005. In 2009, the museum received the European Museum of the Year Award.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nFurniture from the Anif Palace\nMohr arrangement (ca. 1820) of Silent Night\nThe earliest ever example of a bass clarinet\nOriginal manuscript of the Missa Salisburgensis \u00e0 53 voci\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nViva!

          "We have 4 & 6yr old boys, they loved the museum and would have spent a whole day, splaying with very simple things like marbles and the race cars. The staff are very helpful and friendly and they have free tea and water for everyone. Highly recommended, makes you realise kids",
          "We went here with our two kids because it was included on the Salzburg card. This is more of a play centre with a poor selection of toys for the children to play with, than a museum. It can get very crowded so your kids will probably not get near anything. There are three floors",
          "This Museum is included on Salzburg Card. This is kids favorite spot in Salzburg! There are so much hands on and fun things to do. The marble run, slides, train set are to name a few.",
          "very interested for children, they saw a lot of toys, tried a slide, played with some toys too. they didn\u00b4t want to go away",
          "If you compare to similar museums in Prague or Istanbul, you will be definitely disappointed. Very less variety of toys. Better you ignore this spot.",
          "I saw mixed reviews before going to this museum. If you're a toy collector - this isn't for you. If you actually want to take children it is superb. Very hands on, loads to play with superb exhibitions - the historic toys are shown in context with current toys that the children",
          "This is a good place to spend a couple of hours with the kids. Its well hidden as the entrance is through an archway and a courtyard, and the signposting could have been better. The building work going on the that time in the courtyard also did not help i guessOnce there",
          "Having two small children, we hit up the children's museums in basically any city we visit. And I have to say that this is by far one of the best. Multiple floors full of both historical and hands-on exhibitions, a sweet little reading nook built into the stone walls, and plenty",
          "This is ideal for children and beutiful collection of varieties of toys.The woodworks,trains and other artwork is enjoyable and photographic.Kids can play with some toys also.So,overall its for kids and near to hop on bus stop and central area.You can spend some passtime if you",
          "Verry interesting for the little children and it gives you verry beautiful memories for the adult of their childhood",
          "This museum feels fresh and encourages creative play. Historic toys are displayed in modern ways to aid in the feeling of discovering old treasures. we stopped here midway through a head day of sightseeing and it was just the break we needed. Especially great we're the nooks",
          "The museum is included in the Salzburg card. The museum has a great collection of toys from different decades and offers play areas as well. Regardless of age everyone is bound to spot something familiar from their days of youth. North American guests may find some toys",
          "Historic toys displayed safely in eye-level treasure boxes, paired with a huge collection of toys kids could discover on their own and play with for long stretches. It was clean, because all were required to remove their street shoes upon entering. Very thoughtfully",

          "Great place for kids and their parents. A lot of different toys they can play with (for different age). It's also very informative for the kids 7 years and up. They have very nice area with wooden toys, different kinds of trees with description and etc. Actually, you can spend",
          "We wondered why we were asked to put plastic coverings over our shoes. The answer is that they must have though we as a retired couple were going to be climbing all over the play area. This is not a toy museum but for a few dolls and trains but a play area for children. As a",
          "If your going to Salzburg with young children this is a must. Also good if you want o keep out of the sun over lunchtime. It is set over 3 floors and you have a good range of things. Marble runs, books, cinema, train sets including a DIY brio set. There are also wooden blocks",

          "If you see the fortress, admission to the toy museum is included, but we could not find the entrance despite the several signs showing where not to enter. We wandered around the building only to find that it was closed on Sundays.",
          "This is really designed for children. Things you can touch and play with. Very hands on! Exhibits at kids' eye level. Nonetheless, I had a great time myself. I wish the gift shop had more interesting offerings, as the tiny dollhouses and the stuffed animals and the train",
          "On arrival, the receptionist kindly told us that this museum is now an interactive museum for children so we didn't bother stopping. On our last visit a few years ago it had displays of old toys and also of old musical instruments, all long since gone apparently, although the",
          "First time entering a museum using a pair of plastic to cover our shoes, which is sort of a brilliant idea to keep the place clean. The museum itself is not too big so we can finish to look around within few minutes",
          "This place is really about the children. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I was personally a little disappointed. There were quite a few rooms out of use and there was a rather grandly named Amazement Room, which we clearly never got to as I don't remember being amazed!",
          "We went to the museum but we realized our daughter who is 14 is a bit old for that one. Still we did enjoy the exhibits.",

          "Easy to find if you have a map. Free with the Salzburg Card. Interesting to see all the old toys, and there are TONNES of interactive games - There's a slide, an over-sized game of Shut The Box, games set up in nooks and crannies, and more! A must when travelling with kids (or",
          "We found it pretty busy and racous on a rainy Sunday. Lots of small children running around. Some interesting hands on activities like creating shadows, train set, build a pathway for marbles... but manic! On display were model trains, board games, doll houses. We found most",
          "We took our kids to the Toy Museum on our third day in Salzburg. They had a great time playing in the hands-on area - even our toddler was occupied for about 2 hours. It was a nice break for us and re-charged everyone's batteries enough to enjoy our last day and a half there.",
          "Our kids were thrilled to have a morning in which they could do something on their own during our vacation. There is a marble track, bosch building center, brio trains, and more. As parents we also had some much needed down time in our travels. It is not far from the main",
          "We spent about 3 hours looking for this toy museum (including a 20 minute taxi ride that dropped us off close to the fortress in the mountains!?). Nobody had ever heard of it nor could they give us directions! You need to find out exactly where this is before you try and go",

          "My friends and I went here with our families--a 2 yr old, 3 yr old, 5 yr old and 2 6 yr olds, and four adults. All nine of us had a sensational time--it was all hands on (a children's museum, for those from the US) and all of the toys were super cool and wooden and unique. We",

          "I was expecting more of an actual toy museum, in which old toys were on display, etc. This is a very 'modern' looking building, in which there is about one item in each room, no real exhibits or anything like that. There is small section displaying a few toys from China, but",
          "This place was so interactive! When you enter it makes you change your shoes in crocs for fun. When you enter there are little cubbies everywhere and it is so cute. There is a giant wooden slide and a huge rocking chair. So interactive, brings out the inner child in everyone!",
          "I was expecting to see a history of toys and toy-making, such as why teddy bears became so popular, or a chronology of dolls and doll-making. Instead it was a seies of panoramas of doll house, some oriental dolls and sundry areas for children to play. This was a glorified",

They include two chapels: The Maximuskapelle and the Gertraudenkapelle, consecrated in 1178 under the Salzburg Archbishop Conrad of Wittelsbach and dedicated to the assassinated Archbishop Thomas Becket of Canterbury.\nA second chapel, The Margarethenkapelle (Margaret Chapel), (re-)built in 1491, occupies a site in the center of the cemetery.\n\n\n== Notable burials ==\n\nSantino Solari, architect (1646)\nHeinrich Ignaz Franz Biber, composer (1704)\nJohann Christian Paurnfeind, Salzburg mayor (1768)\nSigmund Haffner, Salzburg mayor (1772)\nIgnatz Anton von Weiser, Mozart librettist (1785)\nWolfgang Hagenauer, architect (1801)\nMichael Haydn, composer, younger brother of Joseph Haydn (1806)\nMaria Anna Mozart (Nannerl), elder sister of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1829)\nJohann Georg von Hagenauer, architect, younger brother of Wolfgang Hagenauer, (1835)\nHeinrich Ritter von Mertens, Salzburg mayor (1872)\nGeorg Pezolt, painter (1878)\nRichard Mayr, opera singer (1935)\nCarl Mayr, artist, elder brother of Richard Mayr (1942)\nOtto Pflanzl, poet (1943)\nFranz Martin, historian (1950)\nRichard Hildmann, Salzburg mayor (1952)\nHarry J.

          "Cemeteries are often one of the most peaceful places to visit; as a tourist -I love them. Many of the larger ones can be crowded like Vienna Central because of so many famous people but for me they are calming. Often you will fine wonderful art like the beautiful metalwork",
          "After reading all the positive reviews we decided to have a look at this cemetery. I didn't found it very quiet, as most people wrote, due to the many tourists, but I think it's worth the visit if you are around the area anyways. One thing I really enjoyed was the catacombs.",
          "We visited this small and well-kept cemetery with graves from the 18th century on our trip in Salzburg. The cemetery is located in the middle of the city center nearby the St. Peters church. The graves are usually finished with colorful flower beds and is really worth a moment",
          "I wanted to visit this because I'd read that it was the inspiration for the graveyard scene at the end of the South of Music. But it's so much more than that. Beautiful, with lots of flowers. We were fascinated with the black iron monuments--we'd never seen anything like that",
          "Very pretty cemetery well worth a walk around, easy to miss the entrance - although there are two. Easiest way is to walk as if you are going to the funicular railway to the Fortress the black gates are on the right on a left hand bend up a slope. We didn't do the catacomb's",
          "We learned of this cemetery while watching RIck Steves' video on Salzburg. We are so glad we stopped by! Very easy to find. If you are in the main square area, anyone around will be able to direct you. This well-tended cemetery has an interesting story. Families of loved",
          "As much as a graveyard can be interesting ... very careful, ornate. It has a chapel, simple in decoration, but with a lot of symbolism.",
          "Worth the time to at least walk through the beautiful grounds. The catacombs are very interesting as well. Located in Old Town Salzburg.",
          "Located near the funicular station, at the foot of the Festungsberg Hill, is an ancient cemetery. I do not mean to be disrespectful but this cemetery is beautiful. What I though was a quiet garden turned out to be an attractive cemetery dotted with flowers and greenery. Carved",
          "This was our third visit to Salzburg, and again we had to go to this cemetery, which is so picturesque. Not as colourful this time, due to us being there later in the year, but still lovely. All the graves are neat and tidy and the decorations are lovely. Quiet and tranquil spot",
          "After we stumbled onto a fantastic lunch spot, we stumbled on this beautiful cemetery and chapel. The colors in the flower and the layout of the cemetery was unlike anything I had experienced. You can pay to go to the catacombs, we opted not to.",
          "A quite Cemetery covered in beautiful art work and flowers, hidden just of the busy main tourist streets of Salzburg. With the Salzburg City Card you can also visit the adjacent Catacombs that are included with the card purchase. a must visit spot while in Salzburg.",
          "Beautiful cemetery and very quiet as we visited late afternoon. Suspect it can get very busy as right next to St Peters. Highly decorated in a way that is quite unusual and with some areas being quite new and others centuries old. Two entrances one by St Peters and one on the",
          "Peace and tranquillity in the old town. Small central chapel surrounded by cemetery gardens, full of history as well as recent memorials.",
          "The gravestones and their decorations are beautiful. A MUST visit. The catacombs were also interesting.",
          "Amazing, beautiful, historic and fascinating. Very hard to find and the store keepers nearby had zero idea what I was talking about when I stopped to ask directions. They call it by another name. Worth the trouble it took to find it. Very unique. Don't miss this!!!",
          "My daughter wanted to see this because of the Mozart connection, so we stopped in. I thought we'd just quickly breeze through, but it was so beautiful and there was so much history, we ended up staying quite a while. Generation after generation of families memorialized together",
          "Fascinating stroll through this section of Salzberg. Gardens and memorials + catacombs (we did not go inside .due to lack of time). One of the jewels of Salzburg.",
          "The small Petersfriedhof cemetery is located between the M\u00f6nchsberg's vertical wall and the city behind the church of St. Peter, on the way to the entrance to the Fortezza funicular. It is a corner of extraordinary charm, especially in the summer, with multicolored flowers and",
          "This historic old graveyard in the middle of the city center in Saulsburg is a must see. It\u2019s filled with all sorts of historic monuments and is one of the sites where the sound of music was filmed. You\u2019ll remember the garden where the Tripp family hid from the Nazis as they",
          "Visited this on our way back from the Salzburg fortress. You just cant miss it! Such a beautifully landscaped St. Peter'scemetry. Weather was super and the garden was full of blooms! Catacombs are also located here.",
          "A nice place to go into to get out of the city life for a bit. Small lovely garden and cemetery located at the foot of the funicular..",
          "The most beautiful cemetery I will probably ever see in my lifetime. If I could have stayed in Salzburg for a year I don't think I could see everything to see there. I certainly wouldn't ever get tired of looking at it all.",
          "Our guide pointed this little gem out to us as it formed the idea for the \u201chiding cemetery\u201d in the film Sound of Music. It is tucked away and entry by a quiet gate but it is such a beautifully kept cemetery in the Austrian tradition. Well worth a visit.",
          "The Cemetery dates pre-700AD and is in fact older than the Abbey. By far the prettiest Cemetery I've ever seen, it is so peaceful wandering around.",
          "At the foot of the funicular to the Fortress, you will find this hidden gem. It is probably the most beautiful cemetary I\u2019ve seen across the world. Situated as it is at the foot of the fortress and adjacent to St. Peter\u2019s it makes for a beautiful and moving respite when power",
          "one of the oldest Cemeterys in Salzburg... take some time to wander around and maybe you're lucky and the bakery is open (you will smell it if it's open :-) so you can grab some realy good fresh bread or a little brioche",
          "Beautiful cemetry, quiet to the end where you can feel your soul.. leave the noise of the world behind, come sit here and feel the depth",
          "We visited this quaint cemetery on one of our tours around Salzburg. Since we were there in May, the flowers were in bloom and it was beautiful. It is located on the side of a hill, so the walkways were up and down and all around. We did not visit the catacombs, but the cemetery",
          "As likely one of the oldest cemeteries it was delightful to stroll around its quiet beauty and serenity. The terrific blue sky summer evening added to the experience. Dating back to ancient times around 700 it was established in conjunction with St. Peter's Abbey. It was",
          "We took a few minutes during a snack break from Fraulein Maria's Bicycle Tour to stick our heads into the cemetery--it was cool in both senses: The green space was a nice break on a hot day and wow--what a neat graveyard! If you just want to pause for a few minutes, it's a free,",
          "While it is free to visit the cemetery itself, I would not recommend spending the 2 Euros to walk up the catacombs. There is literally nothing to see but empty holes or rooms carved into the side of the mountain. Apparently, if you have the Salzburg Card, this is free.",
          "This beautiful, well-tended cemetery at the base of a sheer cliff is a must see. The space is quiet and restful, just off the Kapitelplatz, but feels worlds away. The flowers are lovely, and the small fountain (where relatives can get water to tend to the flowers on the graves)",
          "Admission is free. This is the oldest known Christian Cemetery in Austria. It is lined with family crypts, each one protected by iron gates. There is a small charge for the catacombs (\u20ac2 or free with SalzburgCard) which date back to 15AD. These can only be accessed via narrow",
          "One enterance to this cemetery is near the incline for the Salzburg castle. we happened to see people leaving through an iron gate and stuck our heads inside. The small church and the cemetary is simply amazing. its worth a 10-20 min stroll through if you visit Salzburg",
          "We loved it here. Nice gardens and lovely picturesque grave yards. Well kept. Stunning so a must see.",
          "It's a beautiful cemetery - like a flower garden even. All the burial plots are decorated with plants - flowering or not. A lot of them have very decorative place markers - mostly iron works. It is well worth a visit. The cemetery gets quite a few visitors. This does take away",
          "If (IF) I ever die, I want to be buried in Austria. Each tombstone in this graveyard was more elaborate than the next; everything was so beautiful and well-maintained, and it was hard to maintain an air of solemnity when every five seconds I wanted to tug on my wife's sleeve and",
          "One of the few free attractions to visit in Salzburg. Most beautiful cemetery I have ever seen. Well worth a stroll around. The sound of music scene near the end is actually shot in a studio copy of this place but still interesting to see.",
          "The reviews given earlier are right. It is beautiful even though it\u2019s a graveyard. Be respectful as I found it amusing that some people were all too excited to take their pictures here. Respect the place as it is n you will enjoy it more. Not every place is for selfies.",
          "Considering it's a grave yard you wouldn't expect it to be this colourful, but it's a joy walking among the beautifully decorated graves with all the flowers.",
          "It is hard to say this is a do-not-miss location but it is. The grounds are so well maintained and they are absolutely beautiful. The cemetery is very different than what we envision or see in the US. As we wandered through we felt wonder and serenity at the same time. Some will",
          "not usually my cup of tea - but really enjoyed wandering through this peaceful beautiful and interesting cemetery - maybe it was the stark contrast it offered to the garish riches and hypocrisy of the Abbey I had just exited with gold and riches at every turn only outnumbered",
          "This was a little gem we found in Salzburg... If it's a very interesting, beautiful and very well maintained cemetery which is very easy to access and well worth a visit!",
          "It feels strange to recommend a cemetery for tourists, but this is honestly the most beautiful and breathtaking church yard that I've ever seen. It's tucked back in a corner, and hugs the natural hills of the environment. It had old graves along with family plots where you can",
          "Don't know how you've stumbled on this review but well done and when you go to Salzburg make sure you visit. It's just below the funicular, has free entry but charges 2 euros to visit the catacombs set in the hillside. The graves are treated with magnificent respect, well tended",
          "More than one friend had made me promise that I would put this cemetery on mymust-see list. Each one waxed rhapsodically about how \"you could just see Maria von Trapp huddling in the shadows hiding from the Nazis.\" This is all true, and would have been enough. Even so, I",
          "Marvellous place for a stroll and do check out the catacombs, the mill, the stony mountains and the breweries around.",
          "A very clean and well kept area. It is very pleasant to walk around here, even though it is a cemetery. Gives a peaceful feeling and a break from the outisde busy touristy area.",
          "This gorgeous little cemetery dates back to 700 when St Peters Abbey was established. The oldest grave stone is marked 1288. The catacombs are at the back. Dont miss popping into the tiny St Margaret's Chapel built in 1491 the grounds of the cemetery. Fascinating, lovely place.",
          "A fascinating place with one of the oldest cemeteries in Austria still in use. And also the place where the von Trapp family hid from the Nazis in the Sound of Music.",
          "Beautiful, well-kept grounds. Stunning place for remembering your loved ones. I would definitely recommend talking a walk/look around when you are in the area.",
          "I've been back to this cemetery twice now, and both times I have felt an overwhelming feeling of peace while here. For some reason, I feel drawn to this beautiful place. Well worth the visit (it only takes about 20 minutes to walk through and reflect.)",
          "This is a gorgeous, historic and peaceful cemetery. The grave stones are very elaborate and there is a lot of greenery.",
          "We went to have a look at this. It's clear that this is a place where there is a great deal of care about those who are no longer with us. A good place to wander around and reflect and very different to what one would see in North America. Highly ornate and decorative. Also",
          "Definitely my favourite spot in Salzburg, even though this might sound strange. But it's very peaceful here and you feel like you can always escape from the madness of the main square right next to it. It also has a lot of history, and among other famous people Mozart's sister",
          "This is a beautiful photo spot - a small and well-maintained cemetery set against the backdrop of the Salzburg Fortress. Do not miss if you're a photographer.",
          "this is a beautiful cemetery. i have gone to another austrian cemetery also. the thing that they have in common is that the austrians seem to care deeply about their loved ones even though they are no longer on earth. the graves are elaborate and well tended. flowers,",
          "My 13-year old really liked walking through this cemetery. It is unlike U.S. cemeteries and we have seen the Sound of Music, so it is fun to see it how it really is. We were there during the rain, but it still had many guests wandering through it.",
          "A beautiful cemetary - lovingly tended. Explore the stones and markers. A worthy quiet time away from the hustle and bustle of being a tourist.",
          "This was an old cemetery located near the oldest mill/bakery and monastery. A special place to wander through quietly as still being used today.",
          "Respect the dead. Gorgeous cemetery. The family and loved ones take good care of each tombstone. Beautiful arrangements. Stop here before or after you go to the fortress.",
          "This is a beautiful cemetery tucked away. Our tour guide pointed it out, so we decided to go into the cemetery and we're so glad that we did.",
          "Wonderful, beautiful cemetery situated right behind the church, a short walk and then a well kept garden type atmosphere. Great photo opportunity, lots of old grave stones, wrought iron gates. It is well worth your time to visit.",
          "This is a truly unique cemetery and an unexpected experience. Tucked behind the church, this compact cemetery is dripping with history. Very quiet and peaceful...and a wonderful spot for photography lovers. Make sure to spend the 2 euros and check out the catacombs. The views",
          "A little far in and hidden but do lookout for it as it's the loveliest cemetery ever unlike those that gives off the creeps feel",
          "The most beautiful cemetery I\u2019ve visited. The catacombs are also worth visiting which have a great view as well. Free entry to the abbey grounds, and the Salzburg welcome card will get you into the catacombs.",
          "A lovely spot to visit, it's behind the church. The gated graves were the inspiration for the cemetery scene in The Sound of Music. You can pay 2 Euro and walk up the old steps to the catacombs, but all you'll see are indentations carved out of the rock walls.",
          "This attraction is a bit hidden, but worth a visit. The cemetary is beautiful. You can go into the catacombs which are actually up the side of the mountain, underneath the fortress. There is a platform there with beautiful views. It's only 2 euros and takes 10 minutes, but",
          "The cemetery is adjacent to St Peter's Church, also known as the catacombs, from which you reached the fortress, tombstones with sculptures and metal development, wonderful gardening, a place of peace",
          "Call me strange, but I actually appreciate the serenity of places like this, just like the magnificent Brompton Cemetery in London. The peace and quiet is only disturbed by respectful visitors coming to witness the past. There was never a feeling of dread or fear. Each patch of",
          "This is a peaceful cemetery, and feeld like a beautiful garden. The stones should remind Americans of the Sound of Music. Out guide told us is a place where the deceased remain just 40 years, and are then moved, allowing others to take their place. That seems so practical ...",
          "Extremely romantic cemetery beside St Peter abbey. Beautiful old graves , impressive mausoleums and sculptures are surrounded by rocks on one side and city walls on another. And don't forget to visit catacombs and Mozart sisters grave.",
          "It's strange thinking of a cemetery as a site you'd recommend some visit, but it truly is beautiful and worth a visit.",
          "If you\u2019re a Sound of Music fan then make sure you check out this place. We almost walked past it but noticed the hoards of people so we went and checked it out. It\u2019s really beautiful and served as the inspiration for the scenes with the gates tombs in the film (although it",
          "not a bad place to spend eternity except for the fact that you don't get to enjoy the views. really nice cemetery as far as beauty - the views from here are amazing - the huge rock face with the windows built into it - very cool.",
          "If a cemetery can be described as beautiful then this one is. The layout is great and the graves are all so different and well cared for. There are also large family plots behind railings - this area was the inspiration for one of the final scenes in the film The Sound of Music",
          "Very interesting and informative walk of what the customs were in the old days to bury the people. In the same walk you can pay a couple euros and go up to a couple other plots that are higher up on the wall of the hill. Do not miss it.",
          "This is a beautiful cemetery, but its also a good site for Sound of Music fans. No, the filming didn't take place here, but it was the inspiration for the gated tombs in the escape scene.",
          "This is an interesting place to visit to break up all the castles and churches and museums you may be visiting on your trip. It was just at the bottom of the funicular which takes you to the top of the fort. We only went in as we stumbled upon it on our walk back into town, but",
          "Situatedd besdie the Stiftskirche St Peter, it is worth taking a few minutes to pass through the cemetery which is apparently thee oldest in Austria. Having a wheelchair user with us meant we could not access the catacombs.",
          "Probably not a place to take your kids, but quiet adults will relish the beauty of the grounds next to St Peters. Take a tour through the carved catacombs up in the walls. Very Cool!",
          "A corner in Old Town sandwiched by the funicular, the cliff, the cathedral and St Peters Church. A very old cemetery but well maintained and still \"in use\" judging by recent dates on the stones. There is also a very old but interesting chapel on the grounds which contained an",
          "The cemetery plots ARE unique.....well maintained......and above ground. The greenery around the area is lovely also. And the metal decorations around the catacombs are whimsical and delightful.",
          "This cemetery is a must see if you are in Salzburg. It will be very familiar to fans of The Sound of Music, however, it was only an inspiration for the film and no filming was done here. Look closely and you'll see the grave of an American General who loved Salzburg so much he",
          "This was our family's favorite place. The catacombs are built up instead of descending below grade. The cemetary plots are unique and well-maintained. It was a calming place after being on the high fortress. To a degree we stumbled upon it as the entrance was a bit non-descript",
          "this is very off the beaten track, we stumbled upon it by accident. this cemetry, Saint Peter\u2019s was actually the inspiration for the cemetery the Von Trapps used to hide from the Nazis :)",
          "Located next to the funicular station to the fortress. Maybe you can visit while coming back from the fortress. Entry is free",
          "We didn't do a tour. Just meandered through this quiet, spiritual, old cemetery. It's really charming and there are historic cells dug into the cliffs on the side of the mountain. This gem sits below the funicular going up to the castle overlooking the city. Easy site to",
          "This is a true example of the beauty and care of European cemeteries. It's very peaceful to walk around and view everything which is so well maintained and cared for. The cemetery is also right under the fortress which adds to the beauty of the location.",
          "This is a really beautiful cemetery; lush with greens and it doesn't feel like you're intruding. It's well maintained and near all the tourist attractions so it's hard to miss. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth checking out as you walk through Salzburg.",
          "We were taking two friends on a tour of places that we have enjoyed over the years. We first discovered the cemetery on Christmas Eve 1996. The tradition is to bring food to your loved ones grave. On this occasion we explored the onsite chapel and roamed the grounds. The",
          "When walking towards the railway up to the fortress, hang a right and you will come to the very beautiful and very old cemetery. It is very well looked after and you can spend hours in here. I know it sounds strange looking at tombstones and tombs, but it is very interesting.",
          "I only came in here because I accidentally took the right passage instead of the left when heading to the Festungbahn, but I'm glad I did. There is a variety of gravestones, often ornate metal ones, and they are often covered in plants and moss (although well cared for). All",
          "This is a small beautiful cemetery located in the old town of Salzburg. The light in the late afternoon is just wonderful.",
          "Behind St. Peter's Cathedral is an old cemetery, nicely decorated and well kept with trees and flowers. This is one of the oldest gothic building in Salzburg and worth to see.",
          "Right next to the fortress, this cemetery is really very beautiful. For Sound of Music fans, this is where the von Trapp family were seen to be hiding from the Nazis in the film.",
          "If you go to the Fortress, when you get out of the funicular turn the corner and an entrance to the cemetery is right there. This is a beautiful old cemetery with unusual grave markers. There is also a crypt you can visit in the cemetery grounds but check the times. We arrived",
          "This is by far one of the most beautiful and old cemetery's I have seen. It is well worth a visit. You can pay a fee to enter the ancient caves. There are steep steps that were slippery on the day of our visit...be sure to get the brochure at the entrance for a full detailed",
          "If you are a Sound of Music fan you cannot miss it. Graveyards are probably not the most interesting tourist attractions but Petersfriedhof is quite beautiful in a solemn way that is hard to find today. Go there quietly and peacefully.",
          "I'm generally not fond of cemeteries but this one right behind the most wonderful abbey church was so totally dignified and peaceful lacking any pomp and elaborate grave sites which is usually attributed to the graves of leading citizens and dignitaries.",
          "Can access through the Platz. Near the tram for the Fortress. Great stop for the SOM fans. Very peaceful.",
          "Lovely spot, visit early late or in the rain to avoid crowds. You'll find the catacombs here and the grave of Haydn and Mozarts sister (in the entrance to the catacombs).",
          "I walked into the cemetery by accident but I just loved it. It's beautiful and peaceful inside. All the tombs were nicely decorated with lovely plants and flowers. People visiting the cemetery were quiet and respectful too. Thought I did not visit here intentionally, I did have",
          "A very beautiful and peaceful cemetery that was pointed by our guide as the best thing we'll see that day and it turned out to be so true.",
          "The cemetery is a peaceful place. My friend was buying some souvenirs at a fair outside and i walked into this gate and the cemetery was there. For the sound of music fan, this is where Captain Von Trapp hide from the Nazi before climbing the mountains to Switzerland. The actual",
          "I do not usually visit cemeteries. I went here after touring the catacombs. All of the who's who from Salzburg are interred here which gives an interesting historical perspective. Rather than simply headstones there are an array of apartments for the dead.",
          "... and apparently the well-heeled gentry in Salzburg. It was more interesting to stumble across this place (close to the base of Kapuzinerberg) rather than planning a visit there.",
          "It was interesting to see the iron tombs. I've never seen them before, so it was gripping to notice how some christian cultures do it differently than what I'm used to see (simple or elaborate headstones). There is a small chapel which was lovely but reeked of humidity. I",
          "The Petersfriedhof is, together with the burial site at Nonnberg Abbey, the oldest cemetery in the Austrian city of Salzburg, located at the foot of the Festungsberg with Hohensalzburg Castle. It is one of Salzburg's most popular tourist attractions.",
          "I can not say enough words to describe how beautiful and peaceful this cemetery is within a busy and noisy Salzburg. For the Sound of Music fans, this place is one of the scenes in the movie. The cemetery is lovingly maintained like all in Europe but this is one of the better",
          "it is a very nice looking cemetary located close to the funicular for the Hohensalzburg fortress. They catacombs also speak of the history of the place. The place has the tombs of the 7 wives of the king. It is quite convenient in the location",
          "It is a very well kept cemetary and located close to the funicular that goes to the fortress. There are a lot of very old head markers that were interesting to read. Find the seven wives of the king! The catacombs that are located in the hill are interesting as well when you",
          "It's funny how people are drawn to graveyards. We stumbled across this by chance after seeing the waterwheel next door.. what a peaceful place and to see such well kept decorative graves, covered in snow, was a pleasure. We also went up the cliff to the Catacombs which, once you",
          "There are so many beautiful grave markers and statues here. I go to graveyards everywhere because I believe to really get a perspective on a place. This one is no different. This is so peaceful and is not far from the major tourist areas so everyone can at least pass through it.",
          "The graveyard is very beautiful with old statues and decorative wrigtings on them. Entrance is free and is located near the funicular that goes up to Hohensalzburg fortress. Make sure to visit catacombs which can be entered through the graveyard (entrance is only 2 euros).",
          "Beautiful grounds and well kept crypts and graves. Inscriptions were very interesting to read. So beautiful and historic to walk around.",
          "One of the most serene cemeteries I've visited. I make it a must stop every time I get to Salzburg. Take the time to stroll the grounds and read the stones and markers. Such history, and stories!",
          "Nice, peaceful atmosphere, nice place to take a relaxing walk (disclaimer - I like cemeteries). Not the most impressionable cemetery I've visited, but it's worth deviating your path here. It's a green little oasis in all the stone architecture of the Old Town (probably better",
          "The most amazing cemetery I ve ever been to. So peacefull, full of autumn flowers, candles. Enter to the Catacombes you must pay, but save your money. It is not worth it- only for the view.",
          "We were looking for a shortcut to the Stiftskeller restaurant having just come down from the fortress and stumbled on the rear gate to Petersfriedhof. We were simply awestruck at the beauty of this final resting place. It is obviously painstakingly cared for by those whose loved",
          "This graveyard, associated with St. Peter's Abbey, is quite beautiful. According to some sources, it likely dates back to about 700.",
          "A cemetary might not be tops on your normal tourist list, but this is a lovely spot, with touching, beautifully maintained memorials to people's loved ones. A quiet spot for reflection.",
          "We had a somber but very peaceful visit to this cemetery, the oldest in Salzburg. The catacombs are also located in this beautiful cemetery, chiseled into the base of the fortress. We were content just visiting this burial place of many famous native sons and daughters. We did",
          "lovely cemetery with flowers and candles all over and a short dark walk up to the catacombs ...almost halfway up to the fortress.",
          "This cemetery gives a real insight into burial customs in the area and the well-tended graves display some beautiful wrought ironwork. The catacombs are worth seeing, too, and musicians should pause at their entrance to see the slab covering the communal grave where Michael",
          "I walked up to the fortress and the back down through this cemetery. Unlike any cemetery I've seen before so worth a quick squiz",
          "when I entered this site I didn't know what to expect, it can be a little scary and creepy but at the same is really beautiful and has a different aura to it. A place for silence and to give in to your own thoughts.",
          "The cemetery is a thoughtful site. When you stroll here, and gaze at the grave sites with its inscriptions and pictures, you cannot help but wonder what type of person, and lives were led by those that are interned there. It is very contemplative. There are a couple of surprises",
          "The cemetery at St Peter's is well worth a visit if you are in Salzburg, and I would definitely recommend taking an hour or two to explore it. The graveyard itself is well manicured and lovingly kept, and it is very peaceful. I always find it interesting wandering around a",
          "The cemetery at St. Peter's is probably the most beautiful I have ever seen. It was truly amazing. Also, pay the few euros it costs to see the catacombs. The chapels date back to the year 400.",

          "Don't miss the catacombs. Small cost, worth it but a bit of stairs to get to it. Gives an interesting insight to the caves in the stone wall of the fortress. Also makes sense of the windows in that wall that you can see from below. Make sure you get a pamphlet that explains",
          "My mom loves cemetraies and this definitly one she would love. It is small, old, and well taken care of.",
          "Went to visit after coming out of St. Sebastian church. A sacred place with many famous sons of Salburg laid o rest here. Many members of the Mozart family are also buried here. A quite place, evokes fond memories of loved ones when one visits.",

          "Try to stop in to the St. Peter's Cemetery - the entrance is right by the St. Peter Restaurant entrance. Guides are prohibited from taking groups into the cemetery but he encouraged us to stop by on our own. It was the model that Hollywood used for the cemetery escape scene in",

          "For a cemetery to be peaceful, beautiful and rich in history, Petersfriedhof fulfills all of them. It is near the foot of the fortress entrance which is impossible to miss. The cemetery is not real a place for photos, but if you wish to take some photos, you can pay about 1-2",
          "When you come to this cemetry which is quite interesting and has nice statues, don't miss the entrance to the catacombs. It is on the left and the stairs lead inside the rock where you will see some ancient churches and have a chance to look at the cemetry and the church from a",

          "This is a truly beautiful spot. Even the wrought-iron grave markers and the family plots against the wall are beautiful and worth looking at. It has a very peaceful and serene fell and you can visit the catacombs for E3. There is also the grave of one non-Austrian, a certain US",
          "St. Peter's Cemetery and the adjacent catacombs that are carved into the rocks below the Hohensalzburg castle in old-town Salzburg are beautiful and moving. The cemetery have several gated enclaves that inspired the famous scenes from the end of the Sound of Music in which the",

          "This cemetery is beautifully maintained and also one of the several Sound of Music locations in Salzburg. It's next to the funicular station that goes up to the fortress, close to the historical city center. It's a must see location, as is St Peters Cathedral.",

          "This is such a beautiful, peaceful final resting spot for the inhabitants of Salzburg. It is obviously well cared for and full of plants, flowers and quaint markers made of metal. It is tucked away near St Peter's Church but easy to stumble across if you are touring Old",
          "Beautiful cared for and planted cemetry. We viewed it from the platform in the catacombs and then walked through it and out into the square behind. It's a bit hidden away but if you find St Peters then it's behind so not that hard to find.",
          "A nice surprise awaits after walking through the gate into the Graveyard, very peaceful, the adjoining church is beautiful and well worth a visit.",
          "Ancient cemetery definitely worth a visit. The first major general ever born in Salzburg is buried here. The grave sites are well kept with many having newly panted flowers.",
          "I love cemeteries in Germany, especially in Bavaria and in Austria. This is what cemeteries should look like. Petersfriedhof is a peaceful and ornate corner of old-town Salzburg, sitting in the shadow of the Hohensalzburg Fortress. On a cold, rainy day in May, I strolled",
          "Salzburg looks like an expensive baroque theatrical scenery and Petersfriedhof perfectly fits in it. Situated in the town centre, it's is an ancient cemetary used as the burial ground since 1627. It is relatively small, sheltered by the Church walls to one-, and the M\u00f6nchsberg",
          "This historic cemetery will take you back a few centuries as it offers you the opportunity for a quiet walk and some private, meditative moments. Another must-see, must-experience attraction if you're in Salzburg.",

          "Very beautiful graveyard site. Enjoyed walking thru it. The locked gravestones were the the backdrop idea for the last scenes where the Von trap family was hiding in the abbey. Different from what you'll expect. Nice to see.",

          "It's a cute, if not macabre, site that is mostly interesting if you grew up watching Sound of Music a billions times like I did. It will feel oddly familiar. Not too much to see here. We saw it the first time on our SOM bike tour.",
          "Of all places to visit, why do we go to graveyards? Is it morbid curiosity, or simply another place to visit and check off the list? For some reason, we always visit the local cemetary, in this case, the cemetary is not a collection of fallen headstones, weed filled grass, or",
          "The cemetery is unique and beautiful. The ironwork and other ornamentation on the graves was fantastic and you are surrounded by so many fascinating sights as you walk through. The catacombs seemed like they would be interesting but they were a dud, especially with a charge of 2",

          "Very beautiful and historic cemetery, with statues and paintings adorning grave sites that serve multiple generations. Didn't have time to check out the catacombs, and not sure if it was worthwhile to pay to get inside. Might have regretted that decision.",
          "It's a wonderful place, it's of course very quiet and it's in the middle of the old town, bursting with life.It gives you some sort of perspective.",
          "Quite an interesting palace to wonder through if the weather is OK, but the catacombs are not much to speak of. They were closed the day we went, so we went to some trouble to come back the next day, but turned out not to be worth it.",
          "The cemetery is very different in the style of the headstones and grave markers than the one in Vienna. It shows a Salzburg style. It is interesting to see the new and old graves mixed. Don't skip the 'catacombs' - which are actually more ancient chapel sites than graves. Also",
          "A place of interest and history. The wrought iron work is truly beautiful. We found it a special place.",

          "It Doesn't seem what it is, flowers everywhere come from the ground, small and big trees, there's atmosphere of happiness somehow. It's really worthing to visit it. And it's just behind the big church. No entry fee. Suggest to visit it in spring or summer, in autumn or winter",
          "The oldest christian graveyard in Salzburg is unusually inside the cloisters of this little church. The porticoes house chapels of Salzburg's old wealthy families dating back to the 17 th century. Mozart's father and sister are buried there and Joseph Haydn's younger brother.",

          "What a wonderful (and unexpected) place. This is what cemeteries should be-- peaceful, serene, and full of beautiful flowers shrubs and other foliage. It seems more of a celebration of a person's life than the dreary affairs you see back in the states. The cemetery is tucked",

          "While this is a cemetery where the dead are remembered, it is an incredibly beautiful and tranquil space. Graves are well tended and the markers are very interesting...and some are centuries old. The site is very picturesque. It was lovely to stroll through here and take in the",
          "Yes..dead folks are buried here but people come from all over to linger and have lunch and snacks and meet for conversation in the truly unique and tranquil place. Encircled by a medieval monastery/church courtyard, cliffs, and archways covering burial chambers in the walls this",
          "It might be strange to be recommended to visit a cemetery but this is something of a landmark as well as it was used as a filming location in The Sound of Music. It's a beautiful little place and worth the wander around if not only to marvel at the beauty of it.",
          "It seems that you are back in good old days when you visit this peaceful cemetery. The quiet and serene atmosphere is the charm of the place. Located in the old town of Salzburg, this place with its little chapel, beautiful greeneries,and the headstones is a must see. Needless",
          "Beautiful quiet garden with all those wrought iron \"headstones\". Loved the chapel up on the hill and just reading the markers.",
          "This area is right in Old Town and a nice place to have a stroll and to look at all of the history enshrined here. The graves generally are immaculately kept with flowers abounding. The priest who in reality was Max the friend of the Von Trapps in the movie is buried here. The",
          "Lets face it we all love the Sound of Music, this is the cemetary used in the movie. Its was quiet when I was there built into the mountain with cute chapel. few famous people buried worth the ten minutes it takes to walk thru it. Lots of greenery and stone...",
          "This quiet little cemetery was a nice find! I enjoyed strolling through, leaving the noise of the city behind the walls. Very peaceful. It was interesting to know that those buried in this cemetery must have relatives pay rent every 10 years or risk being booted out.",
          "It's certainly a nice cementery, but I'm going to focus on the little chapel (\"Margarethenkapelle\"): The chapel itself is nothing to be amazed over, but when I visited they had a little collection of contemporary paintings portraying the Madonna. They were quite nice and I like",
          "Certainly one of the prettiest cemeteries I've visited and very well maintained. That shouldn't be too surprising, as there are lots of aristocrats and other famous personalities buried here (including Mozart's sister, artists, opera singers, composers, architects, etc). It's",
          "I saw this suggestion on TA. It immediately caught my eye as I like the off beat, little sights. Very peaceful, beautiful for photography and a neat place e to spend a quiet hour or so in.",
          "What should be a quiet cemetary is bustling with tourist. The grounds however are beautifully kept and the candles on the graves continue to burn. The fenced in cripts were used as a basis for the cemetary scene in the movie The Sound of Music.This is why thousands of people",
          "This crammed cemetary is beautifully kept and full of history right in the middle of the old town, around from St. Peter's Church.",
          "The Abbey Church of St. Peter in Salzburg was founded by St. Rupert, who is buried inside. Known for its sumptuous Baroque decoration, it is the church of a Benedictine abbey. We stopped by on our day trip to Salzburg.",
          "It is Close to the great Restaurant \"St.Peter Stiftskeller\" (you might think I am macabre???), so Combine both. The cemetary is unique with the rock-Formation as a Background, and the many beautiful crossed hand-made by talented lock smithss. Nice photo motives. Somewhere here",
          "The cemetery and the area outside the church is a must see. You can see the cemetery in the movie the sound of music",
          "Well, it's a cemetery very different from what were used to... but I recognize it's worth to visit and it's really near. Whatever you do I advise you to don't visit the Catacombs - it's not worth the money.",
          "Located at the foot of the Festungsberg (hill with the castle on top) is a wrought iron gate through which you will find St. Peters church and cemetery. (You'll see the spires from Kapitelplatz). The cemetery is full of graves with beautiful wrought iron grave markers. It is the",

          "When you walk up to the tram to the Salzburg Fortress look for a wrought iron gate which leads into the cemetery surrounding St. Peter's Church. You are in for a treat--ornate headstones and monuments, flamboyant plantings, etc. All very unexpected. Stop into the church also.",
          "We did not know about it and it was a mistake to get to this street...but the view and the attraction was worth doing a mistake after all. The cemetary is just nice and peaceful. Very nice to see and to have a look at. Of course pay attantion to dignity of the place and the",
          "Very old cemetery, church, and a small catacomb. Definitely worth the walk through if you are walking your way through old town. The catacombs consist of two chapels that were used as a place of worship, and not as a burial grounds. Free except a few euros for visiting the",
          "This cemetery is located at the base of the castle behind St Peters Cathedral. This cemetery has three different entrances so you can approach it from any side. The cemetery itself is free however the catacombs are a small fee. This cemetery is truly amazing! There are no",

          "This was one of the most unique cemeteries I have ever seen. A local told us that only people/families born in Salzburg can be buried there. Many of the graves are large family plots and the dates and details make for very interesting history lessons. The glowing candles and",
          "Such a beautiful cemetery. The graves are well cared for. A very picturesque place on the side of the main hill in the Salzburg Old Town. We really enjoyed wandering through the headstones of this beautifully ornate place. Very peaceful, just like stepping back in time. Well",
          "I have never seen a cemetery like this one. The graves are beautiful and well cared for, it is free to walk through and very interesting. This is also the basis for the 'Sound of Music' cemetery - although the actual scenes were filmed in Hollywood. An interesting fact, in",
          "One of the most beautiful resting places anywhere. It is a must visit. One can wander through it, entering on one square and ending on the other.",
          "It's just a beautiful and unique cemetery. It's unique because of the colorful and unusual grave markers, as well as the fact that each grave is like a mini garden. The families that rent these spaces take very good care of their loved ones. The setting of this cemetery was the",

          "Because Salzburg is not all that large, you really should visit this cemetery. It has three parts. The first is the grave sites. The grave stones and markers are beautiful, and in some cases a little creepy. It does not take long to see the cemetery (it is not like the Paris",

          "I loved strolling through this beautiful and peaceful cemetery. I remembered thinking I wish I had more time to just sit down, meditate and pray. You must visit this garden. It was absolutely lovely to just look at. On top of it, one of the scenes from Sound of Music was",
          "Graveyards are not suprisingly my favourite places to visit on Holiday but Petersfriedhof is exceptionally well kept with beautiful flowers everywhere. The most unusual aspect i found are the Tombs built high up on the cliff face which you can access and are hollowed out looking",
          "A must visit. Just for the history and beauty this is well worth seeing. The catacombs are hard to navigate but it was still worth it. Remember if you have your Salzburg card the climb is free.",
          "Could have spent hours here looking at the beautifully maintained graves and elaborate headstones, each with their own story to tell. Peaceful place in the midst of busy Salzburg.",
          "Small cemetery we found after we had looked around St. Peter's church (which is excellent). Wasn't sure if Mozart was buried here - but apparently not after a quick check, he is in Vienna (maybe). There are plenty of mausoleums of the well to do of Salzburg plus individual",
          "We stumbled upon this lovely cemetery when walking down from the Fortress. It is tucked up under the lip of the mountain behind the coloured row houses lining the streets. I'm not sure if the individual families maintain the gravesites or if a service is used but all of the",
          "The cemetery is so well cared for within the grounds of the old abbey. The graves are very ornate and the whole place is clean and well preserved. You can see the old buildings that appear to be built into the rock",
          "Worth the visit to this interesting cemetery beside the mountain, especially in summer, when all the graves are full of flowers growing over them, which it makes it very different and even beautiful.",
          "We got there by accident exploring the city. What a lovely and peaceful place! Also, those houses built into the rock that surrounds the cemetery are amazing!!",
          "I am not usually a huge fan of cemeteries but the history in this one was amazing. The amount of time and energy relatives spend taking care of the grave sites is unbelievable!",
          "We toured this cemetery on our Fraulein Maria's Bike tour, however liked it so much -- the stones, the gorgeous blooming gardens in summer, the architecture that we came back later on our trip. This cemetery featured prominently at the end of the Sound of Music as the place",
          "C1 ( 2013.08.29 ) The cemetery's garden was very beautiful. The tower was very good, and house at the rock was very wonderful. This place was not big than I thought, but very interesting place. Good to look around.",
          "Just strolling around Salzburg is worth it, so why not go through this area! An interesting fact is you won't see many really old markers. Once no one in the family pays for the crypt they sell it to another family who will pay. Mozart's sister is buried here and this is one",
          "Reminded me of Monmartre Cemetry. Beautifully kept and a tranquil atmosphere, even when full of tourists.",
          "lots of tombs around . a small chapel . a shop is there from which you can buy religious memorabilia.",
          "A very unusual cemetery and worth visiting. It was raining when we walked thru and we still stopped to linger at many areas.",
          "Every review you've read before this one applies. Not the most urgent if you have to rush through Salzburg, but lovely and leisurely if you have the chance to visit the old city. We discovered it after attending the Haydn mass at the Cathedral, a fitting calm after the hugeness",
          "The settlement of cemetery was very nice and old. Clean and organize, to attract more visitors. Will recommend my friends to visit this cemetery,it is worth the time when visit Sulzburg.",
          "This is the most beautiful cemetry I have ever visited. The graves are ornately built with metal and stone centre pieces. Accompanying the graves are an array of highly maintained flowers and plants. It is a pleasure to wander around the whole cemetry admiring the beautiful",
          "I found this by accident strolling around and ran to bring to family back to it. A lovely, secluded area tucked against the cliff wall, complete with graves decorated end-to-end with flowing plants, mausoleums behind wrought-iron gates ala The Sound of Music and a catacomb",
          "This really was a beautiful place to walk through and experience the old world charm. Lots of markers and lots of history in this quaint city!",
          "The cemetery is a wonderful part of Salzburg's history. Attached to a beautful old church, this features tombstones and markers for many of the famous families of Salzsburg's history. The highlights are the graves of W.A. Mozart's widow (Constanze) and other family members.",
          "We missed the cemetery on our first trip to Salzburg, however I am glad we didn't miss it this time. The cemetery is located in the Old Town area and is worth a visit if you have time. The headstones are unique and the location of the cemetery would make a lovely final resting",
          "This is a must if you like mooching around old church grounds, a lovely resting place for anyone's loved ones.",
          "I went there for the crypts actually, only to find they were surrounded by this beautiful cemetery. It was a pleasant surprize. Getting in the crypts was cheap: 1,5 euros the entrance (this should have been a hint). The reason for such a low rating, is that there's not much",
          "On my second trip to Salzburg we went up and did the St. Peter's cemetery and catacombs. It was great, and took about a half hour- we really enjoyed walking through. The graves are very decorated, and the catacombs were pretty cool, but I don't think it's a must if you are short",
          "This was a charming little corner of Salzburg, with beautifully kept graves, planted in various colorful flowers.",
          "Although most tourists come here for you-know-what (for the record: TSOM departure scene was shot in Hollywood, not here!) it is still a beautiful and serene graveyard, and probably one of the nicest sites in the old town.",
          "A bit of quiet in the bustle. So pleased to happen upon this cemetery just around the corner from Salzburg's busiest area. Many interesting grave markers and the atmospheric cliffside catacombs. A place of contemplation. Small charge for catacombs.",
          "I never thought a cemetery could be so colorful and artistic. you have to see it to believe it. just walk through and it will calm you.",
          "Must visit. Its worth just going to see the ornate head stones. The inscriptions are really interesting. Try to have someone guide you around.",
          "Well worth the stroll through this graveyard. All graves are decorated with plantings of all variety. We enjoyed it very much.",
          "Mozart's sister was buried here and there are a few other recognisable names. The small extra fee is worth it for the photographic vantage point",
          "A peaceful place with beautiful wrought iron grave markers. The catacombs are worth a visit and give good views.",
          "Very well maintained, tiny cemetery tucked into the base and side of the fortress's hillside. We happened upon it while walking down from the fortress and were surprised that we could just walk right in. Readily accessible in oldtown Salzburg, worth a quick and quiet look,",
          "The cimitery has not changed since the film was made. Very interesting, peaceful and full of flowers.",
          "The layout and architecture employed here makes this for an interesting stop, and silently speaks to the lifestyles of those both devout and wealthy. It's plainly apparent that the producers of the SOM movie used the area as the set basis for the Von Trapp escape scenes at the",
          "It was too quiet and was as if we should not of been there. No one to be seen for hundreds of metres. Were we even aloud in?",
          "I know visiting a cemetery might not be on the top of your priorities, but this one is worth a visit. The serene atmosphere, the lovely tombstones, and the sheer sense of history you get, make it worth your time. Stroll out from there to the platz and the St. Peter Restaurant",
          "We kind of found this cemetery by accident, and I'm so glad we did. It was peaceful and serene, and just beautiful. It was off the beaten track, and very quiet in an otherwise bustling part of town. Loved it.",
          "I'm not a usual visitor to cemeteries--just not my thing but this one is so filled with beautiful flowers that it's worth a visit. It's a small spot and the paths make it tight but we wandered through checking out the dates of the graves and enjoyed ourselves. It's quite",
          "This was very historical and quite peaceful. Nice alternative view of the Dom. Excellent place for photography.",
          "Tucked away below the Festung, Petersfriedhof offers a little peace and quiet in the middle of Salzburg's crowded old town. Filled with the tombs of Salzburg's rich and famous it is also home to Salzburg's earliest Christian site (3rd or 4th century) - a chapel carved some 40",
          "We strolled through the cemetary but the part that got to us was the amazing chapel carved up in the rocks. For a few Euro you can actually climb up there and peak out the windows formed in the rocks and get a great few of the old part of the city. That particular spot made",
          "An beautiful little cemetery that inspired a portion of the movie, The Sound of Music. I truly loved all the iron work used as markers on the grounds.",
          "cemeteries tell so much about the culture and customs of a region, and this cemetery certainly is a jewel. Aside from old wrought iron crosses and headstones, the crypts tell stories of generations long gone. We spend quite some time just reading the history and learning about",
          "This cementery is like out of book, its just lovely and really a mus see when visiting Salzburg, take the time to admire every corner of it, it is worth it.",
          "Recommending a cemetery is unusual; however, I count this one as one of the most beautiful, peaceful places. Love to take a quiet stroll and admire the markers and flowers, all edging up to the mountain and under the reflective watch of the fortress. A must see while visiting",
          "Very impressive as it is the oldest cemetery in Salzburg. Beautifully maintained with very pretty flowers throughout. St. Peter's may not be the largest church in Salzburg (see The Dom) but it is very impressive nonetheless.",
          "We walked through here on our way to a beer garden and glad we did! It's beautiful. It inspired the cemetery where the VonTrapp family hid. The details in the gates, headstones, and grounds are amazing! Don't miss this.",
          "I came because it was the inspiration for the cemetery in the Sound of Music, and discovered that it is quite beautiful, a great place to take pictures.",
          "Interesting gravesides with iron crosses as headstones...beautifully maintained and lovely to wander through and think of past lives. This is right in the heart of the old town and next to the water wheel and old bakery...be sure to stop in and buy a treat!",
          "Not to be missed. The gated tombs were recreated and enlarged in Hollywood for the set of 'The Sound of Music'.",
          "Grave sites of all type, most very expensive to upkeep. You can see the old Austria and how they cherish their deseased loved ones. Flowers were very beautiful thoughout.",
          "Unique and unusual graves along with many very traditional plots and gravestones. Some very very old, some very recent. A quiet and beautiful setting.",
          "The most beautiful cememtry I've ever seen. The catacombs are also worth the climb - amazing to think that hermits lived there",
          "This is the most unique cemetery I have seen. It is the model for the cemetery used in the Sound of Music movie. There are old headstone and gated vaults. It is free to see so it's worth it take a few minutes and stop while on your way to other sites.",
          "For a cemetery, this is absolutely beautiful. Such lovely plots and lush gardens. Really great to stroll through if you have just been to the Dom or around Residenzplatz. In my opinion, the Catacombs are not worth entering unless you have a Salzburg Card because then they are",
          "History buffs will love this with its Sound of Music connection. Well maintained and a quiet respite from the old town crowds.",
          "This is a hidden gem that many seem to pass by, despite it\u2019s inviting beauty and tranquility. Even my children (13 and 8) thought this was cool as it has catacombs built into the natural rock structure surrounding this church. The gardens are also immensely beautiful. The",
          "We wandered through here and took a ton of photos. It's such an interesting cemetery, and clearly great pride is taken by the locals/relatives of those in it. Fascinating to see the gardening done on and around each grave.",
          "If you go to the train track leading up to the castle you'll find an iron gate on the right hand side. It is the entrance to the cemetery. The cemetery is small, quiet and well cared for, but beyond that it is a great place to take pictures of the castle as the sun is setting.",
          "This is a small, quiet and well looked after cemetery. When you walk up to the train that takes you to the castle it is through an iron gate on the right hand side. If you wonder all the way to the end you'll find a great location to snap some pictures of the castle.",
          "Just another of one of Salzburg's hidden gems. The church there was built before Columbus 'discovered' America. Make sure you pay the euro or two to go into the catacombs (office at back of cemetary).",
          "The most beautiful resting place I've ever seen. The catacombs are also worth the climb - amazing to think that hermits lived there.",
          "The inspiration for the cemetery scene from the sound of music, was lovely it was well kept and a peaceful pace to walk through",
          "Located in the centre of Salzburg,St. Peter's Abbey Cemetery is ancient but well maintained. Many of the aristocratic families of Salzburg lie buried there, as is the oldest Christian graveyard in Salzburg, dating back to 1627. It is a worthy attraction in itself, but many",
          "Sound of Music + cemetery= pure enjoyment! Old cemeteries have great sculpture, tender remembrances and often beautiful architecture we don't see today. I loved seeing the real life inspiration for the grave yard scene in SOM; this really is a unique place nestled against the",
          "We walked through this beautiful cemetery inside the abbey as part of our Sound of Music tour...It was haunting and quiet and many famous people of Salzburg are buried here...The crypts are outdoors and beautifully maintained with flowers, shrubs and small flowering",
          "check out the seven graves all next to each other on the main walkway. Also visit the rock church inside the cemetery",
          "If you think cemetery's to be a bit gloomy and dull - visit this one. The ancient grave sites are ornately decorated and well tended with flowers and shrubbery. Perusing the names and dates is a lesson in history that shouldn't be missed. You will spend more time here than",
          "This is really worth a walk round just to get away from the madness of the town. The graves are all planted up with beautiful flowers and are so well maintained. The layout of it is lovely and there is a very calming feeling to the place. You can pay \u20ac1.50 to walk up into the",
          "Peaceful and tranquil place in city centre. Tombs very well looked after with lots of flowers & lovely wrought iron tomb decorations. Worth a look.",
          "It's really quiet, really nice cemetary, I thought at first it was a garden, due to different flowers & green surronding:p",
          "went to the church and followed the signs to the cemetery but they disappeared. keep to the right. the Mozart family tomb is on the path in the center of the graveyard.",
          "This sight makes a lovely stroll. You can photograph beautiful tombs and tombstones. But don't waste a penny on the Catacombs!",
          "The church is quaint and the grounds are beautiful. There is even a working water wheel to serve the bakery on the grounds.",
          "There are names of people here on some very beautifully designed head stones going back centuries, it's well worth a sticky beak, and look around.",
          "This century-old cemetery, where Joseph Haydn's brother and Mozart's sister are buried in the \"chapel\" with the Dance-of-Death paintings (not to be missed, by the way) is quite an experience. But what adds to this is a walk up (not down ...) to the catacombs (there is an",
          "Beautiful cemetery with unusual and ornate iron grave markers. Worth the half our or so that it takes to stroll through - we went there twice!",
          "Beautiful cemetery - worth walking through and it doesn't talk long. Also be sure to stop by St. Peters Bakery :)",
          "We stumbled across this on the way to finding our bearings for a Mozart concert we were attending later that day. It's such a quaint and pretty place, we found ourselves mooching round rather than walking through. Again it was on our doorstep.",
          "I enjoy walking the beautiful grounds of St. Peter's Cemetary. Take a half an hour during your Salzburg visit to see this lovely area.",
          "this might be a small cemetery, but it has lots of beautiful decorations on the tombstones. Not impressive as the one in Vienna but it is still worth a visit, since it is so well located.",
          "This is another very unique location of Salzburg. The eldest cemetery of the city with graves of the 17th and 18th century. From the St. Peters Cemetery you can access the catacombs which also are very interesting to visit.",
          "Interesting to see where the idea came from. Nice little cemetery if you're into cemeteries, although none of the graves were very old. Just outside it is a great little bakery on St. Peter's square that smells heavenly and sells fresh rolls for 1 euro, and says its the oldest",
          "This is a stunning tribute to the loved ones of Salzburg. The headstones are so ornate and beautiful and remind me of a more elegant time in history.",
          "I really don't get it at all. Some quite wealthy people and respected city members are buried here. It's unique I guess. There was a scene in the sound of music based on this cemetery. The city seems to put a lot of focus on this fact, but I guess it pays off in tourism dollars,",
          "The area around St Peters church is walled off and encloses the graveyard with some stunning wrought iron \"headstones\". Alongside it is a restaurant that is well recommended though we didn;t try it.",
          "We loved the cemetary and the unique headstones and plots. It very quiet and peaceful - but enjoyable for a cemetary!",
          "We stumbled upon this little walled sanctuary when walking about the old town. I was suprised to feel near to tears with its beauty. Maybe it because it was the inspiration for the hiding scene in the film The Sound Of Music. I couldn't believe I had been bought by my",

          "Just below the massive hill of the Hohensalzburg Fortress is this incredibly beautiful cemetery. It is amazing to see the love and care family members show for departed loved ones with the carefully tended plots. So many unique headstones and memorials. It is a place to wander",
          "Next to the funicular and in the grounds of the monastery of st peter lies this fascinating cemetery with an arcade of extravagant family vaults and then 'simpler' plots most with wonderfully ornate ironwork decorating the grave stones. The cemetery is very beautiful to wander",
          "This was a beautiful little cemetery to wander around. The history and the dates on the gravestones were amazing. The cemetery had a beautiful atmosphere. It was worth it to take a little time to walk through.",

        "wiki": "Leopold Anton Eleutherius Freiherr von Firmian (11 March 1679 \u2013 22 October 1744) was Bishop of Lavant 1718\u201324, Bishop of Seckau 1724\u201327 and Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg from 1727 until his death.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born in Munich, on his father's side to the dynasty of Freiherren (Barons) von Firmian descending from Sigmundskron (Formigar) Castle in Tyrol, by virtue of being the son of Countess Maria Viktoria von Thun and the Imperial envoy, Baron Franz Wilhelm von Firmian. His maternal uncle Count Johann Ernst von Thun was Bishop of Seckau from 1679 until 1687 and Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg from 1687 to 1709.\nLeopold Anton von Firmian was the uncle of Cardinal Leopold Ernst von Firmian, also prince-bishop of Passau. His nephew, Karl Joseph von Firmian, the Austrian plenipotentiary minister in Milan, was renowned as a patron of the arts, including poets such as Giuseppe Parini, musicians such as Johann Ernst Eberlin  and painters such as Giambettino Cignaroli. While Leopold Anton was an early patron of Leopold Mozart, his nephew, Count Karl von Firmian appears to have been one of the patrons of Amadeus Mozart's opera Mitridate, Re di Ponto in Milan circa 1770.\n\n\n== Ecclesiastical career ==\nFirmian had prepared for an ecclesiastical career, received his ordination in Rome in 1707 and became provost of the Salzburg chapter in 1713. Pope Clement XI appointed him Bishop of Lavant in 1718, Pope Benedict XIII also made him Bishop of Seckau in 1724. On 4 October 1727 he was elected Archbishop of Salzburg. He had Schloss Klessheim finished and Schloss Leopoldskron erected as his private residence.\nFirmian saw it as his goal to give the Catholic Church its \"old power and glory\". Accordingly, he tried to convert the Protestant minority living in the archbishopric (especially in Pongau) to the Catholic faith - he had Jesuits preach in the village squares, all villagers had to appear at threat of severe penalties. On 31 October 1731, the 214th anniversary of Martin Luther's nailing of his 95 Theses to the door of the church in Wittenberg, Firmian signed an Edict of Expulsion of Protestants declaring that all Protestants in the archbishopric had to recant their non-Catholic beliefs or be banished within days. To enforce his order Firmian brought over 6000 Austrian soldiers to Salzburg. Surprisingly, over twenty thousand of his subjects professed Protestant beliefs and were exiled. Most of those who survived their flight were received by King Frederick William I of Prussia and settled around Gumbinnen in East Prussia. Others found refuge in Hanover, the Netherlands, and the British colony of Georgia. The expulsion drew vehement protests from the Protestant body in the Reichstag and the Protestant countries of Europe. For Salzburg, the expulsion had catastrophic economic consequences. After the expulsion of the Protestants, Firmian divided the Salzburg territory into four mission areas: Augustinian, Capuchin, Benedictine and Franciscan.\nFirmian completed construction on Schloss Klessheim, he had the Kapitelschwemme and Marstallschwemme redesigned, and constructed the Schloss Leopoldskron for his nephew Franz Laktanz Firmian.\nArchbishop Firmian is buried at the crypt of Salzburg Cathedral.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Leopold Anton Eleutherius von Firmian\".

        "wiki": "A museum ( mew-ZEE-\u0259m; plural museums or, rarely, musea) is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance.  Many public museums make these items available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. The largest museums are located in major cities throughout the world, while thousands of local museums exist in smaller cities, towns, and rural areas. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public.\nThere are many types of museums, including art museums, natural history museums, science museums, war museums, and children's museums. Amongst the world's largest and most visited museums are the Louvre in Paris, the National Museum of China in Beijing, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., the British Museum and National Gallery in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and Vatican Museums in Vatican City.  According to the International Council of Museums, there are more than 55,000 museums in 202 countries.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe English \"museum\" comes from the Latin word, and is pluralized as \"museums\" (or rarely, \"musea\"). It is originally from the Ancient Greek \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd (Mouseion), which denotes a place or temple dedicated to the Muses (the patron divinities in Greek mythology of the arts), and hence a building set apart for study and the arts, especially the Musaeum (institute) for philosophy and research at Alexandria by Ptolemy I Soter about 280 BC.\n\n\n== Purpose ==\n\nThe purpose of modern museums is to collect, preserve, interpret, and display objects of artistic, cultural, or scientific significance for the education of the public. From a visitor or community perspective, the purpose can also depend on one's point of view. A trip to a local history museum or large city art museum can be an entertaining and enlightening way to spend the day. To city leaders, a healthy museum community can be seen as a gauge of the economic health of a city, and a way to increase the sophistication of its inhabitants. To a museum professional, a museum might be seen as a way to educate the public about the museum's mission, such as civil rights or environmentalism. Museums are, above all, storehouses of knowledge. In 1829, James Smithson's bequest, that would fund the Smithsonian Institution, stated he wanted to establish an institution \"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"Museums of natural history in the late 19th century exemplified the Victorian desire for consumption and for order.  Gathering all examples of each classification of a field of knowledge for research and for display was the purpose.  As American colleges grew in the 19th century, they developed their own natural history collections for the use of their students.  By the last quarter of the 19th century, the scientific research in the universities was shifting toward biological research on a cellular level, and cutting edge research moved from museums to university laboratories.   While many large museums, such as the Smithsonian Institution, are still respected as research centers, research is no longer a main purpose of most museums. While there is an ongoing debate about the purposes of interpretation of a museum's collection, there has been a consistent mission to protect and preserve artifacts for future generations.  Much care, expertise, and expense is invested in preservation efforts to retard decomposition in aging documents, artifacts, artworks, and buildings.  All museums display objects that are important to a culture.  As historian Steven Conn writes, \"To see the thing itself, with one's own eyes and in a public place, surrounded by other people having some version of the same experience can be enchanting.\"Museum purposes vary from institution to institution. Some favor education over conservation, or vice versa. For example, in the 1970s, the Canada Science and Technology Museum favored education over preservation of their objects. They displayed objects as well as their functions. One exhibit featured a historic printing press that a staff member used for visitors to create museum memorabilia.  Some seek to reach a wide audience, such as a national or state museum, while some museums have specific audiences, like the LDS Church History Museum or local history organizations. Generally speaking, museums collect objects of significance that comply with their mission statement for conservation and display.\nAlthough most museums do not allow physical contact with the associated artifacts, there are some that are interactive and encourage a more hands-on approach. In 2009, Hampton Court Palace, palace of Henry VIII, opened the council room to the general public to create an interactive environment for visitors. Rather than allowing visitors to handle 500-year-old objects, the museum created replicas, as well as replica costumes. The daily activities, historic clothing, and even temperature changes immerse the visitor in a slice of what Tudor life may have been.\n\n\n== Most visited museums ==\n\nThis section lists the 20 most visited museums in 2018 as compiled by AECOM and the Themed Entertainment Association's annual report on the world's most visited attractions.  For more figures, see List of most visited museums. The cities of London and Washington, D.C. contain more of the 20 most visited museums in the world than any others, with five museums and four museums, respectively.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early museums ===\nEarly museums began as the private collections of wealthy individuals, families or institutions of art and rare or curious natural objects and artifacts. These were often displayed in so-called wonder rooms or cabinets of curiosities. One of the oldest museums known is Ennigaldi-Nanna's museum, built by Princess Ennigaldi at the end of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The site dates from c. 530 BCE, and contained artifacts from earlier Mesopotamian civilizations. Notably, a clay drum label\u2014written in three languages\u2014was found at the site, referencing the history and discovery of a museum item.\nPublic access to these museums was often possible for the \"respectable\", especially to private art collections, but at the whim of the owner and his staff. One way that elite men during this time period gained a higher social status in the world of elites was by becoming a collector of these curious objects and displaying them. Many of the items in these collections were new discoveries and these collectors or naturalists, since many of these people held interest in natural sciences, were eager to obtain them. By putting their collections in a museum and on display, they not only got to show their fantastic finds but they also used the museum as a way to sort and \"manage the empirical explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication and exchange had produced.\"One of these naturalists and collectors was Ulisse Aldrovandi, whose collection policy of gathering as many objects and facts about them was \"encyclopedic\" in nature, reminiscent of that of Pliny, the Roman philosopher and naturalist. The idea was to consume and collect as much knowledge as possible, to put everything they collected and everything they knew in these displays. In time, however, museum philosophy would change and the encyclopedic nature of information that was so enjoyed by Aldrovandi and his cohorts would be dismissed as well as \"the museums that contained this knowledge.\" The 18th-century scholars of the Age of Enlightenment saw their ideas of the museum as superior and based their natural history museums on \"organization and taxonomy\" rather than displaying everything in any order after the style of Aldrovandi.While some of the oldest public museums in the world opened in Italy during the Renaissance, the majority of these significant museums in the world opened during the 18th century:\n\nthe Capitoline Museums, the oldest public collection of art in the world, began in 1471 when Pope Sixtus IV donated a group of important ancient sculptures to the people of Rome.\nthe Vatican Museums, the second oldest museum in the world, traces its origins to the public displayed sculptural collection begun in 1506 by Pope Julius II\nAmbras Castle (Schloss Ambras Innsbruck), Austria, is not the oldest art collection, but it is the earliest collection still to be found in that very building created especially for its museum purpose (1572\u20131583, Supplement 1589): Ambras Castle is the oldest museum in the world in several respects: the oldest pair of original building and initial collections; the oldest preserved collection in the history of museum according to a systematic concept; it houses \u2013 beside the Armouries \u2013 the only Renaissance Kunstkammer of its kind to have been preserved at its original location. Verifiably called a \u2018museum\u2019 as early as c.1580.\nthe Royal Armouries in the Tower of London is the oldest museum in the United Kingdom. It opened to the public in 1660, though there had been paying privileged visitors to the armouries displays from 1592. Today the museum has three sites including its new headquarters in Leeds.\nthe Museum Kircherianum was opened around 1660 by the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher in the Roman College, exhibiting several of his automata and spectacles, such as his famous sunflower clock.\nRumphius built a botanical museum in Ambon in 1662, making it the oldest recorded museum in Indonesia. Nothing remains of it except books written by himself, which are now in the library of the National Museum. Its successor was the Batavia Society of Art and Science, established on 24 April 1778. It built a museum and a library, played an important role in research, and collected much material on the natural history and culture of Indonesia.\nthe Amerbach Cabinet, originally a private collection, was bought by the university and city of Basel in 1661 and opened to the public in 1671.\nthe Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts et d'arch\u00e9ologie in Besan\u00e7on was established in 1694 after Jean-Baptiste Boisot, an abbot, gave his personal collection to the Benedictines of the city in order to create a museum open to the public two days every week.\nthe Kunstkamera in St. Petersburg was founded in 1717 in Kikin Hall and officially opened to the public in 1727 in the Old St. Petersburg Academy of Science Building\nthe British Museum in London, was founded in 1753 and opened to the public in 1759. Sir Hans Sloane's personal collection of curios provided the initial foundation for the British Museum's collection.\nthe Uffizi Gallery in Florence, This art collection was begun in the 15th century by Cosimo de' Medici, enlarged by his descendants, and in 1743 bequeathed by the last heir of the House of Medici  \"to the people of Tuscany and to all nations.\" The Uffizi Palace (built 1560-1581) was designed by the Renaissance painter and architect Giorgio Vasari. The top floors were converted to gallery space, open to visitors on request, and then opened to the public as a museum in 1769 by Grand Duke Peter Leopold.\nthe Museum of the History of Riga and Navigation is the oldest in Latvia and the whole of the Baltics, and one of the oldest in Europe. It was founded and opened to public in 1773 by the Riga Town Council as Himsel Museum. The rich and diverse collections of the museum originated from an art and natural sciences collection of Nikolaus von Himsel (1729\u20131764), a Riga doctor. Today the Museum of the History of Riga and Navigation collections number more than 500 000 items, systematised in about 80 collections.\nthe Hermitage Museum was founded in 1764 by Catherine the Great and has been open to the public since 1852.\nthe Museo del Prado in Madrid was founded in 1785 by Charles III of Spain, originally to house the Natural History Cabinet. Later, the building was converted into the new Royal Museum of Paintings and Sculptures, opened to the public in 1819, with the aim of showing the works of art belonging to the Spanish Crown. Nowadays, with the nearby Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and the Museo Reina Sof\u00eda, it forms the so-called Golden Triangle of Art.\nthe Belvedere Palace of the Habsburg monarchs in Vienna opened with a collection of art in 1781.\nthe Teylers Museum in Haarlem (The Netherlands) established in 1778 and is the oldest Dutch museum.\nthe Louvre Museum in Paris (France), also a former royal palace, opened to the public in 1793\nThe Brukenthal National Museum, erected in the late 18th century in Sibiu, Transylvania, Romania, housed in the palace of Samuel von Brukenthal\u2014who was Habsburg governor of Transylvania and who established its first collections around 1790. The collections were officially opened to the public in 1817, making it the oldest institution of its kind in Romania.\nThe museum of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia dates to 1743, making it the oldest museum in the United States.\nThe Charleston Museum was established in 1773 thereby making it the first museum in the Southern United States. It did not open to the public until 1824.\nCharles Willson Peale established America's first public museum in 1786 in Philadelphia's Independence Hall in 1786. It closed by the 1840s.\nIndian Museum, Kolkata, established in 1814 is the oldest museum in India. It has a collection of 102,646 artifacts.\n\n\n=== Modern museums ===\n\nModern museums first emerged in western Europe, then spread into other parts of the world.The first \"public\" museums were often accessible only by the middle and upper classes. It could be difficult to gain entrance. When the British Museum opened to the public in 1759, it was a concern that large crowds could damage the artifacts. Prospective visitors to the British Museum had to apply in writing for admission, and small groups were allowed into the galleries each day. The British Museum became increasingly popular during the 19th century, amongst all age groups and social classes who visited the British Museum, especially on public holidays.The Ashmolean Museum, however, founded in 1677 from the personal collection of Elias Ashmole, was set up in the University of Oxford to be open to the public and is considered by some to be the first modern public museum. The collection included that of Elias Ashmole which he had collected himself, including objects he had acquired from the gardeners, travellers and collectors John Tradescant the elder and his son of the same name. The collection included antique coins, books, engravings, geological specimens, and zoological specimens\u2014one of which was the stuffed body of the last dodo ever seen in Europe; but by 1755 the stuffed dodo was so moth-eaten that it was destroyed, except for its head and one claw. The museum opened on 24 May 1683, with naturalist Robert Plot as the first keeper. The first building, which became known as the Old Ashmolean, is sometimes attributed to Sir Christopher Wren or Thomas Wood.\n\nIn France, the first public museum was the Louvre Museum in Paris, opened in 1793 during the French Revolution, which enabled for the first time free access to the former French royal collections for people of all stations and status. The fabulous art treasures collected by the French monarchy over centuries were accessible to the public three days each \"d\u00e9cade\" (the 10-day unit which had replaced the week in the French Republican Calendar). The Conservatoire du mus\u00e9um national des Arts (National Museum of Arts's Conservatory) was charged with organizing the Louvre as a national public museum and the centerpiece of a planned national museum system. As Napol\u00e9on I conquered the great cities of Europe, confiscating art objects as he went, the collections grew and the organizational task became more and more complicated. After Napoleon was defeated in 1815, many of the treasures he had amassed were gradually returned to their owners (and many were not). His plan was never fully realized, but his concept of a museum as an agent of nationalistic fervor had a profound influence throughout Europe.\nChinese and Japanese visitors to Europe were fascinated by the museums they saw there, but had cultural difficulties in grasping their purpose and finding an equivalent Chinese or Japanese term for them. Chinese visitors in the early 19th century named these museums based on what they contained, so defined them as \"bone amassing buildings\" or \"courtyards of treasures\" or \"painting pavilions\" or \"curio stores\" or \"halls of military feats\" or \"gardens of everything\". Japan first encountered Western museum institutions when it participated in Europe's World's Fairs in the 1860s. The British Museum was described by one of their delegates as a 'hakubutsukan', a 'house of extensive things' \u2013 this would eventually become accepted as the equivalent word for 'museum' in Japan and China.American museums eventually joined European museums as the world's leading centers for the production of new knowledge in their fields of interest. A period of intense museum building, in both an intellectual and physical sense was realized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (this is often called \"The Museum Period\" or \"The Museum Age\"). While many American museums, both natural history museums and art museums alike, were founded with the intention of focusing on the scientific discoveries and artistic developments in North America, many moved to emulate their European counterparts in certain ways (including the development of Classical collections from ancient Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia, and Rome). Drawing on Michel Foucault's concept of liberal government, Tony Bennett has suggested the development of more modern 19th-century museums was part of new strategies by Western governments to produce a citizenry that, rather than be directed by coercive or external forces, monitored and regulated its own conduct. To incorporate the masses in this strategy, the private space of museums that previously had been restricted and socially exclusive were made public.  As such, objects and artifacts, particularly those related to high culture, became instruments for these \"new tasks of social management.\" Universities became the primary centers for innovative research in the United States well before the start of World War II. Nevertheless, museums to this day contribute new knowledge to their fields and continue to build collections that are useful for both research and display.\nThe late twentieth century witnessed intense debate concerning the repatriation of religious, ethnic, and cultural artifacts housed in museum collections. In the United States, several Native American tribes and advocacy groups have lobbied extensively for the repatriation of sacred objects and the reburial of human remains. In 1990, Congress passed the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which required federal agencies and federally funded institutions to repatriate Native American \"cultural items\" to culturally affiliate tribes and groups. Similarly, many European museum collections often contain objects and cultural artifacts acquired through imperialism and colonization. Some historians and scholars have criticized the British Museum for its possession of rare antiquities from Egypt, Greece, and the Middle East.\n\n\n== Management ==\n\nThe roles associated with the management of a museum largely depend on the size of the institution, but every museum has a hierarchy of governance with a Board of Trustees serving at the top. The Director is next in command and works with the Board to establish and fulfill the museum's mission statement and to ensure that the museum is accountable to the public.   Together, the Board and the Director establish a system of governance that is guided by policies that set standards for the institution. Documents that set these standards include an institutional or strategic plan, institutional code of ethics, bylaws, and collections policy. The American Alliance of Museums (AAM) has also formulated a series of standards and best practices that help guide the management of museums.\n\nBoard of Trustees \u2013 The board governs the museum and is responsible for ensuring the museum is financially and ethically sound. They set standards and policies for the museum. Board members are often involved in fundraising aspects of the museum and represent the institution.\nDirector- The director is the face of the museum to the professional and public community. They communicate closely with the board to guide and govern the museum. They work with the staff to ensure the museum runs smoothly.\nAccording to museum professionals Hugh H. Genoways and Lynne M. Ireland, \"Administration of the organization requires skill in conflict management, interpersonal relations, budget management and monitoring, and staff supervision and evaluation. Managers must also set legal and ethical standards and maintain involvement in the museum profession.\"Various positions within the museum carry out the policies established by the Board and the Director. All museum employees should work together toward the museum's institutional goal. Here is a list of positions commonly found at museums:\n\nCurator \u2013 Curators are the intellectual drivers behind exhibits. They research the museum's collection and topic of focus, develop exhibition themes, and publish their research aimed at either a public or academic audience. Larger museums have curators in a variety of areas. For example, The Henry Ford has a Curator of Transportation, a Curator of Public Life, a Curator of Decorative Arts, etc.\nCollections Management \u2013 Collections managers are primarily responsible for the hands-on care, movement, and storage of objects. They are responsible for the accessibility of collections and collections policy.\nRegistrar \u2013 Registrars are the primary record keepers of the collection. They insure that objects are properly accessioned, documented, insured, and, when appropriate, loaned. Ethical and legal issues related to the collection are dealt with by registrars. Along with collections managers, they uphold the museum's collections policy.\nEducator \u2013 Museum educators are responsible for educating museum audiences. Their duties can include designing tours and public programs for children and adults, teacher training, developing classroom and continuing education resources, community outreach, and volunteer management. Educators not only work with the public, but also collaborate with other museum staff on exhibition and program development to ensure that exhibits are audience-friendly.\nExhibit Designer \u2013 Exhibit designers are in charge of the layout and physical installation of exhibits. They create a conceptual design and then bring it to fruition in the physical space.\nConservator \u2013 Conservators focus on object restoration. More than preserving the object in its present state, they seek to stabilize and repair artifacts to the condition of an earlier era.Other positions commonly found at museums include: building operator, public programming staff, photographer, librarian, archivist, groundskeeper, volunteer coordinator, preparator, security staff, development officer, membership officer, business officer, gift shop manager, public relations staff, and graphic designer.\nAt smaller museums, staff members often fulfill multiple roles. Some of these positions are excluded entirely or may be carried out by a contractor when necessary.\n\n\n=== Exhibition histories ===\nAn exhibition history is a listing of exhibitions for an institution, artist, or a work of art. Exhibition histories generally include the name of the host institution, the title of the exhibition and the opening and closing dates of the exhibition.\nThe following is a list of major institutions that have complete or substantial exhibition histories that are available online.\n\nAmon Carter Museum, Fort Worth, Texas (1961\u2013present)\nBritish Museum (1838\u20132012)\nBrooklyn Museum (1846\u2013present)\nArt Institute of Chicago (1883\u2013present)\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1988\u2013present)\nCleveland Museum of Art (1916\u2013present)\nContemporary Arts Museum Houston (1948\u2013present)\nCorcoran Gallery of Art, Washington DC (1901\u2013present)\nDahesh Museum of Art, New York (1995\u20132007)\nDallas Museum of Art (1903\u2013present)\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (1984\u2013present)\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York (1929\u2013present)\nNational Gallery of Art, Washington DC (1941\u2013present)\nCanadian Museum of Nature, Ottawa, Ontario (1912\u2013present)\n\n\n=== Protection ===\nThe cultural property stored in museums is threatened in many countries by natural disaster, war, terrorist attacks or other emergencies. To this end, an internationally important aspect is a strong bundling of existing resources and the networking of existing specialist competencies in order to prevent any loss or damage to cultural property or to keep damage as low as possible. International partner for museums is UNESCO and Blue Shield International in accordance with the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property from 1954 and its 2nd Protocol from 1999. For legal reasons, there are many international collaborations between museums, and the local Blue Shield organizations.Blue Shield has conducted extensive missions to protect museums and cultural assets in armed conflict, such as 2011 in Egypt and Libya, 2013 in Syria and 2014 in Mali and Iraq. During these operations, the looting of the collection is to be prevented in particular.\n\n\n== Museum planning ==\n\nThe design of museums has evolved throughout history. However, museum planning involves planning the actual mission of the museum along with planning the space that the collection of the museum will be housed in. Intentional museum planning has its beginnings with the museum founder and librarian John Cotton Dana. Dana detailed the process of founding the Newark Museum in a series of books in the early 20th century so that other museum founders could plan their museums. Dana suggested that potential founders of museums should form a committee first, and reach out to the community for input as to what the museum should supply or do for the community. According to Dana, museums should be planned according to community's needs:\n\"The new museum ... does not build on an educational superstition. It examines its community's life first, and then straightway bends its energies to supplying some the material which that community needs, and to making that material's presence widely known, and to presenting it in such a way as to secure it for the maximum of use and the maximum efficiency of that use.\"The way that museums are planned and designed vary according to what collections they house, but overall, they adhere to planning a space that is easily accessed by the public and easily displays the chosen artifacts. These elements of planning have their roots with John Cotton Dana, who was perturbed at the historical placement of museums outside of cities, and in areas that were not easily accessed by the public, in gloomy European style buildings.Questions of accessibility continue to the present day. Many museums strive to make their buildings, programming, ideas, and collections more publicly accessible than in the past. Not every museum is participating in this trend, but that seems to be the trajectory of museums in the twenty-first century with its emphasis on inclusiveness. One pioneering way museums are attempting to make their collections more accessible is with open storage. Most of a museum's collection is typically locked away in a secure location to be preserved, but the result is most people never get to see the vast majority of collections. The Brooklyn Museum's Luce Center for American Art practices this open storage where the public can view items not on display, albeit with minimal interpretation. The practice of open storage is all part of an ongoing debate in the museum field of the role objects play and how accessible they should be.In terms of modern museums, interpretive museums, as opposed to art museums, have missions reflecting curatorial guidance through the subject matter which now include content in the form of images, audio and visual effects, and interactive exhibits. Museum creation begins with a museum plan, created through a museum planning process. The process involves identifying the museum's vision and the resources, organization and experiences needed to realize this vision. A feasibility study, analysis of comparable facilities, and an interpretive plan are all developed as part of the museum planning process.\nSome museum experiences have very few or no artifacts and do not necessarily call themselves museums, and their mission reflects this; the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles and the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, being notable examples where there are few artifacts, but strong, memorable stories are told or information is interpreted. In contrast, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. uses many artifacts in their memorable exhibitions.\n\n\n=== Financial uses of museums ===\nIn recent years, some cities have turned to museums as an avenue for economic development or rejuvenation. This is particularly true in the case of postindustrial cities. Examples of museums fulfilling these economic roles exist around the world. For example, the spectacular Guggenheim Bilbao was built in Bilbao, Spain in a move by the Basque regional government to revitalize the dilapidated old port area of that city. The Basque government agreed to pay $100 million for the construction of the museum, a price tag that caused many Bilbaoans to protest against the project. Nonetheless, the gamble has appeared to pay off financially for the city, with over 1.1 million people visiting the museum in 2015. Key to this is the large demographic of foreign visitors to the museum, with 63% of the visitors residing outside of Spain and thus feeding foreign investment straight into Bilbao. A similar project to that undertaken in Bilbao was also built on the disused shipyards of Belfast, Northern Ireland. Titanic Belfast was built for the same price as the Guggenheim Bilbao (and which was incidentally built by the same architect, Frank Gehry) in time for the 100th anniversary of the Belfast-built ship's maiden voyage in 2012. Initially expecting modest visitor numbers of 425,000 annually, first year visitor numbers reached over 800,000, with almost 60% coming from outside Northern Ireland. In the United States, similar projects include the 81, 000 square foot Taubman Museum of Art in Roanoke, Virginia and The Broad Museum in Los Angeles.\nMuseums being used as a cultural economic driver by city and local governments has proven to be controversial among museum activists and local populations alike. Public protests have occurred in numerous cities which have tried to employ museums in this way. While most subside if a museum is successful, as happened in Bilbao, others continue especially if a museum struggles to attract visitors. The Taubman Museum of Art is an example of a museum which cost a lot (eventually $66 million) but attained little success, and continues to have a low endowment for its size. Some museum activists also see this method of museum use as a deeply flawed model for such institutions. Steven Conn, one such museum proponent, believes that \"to ask museums to solve our political and economic problems is to set them up for inevitable failure and to set us (the visitor) up for inevitable disappointment.\"\n\n\n=== Museum funding ===\nMuseums are facing funding shortages. Funding for museums comes from four major categories, and as of 2009 the breakdown for the United States is as follows: Government support (at all levels) 24.4%, private (charitable) giving 36.5%, earned income 27.6%, and investment income 11.5%. Government funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, the largest museum funder in the United States, decreased by 19.586 million between 2011 and 2015, adjusted for inflation. The average spent per visitor in an art museum in 2016 was $8 between admissions, store and restaurant, where the average expense per visitor was $55. Corporations, which fall into the private giving category, can be a good source of funding to make up the funding gap. The amount corporations currently give to museums accounts for just 5% of total funding. Corporate giving to the arts, however, was set to increase by 3.3% in 2017.\n\n\n== Exhibition design ==\n\nMost mid-size and large museums employ exhibit design staff for graphic and environmental design projects, including exhibitions. In addition to traditional 2-D and 3-D designers and architects, these staff departments may include audio-visual specialists, software designers, audience research, evaluation specialists, writers, editors, and preparators or art handlers. These staff specialists may also be charged with supervising contract design or production services. The exhibit design process builds on the interpretive plan for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. Museums of all sizes may also contract the outside services of exhibit fabrication businesses.Exhibition design has as multitude of strategies, theories, and methods but two that embody much of the theory and dialogue surrounding exhibition design are the metonymy technique and the use of authentic artifacts to provide the historical narrative. Metonymy, or \"the substitution of the name of an attribute or adjunct for that of the thing meant,\" is a technique used by many museums but few as heavily and as influentially as Holocaust museums.\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C., for example, employs this technique in its shoe exhibition. Simply a pile of decaying leather shoes piled against a bare, gray concrete wall the exhibit relies heavily on the emotional, sensory response the viewer will naturally through this use metonymic technique. This exhibition design intentionally signifies metonymically the nameless and victims themselves. This metaphysical link to the victims through the deteriorating and aged shoes stands as a surviving vestige of the individual victim. This technique, employed properly, can be a very powerful one as it plays off the real life experiences of the viewer while evoking the equally unique memory of the victim. Metonymy, however, Jennifer Hansen-Glucklich argues, is not without its own problems. Hansen-Glucklich explains, \"...when victims' possessions are collected according to type and displayed en masse they stand metonymically for the victims themselves ... Such a use of metonymy contributes to the dehumanization of the victims as they are reduced to a heap of indistinguishable objects and their individuality subsumed by an aesthetic of anonymity and excess.\"While a powerful technique, Hansen-Glucklick points out that when used en masse the metonym suffers as the memory and suffering of the individual is lost in the chorus of the whole. While at times juxtaposed, the alternative technique of the use of authentic objects is seen the same exhibit mentioned above. The use of authentic artifacts is employed by most, if not all, museums but the degree to which and the intention can vary greatly. The basic idea behind exhibiting authentic artifacts is to provide not only legitimacy to the exhibit's historical narrative but, at times, to help create the narrative as well. The theory behind this technique is to exhibit artifacts in a neutral manner to orchestrate and narrate the historic narrative through, ideally, the provenance of the artifacts themselves.\nWhile albeit necessary to some degree in any museum repertoire, the use of authentic artifacts can not only be misleading but as equally problematic as the aforementioned metonymic technique. Hansen-Glucklick explains, \"The danger of such a strategy lies in the fact that by claiming to offer the remnants of the past to the spectator, the museum creates the illusion of standing before a complete picture. The suggestion is that if enough details and fragments are collected and displayed, a coherent and total truth concerning the past will emerge, visible and comprehensible. The museum attempts, in other words, to archive the unachievable.\" While any exhibit benefits from the legitimacy given by authentic objects or artifacts, the temptation must be protected against in order to avoid relying solely on the artifacts themselves. A well designed exhibition should employ objects and artifacts as a foundation to the narrative but not as a crutch; a lesson any conscientious curator would be well to keep in mind.Some museum scholars have even begun to question whether museums truly need artifacts at all. Historian Steven Conn provocatively asks this question, suggesting that there are fewer objects in all museums now, as they have been progressively replaced by interactive technology. As educational programming has grown in museums, mass collections of objects have receded in importance. This is not necessarily a negative development. Dorothy Canfield Fisher observed that the reduction in objects has pushed museums to grow from institutions that artlessly showcased their many artifacts (in the style of early cabinets of curiosity) to instead \"thinning out\" the objects presented \"for a general view of any given subject or period, and to put the rest away in archive-storage-rooms, where they could be consulted by students, the only people who really needed to see them.\" This phenomenon of disappearing objects is especially present in science museums like the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, which have a high visitorship of school-aged children who may benefit more from hands-on interactive technology than reading a label beside an artifact.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\nMuseums can vary based on size, from large institutions covering many of the categories below, to very small institutions focusing on a specific subjects, such as a specific location, a notable person, or a given period of time. Museums can also be categorized into major groups by the type of collections they display, to include: fine arts, applied arts, craft, archaeology, anthropology and ethnology, biography, history, cultural history, science, technology, children's museums, natural history, botanical and zoological gardens. Within these categories, many museums specialize further, e.g. museums of modern art, folk art, local history, military history, aviation history, philately, agriculture, or geology. Another type of museum is an encyclopedic museum. Commonly referred to as a universal museum, encyclopedic museums have collections representative of the world and typically include art, science, history, and cultural history. The size of a museum's collection typically determines the museum's size, whereas its collection reflects the type of museum it is. Many museums normally display a \"permanent collection\" of important selected objects in its area of specialization, and may periodically display \"special collections\" on a temporary basis.\nIt may sometimes be useful to distinguish between diachronic and synchronic museums.  According to University of Florida's Professor Eric Kilgerman, \"While a museum in which a particular narrative unfolds within its halls is diachronic, those museums that limit their space to a single experience are called synchronic.\"\n\n\n=== Agricultural museums ===\n\nAgricultural museums are dedicated to preserving agricultural history and heritage. They aim to educate the public on the subject of agricultural history, their legacy and impact on society. To accomplish this, they specialize in the display and interpretation of artifacts related to agriculture, often of a specific time period or in a specific region. They may also display memorabilia related to farmers or businesspeople who impacted society via agriculture (e.g., larger size of the land cultivated as compared to other similar farms) or agricultural advances, such as new technology implementation, as in the case of Museo Hacienda Buena Vista.\n\n\n=== Architecture museums ===\n\nArchitectural museums are institutions dedicated to educating visitors about architecture and a variety of related fields, often including urban design, landscape design, interior decoration, engineering, and historic preservation.  Additionally, museums of art or history sometimes dedicate a portion of the museum or a permanent exhibit to a particular facet or era of architecture and design, though this does not technically constitute a proper museum of architecture.\nThe International Confederation of Architectural Museums (ICAM) is the principal worldwide organisation for architectural museums.  Members consist of almost all large institutions specializing in this field and also those offering permanent exhibitions or dedicated galleries.\nArchitecture museums are in fact a less common type in the United States, due partly to the difficulty of curating a collection which could adequately represent or embody the large scale subject matter.\n\nThe National Building Museum in Washington D.C., a privately run institution created by a mandate of Congress in 1980, is the nation's most prominent public museum of architecture. In addition to its architectural exhibits and collections, the museum seeks to educate the public about engineering and design. The NBM is a unique museum in that the building in which it is housed\u2014the historic Pension Building built 1882\u201387\u2014is itself a sort of curated collection piece which teaches about architecture.  Another large scale museum of architecture is the Chicago Athenaeum, an international Museum of Architecture and Design, founded in 1988.  The Athenaeum differs from the National Building Museum not only in its global scope\u2014it has offices in Italy, Greece, Germany, and Ireland\u2014but also in its broader topical scope, which encompasses smaller modern appliances and graphic design.\nA very different and much smaller example of an American architectural museum is the Schifferstadt Architectural Museum in Frederick, Maryland. Similar to the National Building Museum, the building of the Schifferstadt is a historic structure, built in 1758, and therefore also an embodiment of historic preservation and restoration.  In addition to instructing the public about its eighteenth-century German-American style architecture, the Schifferstadt also interprets the broader contextual history of its origins, including topics such as the French and Indian War and the arrival of the region's earliest German American immigrants.\nMuseums of architecture are devoted primarily to disseminating knowledge about architecture, but there is considerable room for expanding into other related genres such as design, city planning, landscape, infrastructure, and even the traditional study of history or art, which can provide useful context for any architectural exhibit.\nThe American Society of Landscape Architects has professional awards given out every year to architectural museums and art displays. A few of the award-winning projects are: Perez Art Museum Miami: Resiliency by Design, Teardrop Park: General Design Category, and Mesa Arts Center: General Design Honor Award\n\n\n=== Archaeology museums ===\n\nArchaeology museums specialize in the display of archaeological artifacts. Many are in the open air, such as the Agora of Athens and the Roman Forum. Others display artifacts found in archaeological sites inside buildings. Some, such as the Western Australian Museum, exhibit maritime archaeological materials. These appear in its Shipwreck Galleries, a wing of the Maritime Museum. This Museum has also developed a  'museum-without-walls'  through a series of underwater wreck trails.\n\n\n=== Art museums ===\n\nAn art museum, also known as an art gallery, is a space for the exhibition of art, usually in the form of art objects\nfrom the visual arts, primarily paintings, illustrations, and sculptures. Collections of drawings and old master prints are often not displayed on the walls, but kept in a print room. There may be collections of applied art, including ceramics, metalwork, furniture, artist's books, and other types of objects. Video art is often screened.\nThe first publicly owned museum in Europe was the Amerbach-Cabinet in Basel, originally a private collection sold to the city in 1661 and public since 1671 (now Kunstmuseum Basel). The Ashmolean Museum in Oxford opened on 24 May 1683 as the world's first university art museum. Its first building was built in 1678\u20131683 to house the cabinet of curiosities Elias Ashmole gave Oxford University in 1677. The Uffizi Gallery in Florence was initially conceived as offices for the Florentine civil service (hence the name), but evolved into a display place for many of the paintings and sculpture collected by the Medici family or commissioned by them. After the house of Medici was extinguished, the art treasures remained in Florence, forming one of the first modern museums. The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century, and in 1765 it was officially opened to the public. Another early public museum was the British Museum in London, which opened to the public in 1759. It was a \"universal museum\" with very varied collections covering art, applied art, archaeology, anthropology, history, and science, and what is now the British Library. The science collections, library, paintings, and modern sculptures have since been found separate homes, leaving history, archaeology, non-European and pre-Renaissance art, and prints and drawings. Underwater museum is another type of art museum where the Artificial reef are placed to promote marine life. Cancun Underwater Museum, or the Subaquatic Sculpture Museum, in Mexico is the largest underwater museum in the world. There are now about 500 images in the underwater museum. The last eleven images were added in September 2013.\n\nThe specialised art museum is considered a fairly modern invention, the first being the Hermitage in Saint Petersburg which was established in 1764.The Louvre in Paris was established in 1793, soon after the French Revolution when the royal treasures were declared for the people. The Czartoryski Museum in Krak\u00f3w was established in 1796 by Princess Izabela Czartoryska. This showed the beginnings of removing art collections from the private domain of aristocracy and the wealthy into the public sphere, where they were seen as sites for educating the masses in taste and cultural refinement.\n\n\n=== Biographical museums ===\n\nBiographical museums are dedicated to items relating to the life of a single person or group of people, and may also display the items collected by their subjects during their lifetimes.  Some biographical museums are located in a house or other site associated with the lives of their subjects (e.g. Sagamore Hill which contains the Theodore Roosevelt Museum or The Keats-Shelley Memorial House in the Piazza di Spagna, Rome). Some homes of famous people house famous collections in the sphere of the owner's expertise or interests in addition to collections of their biographical material; one such example is Apsley House, London, home of the Duke of Wellington, which, in addition to biographical memorabilia of the Duke's life, also houses his collection world-famous paintings.  Other biographical museums, such as many of the American presidential libraries, are housed in specially constructed buildings.\n\n\n=== Automobile museums ===\nThere are one hundred and seven automobile museums in the United States, one in Canada, and one in the Republic of Georgia according to the National Association of Automobile Museums. Automobile Museums are for car fans, collectors, enthusiasts, and for families. \u201cThey speak to the imagination,\u201d says Ken Gross, a former museum director who now curates auto exhibits at the fine arts museum.\nAs time goes by, more and more museums dedicated to classic cars of yesteryear are opening. Many of the old classics come to life once the original owners pass away. Some are not-for-profit while others are run as a private business.\n\n\n=== Children's museums ===\n\nChildren's museums are institutions that provide exhibits and programs to stimulate informal learning experiences for children. In contrast with traditional museums that typically have a hands-off policy regarding exhibits, children's museums feature interactive exhibits that are designed to be manipulated by children. The theory behind such exhibits is that activity can be as educational as instruction, especially in early childhood. Most children's museums are nonprofit organizations, and many are run by volunteers or by very small professional staffs.The Brooklyn Children's Museum was established in 1899 by the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. It is often regarded as the first children's museum in the United States. The idea behind the Brooklyn Children's Museum implicitly acknowledged that existing American museums were not designed with children in mind. Although museums at the turn of the century viewed themselves as institutions of public education, their exhibits were often not made accessible for children, who may have struggled with simple design features like the height of exhibit cases, or the language of interpretive labels. Furthermore, touching objects was often prohibited, limiting visitors' ability to interact with museum objects.\nThe founders of the Brooklyn Children's Museum were concerned with education and realized that no other institution had attempted to establish \"a Museum that will be of especial value and interest to young people between the ages of six and twenty years.\" Their goal was to gain children's interest and \"to stimulate their powers of observation and reflection\" as well as to \"illustrate by collections of pictures, cartoons, charts, models, maps and so on, each of the important branches of knowledge which is taught in elementary schools.\"Anna Billings Gallup, the museum's curator from 1904 to 1937, encouraged a learning technique that allowed children to \"discover\" information by themselves through touching and examining objects. Visitors to the museum were able to compare the composition, weight, and hardness of minerals, learn to use a microscope to examine natural objects, and build their own collections of natural objects to be displayed in a special room of the museum. In addition to emphasis on allowing interaction with objects, Gallup also encouraged learning through play. She believed learning at the Brooklyn Children's Museum should be \"pure fun\", and to this end developed nature clubs, held field trips, brought live animals into the museum, and hired gallery instructors to lead children in classification games about animals, shells, and minerals. Other children's museums of the early twentieth century used similar techniques that emphasized learning through experience.\nChildren's museums often emphasize experiential learning through museum interactives, sometimes leading them to have very few or no physical collection items. The Brooklyn Children's Museum and other early children's museums grew out of the tradition of natural history museums, object-centered institutions. Over the course of the twentieth century, the children's museums slowly began to discard their objects in favor of more interactive exhibits. While children's museums are a more extreme case, it is important to note that during the twentieth century, more and more museums have elected to display fewer objects and offer more interpretation than museums of the nineteenth century. Some scholars argue that objects, while once critical to the definition of a museum, are no longer considered vital to many institutions because they are no longer necessary to fulfill the roles we expect museums to serve as museums focus more on programs, education, and their visitors.After the Brooklyn Children's Museum opened in 1899, other American museums followed suit by opening small children's sections of their institutions designed with children in mind and equipped with interactive activities, such as the Smithsonian's children's room opened in 1901. The Brooklyn Children's Museum also inspired other children's museums either housed separately or even developed completely independently of parent museums, like the Boston Children's Museum (1913), The Children's Museum of Detroit Public Schools (1915), and the Children's Museum of Indianapolis (1925). The number of children's museums in the United States continued to grow over the course of the twentieth century, with over 40 museums opened by the 1960s and more than 70 children's museums opened to the public between 1990 and 1997.International professional organizations of children's museums include the Association of Children's Museums (ACM), which was formed in 1962 as the American Association of Youth Museums (AAYM) and in 2007 counted 341 member institutions in 23 countries, and The Hands On! Europe Association of Children's Museum (HO!E), established in 1994, with member institutions in 34 countries as of 2007. Many museums that are members of ACM offer reciprocal memberships, allowing members of one museum to visit all the others for free.\n\n\n=== Community Museums ===\n\nA community museum is a museum serving as an exhibition and gathering space for specific identity groups or geographic areas. In contrast to traditional museums, community museums are commonly multidisciplinary, and may simultaneously exhibit the history, social history, art, or folklore of their communities. They emphasize collaboration with \u2013 and relevance to \u2013 visitors and other stakeholders.\n\n\n=== Design museums ===\n\nA design museum is a museum with a focus on product, industrial, graphic, fashion, and architectural design.\nMany design museums were founded as museums for applied arts or decorative arts and started only in the late 20th century to collect design. Pop-up wndr museum of Chicago was purposefully made to provide visitors with interesting selfie backgrounds.\n\n\n=== Encyclopedic museums ===\n\nEncyclopedic museums are large, mostly national, institutions that offer visitors a plethora of information on a variety of subjects that tell both local and global stories. The aim of encyclopedic museums is to provide examples of each classification available for a field of knowledge. \"When 3% of the world's population, or nearly 200 million people, living outside the country of their birth, encyclopedic museums play an especially important role in the building of civil society. They encourage curiosity about the world.\" James Cuno, President and Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, along with Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum, are two of the most outspoken museum professionals who support encyclopedic museums. They state that encyclopedic museums are advantageous for society by exposing museum visitors to a wide variety of cultures, engendering a sense of a shared human history.  Some scholars and archaeologists, however, argue against encyclopedic museums because they remove cultural objects from their original cultural setting, losing their context.\n\n\n=== Ethnology or ethnographic museums ===\n\nEthnology museums are a type of museum that focus on studying, collecting, preserving and displaying artifacts and objects concerning ethnology and anthropology. This type of museum usually were built in countries possessing diverse ethnic groups or significant numbers of ethnic minorities.  An example is the Ozurgeti History Museum, an ethnographic museum in Georgia.\n\n\n=== Historic house museums ===\n\nWithin the category of history museums, historic house museums are the most numerous. The earliest projects for preserving historic homes began in the 1850s under the direction of individuals concerned with the public good and the preservation of American history, especially centered on the first president. Since the establishment of America's first historic site at Washington's Revolutionary headquarters at Hasbrouck House in New York, Americans have found a penchant for preserving similar historical structures. The establishment of historic house museums increased in popularity through the 1970s and 1980s as the Revolutionary bicentennial set off a wave of patriotism and alerted Americans to the destruction of their physical heritage. The tradition of restoring homes of the past and designating them as museums draws on the English custom of preserving ancient buildings and monuments. Initially homes were considered worthy of saving because of their associations with important individuals, usually of the elite classes, like former presidents, authors, or businessmen. Increasingly, Americans have fought to preserve structures characteristic of a more typical American past that represents the lives of everyday people including minorities.\n \nWhile historic house museums compose the largest section within the historic museum category, they usually operate with small staffs and on limited budgets. Many are run entirely by volunteers and often do not meet the professional standards established by the museum industry. An independent survey conducted by Peggy Coats in 1990 revealed that sixty-five percent of historic house museums did not have a full-time staff and 19 to 27 percent of historic homes employed only one full-time employee. Furthermore, the majority of these museums operated on less than $50,000 annually. The survey also revealed a significant disparity in the number of visitors between local house museums and national sites. While museums like Mount Vernon and Colonial Williamsburg were visited by over one million tourists a year, more than fifty percent of historic house museums received less than 5,000 visitors per year.These museums are also unique in that the actual structure belongs to the museum collection as a historical object. While some historic home museums are fortunate to possess a collection containing many of the original furnishings once present in the home, many face the challenge of displaying a collection consistent with the historical structure. Some museums choose to collect pieces original to the period while not original to the house. Others, fill the home with replicas of the original pieces reconstructed with the help of historic records. Still other museums adopt a more aesthetic approach and use the homes to display the architecture and artistic objects.   Because historic homes have often existed through different generations and have been passed on from one family to another, volunteers and professionals also must decide which historical narrative to tell their visitors. Some museums grapple with this issue by displaying different eras in the home's history within different rooms or sections of the structure. Others choose one particular narrative, usually the one deemed most historically significant, and restore the home to that particular period.\n\n\n=== History museums ===\n\nHistory museums cover the knowledge of history and its relevance to the present and future. Some cover specialized curatorial aspects of history or a particular locality; others are more general. Such museums contain a wide range of objects, including documents, artifacts of all kinds, art, archaeological objects. Antiquities museums specialize in more archaeological findings.\nA common type of history museum is a historic house. A historic house may be a building of special architectural interest, the birthplace or home of a famous person, or a house with an interesting history. Local and national governments often create museums to their history.  The United States has many national museums for historical topics, such as the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Historic sites can also serve as museums, such as the museum at Ford's Theater in Washington D.C.  The U.S. National Park Service defines a historic site as the \"location of a significant event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or structure, whether standing, ruined, or vanished, where the location itself possesses historic, cultural, or archeological value regardless of the value of any existing structure.\"\n\nHistoric sites can also mark public crimes, such as Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh, Cambodia or Robben Island, South Africa. Similar to museums focused on public crimes, museums attached to memorials of public crimes often contain a history component, as is the case at the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum.  History museums may concern more general crimes and atrocities, such as American slavery.  Often these museums are connected to a particular example, such as the proposed International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina, which will treat slavery as an institution with a particular focus on slavery in Charleston and South Carolina's Lowcountry.  Museums in cities like Charleston, South Carolina must interact with a broader heritage tourism industry where the history of the majority population is traditionally privileged over the minority.Many specialized museums have been established such as the National LGBT Museum in New York City and the National Women's History Museum planned for the National Mall. The majority of museums across the country that tell state and local history also follow this example. Other museums have a problem interpreting colonial histories, especially at Native American historic sites. However, museums such as the National Museum of the American Indian and Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture and Lifeways in Michigan are working to share authority with indigenous groups and decolonize museums.Another type of history museum is a living history museum. A living history museum is an outdoor museum featuring reenactors in period costume, and historic or reconstructed buildings. Colonial Williamsburg is a living history museum in Virginia that represents the colony on the eve of the American Revolution in the 18th century. The 301 acre historic area includes hundreds of buildings, in their original locations, but mostly reconstructed.\n\n\n=== Living history museums ===\n\nLiving history museums combine historic architecture, material culture, and costumed interpretation with natural and cultural landscapes to create an immersive learning environment. These museums include the collection, preservation or interpretation of material culture, traditional skills, and historical processes. Recreated historical settings simulating past time periods can offer the visitor a sense of traveling back in time. They are a type of open-air museum.\nTwo main interpretation styles dominate the visitor experience at living history museums: first and third person interpretation. In first person interpretation, interpreters assume the persona, including the speech patterns, behaviors, views, and dress of a historical figure from the museum's designated time period. In third person interpretation, the interpreters openly acknowledge themselves to be a contemporary of the museum visitor. The interpreter is not restricted by being in-character and can speak to the visitor about society from a modern-day perspective.\nThe beginnings of the living history museum can be traced back to 1873 with the opening of the Skansen Museum near Stockholm, Sweden. The museum's founder, Artur Hazelius, began the museum by using his personal collection of buildings and other cultural materials of pre-industrial society. This museum began as an open-air museum and, by 1891, had several farm buildings in which visitors could see exhibits and where guides demonstrated crafts and tools.For years, living history museums were relatively nonexistent outside of Scandinavia, though some military garrisons in North America used some living history techniques. Living history museums in the United States were initially established by entrepreneurs, such as John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford, and since then have proliferated within the museum world. Some of the earliest living history museums in the United States include Colonial Williamsburg (1926), Greenfield Village (1929), Conner Prairie Pioneer Settlement (1930s), Old Sturbridge Village (1946), and Plimoth Plantation (1947). Many living history farms and similar farm and agricultural museums have united under an association known as the Association for Living History, Farm, and Agricultural Museums (ALHFAM).\n\n\n=== Maritime museums ===\n\nMaritime museums are museums that specialize in the presentation of maritime history, culture, or archaeology. They explore the relationship between societies and certain bodies of water. Just as there is a wide variety of museum types, there are also many different types of maritime museums. First, as mentioned above, maritime museums can be primarily archaeological. These museums focus on the interpretation and preservation of shipwrecks and other artifacts recovered from a maritime setting. A second type is the maritime history museum, dedicated to educating the public about humanity's maritime past. Examples are the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park and Mystic Seaport. Military-focused maritime museums are a third variety, of which the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum and Battleship IOWA Museum are examples.\n\n\n=== Medical museums ===\n\nMedical museums today are largely an extinct subtype of museum with a few notable exceptions, such as the M\u00fctter Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in Glasgow, Scotland. The origins of the medical museum date back to Renaissance cabinets of curiosities which often featured displays of human skeletal material and other materia medica. Apothecaries and physicians collected specimens as a part of their professional activities and to increase their professional status among their peers. As the medical profession placed greater emphasis on teaching and the practice of materia medica in the late 16th century, medical collections became a fundamental component of a medical student's education. New developments in preserving soft tissue samples long term in spirits appeared in the 17th century, and by the mid-18th-century physicians like John Hunter were using personal anatomical collections as teaching tools. By the early 19th century, many hospitals and medical colleges in Great Britain had built sizable teaching collections. In the United States, the nation's first hospital, the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, already had a collection of plaster casts and crayon drawings of the stages of pregnancy as early as 1762.Medical museums functioned as an integral part of medical students education through the 19th century and into the early 20th century. Dry and wet anatomical specimens, casts, drawings, oil paintings, and photographs provided a means for medical students to compare healthy anatomical specimens with abnormal, or diseased organs. Museums, like the M\u00fctter Museum, added medical instruments and equipment to their collections to preserve and teach the history of the medical profession. By the 1920s, medical museums had reached their nadir and began to wane in their importance as institutes of medical knowledge and training. Medical teaching shifted towards training medical students in hospitals and laboratories, and over the course of the 20th century most medical museums disappeared from the museum horizon. The few surviving medical museums, like the M\u00fctter Museum, have managed to survive by broadening their mission of preserving and disseminating medical knowledge to include the general public, rather than exclusively catering to medical professionals.\n\n\n=== Memorial museums ===\n\nMemorial museums are museums dedicated both to educating the public about and commemorating a specific historic event, usually involving mass suffering. The concept gained traction throughout the 20th century as a response to the numerous and well publicized mass atrocities committed during that century. The events commemorated by memorial museums tend to involve mostly civilian victims who died under \"morally problematic circumstances\" that cannot easily be interpreted as heroic. There are frequently unresolved issues concerning the identity, culpability, and punishment of the perpetrators of these killings and memorial museums often play an active research role aimed at benefiting both the victims and those prosecuting the perpetrators.Today there are numerous memorial museums including the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Toul Sleng Museum of Genocidal Crimes in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, the District Six Museum in Cape Town, South Africa, and the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City. Although the concept of a memorial museum is largely a product of the 20th century, there are museums of this type that focus on events from other periods, an example being the House of Slaves (Maisons des Esclaves) in Senegal which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978 and acts as a museum and memorial to the Atlantic slave trade.\nMemorial museums differ from traditional history museums in several key ways, most notably in their dual mission to incorporate both a moral framework for and contextual explanations of an event. While traditional history museums tend to be in neutral institutional settings, memorial museums are very often situated at the scene of the atrocity they seek to commemorate. Memorial museums also often have close connections with, and advocate for, a specific clientele who have a special relationship to the event or its victims, such as family members or survivors, and regularly hold politically significant special events.  Unlike many traditional history museums, memorial museums almost always have a distinct, overt political and moral message with direct ties to contemporary society. The following mission statement of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is typical in its focus on commemoration, education and advocacy:\n\"The museum's primary mission is to advance and disseminate knowledge about this unprecedented tragedy; to preserve the memory of those who suffered; and to encourage its visitors to reflect upon the moral and spiritual questions raised by the events of the Holocaust as well as their own responsibilities as citizens of a democracy.\"\n\n\n=== Military and war museums ===\n\nMilitary museums specialize in military histories; they are often organized from a national point of view, where a museum in a particular country will have displays organized around conflicts in which that country has taken part. They typically include displays of weapons and other military equipment, uniforms, wartime propaganda, and exhibits on civilian life during wartime, and decorations, among others. A military museum may be dedicated to a particular or area, such as the Imperial War Museum Duxford for military aircraft, Deutsches Panzermuseum for tanks, the Lange Max Museum for the Western Front (World War I), the International Spy Museum for espionage, The National World War I Museum for World War I, the \"D-Day Paratroopers Historical Center\" (Normandy) for WWII airborne, or more generalist, such as the Canadian War Museum or the Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e. The U.S. Army and the state National Guards operate 98 military history museums across the United States and three abroad. For the Italian alpine wall one can find the most popular museum of bunkers in the small museum n8bunker at Olang / Kronplatz in the heard of the dolomites of South Tyrol.\n\n\n=== Mobile museums ===\nMobile museum is a term applied to museums that make exhibitions from a vehicle- such as a van. Some institutions, such as St. Vital Historical Society and the Walker Art Center, use the term to refer to a portion of their collection that travels to sites away from the museum for educational purposes. Other mobile museums have no \"home site\", and use travel as their exclusive means of presentation. University of Louisiana in Lafayette has also created a mobile museum as part of the graduate program in History. The project is called Museum on the Move.\n\n\n=== Natural history museums ===\n\nMuseums of natural history and natural science typically exhibit work of the natural world. The focus lies on nature and culture. Exhibitions educate the public on natural history, dinosaurs, zoology, oceanography, anthropology, and more. Evolution, environmental issues, and biodiversity are major areas in natural science museums. Notable museums include the Natural History Museum in London, the Oxford University Museum of Natural History in Oxford, the Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, and the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\n\n=== Open-air museums ===\n\nOpen-air museums collect and re-erect old buildings at large outdoor sites, usually in settings of re-created landscapes of the past. The first one was King Oscar II's collection near Oslo in Norway, opened in 1881. In 1907, it was incorporated into the Norsk Folkemuseum.  In 1891, inspired by a visit to the open-air museum in Oslo, Artur Hazelius founded the Skansen in Stockholm, which became the model for subsequent open-air museums in Northern and Eastern Europe, and eventually in other parts of the world. Most open-air museums are located in regions where wooden architecture prevail, as wooden structures may be translocated without substantial loss of authenticity. A more recent but related idea is realized in ecomuseums, which originated in France.\n\n\n=== Pop-up museums ===\nA concept developed in the 1990s, the pop-up museum is generally defined as a short term institution existing in a temporary space. These temporary museums are finding increasing favor among more progressive museum professionals as a means of direct community involvement with objects and exhibition. Often, the pop-up concept relies solely on visitors to provide both the objects on display and the accompanying labels with the professionals or institution providing only the theme of the pop-up and the space in which to display the objects, an example of shared historical authority. Due to the flexibility of the pop-up museums and their rejection of traditional structure, even these latter provisions need not be supplied by an institution; in some cases the themes have been chosen collectively by a committee of interested participants while exhibitions designated as pop-ups have been mounted in places as varied as community centers and even a walk-in closet.\nSome examples of pop-up museums include:\n\nSanta Cruz Museum of Art and History (MAH), which currently hosts collaborative Pop Up Museums around Santa Cruz County.\nMuseum of New Art (MONA) \u2013 founded in Detroit, Michigan in 1996 this contemporary art museum is generally acknowledged to be the pioneer of the concept of the pop-up museum.\nThe Pop-Up Museum of Queer History \u2013 a series of pop-up museum events held at various sites across the United States focusing on the history and stories of local LGBT communities.\nDenver Community Museum \u2013 a pop-up museum that existed for nine months during 2008\u201309, located in downtown Denver, Colorado.\nMuseum of Motherhood, displayed in and around New York City from 2011 to 2014, now located in St. Petersburg, FL.\n\n\n=== Science museums ===\n\nScience museums and technology centers or technology museums revolve around scientific achievements, and marvels and their history. To explain complicated inventions, a combination of demonstrations, interactive programs and thought-provoking media are used. Some museums may have exhibits on topics such as computers, aviation, railway museums, physics, astronomy, and the animal kingdom. The Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago is a very popular museum.\nScience museums traditionally emphasize cultural heritage through objects of intrinsic value, echoes of the 'curiosity cabinets' of the Renaissance period. These early museums of science represented a fascination with collecting which emerged in the fifteenth century from 'an attempt to manage the empirical explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication and exchange had produced. Science museums were institutions of authoritative, uncontestable, knowledge, places of 'collecting, seeing and knowing, places where \"anybody\" might come and survey the evidence of science. Dinosaurs, extensive invertebrate and vertebrate collections, plant taxonomies, and so on \u2013 these were the orders of the day. By the nineteenth century, science museums had flourished, and with it 'the capacity of exhibitionary representation to render the world as visible and ordered... part of the instantiation of wider senses of scientific and political certainty' (MacDonald, 1998: 11). By the twentieth century, museums of science had built 'on their earlier emphasis on public education to present themselves as experts in the mediation between the obscure world of science and that of the public.\n\nThe nineteenth century also brought a proliferation of science museums with roots in technical and industrial heritage museums.  Ordinarily, visitors individually interact with exhibits, by a combination of manipulating, reading, pushing, pulling, and generally using their senses. Information is carefully structured through engaging, interactive displays. Science centers include interactive exhibits that respond to the visitor's action and invite further response, as well as hands-on exhibits that do not offer feedback to the visitor, In general, science centers offer 'a decontextualized scattering of interactive exhibits, which can be thought of as exploring stations of ideas' usually presented in small rooms or galleries, with scant attention paid to applications of science, social political contexts, or moral and ethical implications.\nBy the 1960s, these interactive science centers with their specialized hands-on galleries became prevalent. The Exploratorium in San Francisco, and the Ontario Science Centre in 1969, were two of the earliest examples of science centers dedicated to exploring scientific principles through hands-on exhibits. In the United States practically every major city has a science center with a total annual visitation of 115 million New technologies of display and new interpretive experiments mark these interactive science centers, and the mantra 'public understanding of science' aptly describes their central activity.Science museums, in particular, may consist of planetaria, or large theatre usually built around a dome. Museums may have IMAX feature films, which may provide 3-D viewing or higher quality picture. As a result, IMAX content provides a more immersive experience for people of all ages.\nAlso new virtual museums, known as Net Museums, have recently been created. These are usually websites belonging to real museums and containing photo galleries of items found in those real museums. This new presentation is very useful for people living far away who wish to see the contents of these museums.\n\n\n=== Specialized museums ===\n\nA number of different museums exist to demonstrate a variety of topics. Music museums may celebrate the life and work of composers or musicians, such as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio, or even the Rimsky-Korsakov Apartment and Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Other music museums include live music recitals, such as the Handel House Museum in London, England.\nIn Glendale, Arizona, the Bead Museum  fosters an appreciation and understanding of the global, historical, cultural, and artistic significance of beads and related artifacts dating as far back as 15,000 years. Also residing in the American Southwest are living history towns such as Tombstone, Arizona. This historical town is home to a number of \"living history\" museums (such as the O.K. Corral and the Tombstone Epitaph) in which visitors can learn about historical events from actors playing the parts of historical figures like Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and John Clum. Colonial Williamsburg (in Williamsburg, Virginia), is another great example of a town devoted to preserving the story of America through reenactment.\n\nSouth Korea is host to the world's first museum devoted to the history and development of organic farming, the Namyangju Organic Museum, with exhibit captions in both Korean and English, and which opened in 2011.The No Show Museum, based in Zurich and Johannesburg, is the world's first museum dedicated to nothing and its various manifestations throughout the history of art.\nMuseums targeted for youth, such as children's museums or toy museums in many parts of the world, often exhibit interactive and educational material on a wide array of topics, for example, the Museum of Toys and Automata in Spain. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum and the \"Borusseum\", the museum about Borussia Dortmund in Dortmund, Germany, are institutions of the sports category. The Corning Museum of Glass is devoted to the art, history, and science of glass. The National Museum of Crime & Punishment explores the science of solving crimes. The Great American Dollhouse Museum in Danville, Kentucky, depicts American social history in miniature. Interpretation centres are modern museums or visitors centres that often use new means of communication with the public. In some cases, museums cover an extremely wide range of topics together, such as the Museum of World Treasures in Wichita, KS. In other instances, museums emphasize regional culture and natural history, such as the Regional Museum of the National University of San Martin, Tarapoto, Peru. The Museum of Salt and Pepper Shakers shows the history and variety of an everyday item.\n\n\n=== Virtual museums ===\nA development, with the expansion of the web, is the establishment of virtual museums and online exhibitions. Online initiatives like the Virtual Museum of Canada and the National Museum of the United States Air Force provide physical museums with a web presence. Online curatorial platforms such as Rhizome or the Archive of Digital Art (ADA) developed online exhibitions that transform the museal experience within the digital space.\nSome virtual museums have no counterpart in the real world, such as LIMAC (Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo de Lima), which has no physical location and might be confused with the city's own museum. The art historian Griselda Pollock elaborated a virtual feminist museum, spreading between classical art to contemporary art.Some real life museums are also using the internet for virtual tours and exhibitions. In 2010, the Whitney Museum in New York organized what it called the first ever online Twitter museum tour.\n\n\n=== Zoological parks and botanic gardens ===\n\nAlthough zoos and botanical gardens are not often thought of as museums, they are in fact \"living museums\". They exist for the same purpose as other museums: to educate, inspire action, and to study, develop, and manage collections. They are also managed much like other museums and face the same challenges. Notable zoos include the San Diego Zoo, the London Zoo, Brookfield Zoo at Chicago, Berlin Zoological Garden, the Bronx Zoo in New York City, Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, Jardin des Plantes in Paris, and Z\u00fcrich Zoologischer Garten in Switzerland. Notable botanic gardens include The New York Botanical Garden, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Chicago Botanic Garden, Taipei Botanical Garden, Bogor Botanical Garden, and Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario).\n\n\n== See also ==\n Museums portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBennett, Tony (1995).

        "wiki": "The Holy Trinity Church (German: Dreifaltigkeitskirche) is a Roman Catholic church in Salzburg, Austria.  It was designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church is designed as a central building and was built in the years 1694\u20131702. Authority of the church and the seminary was the founder Prince Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun. The contract was carried out in 1694, the consecration of the partly unfinished church took place in 1699. The church, together with the same time build St. John's Church (hospital church) the first building designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach in Salzburg. He used as models various religious buildings in Rome\u2014especially Francesco Borromini's Church Sant'Agnese in Agone in Piazza Navona. While the church is characterized by a discreet use of decorative elements, the entire structure conveys a palatial impression. In addition to Fischer von Erlach and Bernhard Michael Mandl, who created the dome murals, the following sculptors and stonemasons also contributed: Wolf Wei\u00dfkirchner, Mathias Wilhelm Wei\u00dfkirchner, Sebastian Stumpfegger, Andreas G\u00f6tzinger, and Lorenz Dr\u00e4xl.\n\n\n== Exterior ==\nThe construction of the Holy Trinity Church did not originally take place on Hannibal Square (present-day Makart Square), but on a narrow side street between the outer mountain road (present-day Rainerstra\u00dfe) and the Linzergasse. The pawnshop situated directly opposite the church was demolished in 1907, leaving the elevated church forecourt facing Dreifaltigkeitsgasse, forming the upper end of the Makart Square.\nThe original steeples were much lower than the present-day steeples, which were later increased for a better visibility of the church behind the pawnshop. The belfries were built in 1757, and the chief cupola towers were added after the fire of Neustadt in 1818. The overall image of the church was improved by the expanding of the towers. The church is the architectural center of a sprawling complex with the two great wings of the seminary forming a uniformly composed fa\u00e7ade with the central church representing the powerful central drum dome of the church.\nThe outer church portal is supported on the parapet in front of the dome on twin columns bearing four figures, three of which symbolize the theological virtues\u2014Faith, Hope, and Love. The fourth figure represents Divine Wisdom. All four characters have been designed by Bernhard Michael Mandl. Between the figures is the double coat of arms of the Prince Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun, connected to the Salzburger country coat of arms.\n\n\n== Interior ==\nThe church interior is a longitudinal oval room with four short barrel vaults with crossed arms, which are surmounted by the large drum dome. The monumental effect of the interior arises mainly from the simplicity of the building and the towering height of the dominant drum dome. The design is reminiscent of the inner shape of the Karlskirche in Vienna, which was the second sacral masterpiece by Fischer von Erlach.\nThe large dome fresco inside the church, Coronation of the Virgin, was executed by Johann Michael Rottmayr between 1697 and 1700. It was Rottmayr's first sacral dome fresco and shows the Coronation of the Virgin by the Holy Trinity with the assistance of the Archangel Michael, as well as other saints, angels, prophets, the ten holy popes, and the Church patriarch. The fresco sums up the Christian salvation and church history impressively together. The figures are grouped in concentrically arranged cloud banks. At the top lantern a Holy Spirit dove is present. The large dome fresco completes the impression of Baroque ecclesia triumphans, the triumphant Church, within the meaning of Baroque self-understanding of the church building.\nThe stucco work by Andrea Sallari and Johann Baptist Redi is limited in the main room to the capitals, and in the cross arms stucco boxes. The high altar was created in 1700 according to plans by Fischer von Erlach. It was revised in 1841, but was returned to its original state in 1947. The altar contains a sculptural group of the Trinity group with two adoring angels. The reliquary of St. Ernestus was designed in 1959 by Otto Prossinger. The two side altars contain magnificent life-size angels, which were designed by Fischer von Erlach and Michael Bernhard Mandl from 1700\u201302. The Marie miraculous image of the right side altar dates from the sixteenth century. The Baroque frame was carried out by Sebastian Stumpfegger.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of early modern period domes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoly Trinity Church",

The Festungsbahn opened in 1892, and should not be confused with the much older Reisszug line that provides goods access to the castle.The line is operated by Salzburg AG, who also operate the city's buses and the Salzburger Lokalbahn.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Festungsbahn opened in 1892 as a water balance funicular operated by the Salzburger Eisenbahn- und Tramwaygesellschaft. Previously used as barracks, the line made the fortress available to a broader range of visitors.The line was rebuilt with new cars and an electric drive in 1960, whilst the lower and upper stations were rebuilt in 1975 and 1976 respectively. In 1991 the line was again modernised, with the provision of new cars with an increased passenger capacity and a faster line speed.Between January and April 2011, the funicular was again modernized, at a cost of \u20ac4 million. Two new vehicles were provided and the electrical equipment replaced. Panoramic windows offer a better view of the city.\n\n\n== Operation ==\n\nThe line operates every day from 09:00.

          "The ticket price for this lift is very affordable, and the views are incredible. Not to mention the interesting buildings on the top. This also offers the best view of the Fortress. There is also a caf\u00e9 on top, so you can have a nice coffee or ice cold beer while enjoying the",
          "I hardly ever write a review - only when I am either very happy or very disappointed and upset about my experience - this time it is the latter. We hiked from the castle to M\u00f6nchsberg, had a quick look in the museum and then took what we thought was a normal lift that would",
          "You get one free ascent and descent with the Salzburg Card. Gave us a good view over the city for some photographs. Would not have bothered if not free on the card.",
          "Not that much you can really say about a lift.....it is just a regular lift, but certainly saves you the long walk up. We used this lift to get up to the viewing platforms to see the stunning panorama of Salzburg city. Our trip in the lift was free as we had purchased a Salzburg",
          "Come up here at evening ,, Just pay one way up ,, have a drink in the restaurant at the top it\u2019s gorgeous and romantic . You get a free ticket down from restaurant . The views are just stunning .",
          "Friendly personnel. After a nice long city walk great to get up to moenchsberg very fast. ;) We also did not need to wait very long to get into the elevator.",
          "We did both the Monchsberg Lift and Salzburg Fortress for the views. We found the views from the panorama terrace at Monchsberg better because you can see the Salzburg Fortress from it. It's also much cheaper (3.60 EUR compared to 11.20 EUR) and is included in the Salzburg Card.",
          "you can make this an easy hike by taking the funicular to the fortress then hiking down hill to the mostly flat trail to the modern museum which has a lift to take you to old town. you will be rewarded with fabulous views of salzburg and the river on one side and the rest of",
          "this is a must for saving your tired legs. it is much better way to get to the monchsberg walk. you'll be rewarded with beautiful views. there are a couple of restaurants there also.",
          "Though the name of the attraction suggested something special about the lift, it was pretty ordinary (I hoped it would at least be a glass-wall capsule lift, but it wasn't). However, views from the top were great, though would offer nothing extra if you plan to visit Salzburg",
          "This attraction is a little tucked away at the end of town and it's easy to miss as it's basically a covered lift shaft up to the small mountain that stands in front of the Alt Stadt. Once up there though, the views out over Salzburg are superb and low enough to pick out all",
          "I got a one month pass for 14 Euros. It was worth it. There are four ways up to the Monchsberg: the steps on the opposite end of Sigmundstor from Old Town (turn right from Neeutorstrasse), the steps and pathway from Mullner Haupstrasse and the Augustiner Brewery, the road up",
          "The lift was great, free for both my husband (who is in a wheelchair) and me. Once at the top you have the option of going in the modern art museum (we didn't go in), taking another elevator to the restaurant, or taking the steps (or stair left for wheelchair users) to the",
          "We were thrilled by the ease of using this lift to get down to Old Salzburg. I was just sorry that it was a Monday and the Art Museum which houses the lift was closed. Of course the views at the top of the lift and outside the Art Museum are wonderful, at any time of the day.",
          "Quick and convenient. Take the lift up to m32 restaurant and then explore 20 acres of gardens our medieval artefacts at top.",
          "This is a must really, the views from the berg over all of Salzburg, the restaurant is good too. If you are really fit you can walk down!",
          "The lift takes you up to the museum of modern art, but you should go up just for the views. We got amazing photos of the whole city and fortress. There is a very expensive restaurant up top. We had a beer there which was very relaxing.",
          "We had a Salzburg card and decided to end our day with a trip up the lift. It goes up the mountainside to the Modern Art Museum. The view was great, but my favourite part was the crazy washroom. It was like being on a spaceship. We didn't go to the museum, but they had a few",
          "Take the lift to get to the top with its views over the city and surrounding mountains. There is also a modern art gallery there and an open-air restaurant.",
          "We actually took the elevator to help us reach the Stadtalm Cafe atop the mountain. There was no problem finding the entrance to the lift as indicated by others because we were with a local friend. But looking back now, we would agree that it might have been difficult had we",
          "This renovated lift takes visitors to the Modern Art Gallery at the top and the posh bar. The entrance to the bottom of the lift could be more clearly signposted and the cafe/ bar staff were not the most welcoming we met in the city. Good walks along the. Edge to the Festung.",
          "We walked around for ages trying to find the lift, it's inside the museum of modern art. We went first thing in the morning, after enjoying the amazing view we decided to walk the trail to the fortress. We found many amazing viewpoints along the way. Make sure you go to the",
          "Nice lift in the middle of tunnel . It takes you to the museum where you can see whole skyline and there is a nice resturant. Entry to this lift is included in the Salzburg card. I will recommend taking it and exploring the Salzburg museum view points. Nice fast easy to use lift",
          "Place to get stunning views of all of Salzburg. We rode it up just before sunset and was able to capture the changing light over the city and fortress.",
          "We tried looking up directions but couldn't seem to find the entrance, until we realized the entrance is inside the museum of modern art. You pay for the lift up, and I'd recommend paying to take it down as well. We were told we could order a drink up top and get a free lift",
          "This is a good getaway to go to during lunch. Take the lift and have lunch. Then enjoy the walk along the fortress walls.",
          "Take the lift up to the Modern Art museum for great views. You can walk all the way along to the fortress. A good break from the crowds of visitors.",
          "Definitely worth seeing the views. If you have the Salzburg Card, this is included in it and you pay nothing extra. Also go and see the Museum der Moderne when you are up there.",
          "efficient way yo get to fortress. It is fine and clean and quick. Easy to find and well organized. Do it",
          "the lift is worth the views! \u20ac3.60 ascent and descent, however you can walk up and down. we chose to go up with the lift as it was unbearably hot. the views are fantastic! Salzburg is right below you with the fortress right in front of you! loved it, would recommend!",
          "We thought this was going to be a train, but it is an elevator and it takes you up to some fabulous views overlooking the city.",
          "If it were not for the Salzburg Card, which included that ELEVATOR ride, I wouldn't pay. Instead, I would either walk up or walk on.",
          "Great way to the top. Keep your coupon from the fortress for discount on this lift. Great to hike at the top.",
          "But the \u20ac3.60 to use the lift on its own definitely not. Make sure you have the Salzburg card. The view from the top gives you amazing panoramic views and great for amazing pixs",
          "We were short on time so we decided to go up the lift and the views were amazing from there. There is a pathway on top which leads to the castle as well and we walked half way through that. Very peaceful and enjoyable walk.",
          "Get the lift up to see the view across to the fortress and then walk along the old city wall to get back down, way way to spend a late afternoon as it's not busy and shops are closed about 6 anyway and it's not dark yet so a good walk before dinner!",
          "To get to the top, you can take the lift or opt to walk up. But be forewarned that it is a steep walk though you can always stop to catch your breath. I chose to walk up and then take the lift coming down.",
          "It's a steep hike and not one to be done at night. So why not take the Lift which has you on top of the M\u00f6nchsberg in a matter of seconds. The Museum of Modern Art is right by the Lift.",
          "Went here early morning on our way out of town. This is the place to come for great pictures and views. Regretfully we did not have a chance to get anything to eat or drink at the top.",
          "There is a restaurant at the top of this cliff and you get a beautiful view of the entire city. There is a funicular to the top of the cliff. We were advised to go here around sunset time. A must visit in salzburg",
          "Once you find the entrance it is an easy trip up. We headed up mid-morning although a lot of people say to go at sunset and I imagine it is stunning. There is a restaurant at the top where we had a coffee whilst taking in the views. We spent an hour or so up there and then",
          "A swift and efficient funicular to the top of the Monchsberg where you can see the Museum of Modern Art. Perhaps more importantly you can also enjoy the view over Salzburg showcased in 'The Sound Of Music halfway through 'Do Re Mi' - it is truly breathtaking!",
          "We headed up this lift to explore & returned to catch sunset over the city. Its a bit tricky to find the lift entrance but is reasonably cheap. We enjoyed walking over to the fortress. The views are great and the pathway, with plenty of shade, easy to follow. We did head down",
          "The Monschsberg Lift is a funicular train that takes tourists, employees and fortress and restaurant supplies to the top of Monchsberg Mountain. It is located on the side of the mountain and leads from the base of the mountain to the fortress at the top. The lift is used to",
          "We lost some time to find it, because we haven't seen any indicator to it, by coming from Getreidegasse. It's free with Salzburg Card, it's fast and the view is stunning.At this point, you can understand why Salzburg was so loved by all romantic landscape painters. Upthere, you",
          "Take the Monchsberg lift to make great photos of the Fortress and the town. If you find time take a walk to the fortress - it's a very nice path.",
          "Easy way to go up the M\u00f6nchsberg. (also possible to walk up there) On top of it you can enjoy a Museum and a Restaurant. Dont Forget to bring your camera along with you",
          "If you're looking for a great place to take photos of the city, look no further. This view was gorgeous, and for an \"experience,\" it was cheap -- 3,60 euro for up and down in the elevator. I ended taking the elevator up and then just walking down -- it wasn't bad on the descent.",
          "Interesting engineering as the shaft was carved out of the interior rock rather than being placed on the exterior wall. Lift is quick and takes you up to a location that has a nice view of the old town, river and fortress. We thought the views from the festung were more",
          "This lift is quite hard to find, but on the mountain there is a shaft which looks like the lift... walk towards it! Although it's not the lift, it's nearby! Ask the local shops to point you in its direction. We were in a group of 4. Less than 4 euros to enter! Wheelchair",
          "We had the city pass and decided to go up the lift. You get a great view of the city and a different perspective than what you see at the fortress. I'm not sure if it would be worth it without the pass, but a good excursion that can take as little or as much time as you like.",
          "The price to ride was less than 2 Euros. The elevator goes through a shaft inside the rock making it special and unusual. There is a coffee shop on the top and a modern museum which was closed. One can go hiking from here. The view from here was fanatstic.",
          "Short lift ride with a worthwhile view of the city from the top - not expensive but less so if adding to the list of attractions that you can access with the Salzburg card.",
          "... but the view from the top is quite good. There is a restaurant and a nice walkway that is well worth the 20 minute walk.",
          "We found it a little difficult at first to find this place. Earlier in the day we saw the pipe-looking object on the side of the hill near a castle. We thought this was the main castle (Hohensalzburg Fortress) and the funicular. It's not. The pipe is also not the actual elevator",
          "Many pictures I have seen of Salzburg are taken from the high walls of Fortress Hohensalzburg but they are missing one vital ingredient - and that is the castle itself. We decided to go up the opposite hillside and that meant a thirty second ride in a lift housed within a",
          "Within walking distance from the pedestrian street, the Monchsberg lift allow the visitor to have an overview of the city. There are so much to do and see within the Old Town however this side-trip to the hill top is worthwhile detour. The whole trip for the view take only",
          "Great views at the top. Access to lovely parks, restaurant at modern art gallery. Recommend with your Salzburg card as it is free.",
          "3.6 Euros for a return journey. The views over the city are wonderful. There is a caf\u00e9 with a wonderful terrace at the top or you can sit on the steps. You can walk to the fortress in circa 50 minutes if you choose.",
          "If you are a fan of the Sound of Music, like most of the tourists in Salzburg, this place shouldn't be missed. Well not the lift, but the terrace at the top. Taking the lift, beats taking the stairs and its worth a 3.50 euro. It has a great view of the city and when you come out",
          "The Monchsberg lift is a means to avoid the paths and reach directly fast. There are amazing views especially of the city and the Festung.",
          "An aerial view of Salzburg was included in our travel itinerary as we wanted to enjoy a panoramic view of the city. We were not disappointed with the magnificent views at the top of Monchsberg, which was accessible by a quick ride on a lift. Good photo shots can be taken of the",
          "my partner thought that this place was a modern art gallery and so we went there to see the art, needless to say we saw 1 exhibition room and don't understand why there is only one room. So we went outside and realised that perhaps its an outlook (no wonder why its cost so cheap",
          "This is not so much an attraction as an extremely useful transport to save you from taking long and winding paths up to the top where the museum and a few other attractions are. One round trip is free with the Salzburg card. Otherwise it's E3.60. As others have noted, the",
          "There is an entrance fee of 3.60 Euros or free with Salzburg Card. I would highly recommended this card while in Salzburg as you will have lots of free access to a lot of attractions and discounts. The lift takes you to the top of a hill with magnificent and breathtaking views.",
          "We discovered this lift when looking for the Museum of Modern Art which is most easily accessed by taking it. The lift solves one of the problems of Salzburg for many travellers. The problem is that the nature of the rock formations around the city is such that to get to vantage",
          "Speed lift took us to a high view to the whole beautiful Salzburg. There was a nice restaurant where we can sit for the sunset",
          "The lift was quick and took you to a great viewing platform to get some stunning views over the city.",
          "This offers a good city view, but we did not go into the museum of modern art at the top. It would probably be a good place to have lunch, but it was raining. Instead, we trotted down to the giant and amazing monastery pub through the park at the back of the hill and had a pint",
          "We walked up and enjoyed the climb and views. We rode down, and it seemed very overpriced for the short ride.",
          "There is a modern art gallery up here, which is very modern! It is quite easy to accidentally pay for entry to the gallery when all you want is a ride up and back in the lift. Its worth taking the time to have a good walk when you get to the top as within 5 minutes it's as",
          "The lift takes you up to an amazing view however, like someone else mentioned, it's nothing you cannot see from the Fortress. It's not worth the money they charge and there is absolutely nothing special about this lift.",
          "Bought an all inclusive ticket for the lift and Modern Art Museum. Only went to the gallery as there was an exhibition of posters from the 1900s. Great views of the city from the panorama terrace. Enjoyed strudel and a cuppa on the terace of the museum restaurant, with lovely",
          "3.60\u20ac return give you access to beautiful views over Salzburg. There is also a restaurant and the Modern Art Museum, but we just went up for the views. Did not disappoint....",
          "One trip up and down is free with the Salzberg Card but it is worth paying. The view at the top is stunning over the city and there are some nice walks up there too.",
          "Tickets were charged at 3.60\u20ac two way or a one way option at 2.20\u20ac (not too sure). It's basically just a lift up to the top floor with a view overlooking the city. It's not too bad but I prefer the view from up the fortress where you can see the Alps as well. We got the Salzburg",
          "Good lift from old part of town to Monchsberg and Museum. Did not care at all for the museum, so the 9 euros combined for museum and lift was too much. Lift takes < 30 seconds for 3 euros. Would not take again.",
          "Had I known what to expect I would have went there much earlier in the afternoon! You could spend the whole afternoon walking around overlooking Salzburg, having a nap etc or even better take a picnic with you! The forest around is beautiful, a nice castle dating back to the",
          "Have used the lift before to get to Monchsberg. From there it is a beautiful walking path to get over to the Fortress. It is up and down so go slow if you are out of shape.",
          "The Monchsberg lift is the best method to reach the top of Monchsberg. The elevator takes you to the top in seconds and it is included in the Salzburg card. The views of the town are really nice from here and also the fortress looks great from here.",
          "This a quick and easy way to get to the top of Monchsberg to get a beautiful view of the city. If you have the Salzburg Card, it is free to ride the lift. We did this immediately our first evening in Salzburg. Once on Monchsberg you can take in the view or stroll on the nice",
          "Three elevators take you to the most amazing panorama terrace in Salzburg and to the Museum of Modern Art M\u00f6nchsberg. The cost is ok ( family ticket 2 ways: 7\u20ac)",
          "This is the way to travel up to the top of the mountain to walk through the woods and to view the city. It is quick and helps those who do not want to hike the whole way or who can't hike the whole way. Beware that on Mondays when the restaurant at the Museum Moderne is closed,",
          "I don't know why there are reviews of this at all, it's an elevator. The views from up are nice, but the hill is big and the views are nice all around there. And you can easily walk there even if you are not fit. Actually you are better of walking around up at the hill, going up",
          "Fantastic view from the top, we went at sunset and watched the city lights coming on. It's included with the Salzburg card (which I also recommend). Ignore the rubbish reviews, yes it's a lift but it's clean and quick. Steps are just steps too but it's the view from the top we",
          "The lift itself is nothing to note, despite the appearance from the outside it is in fact a very modern lift like you would use in an office block but when you get out onto the winkler terrace the view is wonderful, you can see why it was used in the Sound of Music. So, if you",
          "We bought a Salzburg card. We are only in Salzburg for three nights. So I wanted to ride the Monchsberg Lift to take in the view that others on trip advisor have raved about. We in fact arrived at sunset but it was too cloudy.however, the sky was dramatic and the view stunning.",
          "It is more fun taking a trip in an hotel elevator than this one. Only dark walls and the trip was over in 30 Seconds. Next time I will walk up the mountain instead.",
          "If you plan to go to the Festung Hohensalzburg, you should jump on the lift. The climb to the Fortress is a bit taxing, and you've probably already done and will be doing enough walking to max your FitBit out. If you have the Salzburg card you get to ride this for free. The",
          "Take in the view of the city for sunset! We went just before sunset and got to watch the light change over the city. It was incredible and so peaceful!! It is part of the Salburg card pass, but it would be worth it without that perk. Be sure to go there just before 6pm so",
          "The lift was further away from the heart of Old Town than I anticipated so I had a little trouble finding it (just keep going near the sheer rock face and you'll eventually find it). I'm very glad we started our approach to the Fortress from this point as we got spectacular",
          "Salzburg has a sheer rock wall surrounding the old town and the lift brings you to a nice outlook over the city on top of this wall. As you come to the top, there is the modern museum however we were rather disappointed with the current exhibition at the Modern Museum end of",
          "Again depending on how much time you have to see this beautiful city, it is an interesdting trip up yo the top.",
          "With a few euros or no euros if you have the Salzburg card you get to see the best view of the city. Those lifts are built inside the rock. The best lifts and the best view you will ever see.",
          "It was many years since my last visit when the lift took one directly to the splendid old Cafe Winkler on to of the Monchsberg. The terrace of the former restaurant offered the best view of the old city, with an added benefit of fine dining, plus old world charm and service.",
          "The lift itself is just an elevator...but at the top you have an amazing view of the city (great location from which to take photos of the fortress and the cathedral), paths for hiking in the woods, and eventually you can hike about 3/4 of a mile to a mile and end up about half",
          "You can see the Salzburg castel and top down to the city from another side. The cafe in morden musum has great view of these.",
          "Paid the small fee and took the lift - skipped the museum of modern art at the top, and spent the afternoon wandering around the top of Monchsberg. Beautiful paths, a few mini-castles, and phenomenal views. Perfect for Sunday afternoon strolling!",
          "it takes you up to the top of the cliff and the view over old town is wonderful. it is clean and fast.",
          "We spent hours at the top of Monchsberg, wandering the beautiful paths and looking out at the breathtaking views. There are a number of beautiful buildings to discover and a great view of the Alps that is not visible from the city of Salzburg. A nice place for a walk - no matter",
          "I have been taking this lift ever since I started going to Salzburg, and it has been great. UNTIL they remodeled it and ruined all the ambience it held. It is a great way to get to the top of the mountain, but that is all I can say. It is also more expensive since the remodel.",
          "For \u20ac3,50 the lift takes you to the top of the mountain. A panoramic view of the city lied below. Museums, forts and walking paths await you at the top. The view alone is worth the price.",
          "Ok...let's not get too excited about this attraction...it's an elevator. Yes, it does go up the interior of a mountain, so that's pretty cool. The views at the top are nothing short of spectacular. Still, you can save yourself the money by taking the stairs if you are fit",
          "This was an ultra modern lift which took us from our hotel into the city of Salzburg. Our hotel gave us a free pass and we used it several times a day. Quick and efficient.",
          "We used the lift frequently during our stay to go to and from our hotel (Schloss Monchstein). It's fast and convenient. Our hotel gave us free passes for our stay, which made it even better.",
          "This is just a normal lift situated inside the Monchsberg hill. A ride up is around 2.50 euro I believe but is free with the Salzburg card. The lift takes you to the Museum of Modern Art. Here on the hill is the terrace used for filming scenes from The Sound Of Music, the",
          "You have to pay to go up and down the lift so best to get a round trip ticket. The staff did not let us know that they charged both directions before we got one way tickets to the top.",
          "We were not sure how we were going to get up to see the Salzburg Fortress thinking we have to walk up until we saw the lift. It is in the rear of old town and easy to miss the entrance. The ride up is relatively fast and takes you right to the fortress. The only way to go.",
          "went to top of this attraction by the lift the panoramic views are amazing and also the museum is interesting",
          "Couldn't work out how to get up to the top of Salzburg... using google maps. Then we found this lift... perfect solution",
          "The steps are very tiring so take the loft if you can for the spectacular views! The views from Museum of Modern Art are great but if you want the spot for wow photos carry on round the Tarmac path and find the Humboldt Terrace and here you get a better aspect of the river. Set",
          "Was very busy when we visited and the staff in ticket booths were grumpy and far from helpful . We went up anyway and good to see how lift works and good views on the way",
          "The lift takes you up to the modern art museum but the viewing terrace is the sell here. Great views of Salzburg. The views from the fortress are better but from here you can actually see the fortress!",
          "Used our Salzburg card, admission free & use of the lift. Great views of Salzburg & surrounding landscape. Great photos",
          "The view from Monchsberg is a treat, especially early evening when the lights start appearing all over town. You can have a lovely stroll especially if the weather is nice. If you take the lift up - perhaps walk back down, it really is great scenery. You will pay to use the",
          "We did not have time to visit the Museum of Modern Art (modern art is not our thing, anyway), but we were told the views from the top are among the best in Salzburg. They are. Once at the top, you can walk around the grounds with some modern sculptures in them, eat in the",
          "We walked from the fortress along the Monchsberg path, which was a pleasant stroll in an urban park environment. Plenty of birds and scenic opportunities along the walk. We ended taking the lift down to the city after the walk,",

          "Ok, it#s easier to be taken to the top of Monchsberg than walk, but you'll be missing on a great view. You'll be in the metal box in the mountain deprived of any sight, which is a pitty. Don't be lazy and climb those stairs! Of course, for those who are of poor health or for",
          "The lift is not anything so exciting but the view from the top over Salzburg is wonderful. You can take a one way ticket up and then walk down. Sit and have a drink or lunch on a beautiful patio at the modern art museum at the top if its a nice day. Afterwards, we walked the",
          "Good views of Salzburg but mostly just an easy way to get to modern art museum, combo ticket available.",
          "To the top and back down for 3.50 Euro is not bad considering the stunning views that greet you at the top.. I certainly wouldn't want to walk up there in a hurry!",
          "There are 3 modern lifts hidden away as part of entrance to modern art museum (which was closed on Monday). The views of old city was worth the ride up.",
          "Amazing views of the city and the castle from an alternative viewpoint. And cheap compared to the cost of a trip to the castle. Nice cafe for a snack or a drink.",
          "Lovely view if not a walker but not inexpensive .Another option is to visit the modern art museum at the top of the hill overlooking Salzburg( price includes the use of a closed lift super modern and fast that takes you the top and from there you can walk to the fortress .the",
          "Took a wee bit of finding but well worth the views on the way up to the fortress. Nip round the corner for fresh made bread rolls from the St Peter's bakery.",
          "This is the cheaper option to get a great view of the river and city. There are concessions if you need them. If you have time then there is also the museum. The view itself is worth the time and puts the area into perspective. There is a restaurant at the top which is",
          "Got to do this. It is a fun and easy way to get up to the fortress. Great views while going up and down .",
          "Nothing remarkable about the lift, but you get great views at the top - well worth it if you combine with the entry to the museum at the top (inclusive ticket at a decent price)",
          "Great view of the city an ideal place to take the classic photograph of the city scape. Just a quick trip in the lift which is a standard lift and nothing exceptional.",
          "If you are travelling and visit Salzburg, do not ever miss the complete city view; impressive! Also - for a special meal - out on the terrace - experience not to be missed!",
          "It is an elevator. It takes you to somewhere you want to go - either the top of the hill (me to hike) or the Museum of Modern Art",
          "Inexpensive way to ascend to the viewpoint. Once there, take a break and have a drink on the terrace enjoying the city views, then walk along to enjoy wider views.",
          "Use the lift to get up to the museum, or the cafe inside. Then go for a hike if you so desire. The views are fantastic. We were there in the late winter so a bit of snow on the ground made it special...though tougher to walk in.",
          "It's worth taking the lift up to the Museum of Modern Art for the views over Salzburg. The Museum itself was partly closed when we visited so there wasn't a lot to see but the views made up for that. The restaurant also had wonderful views but when we visited the menu was",
          "The lift to the Monchberg Ridge Trail was reasonable and fast. Once up to the trail, enjoy the walk and the view. Walking to the end you will find the Nonnberg Priory. Enjoy the quiet atmosphere here.",
          "Man, that was some walk. Around 2 km of mountain hiking. We took the elevator up amd walked up from there to the fortress. Unbelievable view fro the top.",
          "We were staying at the Hotel Schloss Monstein who provided us with lift passes for the duration of our stay. Fabulous to just go (literally) down town for the day, evening or at will!",
          "Spectacular panoramic views of the Fortress, Old Town & New Town. The view never gets old \u2013 morning, mid-day, or evening! This setting was also used in the Sound Of Music film. A must see! Although we did not go, a museum and restaurant are there as well.",
          "The view from the top of the Monchberg is stunning. We enjoyed walking along the remnant of the old wall that protected the city during the Middle Ages.",
          "Worth the money, especially on a hot clear day. We would have liked to do the walk up there with the kids but unfortunately no time. The view is still fabulous though. A to-do thing in Salzburg. Definitely.",
          "An easy way to the top of one of the hills with a good view back down to the river, city and across to the Fort. Also good access to the paths along the top of the hill.",
          "The ride to the Monchberg is in a very fast elevator inside the mountain. Once on top there is a possibility to have leisurely walk in the forest and visit the Museum of modern art.",
          "I wouldn't say this was a must do attraction. The views from the top, however, are really nice. It is free with the Salzburg card.",
          "The Moenchsberg Lift is a lazy way of getting to enjoy the view over Salzburg city, the surrounding hills and other monuments. Those who do not mind a 15 minutes walk up the hill can do so and save the 2 EUR for the lift.",
          "There are 2 ways to get up onto Monchsberg- the lift/elevator and the funicular/cable car. The lift is in the modern museum on the northwest side of the Altstadt. It is quite a walk to the fortress but has great views and is quite nice (not incredibly well marked though). The",
          "great way to see the salzburg from the top! if you eat at the restaurant m32 you only have to pay for your way up!",
          "It's a quick and easy way to get onto the Moenchsberg and only 2 Euro. It's definitely worth spending the money. On the top you have a wonderful panorama view of the city. For the full experience walk along the path to reach the other side of the mountain and enjoy the view.",
          "Well hyped and historic. I was expecting a history display, rock walls and an interesting ascent. Honestly, it is not much different from the elevator in your office building. You enter the base through a wide open area, pay at the window, go through the turnstile, and ride",
          "Handy to go to and from Moenchstein to the old city level. We had complementary passes from our hotel - I don't know how much it'd cost, it's only saving some 10 mins walk but in the Heath of the summer it's worth it.",
          "Good way to go up to the museum of modern art and the castle above! Nice personnel. We forgot our tickets in the room and they Ley us up anyway. Open very late at night. Saves you money for cabs!",
          "Visiting the Monchsberg Rock when you are in Salzburg is a must. The easiest access, unless you fancy the hike, is via the lift on Gstattengasse which takes you to the Museum of Modern Art. A return ticket is \u20ac3.50 (you can get a single if you are eating in the restaurants on",

          "there are two lifts in town, 1 to take you up to the fortress and this one that takes you up to the modern art museum. The great thing about this lift is once you are on top you can wander around the forest trails, sit up at the modern art museum to have a drink or a meal in",
          "The Monchsberg elevator is relatively inexpensive [E3.40 round trip or free w/ Salzburg Card]. This goes to top of the Monchsberg to see the Museum of Modern Art, 2 restaurants or to go hiking which is what we did. The elevator is quick & easy, it is a fun way to get to top",
          "Things which may be helpful: 1) The elevator is not well marked but is on the west side of town under the Modern Art Museum; 2) Inexpensive at about 2 Euro each way; 3) This is the best way to the Stadtalm Care and Modern Art Museum, but not to the Fortress. We took the lift to",
          "In every city, one should find a nice, high location for pictures. This is the one. I paid just for the trip up the hill, and walked my way back to town through the forest paths. The view from above is awesome, and you won't get lost, there are signs explaining all directions.",
          "This was covered by our salzburg card (infact the card really makes sense if you are going to Untersberg) and we went to the top by the lift. the views of salzburg city are really nice, The fortress looks awesome from here.",
          "Really enjoyed the cable car ride up the mountain. Beautiful views and a nice smooth ride. This was also included in the price of the Salzburg card.",
          "It's a good way to get on the top of the hill. Ride itself wasn't anything special. The car was so full of people that we hardly saw anything during the ride.",
          "The walk up to the fortress is steep! We took the lift up and walked down. The views were stunning at sunset.",
          "It is a fast and painless way onto the top and the museum of modern art. Once up there the views are great and it is a lovely 30 minute walk ( decidedly not level at the end) to the fortress through beech woods and with great views most of the way.",
          "The view from the top is pretty spectacular and different enough from the views from the fortress to make it worth your while. Once you're up there, hiking trails run all the way over to Nonnberg Abbey if you're so inclined. We had the Salzburg pass and didn't realize it was",
          "We walked up to the Fortress. It was super hard. My fitbit counted it as 66 floors. We were happy that the ride down on the lift was included in the price of admission.",
          "The best view over old town and the castle can be enjoyed from up here. You can either walk down from the castle or make it easy and take the elevator. You won't be disappointed.",
          "We hiked up the mountain once and took the lift down. For 2euro if someone in your party wants the magnificent views but not the strenuous stair climb it's great.",
          "This lift which takes you up from the Museum of Modern Art to the second Museum at the top of the mountain is a must do for any visit to Salzburg. The views of the city, the river and the Hohensalzburg Fortress which looms over the city and dominates your view from most",
          "We took the lift up at night. I was hoping it was going to be what looks like a very old looking lift you can see on the cliff face, which worried my wife, but it was actually a very modern lift inside the rock. we had a Salzburg card, so it was \"free\". We went up at night,",
          "We had a 24 hour Salzburg Card and were aiming to cover as many things as we could within this time. The Moenchberg lift was open until 9pm as it was a Wednesday and we decided it would be perfect to view Salzburg, from above and at night. We went up about 8pm. There was no",
          "Probably not worth the money if one of your likes is walking. If you're lazy, take the lift. The lift also takes you to the Museum of Modern Art.",
          "It's free if you have the Salzburg Card! The lobby has an awesome mosaic tile picture of the Salzburg Fortress. A quick elevator ride to the top and you get great views of downtown and the surrounding area of Salzburg.",
          "Do not miss it! The view is fantastic! You have to pay 3,40 euros to go up and down, but is totally worth it!",
          "Me and my wife took the lift only to go to the highest point and have a good view from the city. We have not entered in the museum as we are not big fans of modern art. The view really worth the couple of Euros that you have to pay to go up. You will see the whole old town and",
          "This is a cool lift, carved into the mountainside. If you just take it to go to Stadtalm it is worth it. We took the lift daily as our Hotel was on the top of the hill. Pay attention to times as it closes early on Mondays I think. There is a walk path on the hill as well. The",
          "The view from up top is terrific! The lift is just a regular elevator but it goes up very high. Worth a trip up there if your keen to see a good view of Salzburg!",
          "The view from the top is very nice and there is a nice park to walk around in. If you just buy a ticket, the cost was around 3 Euro which seems high per adult from a lift ride. There is not really a better alternative to reach the top, so it is what it is.",
          "Had a snack in the cafe, listened to the church bells ringing, took amazing pictures, enjoyed local beer. Did not go into the museum.",
          "This is just an elevator ride with the only thing different about it is the shaft goes up through rock not a building. What makes this worth it is the view from the top. Overlooks Salzburg old town and the river and helps you figure out where everything is. Used the Salzburg",
          "it's quite cheap to buy the ticket to use the lift. The view its outstanding. Its worth it... specially at the end of the day, the city as an unique light",
          "It will get you up and down :-) Not much to say about it. Maybe with an exception that instead of a building it is a lift inside a hill.",
          "The view from the top is really worth it! Must go up to see the city! We had the Salzburg City card so the attraction was free... no idea about the charges otherwise!",
          "The Monchsberg lift is three express elevators that take you from the base station in Anton-Neumayr-Platz to the Winkler Terrace near the Museum of Modern Art, high up on the hill called Monchsberg. This is the same terrace where Maria and the Von Trapps sang 'Do Re Mi' in the",

          "Salzburg is city of hills. City center could be described flat but visiting castle, modern museum or Capucin hill you have to climb. We thought that this list is cable car but it is a simple elevator take you up of hill. There is a modern art museum, park and a nice restaurant",
          "This provides a nice view of Salzburg, but a good one is also available from the Festung. Worth it if you have the Salzburg card.",
          "Fuss-free lift ride up to an amazing view of Salzburg old town. Really enjoyed the peaceful walk to the Fortress after.",
          "This was a fast elevator ride up to top of the mountain. Enjoyed the views of the city and the mountains in the distance.",
          "Really for folks that can't do the walk uphill. I think that the price does include access to the castle if that is your desire. Better to take the elevator at the other end of the road and walk the scenic trails. You can still pay to see the castle once you walk there and",
          "Just a quick, inexpensive ride to the Museum and M32 restaurant. Well worth the ~4 euros to get the view and, perhaps like us, get a nice drink at sunset.",

          "The lift takes you up to the top of the Museum of Modern Art and had a wonderful view of the city. Worth paying to do if it is a pretty day. We did it as part of the Salzburg card.",
          "We took the elevator, which is inside the art museum to the top of the Monchsberg to enjoy the views. We went for a walk along the top and the walked towards the castle, stopping at a restaurant for some drinks, before walking down into the Salzburg old town.",
          "After the quick and easy lift up, we were thrilled to discover that the view was just as we had imagined. Breathtaking. We would have spent more time here if the weather had allowed us to stay longer (heavy rain decided to fall upon us), but we still managed to go for a lovely",
          "Compared to the disappointing fortress on the adjoining hill and the more ambitious Kapuzinerberg climb on the opposite side of the river, this was a dawdle. We started near the Augustiner Brewery (a must visit) and made our way to the top, paused for refreshment and the most",
          "Many people head to the Salzburg fortress for the best views of the city when they arw missing out on this gem of a place. Monchsbergaufzug provides amazing panoramic views of the city of Salzburg and the alps. I preferred this area because I can have the fortress in the photos",

          "Use your Salzburg Card and go into the Museum of Modern Art for free. Take the elevators to the top floor and go out onto the terrace for superb views across the town. Restaurants and a terrace means if the sun shines it's an ideal spot to rest your feet.",

          "The elevator is not quite cheap, but has a long tradition ...\n\nThe view from the top pays off in any case. And if you do not want to pay anything, just go over one of the many steps to the M\u00f6nchsberg!\n\n",

          "The M\u00f6nchsberg lift is an imaginative option for the city of Salzburg to bring unsuspecting tourists quickly to their money, a simple short trip down the elevator costs 2.30 euros (!). The price is when you enter the \u2026",
          "Absolutely rude staff. It is difficult to see that the lift price only includes a one-way ticket, and you are only asked to checkout when you have returned below. Elevator ride / view not worth the price ... \u2026",
          "Quite expensive lift ride to a small viewpoint that doesn't offer much else. You have to have been upstairs, but then that's it again. Museum yes, for those interested. The restaurant / cafe can be left out. \u2026",

        "wiki": "Salzburg Marionette Theatre was established in 1913 and is one of the oldest continuing marionette theatres in the world. It is based in the city of Salzburg, Austria.  Original productions featured live actors and musicians. Today soundtracks are recorded. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre performs a large repertoire of operas, ballets and productions for both children and adults, using marionettes.\nThe Salzburg Marionette Theatre was founded as the Aicher Family Theatre, and has continued to this day delighting both children and adults. Over 2,600 performances have played all over the world, including Carnegie Hall.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Anton Aicher ===\nThe Salzburg Marionette Theatre was founded in 1913 by Professor Anton Aicher.  The original production was Bastien and Bastienne, a marionette version of Mozart's famous comic opera of that name. The company repertoire expanded the following year to incorporate thirteen additional productions.\nThe Salzburg Marionette Theatre grew more adventurous and started to tour its productions abroad, starting in Hamburg, Germany in 1927. The company made further tours to the Balkan countries. In 1936, it toured the Soviet Union visiting Moscow and Leningrad. As a sign of artistic excellence, the company was awarded the Gold Medal at the 1937 World's Fair in Paris. In 1938, the year of the Anschluss, the Salzburg Marionette Theatre made an extensive tour of Germany and Sweden.\nDuring World War II, the government instructed the Salzburg Marionette Theatre to make tours of frontline areas and the troupe performed in German-occupied Norway, Poland, Russia and Romania until it was forced to cease operations in 1944.\n\n\n=== Herman Aichel ===\nWith Hermann Aicher's return from the war, the Salzburg Marionette Theatre started performing again for the occupying American, British and French military forces. In 1947, the troupe marked its first German language performances in Paris. The company toured extensively throughout the 1950s and in 1950 the company began to use recorded sound for performances, instead of live actors and musicians. The troupe began its first tour of the United States in 1952 under a five-year contract. International touring became a permanent feature of the company, in addition to regular performances in Salzburg.\n\n\n=== Own Theatre ===\nThe Salzburg Marionette Theatre had performed in a variety of venues until 1971 when the company acquired its own theatre in the former ballroom of the Mirabell Hotel. The first production there was Rossini's Barber of Seville. For the sixtieth anniversary of the founding, two years later, the company and its unique work was the subject of a documentary film.\n\n\n=== Gretl Aicher ===\nIn 1977, the driving force behind the Salzburg Marionette Theatre, Hermann Aicher died. Artistic control passed to Gretl Aicher.\nTo mark the seventieth birthday of Gretl Aicher and the eighty-fifth anniversary of the Salzburg Marionette Theatre, a special exhibition of marionettes opened at the Salzburg Hohensalzburg Fortress. Since that time, the company has continued to tour and perform in its own theatre with an ever increasing repertoire of productions featuring not just the works of Mozart, but also many other famous composers such as Johann Strauss and Tchaikovsky.\nThe company revived its production of Bastien and Bastienne in 2007 and premiered a new production of The Sound of Music, directed by Richard Hamburger. Salzburg was home of the Von Trapp family and was featured heavily in the 1965 film production of the same name starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSalzburg Marionetten Theater.

          "Such an entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable experience. Quite unique and a dying art. The puppeteers are very skilled and talented. Such a unique experience, totally different than the usual play, musical or concert. As middle aged adults, felt like a kid again. Curtain",
          "One of the tour books we had talked about both the performance and the theater as can't miss sights. We left Munich in the afternoon just to make it to Salzburg for this performance. Both the performance and theater were great and truly things you could only do in Salzburg.",
          "Don't believe a word the negative reviews say - this is an age old tradition in Salzburg, and it's not a Broadway production, but Marionettes. The theater is old yes, the Marionettes most likely too, but they are works of art! We saw a production of the Nutcracker in December",
          "Delightful presentation. Child friendly. Easy to see performance. Easy to access theater and close to other attractions.",
          "One hour show was perfect, we\u2019ll done. Great for kids but more interesting if you actually understand German.",
          "100 metres away from our hotel and a great way to spend a hour on New Years Day. The artistry of the puppeteers is amazing. No surprise that at the end of the show they got 3 rounds of applause. Well worth the money. I can see why young children would get restless.",
          "I saw the Nutcracker on Boxing Day and it was the perfect way to spend the afternoon. The show is so beautiful and the skill of the people who manipulate the puppets incredibly flawless. It was a nice touch to see them above the curtains at the end of the show when they",

It\u2019s similar to the movie but also different given it\u2019s live theatre using puppets. My husband and I both enjoyed the show as did our",

          "This was a total ripoff I saw the Nutcracker from the second row center and it was like watching a dimly lit small movie screen very far away with marionette characters too small to discern And this was row two I think this should have been titled The Emperors New Clothes.",
          "We went to this as average SOM fans thinking it would be a nice way to give the kids something they'd enjoy on our trip. Where we thought this would just be an interesting experience, this was well worth it! The show is truly amazing to realize that those are puppets and people",
          "I saw The Sound Of Music and it was a wonderful show. Such a rare experience to see a full marionette performance by a very talented group of performers in a lovely old theatre.",

          "As I had never seen the film but had seen the sights it was only fitting my last night in Salzburg should be spent watching the Sound of Music. The theatre is small and my ticket was row 12, I would say pay a little more to get closer. I was totally absorbed in the story, the",

          "This is ridiculously fun! I promise :0) We booked this Sound of Music show as a part of a larger two day Salzburg experience and were feeling slightly uneasy just before the performance. Should we go? Would it be too cheesy? Well, we were delighted and grinning the whole time.",

          "Of all of the things we've done while here, this was for sure my favorite. The puppeteers are SO talented. I can't imagine the work that goes into one show. We saw The Sound of Music, so it was in English. I just can't say enough positive things about this experience.",
          "This was indeed a unique stop on our visit to Salburg. In a city so rich in history, it's not unusual to find historic locations, but a marionette theatre in the same family for generations is pretty cool. My wife and I saw the Magic Flute with beautiful music from the famous",

          "This is a must see while in Salzburg!! They have many different shows, but the Sound of Music done by marrionettes was perfect for Salzburg. The stage sets, singing, \"characters\" & emotions elicited are the best-of-Salzburg and perhaps best-of-Europe so far.",

          "My husband did not want to go to this theater but was so glad he did. The performance for that week was \"The Magic Flute\" by Mozart. (Husband does like opera) This is not done on a small stage and one has to see to believe what they do with these marionettes. All ages were at",
          "Seeing a marionette performance while in Salzburg is a must. The theater is absolutely charming and the performance amazing when you think about how it is done. We saw The Magic Flute, which is so appropriate for the area's history. We marveled at the motion of the puppets",

          "I wasnt too sure about seeing this. Tickets were quite expensive and we bought cheaper ones (still 22 euros) near the back. When the show started it immediately was worth the money. The marionettes were really well made and the puppetry amazing. We saw the sound of music which",

        "wiki": "Salzburg (Austrian: [\u02c8saltsb\u028a\u0281k]; German: [\u02c8zaltsb\u028a\u0281k] (listen);  literally \"Salt Fortress\"; Bavarian: Soizburg) is the capital city of the State of Salzburg and with 155,031 inhabitants, it is the fourth-largest city in Austria.\nThe town is located on the site of the former Roman settlement of Iuvavum. Salzburg was founded as an episcopal see in 696 and became a seat of the archbishop in 798. Its main sources of income were salt extraction and trade and, at times, gold mining. The fortress of Hohensalzburg, one of the largest medieval fortresses in Europe, dates from the 11th century. In the 17th century, Salzburg became a centre of the Counter-Reformation, where monasteries and numerous Baroque churches were built.\nSalzburg's historic centre (German: Altstadt) is thus renowned for its Baroque architecture and is one of the best-preserved city centres north of the Alps, with 27 churches. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The city has three universities and a large population of students. Tourists also visit Salzburg to tour the historic centre and the scenic Alpine surroundings. Salzburg was the birthplace of the 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Because of its history, culture, and attractions, Salzburg has been labeled Austria's \"most inspiring city.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity to the High Middle Ages ===\nTraces of human settlements have been found in the area, dating to the Neolithic Age. The first settlements in Salzburg continuous with the present were apparently by the Celts around the 5th century BC.\nAround 15 BC the Roman Empire merged the settlements into one city. At this time, the city was called \"Juvavum\" and was awarded the status of a Roman municipium in 45 AD. Juvavum developed into an important town of the Roman province of Noricum. After the Norican frontier's collapse, Juvavum declined so sharply that by the late 7th century it nearly became a ruin.The Life of Saint Rupert credits the 8th-century saint with the city's rebirth. When Theodo of Bavaria asked Rupert to become bishop c. 700, Rupert reconnoitered the river for the site of his basilica. Rupert chose Juvavum, ordained priests, and annexed the manor of Piding. Rupert named the city \"Salzburg\". He travelled to evangelise among pagans.\nThe name Salzburg means \"Salt Castle\" (Latin: Salis Burgium). The name derives from the barges carrying salt on the River Salzach, which were subject to a toll in the 8th century as was customary for many communities and cities on European rivers. Hohensalzburg Fortress, the city's fortress, was built in 1077 by Archbishop Gebhard, who made it his residence. It was greatly expanded during the following centuries.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\nIndependence from Bavaria was secured in the late 14th century. Salzburg was the seat of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, a prince-bishopric of the Holy Roman Empire. As the Reformation movement gained steam, riots broke out among peasants in the areas in and around Salzburg. The city was occupied during the German Peasants' War, and the Archbishop had to flee to the safety of the fortress. It was besieged for three months in 1525.\nEventually, tensions were quelled, and the city's independence led to an increase in wealth and prosperity, culminating in the late 16th to 18th centuries under the Prince Archbishops Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau, Markus Sittikus, and Paris Lodron. It was in the 17th century that Italian architects (and Austrians who had studied the Baroque style) rebuilt the city centre as it is today along with many palaces.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\n\n==== Religious conflict ====\n\nOn 31 October 1731, the 214th anniversary of the 95 Theses, Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian signed an Edict of Expulsion, the Emigrationspatent, directing all Protestant citizens to recant their non-Catholic beliefs. 21,475 citizens refused to recant their beliefs and were expelled from Salzburg. Most of them accepted an offer by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, travelling the length and breadth of Germany to their new homes in East Prussia. The rest settled in other Protestant states in Europe and the British colonies in America.\n\n\n==== Illuminism ====\nIn 1772\u20131803, under archbishop Hieronymus Graf von Colloredo, Salzburg was a centre of late Illuminism. Colloredo is known for being one of the main employers of Mozart. He often had several arguments with Mozart he dismissed him by  saying, \u201cSoll er doch gehen, ich brauche ihn night!\u201d (He should just go then; I don\u2019t need him!)  Mozart would leave Salzburg for Vienna in 1781 with his family including his father Leopold staying back as he and Colloredo had a close relationship.\n\n\n=== Electorate of Salzburg ===\nIn 1803, the archbishopric was secularised by Emperor Napoleon; he transferred the territory to Ferdinando III of Tuscany, former Grand Duke of Tuscany, as the Electorate of Salzburg.\n\n\n=== Austrian annexation of Salzburg ===\nIn 1805, Salzburg was annexed to the Austrian Empire, along with the Berchtesgaden Provostry.\n\n\n=== Salzburg under Bavarian rule ===\nIn 1809, the territory of Salzburg was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria after Austria's defeat at Wagram.\n\n\n=== Division of Salzburg and annexation by Austria and Bavaria ===\nAfter the Congress of Vienna with the Treaty of Munich (1816), Salzburg was definitively returned to Austria, but without Rupertigau and Berchtesgaden, which remained with Bavaria. Salzburg was integrated into the Province of Salzach and Salzburgerland was ruled from Linz.In 1850, Salzburg's status was restored as the capital of the Duchy of Salzburg, a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The city became part of Austria-Hungary in 1866 as the capital of a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The nostalgia of the Romantic Era led to increased tourism. In 1892, a funicular was installed to facilitate tourism to Hohensalzburg Fortress\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n\n==== First Republic ====\nFollowing World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Salzburg, as the capital of one of the Austro-Hungarian territories, became part of the new German Austria. In 1918, it represented the residual German-speaking territories of the Austrian heartlands. This was replaced by the First Austrian Republic in 1919, after the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919).\n\n\n==== Annexation by the Third Reich ====\n\nThe Anschluss (the occupation and annexation of Austria, including Salzburg, into the Third Reich) took place on 12 March 1938, one day before a scheduled referendum on Austria's independence. German troops moved into the city. Political opponents, Jewish citizens and other minorities were subsequently arrested and deported to concentration camps. The synagogue was destroyed. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union, several POW camps for prisoners from the Soviet Union and other enemy nations were organized in the city.\nDuring the Nazi occupation, a Romani camp was built in Salzburg-Maxglan. It was an Arbeitserziehungslager (work 'education' camp), which provided slave labour to local industry. It also operated as a Zwischenlager (transit camp), holding Roma before their deportation to German camps or ghettos in German-occupied territories in eastern Europe.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nAllied bombing destroyed 7,600 houses and killed 550 inhabitants. Fifteen air strikes destroyed 46 percent of the city's buildings, especially those around Salzburg railway station. Although the town's bridges and the dome of the cathedral were destroyed, much of its Baroque architecture remained intact. As a result, Salzburg is one of the few remaining examples of a town of its style. American troops entered the city on 5 May 1945 and it became the centre of the American-occupied area in Austria.  Several displaced persons camps were established in Salzburg\u2014among them Riedenburg, Camp Herzl (Franz-Josefs-Kaserne), Camp M\u00fclln, Bet Bialik, Bet Trumpeldor, and New Palestine.\n\n\n==== Present day ====\nAfter World War II, Salzburg became the capital city of the Federal State of Salzburg (Land Salzburg). On 27 January 2006, the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all 35 churches of Salzburg rang their bells after 8:00 p.m. (local time) to celebrate the occasion. Major celebrations took place throughout the year.\nAs of 2017 Salzburg had a GDP per capita of \u20ac46,100, which was greater than the average for Austria and for most European countries.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSalzburg is on the banks of the River Salzach, at the northern boundary of the Alps. The mountains to Salzburg's south contrast with the rolling plains to the north. The closest alpine peak, the 1,972\u2011metre-high Untersberg, is less than 16 kilometres (10 miles) from the city centre. The Altstadt, or \"old town\", is dominated by its baroque towers and churches and the massive Hohensalzburg Fortress. This area is flanked by two smaller hills, the M\u00f6nchsberg and Kapuzinerberg, which offer green relief within the city.  Salzburg is approximately 150 km (93 mi) east of Munich, 281 km (175 mi) northwest of Ljubljana, Slovenia, and 300 km (186 mi) west of Vienna. Salzburg has about the same latitude of Seattle.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSalzburg is part of the temperate zone. The K\u00f6ppen climate classification specifies the climate as a humid continental climate (Dfb), however, with the \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm for the coldest month, Salzburg can be classified as having four-season oceanic climate with significant temperature differences between seasons. Due to the location at the northern rim of the Alps, the amount of precipitation is comparatively high, mainly in the summer months. The specific drizzle is called Schn\u00fcrlregen in the local dialect. In winter and spring, pronounced foehn winds regularly occur.\n\n\n== Population ==\nIn 2018, 31% of the total population is foreign born according to Statistik Austria.\nSalzburg's official population significantly increased in 1935 when the city absorbed adjacent municipalities. After World War II, numerous refugees found a new home in the city. New residential space was constructed for American soldiers of the postwar occupation, and could be used for refugees when they left. Around 1950, Salzburg passed the mark of 100,000 citizens, and in 2016, it reached the mark of 150,000 citizens.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Romanesque and Gothic ===\nThe Romanesque and Gothic churches, the monasteries and the early carcass houses dominated the medieval city for a long time. The Cathedral of Archbishop Conrad of Wittelsbach was the largest basilica north of the Alps. The choir of the Franciscan Church, construction was begun by Hans von Burghausen and completed by Stephan Krumenauer, is one of the most prestigious religious gothic constructions of southern Germany. At the end of the Gothic era the Collegiate church \"Nonnberg\", Margaret Chapel in St. Peter's Cemetery, the St. George's Chapel and the stately halls of the \"Hoher Stock\" in Hohensalzburg Fortress were constructed.\n\n\n=== Renaissance and baroque ===\nInspired by Vincenzo Scamozzi, Prince Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau began to transform the medieval town to the architectural ideals of the late Renaissance. Plans for a massive cathedral by Scamozzi failed to materialize upon the fall of the archbishop. A second cathedral planned by Santino Solari rose as the first early Baroque church in Salzburg. It served as an example for many other churches in Southern Germany and Austria. Markus Sittikus and Paris von Lodron continued to rebuild the city with major projects such as Hellbrunn Palace, the prince archbishop's residence, the university buildings, fortifications, and many other buildings. Giovanni Antonio Daria managed by order of Prince Archbishop Guido von Thun the construction of the residential well. Giovanni Gaspare Zuccalli, by order of the same archbishop, created the Erhard and the Kajetan church in the south of the town. The city's redesign was completed with buildings designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, donated by Prince Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun.\nAfter the era of Ernst von Thun, the city's expansion came to a halt, which is the reason why there are no churches built in the Rococo style. Sigismund von Schrattenbach continued with the construction of \"Sigmundstor\" and the statue of holy Maria on the cathedral square. With the fall and division of the former \"F\u00fcrsterzbistum Salzburg\" (Archbishopric) to Upper Austria, Bavaria (Rupertigau) and Tyrol (Zillertal Matrei) began a long period of urban stagnancy. This era didn't end before the period of promoterism (Gr\u00fcnderzeit) brought new life into urban development. The builder dynasty Jakob Ceconi and Carl Freiherr von Schwarz filled major positions in shaping the city in this era.\n\n\n=== Classical modernism and post-war modernism ===\nBuildings of classical modernism and in particular the post-war modernism are frequently encountered in Salzburg. Examples are the Zahnwurzen house (a house in the Linzergasse 22 in the right center of the old town), the \"Lepi\" (a public baths in Leopoldskron) (built 1964) and the original 1957 constructed congress centre of Salzburg, which was replaced by a new building in 2001. An important and famous example of architecture of this era is the 1960 opening of the Gro\u00dfes Festspielhaus by Clemens Holzmeister.\n\n\n=== Contemporary architecture ===\nAdding contemporary architecture to Salzburg's old town without risking its UNESCO World Heritage status is problematic. Nevertheless, some new structures have been added: the Mozarteum at the Baroque Mirabell Garden (Architecture Robert Rechenauer), the 2001 Congress House (Architecture: Freemasons), the 2011 Unipark Nonntal (Architecture: Storch Ehlers Partners), the 2001 \"Makartsteg\" bridge (Architecture: HALLE1), and the \"Residential and Studio House\" of the architects Christine and Horst Lechner in the middle of Salzburg's old town (winner of the architecture award of Salzburg 2010). Other examples of contemporary architecture lie outside the old town: the Faculty of Science building (Universit\u00e4t Salzburg \u2013 Architecture Willhelm Holzbauer) built on the edge of free green space, the blob architecture of Red Bull Hangar\u20117 (Architecture: Volkmar Burgstaller) at Salzburg Airport, home to Dietrich Mateschitz's Flying Bulls and the Europark Shopping Centre. (Architecture: Massimiliano Fuksas)\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nSalzburg has twenty-four urban districts and three extra-urban populations.\nUrban districts (Stadtteile):\n\nExtra-urban populations (Landschaftsr\u00e4ume):\n\nGaisberg\nHellbrunn\nHeuberg\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nSalzburg is a tourist favourite, with the number of visitors outnumbering locals by a large margin in peak times.

Old High German muosgadem \u2018spice room\u2019. \nThere was a folk etymology that supported a derivation based on the legendary figure of Frau Perchta (Berchta), a woman (Holle < Holda \u2018well disposed, dear\u2019) with good and bad changing features, who was venerated on Perchtertag (= Three Kings Day) and at Shrovetide was sworn to during the Perchta procession.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first ever historical note dates back to 1102 and mentions the area because of its rich salt deposits. Much of Berchtesgaden's wealth has been derived from its salt mines, the first of which started operations in 1517. The town served as independent F\u00fcrstpropstei until the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss in 1803. During the Napoleonic wars, Berchtesgaden changed hands a few times, such as in 1805 under the Treaty of Pressburg, when the area was ceded to Austria.\nBerchtesgaden came under Bavarian rule in 1810 and became instantly popular with the Bavarian royal family, the House of Wittelsbach, who often visited K\u00f6nigssee and maintained a royal hunting residence in the former Augustine monastery (still used today by Franz, Duke of Bavaria). Nascent tourism started to evolve and a number of artists came to the area, which reportedly gave rise to Malereck (\"painters' corner\") on the shore of K\u00f6nigssee in nearby Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden. The most famous author who lived in Berchtesgaden was Ludwig Ganghofer.\n\n\n=== Nazi era ===\n\nAdolf Hitler had been vacationing in the Berchtesgaden area since the 1920s. He purchased a home in the Obersalzberg above the town on the flank of the Hoher Goll and began extensive renovations on his Berghof in the following years.  As other top Third Reich figures, such as Hermann G\u00f6ring, Joseph Goebbels, Martin Bormann, Heinrich Himmler, and Albert Speer, began to frequent the area the Party began to purchase and requisition land in the Obersalzberg.In order to serve as an outpost of the German Reichskanzlei (Imperial Chancellery), Berchtesgaden and its environs (Stanggass) saw substantial expansion of offices, security, and support services, mainly on the Obersalzberg.  Included in the town were a new railway station, with a reception area for Hitler and his guests, and an adjacent post office. The Berchtesgadener Hof Hotel, where famous visitors such as Neville Chamberlain and David Lloyd George stayed, was substantially upgraded.\nEven though a feared \"national redoubt\" last stand of the Nazi Regime in the Alps failed to materialize late in World War II, the Allies launched a devastating air raid on the Berchtesgaden area in the spring of 1945.  Concentrated on the Obersalzberg, the April 25 bombing did little damage to the town.  On May 4, forward elements of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division arrived and received the town's surrender.\n\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\nAfter the war, Berchesgaden became a military zone and most of its buildings were requisitioned by the U.S. Army. Hotel Platterhof was rebuilt and renamed the General Walker Hotel in 1952. It served as an integral part of the U.S. Armed Forces Recreation Centers for the duration of the Cold War and beyond. The remnants of homes of former Nazi leaders were all demolished in the early postwar years, though traces of some remained. In 1995, fifty years after the end of World War II and five years after German reunification, the AFRC Berchtesgaden was turned over to Bavarian authorities to facilitate military spending reductions mandated within the Base Realignment and Closure program by the US Congress and Pentagon during the administration of President Bill Clinton. The General Walker Hotel was demolished in 2000\u20132001.\nIn 1986, Berchtesgaden was a first round candidate city to host the XVI Olympic Winter Games to be held in 1992. The vote eventually went to Albertville, France, in October of that year.\n\n\n=== Berchtesgaden today ===\n\nThe Hotel T\u00fcrken, which was near the Nazi buildings and was often used by the SS and then by the Generalmajor of the Police, was badly damaged in 1945. It was rebuilt in 1950 and reopened as a hotel before Christmas. Visitors can still  explore the historic underground hallways and tunnels that had been used by the Nazis.In 1972, local government reform united the then independent municipalities of Salzberg, Maria Gern and Au (consisting of Oberau and Unterau) under the administration of the town of Berchtesgaden. Another suggested reform uniting all remaining five municipalities in the Berchtesgaden valley (Bischofswiesen, Ramsau, Marktschellenberg and Sch\u00f6nau) failed to gain enough popular support; it passed in Berchtesgaden but failed everywhere else.\nThe Berchtesgaden National Park was established in 1978 and has gradually become one of Berchtesgaden's largest draws. Mass tourism is confined to a few popular spots, leaving the rest to nature-seekers. Other tourist draws are the K\u00f6nigssee, the salt mine, the Kehlsteinhaus, open seasonally as a restaurant and the Dokumentationszentrum Obersalzberg museum about the area's history, operated by the Munich Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte since 1999.Recreational and competitive sports have grown in importance. The town's ski slope is popular. The K\u00f6nigssee bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track has hosted ski-running and a number of international events and competitions. Berchtesgaden's most famous sports personality is Georg Hackl, a multiple Olympic medal winner. The city is home to the International Luge Federation (FIL).\nUnlike the northern part of Berchtesgadener Land and the Salzburg area, Berchtesgaden has virtually no manufacturing industry.\nBerchtesgaden Central Station is connected by the Salzburg\u2013Berchtesgaden railway to the Rosenheim\u2013Salzburg railway at Freilassing.\nThe Bavarian state government facilitated the erection of a hotel, which opened in 2005 and is operated by the InterContinental Hotels Group. Since May 2015, the hotel has been the Kempinski Berchtesgaden.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBerchtesgaden's neighbouring towns are Bischofswiesen, Marktschellenberg, Ramsau, and Sch\u00f6nau am K\u00f6nigssee.\nThe municipality counts the following villages which are (Ortsteil): Am Etzerschl\u00f6\u00dfl, Anzenbach, Hintergern, Metzenleiten, Mitterbach, Oberau, Obergern, Obersalzberg, Resten, Unterau, Untersalzberg I, Untersalzberg II, and Vordergern.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nWolfgang Bartels, (1940-2007), Olympic alpine skier bronze medalist\nKarl Bartos, (born 1952), electronic musician, former electronic percussionist in the band Kraftwerk\nSigmund Freud, (1856-1939), psychoanalyst, owned a house for family holidays in Sch\u00f6nau near Obersalzberg.

        "wiki": "Freilassing station is located in the Upper Bavarian district of Berchtesgaden. It is the last German station on the railway line from Munich to Salzburg, a border station to Austria and the only station in the town of Freilassing.\nThe station is the junction between the Rosenheim\u2013Salzburg, Salzburg\u2013Berchtesgaden and Salzburg\u2013M\u00fchldorf lines and is used daily by about 160 trains operated by Deutsche Bahn, the Austrian Federal Railways and the Berchtesgadener Land Bahn.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe station is located north of the town centre. The station area is bounded to the north by Rupertusstra\u00dfe and to the south by Bahnhofstrasse (station street). To the west there is a footbridge linking Bahnhofstrasse and Rupertusstra\u00dfe. The station building is located south of the railway facilities and has the address of Bahnhofstrasse 4\n\n\n== History ==\nFreilassing station was opened in 1860 together with the railway line from Munich to Salzburg. It then served as a border station between Austria and Bavaria. In 1866, Freilassing was connected to another line (Freilassing\u2013Bad Reichenhall) and in 1888 it was extended to Berchtesgaden. A branch line (Lokalbahn) was opened to Laufen in 1890 and it was extended to Tittmoning in 1894. In 1916, electrification was completed on the Freilassing-Berchtesgaden line.\nWith the entry of Austria in the European Union in 1995, the station lost its importance as a border station.\n\n\n=== Freilassing locomotive depot ===\nWith the opening of lines to Tittmoning and Berchtesgaden and the general increase in traffic, a locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk) was required. This was built from 1902 to 1905 in the northwest of the station area. It had twenty roads and a turntable that was enlarged in 1924 to a length of 23 metres. In 1994, the depot was closed. In 1998, the training workshop was closed. The building has been classified as a historical monument since 1998 and it now houses a railway museum.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nThe station has seven through tracks on four platforms, with track 1 as the \u201chome\u201d platform (Hausbahnsteig), that is next to the station building. Each platform is covered and has digital platform displays. All platforms are connected by a pedestrian tunnel to the home platform. It has only partial step-free access to the platform. The station building has among other things a ticket office.  Park and ride parking and bike racks are available in the station area.\nThe station has been located in the area administered by the Salzburg Transport Association (Salzburger Verkehrsverbund) since 2006 and is served by the Salzburg S-Bahn network. The municipal bus company (Freilassinger StadtBus) operates bus routes 81 and 82 through the Freilassing urban area, connecting with the station. In addition to the local services, Freilassing station is connected by bus route 24 via the stops of Salzburger Platz and Rupertikirche/Rathaus to the public bus network of the city of Salzburg.\n\n\n=== Platform data ===\nPlatform lengths and heights are as follows:\nTrack 1: length 421 m, height 38 cm\nTrack 2: length 421 m, height 22 cm\nTrack 3: length 421 m, height 22 cm\nTrack 4: length 416 m, height 22 cm\nTrack 5: length 416 m, height 22 cm\nTrack 7: length 300 m, height 22 cm\nTrack 8: length 300 m, height 22 cm\n\n\n=== Rail services ===\nFreilassing station is served by EuroCity services operated by Deutsche Bahn, in cooperation with the Austrian Federal Railways. It is also served by local trains operated by Meridian (a subsidiary of Bayerische Oberlandbahn) to Munich, Salzburg and Rosenheim and by S\u00fcdostbayernbahn to M\u00fchldorf. The local trains on the line to Berchtesgaden are operated by Berchtesgadener Land Bahn (as line S 4 of the Salzburg S-Bahn) and by the Salzburg S-Bahn (as line S 3, which also continues to Salzburg Central Station in Austria).\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Freilassing train station at Wikimedia Commons",

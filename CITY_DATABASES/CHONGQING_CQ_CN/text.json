        "wiki": "Chongqing (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0o\u014b\u02e8\u02e9t\u0255\u02b0in\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u028a\u030c\u014b.t\u0255\u02b0\u00ee\u014b] (listen), UK: , US: ,), alternately romanized as Chungking, is a megacity in southwest China. Administratively, it is one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of central government of the People's Republic of China (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), and the only such municipality located far away from the coast. The municipality of Chongqing, which is around the size of Austria, includes the city of Chongqing and various non-connected cities. As the Chongqing municipality government directly administers the city of Chongqing, as well as rural counties, and other cities not connected to the city of Chongqing, Chongqing municipality can technically claim to be the largest city proper in the world, even though this is due to a classification technicality and not because it is actually the world's largest urban area.\nChongqing was a municipality during the Republic of China (ROC) administration, within the Sichuan Province. It served as its wartime capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), being one of the world's anti-fascist command centers. The current municipality was separated from Sichuan province on 14 March 1997 to help develop the central and western parts of China. The Chongqing administrative municipality has a population of over 30 million. The city of Chongqing, comprising 9 urban and suburban districts, has a population of 8,518,000 as of 2016. According to the 2010 census, Chongqing is the most populous Chinese municipality, and also the largest direct-controlled municipality in China, containing 26 districts, eight counties, and four autonomous counties.\nThe official abbreviation of the city, \"Y\u00fa\" (\u6e1d), was approved by the State Council on 18 April 1997. This abbreviation is derived from the old name of a part of the Jialing River that runs through Chongqing and feeds into the Yangtze River.\nChongqing has a significant history and culture. Being one of China's National Central Cities, it serves as the economic centre of the Sichuan Basin and the upstream Yangtze. It is a major manufacturing centre and transportation hub; a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit described it as one of China's \"13 emerging megalopolises\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nTradition associates Chongqing with the State of Ba.\nThis new capital was first named Jiangzhou (\u6c5f\u5dde).\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\nJiangzhou subsequently remained under Qin Shi Huang's rule during the Qin dynasty, the successor of the Qin State, and under the control of Han dynasty emperors.\nJiangzhou was subsequently renamed during the Northern and Southern dynasties to Chu Prefecture (\u695a\u5dde), then in 581 AD (Sui dynasty) to Yu Prefecture (\u6e1d\u5dde), and later in 1102 during Northern Song to Gong Prefecture (\u606d\u5dde). The name Yu however survives to this day as an abbreviation for Chongqing, and the city centre where the old town stood is also called Yuzhong (\u6e1d\u4e2d, Central Yu). It received its current name in 1189, after Prince Zhao Dun of the Southern Song dynasty described his crowning as king and then Emperor Guangzong as a \"double celebration\" (simplified Chinese: \u53cc\u91cd\u559c\u5e86; traditional Chinese: \u96d9\u91cd\u559c\u6176; pinyin: shu\u0101ngch\u00f3ng x\u01d0q\u00ecng, or chongqing in short). In his honour, Yu Prefecture was therefore converted to Chongqing Fu, marking the occasion of his enthronement.\nIn 1362, (Yuan dynasty), Ming Yuzhen, a peasant rebel leader, established the Daxia Kingdom (\u5927\u590f) at Chongqing for a short time. In 1621 (Ming dynasty), another short-lived kingdom of Daliang (\u5927\u6881) was established by She Chongming (\u5962\u5d07\u660e) with Chongqing as its capital. In 1644, after the fall of the Ming dynasty to a rebel army, Chongqing, together with the rest of Sichuan, was captured by Zhang Xianzhong, who was said to have massacred a large number of people in Sichuan and depopulated the province, in part by causing many people to flee to safety elsewhere. The Manchus later conquered the province, and during the Qing dynasty, immigration to Chongqing and Sichuan took place with the support of the Qing emperor.In 1890, the British Consulate General was opened in Chongqing. The following year, the city became the first inland commerce port open to foreigners. The French, German, US and Japanese consulates were opened in Chongqing in 1896\u20131904.\n\n\n=== Provisional capital of the Republic of China ===\n\nDuring and after the Second Sino-Japanese War, from Nov 1937 to May 1946, it was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's provisional capital. Indeed, after the General and remaining army had lived there for a time following their retreat in 1938 from the previous capital of Wuhan, it was formally declared the second capital city (pei du) on 6 September 1940. After Britain, the United States, and other Allies entered the war in Asia in December 1941, one of the Allies' deputy commanders of operations in South East Asia (South East Asia Command SEAC), Joseph Stilwell, was based in the city. This made it a city of world importance in the fight against Axis powers, together with London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. The city was also visited by Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of SEAC which was itself headquartered in Ceylon, modern day Sri Lanka. Chiang Kai Shek as Supreme Commander in China worked closely with Stilwell. From 1938 to 1943, the city suffered from continuous terror bombing by the Japanese air force. Lives were saved by the air-raid shelters which took the advantage of the mountainous terrain. Chongqing was acclaimed to be the \u201cCity of Heroes\u201d due to the indomitable spirits of its people as well as their contributions and sacrifices during World War II. Many factories and universities were relocated from eastern China to Chongqing during the war, transforming this city from inland port to a heavily industrialized city. In late November 1949, the Nationalist KMT government retreated from the city.\n\n\n=== Municipality status ===\n\nOn 14 March 1997, the Eighth National People's Congress decided to merge the Sub-provincial city with the neighbouring Fuling, Wanxian, and Qianjiang prefectures that it had governed on behalf of the province since September 1996. The resulting single division became Chongqing Municipality, containing 30,020,000 people in forty-three former counties (without intermediate political levels). The municipality became the spearhead of China's effort to develop its western regions and to coordinate the resettlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges Dam project. Its first official ceremony took place on 18 June 1997. On 8 February 2010, Chongqing became one of the four National Central/Core cities, the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. On 18 June 2010, Liangjiang New Area was established in Chongqing, which is the third State-level new areas at the time of its establishment.In August 2020 the city was hit by a large scale flood, the highest water level seen since the Cuntan hydrographic station was opened in 1939. This came after other smaller scale floods during the year. It is estimated the flood killed hundreds of people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography and topography ===\n\nChongqing is situated at the transitional area between the Tibetan Plateau and the plain on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the sub-tropical climate zone often swept by moist monsoons. It often rains at night in late spring and early summer, and thus the city is famous for its \"night rain in the Ba Mountains\", as described by poems throughout Chinese history including the famous Written on a Rainy Night-A Letter to the North by Li Shangyin. The municipality reaches a maximum width of 470 kilometres (290 mi) from east to west, and a maximum length of 450 km (280 mi) from north to south. It borders the following provinces: Hubei in the east, Hunan in the southeast, Guizhou in the south, Sichuan in the west and northwest, and Shaanxi to the north in its northeast corner.\n\nChongqing covers a large area crisscrossed by rivers and mountains. The Daba Mountains stand in the north, the Wu Mountains in the east, the Wuling Mountains in the southeast, and the Dalou Mountains in the south. The whole area slopes down from north and south towards the Yangtze River valley, with sharp rises and falls. The area is featured by a large geological massif, of mountains and hills, with large sloping areas at different heights. Typical karst landscape is common in this area, and stone forests, numerous collections of peaks, limestone caves and valleys can be found in many places. The Longshuixia Gap (\u9f99\u6c34\u5ce1\u5730\u7f1d), with its natural arch-bridges, has made the region a popular tourist attraction. The Yangtze River runs through the whole area from west to east, covering a course of 665 km (413 mi), cutting through the Wu Mountains at three places and forming the well-known Three Gorges: the Qutang, the Wuxia and the Xiling gorges. Coming from northwest and running through \"the Jialing Lesser Three Gorges\" of Libi, Wentang and Guanyin, the Jialing River joins the Yangtze in Chongqing.\n\nThe central urban area of Chongqing, or Chongqing proper, is a city of unique features. Built on mountains and partially surrounded by the Yangtze and Jialing rivers, it is known as a \"mountain city\" and a \"city on rivers\". The night scene of the city is very illuminated, with millions of lights and their reflection on the rivers. With its special topographical features, Chongqing has the unique scenery of mountains, rivers, forests, springs, waterfalls, gorges, and caves. Li Bai, a famous poet of the Tang dynasty, was inspired by the natural scenery and wrote this epigram.Specifically, the central urban area is located on a huge folding area. Yuzhong District, Nan'an District, Shapingba District and Jiangbei District are located right on a big syncline. And the \"Southern Mountain of Chongqing\" (Tongluo Mountain), along with the Zhongliang Mountain are two anticlines next to the syncline of downtown.Zhongliang Mountains (\u4e2d\u6881\u5c71) and Tongluo Mountains (\u94dc\u9523\u5c71) roughly forms the eastern and western boundaries of Chongqing's urban area. The highest point in downtown is the top of Eling Hill, which is a smaller syncline hill that keeps Yangtze River and Jialing River apart for some more kilometres. The elevation of Eling Hill is 379 metres (1,243 feet). The lowest point is Chaotian Gate, where the two rivers merge with each other. The altitude there is 160 metres (520 feet). The average height of the area is 259 metres (850 feet). However, there are several high mountains outside central Chongqing, such as the Wugong Ling Mountain, with the altitude of 1,709.4 metres (5,608 feet), in Jiangjin.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nChongqing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa), bordering on a monsoonal humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and for most of the year experiences very high relative humidity, with all months above 75%. Known as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" of the Yangtze river, along with Wuhan and Nanjing, its summers are long and among the hottest and most humid in China, with highs of 33 to 34 \u00b0C (91 to 93 \u00b0F) in July and August in the urban area. Winters are short and somewhat mild, but damp and overcast. The city's location in the Sichuan Basin causes it to have one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, at only 1,055 hours, lower than much of Northern Europe; the monthly percent possible sunshine in the city proper ranges from a mere 8% in December and January to 48% in August. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.8 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 15 December 1975 (unofficial record of \u22122.5 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) was set on 8 February 1943) to 43.0 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) on 15 August 2006 (unofficial record of 44.0 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F) was set on 8 and 9 August 1933).Chongqing, with over 100 days of fog per year, is known as the \"Fog City\" (\u96fe\u90fd), like San Francisco, and a thick layer of fog enshrouds it for 68 days per year during the spring and autumn. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, this special weather possibly played a role in protecting the city from being overrun by the Imperial Japanese Army.\nAs exemplified by Youyang County below, conditions are often cooler in the southeast part of the municipality due to the higher elevations there.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nChongqing has been, since 1997, a direct-controlled municipality in the Chinese administrative structure, making it a provincial-level division with commensurate political importance. The municipality's top leader is the secretary of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China (\"party chief\"), which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, the country's second highest governing council. Under the Soviet-inspired nomenklatura system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the Communist Party, and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include He Guoqiang, Wang Yang, Bo Xilai, Zhang Dejiang, and Sun Zhengcai, the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal party standing committee, the de facto top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.\nThe municipal People's Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor, who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.The municipality also has a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (zhengxie) meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The zhengxie is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.\n\n\n=== Military ===\nChongqing was the wartime capital of China during the Second Sino-Japanese war (i.e., World War II), and from 1938 to 1946, the seat of administration for the Republic of China's government before its departure to Nanjing and then Taiwan. After the eventual defeat at the Battle of Wuhan General Chiang-Kai Shek and the army were forced to use it as base of resistance from 1938 onwards. It also contains a military museum named after the Chinese Korean War hero Qiu Shaoyun.Chongqing used to be the headquarters of the 13th Group Army of the People's Liberation Army, one of the two group armies that formerly comprised the Chengdu Military Region, which in 2016 was re-organized into the Western Theater Command.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nChongqing is the largest of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China. The municipality is divided into 38 subdivisions (3 were abolished in 1997, and Wansheng and Shuangqiao districts were abolished in October 2011), consisting of 26 districts, 8 counties, and 4 autonomous counties. The boundaries of Chongqing municipality reach much farther into the city's hinterland than the boundaries of the other three provincial level municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and much of its administrative area, which spans over 80,000 square kilometres (30,900 sq mi), is rural. At the end of year 2017, the total population is 30.75 million.[1]\n\n\n==== Urban areas ====\n\na Indicates with which district the division was associated below prior to the merging of Chongqing, Fuling, Wanxian (now Wanzhou) and Qianjiang in 1997.\n\n\n==== Central Chongqing ====\n\nThe main urban area of Chongqing city (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e3b\u57ce\u533a) spans approximately 5,473 square kilometres (2,113 square miles), and includes the following nine districts:\nYuzhong District (\u6e1d\u4e2d\u533a, or \"Central Chongqing District\"), the central and most densely populated district, where government and international business offices and the city's best shopping are located in the district's Jeifangbei CBD area. Yuzhong is located on the peninsula surrounded by Eling Hill, Yangtze River and Jialing River.\nJiangbei District (\u6c5f\u5317\u533a, or \"River North District\"), located to the north of Jialing River.\nShapingba District (\u6c99\u576a\u575d\u533a), roughly located between Jialing River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nJiulongpo District (\u4e5d\u9f99\u5761\u533a), roughly located between Yangtze River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nNan'an District (\u5357\u5cb8\u533a, or \"Southern Bank District\"), located on the south side of Yangtze River.\nDadukou District (\u5927\u6e21\u53e3\u533a)\nBanan District (\u5df4\u5357\u533a, or \"Southern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Ba County, and changed to the current name in 1994. Its northern area merged into Chongqing, and its capital town Yudong is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nYubei District (\u6e1d\u5317\u533a, or \"Northern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Jiangbei County, and changed into the current name in 1994. Its southern area merged into Chongqing, and the capital town Lianglu Town is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nBeibei District (\u5317\u789a\u533a), a satellite city northwest of Chongqing.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAccording to a July 2010 article from the official Xinhua news agency, the municipality has a population of 32.8 million, including 23.3 million farmers. Among them, 8.4 million farmers have become migrant workers, including 3.9 million working and living in urban areas of Chongqing.\nThe metropolitan area encompassing the central urban area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 17 million.This would mean that the locally registered farmers who work in other jurisdictions number 4.5 million, reducing the local, year-round population of Chongqing in 2010 to 28.3 million, plus those who are registered in other jurisdictions but live and work in Chongqing. According to China's 2005 statistical yearbook, of a total population of 30.55 million, those with residence registered in other jurisdictions but residing in the Chongqing enumeration area numbered 1.4 million, including 46,000 who resided in Chongqing \"for less than half-year\". An additional 83,000 had registered in Chongqing, but not yet settled there.The 2005 statistical yearbook also lists 15.22 million (49.82%) males and 15.33 million (50.18%) females.In terms of age distribution in 2004, of the 30.55 million total population, 6.4 million (20.88%) were age 0\u201314, 20.7 million (67.69%) were 15\u201364, and 3.5 million (11.46%) were 65 and over.Of a total 10,470,000 households (2004), 1,360,000 consisted of one person, 2,940,000 two-person, 3,190,000 three-person, 1,790,000 four-person, 783,000 five-person, 270,000 six-person, 89,000 seven-person, 28,000 eight-person, 6,000 nine-person, and 10,000 households of 10 or more persons per household.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe predominant religions in Chongqing are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 26.63% of the population believes and is involved in cults of ancestors, while 1.05% of the population identifies as Christian.The reports didn't give figures for other types of religion; 72.32% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects.\n\n\n== Crime ==\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the city became notorious for organised crime and corruption. Gangsters oversaw businesses involving billions of yuan and the corruption reached into the law-enforcement and justice systems. In 2009, city authorities under the auspices of municipal Communist Party secretary Bo Xilai undertook a large-scale crackdown, arresting 4,893 suspected gangsters, \"outlaws\" and corrupt cadres, leading to optimism that the period of gangsterism was over. However, local media later highlighted the apparent reliance by the authorities on torture to extract confessions upon which convictions were based. In December 2009, one defence lawyer was controversially arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison for \"coaching his client to make false claims of torture\" and in July 2010, another lawyer released videotapes of his client describing the torture in detail. In 2014, four policemen involved in the interrogation were charged with the practice of \"opposed illegal interrogation techniques\", considered by observers to be torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nChongqing was separated from Sichuan province and made into a municipality in its own right in 14 March 1997 in order to accelerate its development and subsequently China's relatively poorer western areas (see China Western Development strategy). An important industrial area in western China, Chongqing is also rapidly urbanising. For instance, statistics suggest that new construction added approximately 137,000 square metres (1,470,000 square feet) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. In addition, more than 1,300 people moved into the city daily, adding almost 100 million yuan (US$15 million) to the local economy.\nTraditionally, due to its geographical remoteness, Chongqing and neighbouring Sichuan have been important military bases in weapons research and development. Chongqing's industries have now diversified but unlike eastern China, its export sector is small due to its inland location. Instead, factories producing local-oriented consumer goods such as processed food, cars, chemicals, textiles, machinery, sports equipment and electronics  are common.\nChongqing is China's third largest centre for motor vehicle production and the largest for motorcycles. In 2007, it had an annual output capacity of 1 million cars and 8.6 million motorcycles. Leading makers of cars and motor bikes includes China's fourth biggest automaker; Changan Automotive Corp and Lifan Hongda Enterprise, as well as Ford Motor Company, with the US car giant having 3 plants in Chongqing.  The municipality is also one of the nine largest iron and steel centres in China and one of the three major aluminium producers. Important manufacturers include Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and South West Aluminium which is Asia's largest aluminium plant. Agriculture remains significant. Rice and fruits, especially oranges, are the area's main produce. Natural resources are also abundant with large deposits of coal, natural gas, and more than 40 kinds of minerals such as strontium and manganese. Coal reserves \u2248 4.8 billion tonnes. Chuandong Natural Gas Field is China's largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270 billion m3 \u2013 more than 1/5 of China's total. Has China's largest reserve of strontium (China has the world's 2nd biggest strontium deposit). Manganese is mined in the Xiushan area. although the mining sector has been criticised for being wasteful, heavily polluting and unsafe. Chongqing is also planned to be the site of a 10 million ton capacity refinery operated by CNPC (parent company of PetroChina) to process imported crude oil from the Sino-Burma pipelines. The pipeline itself, though not yet finished, will eventually run from Sittwe (in Myanmar's western coast) through Kunming in Yunnan before reaching Chongqing and it will provide China with fuels sourced from Myanmar, the Middle East and Africa. Recently, there has been a drive to move up the value chain by shifting towards high technology and knowledge intensive industries resulting in new development zones such as the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ). Chongqing's local government is hoping through the promotion of favorable economic policies for the electronics and information technology sectors, that it can create a 400 billion RMB high technology manufacturing hub which will surpass its car industry and account for 25% of its exports.The city has also invested heavily in infrastructure to attract investment. The network of roads and railways connecting Chongqing to the rest of China has been expanded and upgraded reducing logistical costs. Furthermore, the nearby Three Gorges Dam which is the world's largest, supplies Chongqing with power and allows oceangoing ships to reach Chongqing's Yangtze River port. These infrastructure improvements have led to the arrivals of numerous foreign direct investors (FDI) in industries ranging from car to finance and retailing; such as Ford, Mazda, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, ANZ Bank, Scotiabank, Wal-Mart, Metro AG and Carrefour, among other multinational corporations.\nChongqing's nominal GDP in 2011 reached 1001.1 billion yuan (US$158.9 billion) while registering an annual growth of 16.4%. However, its overall economic performance is still lagging behind eastern coastal cities such as Shanghai. For instance, its per capita GDP was 22,909 yuan (US$3,301) which is below the national average. Nevertheless, there is a massive government support to transform Chongqing into the region's economic, trade, and financial centre and use the municipality as a platform to open up the country's western interior to further development.Chongqing has been identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei, Anshan, Maanshan, Pingdingshan and Shenyang), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China.\n\n\n=== Economic and technological development zones ===\nThe city includes a number of economic and technological development zones:\n\nChongqing Chemical Industrial Park\nChongqing Economic & Technological Development Zone\nChongqing Hi-Tech Industry Development Zone\nChongqing New North Zone (CNNZ)\nChongqing Export Processing Zone\nJianqiao Industrial Park (located in Dadukou District)\nLiangjiang New Area\nLiangjiang Cloud Computing Center (the largest of its kind in China)Chongqing itself is part of the West Triangle Economic Zone, along with Chengdu and Xi'an.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nChongqing University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University of Political Science and Law (\u897f\u5357\u653f\u6cd5\u5927\u5b66)\nThird Military Medical University (\u7b2c\u4e09\u519b\u533b\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (\u91cd\u5e86\u90ae\u7535\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u7406\u5de5\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Jiaotong University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Medical University (\u91cd\u5e86\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Normal University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e08\u8303\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Technology and Business University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5de5\u5546\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Three Gorges University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e09\u5ce1\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing Telecommunication Institute (\u91cd\u5e86\u901a\u8baf\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Science and Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u79d1\u6280\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan Fine Arts Institute (\u56db\u5ddd\u7f8e\u672f\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan International Studies University (\u56db\u5ddd\u5916\u56fd\u8bed\u5927\u5b66)\nUniversity of Logistics (\u540e\u52e4\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Arts and Science (\u91cd\u5e86\u6587\u7406\u5b66\u9662)\nYangtze Normal University (\u957f\u6c5f\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Education (\u91cd\u5e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\n\n\n=== Notable high schools ===\nFuling Experimental High School (\u6daa\u9675\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.1 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u4e2d)\nChongqing Nankai Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5357\u5f00\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.8 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u516b\u4e2d)\nBashu Secondary School (\u5df4\u8700\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Railway High School (\u91cd\u5e86\u94c1\u8def\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Yucai Secondary School (\u80b2\u624d\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Foreign Language School (The High School Affiliated to Sichuan International Studies University \u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u5916)\nVerakin High School of Chongqing (The 2nd Chongqing Foreign Language School, \u91cd\u5e86\u4e8c\u5916)\nChongqing Qiujing High School (\u6c42\u7cbe\u4e2d\u5b66)\nHigh School Affiliated to Southwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u4e2d)\nChongqing NO.18 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5341\u516b\u4e2d)\n\n\n=== International schools ===\nYew Chung International School of Chongqing (\u91cd\u5e86\u8000\u4e2d\u56fd\u9645\u5b66\u6821)\nKL International School of Chongqing Bashu (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e02\u8bfa\u6797\u5df4\u8700\u5916\u7c4d\u4eba\u5458\u5b50\u5973\u5b66\u6821)\n\n\n== Transport ==\nSince its elevation to national-level municipality in 1997, the city has dramatically expanded its transportation infrastructure. With the construction of railways and expressways to the east and southeast, Chongqing is a major transportation hub in southwestern China.\nAs of October 2014, the municipality had 31 bridges across the Yangtze River including over a dozen in the city's urban core. Aside from the city's first two Yangtze River bridges, which were built, respectively, in 1960 and 1977, all of the other bridges were completed since 1995.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nPublic transport in Chongqing consists of metro, intercity railway, a ubiquitous bus system and the world's largest monorail network.\nAccording to the Chongqing Municipal Government's ambitious plan in May 2007, Chongqing is investing 150 billion RMB over 13 years to finish a system that combines underground metro lines with heavy monorail (called 'light rail' in China).\nAs of 2017, four metro lines, the 14 km (8.7 mi) long CRT Line 1, a conventional subway, and the 19 km (12 mi) long heavy monorail CRT Line 2 (through Phase II), Line 3, a heavy monorail connects the airport and the southern part of downtown., Line 6, runs between Beibei, a commuter city in the far north to the centre. Line 5 opened in late 2017.\nBy 2020 CRT will consist of 6 straight lines and 1 circular line resulting in 363.5 km (225.9 mi) of road and railway to the existing transportation infrastructure and 93 new train stations will be added to the 111 stations that are already in place.By 2050, Chongqing will have as many as 18 lines planned to be in operation.\n\n\n==== Aerial tramway ====\n\nChongqing is the only Chinese city that keeps public aerial tramways. Historically there were three aerial tramways in Chongqing: the Yangtze River Tramway, the Jialing River Tramway and the South Mountain Tramway. Currently, only Yangtze River Tramway is still operating and it is Class 4A Tourist Attractions in China. This tramway is 1,160 metres (3,810 feet) long, connecting the southern and northern banks of Yangtze River. The daily passenger volume is about 10,000.\n\n\n=== River port ===\n\nChongqing is one of the most important inland ports in China. There are numerous luxury cruise ships that terminate at Chongqing, cruising downstream along the Yangtze River to Yichang, Wuhan, Nanjing or even Shanghai. In the recent past, this provided virtually the only transportation option along the river. However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several port handling facilities exist throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nMajor train stations in Chongqing:\n\nChongqing railway station in Yuzhong, accessible via Metro Lines 1 & 3 (Lianglukou Metro station), is the city's oldest railway station and located near the city centre. The station handles mostly long-distance trains. There are plans for a major renovation and overhaul of this station, thus many services have been transferred to Chongqing North Railway Station.\nChongqing North railway station is a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to Chengdu, Beijing and other cities. It was completed in 2006 and is connected to Metro Line.\nChongqing West railway station is in Shapingba, a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to many cities. It is completed in 2018.\nShapingba railway station is in Shapingba, near Shapingba CBD, accessible via Metro Line 1. It handles many local and regional train services. It is completed in 2018.Chongqing is a major freight destination for rail with continued development with improved handling facilities. Due to subsidies and incentives, the relocation and construction of many factories in Chongqing has seen a huge increase in rail traffic.\nChongqing is a major rail hub regionally.\n\nChengdu\u2013Chongqing railway to Chengdu\nSichuan-Guizhou railway to Guiyang\nXiangyang\u2013Chongqing railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Huaihua railway to Hunan\nChongqing-Suining railway (Sichuan province)\nChongqing-Lichuan railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Lanzhou railway (Gansu) railway\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nTraditionally, the road network in Chongqing has been narrow, winding and limited to smaller vehicles because of the natural terrain, large rivers and the huge population demands on the area, especially in the Yuzhong District. In other places, such as Jiangbei, large areas of homes and buildings have recently been cleared to improve the road network and create better urban planning. This has seen many tunnels and large bridges needing to be built across the city. Construction of many expressways have connected Chongqing to neighbouring provinces. Several ring roads have also been constructed. The natural mountainous terrain that Chongqing is built on makes many road projects difficult to construct, including for example some of the world's highest road bridges.Unlike many other Chinese cities, it is rare for motorbikes, electric scooters or bicycles to be seen on Chongqing Roads. This is due to the extremely hilly and mountainous nature of Chongqing's roads and streets. However, despite this, Chongqing is a large manufacturing centre for these types of vehicles.\nChongqing-Chengdu Expressway\nChongqing-Chengdu 2nd Expressway (under construction)\nChongqing-Wanzhou-Yichang Highway (Wanzhou-Yichang section under construction)\nChongqing-Guiyang Highway\nChongqing-Changsha Expressway (Xiushan-Changsha section under construction)\nChongqing-Dazhou-Xi'a Highway (Dazhou-Xi'an section under construction)\nChongqing-Suining Expressway\nChongqing-Nanchong Expressway\nChina National Highway 210\nChina National Highway 212\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nWith so many bridges crossing the Yangtze and Jialing rivers in the urban area, Chongqing is sometimes known as the 'Bridge Capital of China'. The first important bridge in urban Chongqing was the Niujiaotuo Jialing River Bridge, built in 1958. The first bridge over the Yangtze river was the Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge (or Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge) built in 1977.\nAs of 2014, within the area of the 9 districts, there were 20 bridges on the Yangtze river and 28 bridges on the Jialing river. The bridges in Chongqing exhibit a variety of shapes and structures, making Chongqing a showcase for bridge design.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe major airport of Chongqing is Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport (IATA: CKG, ICAO: ZUCK). It is located in Yubei District. The airport offers a growing network of direct flights to China, South East Asia, the Middle East, North America, and Europe. It is located 21 km (13 mi) north of the city-centre of Chongqing and serves as an important aviation hub for south-western China. Jiangbei airport is a hub for China Southern Airlines, Chongqing Airlines, Sichuan Airlines, China Express Airlines, Shandong Airlines and Hainan Airlines's new China West Air. Chongqing also is a focus city of Air China, therefore it is very well connected with Star Alliance and Skyteam's international network. The airport currently has three parallel runways in operation. It serves domestic routes to most other Chinese cities, as well as international routes to Auckland, New York City, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, Doha, Dubai, Seoul, Bangkok, Phuket, Osaka, Singapore, Chiang Mai, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Mal\u00e9, Bali, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Batam, Rome and Helsinki. As of 2018, Jiangbei Airport is the 9th busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic in mainland China.Currently, Jiangbei airport has three terminals. Chongqing Airport has metro access (CRT Line 3 and Line 10) to its central city, and two runways in normal use.There are two other airports in Chongqing Municipality: Qianjiang Wulingshan Airport (IATA: JIQ, ICAO: ZUQJ) and Wanzhou Wuqiao Airport (IATA: WXN, ICAO: ZUWX). They are both class 4C airports and serve passenger flights to some domestic destinations including Beijing, Shanghai and Kunming. Two more airports are being constructed soon: Wulong Xiann\u00fcshan Airport and Wushan Shenn\u00fcfeng Airport.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe language native to Chongqing is Southwestern Mandarin. More precisely, the great majority of the municipality, save for Xiushan, speak Sichuanese, including the primary Chengdu-Chongqing dialect and Minjiang dialect spoken in Jiangjin and Qijiang. There are also a few speakers of Xiang and Hakka in the municipality, due to the great immigration wave to the Sichuan region (\u6e56\u5e7f\u586b\u56db\u5ddd) during the Ming and Qing dynasties. In addition, in parts of southeastern Chongqing, the Miao and Tujia languages are also used by some Miao and Tujia people.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAs the provisional Capital of China for almost ten years (1937 to 1945), the city was also known as one of the three headquarters of the Allies during World War II, as well as being a strategic center of many other wars throughout China's history. Chongqing has many historic war-time buildings or sites, some of which have since been destroyed. These sites include the People's Liberation Monument, located in the center of Chongqing city. It used to be the highest building in the area, but is now surrounded and dwarfed by numerous shopping centres. Originally named the Monument for the Victory over Axis Armies, it is the only building in China for that purpose. Today, the monument serves as a symbol for the city. The General Joseph W. Stilwell Museum, dedicated to General \"Vinegar Joe\" Stilwell, a World War II general. the air force cemetery in the Nanshan area, in memory of those air force personnel killed during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), and the Red Rock Village Museum, a diplomatic site for the Communist Party in Chongqing led by Zhou Enlai during World War II, and Guiyuan, Cassia Garden, where Mao Zedong signed the \"Double 10 (10 October) Peace Agreement\" with the Kuomintang in 1945.\n\nThe Baiheliang Underwater Museum, China's first underwater museum,\nThe Memorial of Great Tunnel Massacre, a former air-raid shelter where a major massacre occurred during World War II.\nThe Great Hall of the People in Chongqing is based on the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Chongqing is known for its spicy food. Its food is normally considered numbing because of the use of Sichuan pepper, also known as Sichuan peppercorn, containing hydroxy alpha sanshool. Chongqing's city centre has many restaurants and food stalls where meals often cost less than RMB10. Local specialties here include dumplings and pickled vegetables and, different from many other Chinese cuisines, Chongqing dishes are suitable for the solo diner as they are often served in small individual sized portions. Among the delicacies and local specialties are these dishes:\n\nChongqing hot pot (Huoguo) \u2013 Chongqing's local culinary specialty which was originally from Northern China.

          "As others have said, it's very touristy and crowded. You are in a narrow lane so there isn't anywhere else to go most of the time. Occasionally, a lane will appear to the left (walking in the direction of the river), take it, and see a little more authentic slice of this",
          "We only had a short time in Chongqing so headed here for some fun. Yes it is busy but lots going on and the stalls are usually trying to get your attention by doing small demonstrations. Be it bashing dough or dressing up for the opera. Didn't feel pressured into buying and",
          "Old buildings are pretty, but this is mostly just another tourist trap shopping street with piles of cheap souvenirs. Interesting local food stalls. Loud and noisy like a 3-ring circus.",
          "Tons of local tourists on weekends, but that is to be expected in all popular Chinese places. Nice park, without a soul - everybody is busy walking narrow streets with tons of shops selling spices and souvenirs",
          "A very old fluvial port town integrated into Chongqing, completely restored and touristified. Really crowded, specially on weekends. Walk along its narrow streets is like swimming in a crowd of crazied people buying street food, admiring souvenirs for tourists and taking selfies",
          "A small town shows how Chongqing looks like newly hundred years ago. Admission to the area is free. Many traditional local food was selling there, also traditional arts performance. We watched a local opera show in which the actor changed his face mask in seconds!!",
          "I\u2019ve visited this place twice now, the first time was last May and I went early in the morning so it wasn\u2019t so crowded and it was easier to walk around and shop. The second time I went was close to a public holiday and slightly later in the morning so it was a lot more crowded.",
          "In reading the history of Ciqikou, I had the impression that most of the shops in this area would be dedicated to the selling of porcelain. Was I mistaken. This is actually a very good mix of souvenir shops, clothing stores, snack and food stalls, and also a wide variety of",
          "We arrived for dinner & unfortunately shops here start to close when we ended. I will come again in the afternoon & stay till shops close. There are nice 2nd storey spots for drinks n music. Many singing from windows to shoppers. Sadly, the Art shops open mostly during the day",
          "I am always fond of an old town,old streets or ancient town. So, when I was in Chongqing last May, Ciqikou was on my list to visit. And sure it was, it did not disappoint me at all. Shopping, shopping and shopping. You will get to see a lot of things from porcelains, hot pot",
          "Ciqikou is on the bank of the Jialing River with the history of the area going back over 1,700 years. From 1368-1911, the area was best known for production of porcelain. From the Binle Hotel at the #5 Blue Line (Jintonglu metro stop), I went down to the #1 Red Line",
          "Our friends said this was a replica of an old town. I thought it would include a variety of buildings, but mostly it was just shops. There was one temple being worked on. It is a good place to buy souvenirs, but pretty expensive. Very crowded like almost every place in",
          "Great place to visit for sampling different foods, shopping for tea sets, and souvenirs. There are lots of little lanes and alleys to discover as well as the main streets. We found a place where we was treated to s free show with the final performance being mask changing, which",
          "I\u2019ve been to a lot of tourist areas in China and Ciqikou was one of my favorites. You can get there by the line 1 metro. I would suggest you get there early, I got there by 9:30 and by 10 it was busy, and it just got busier as the day went on. There are some cute cafes, and a",
          "CiQiKou is about 15 subway stops from JieFangBei on Line 1. We got there just before 10am today (Monday) and it wasn't too crowded, but by 12 noon the streets were filled up with people, so much so that it was hard to really do anything or enjoy it. I don't think I would bother",
          "I wanted to visit Ciqikou for its history but on the day we visited we were hemmed in like sardines all the way through the area and it was quite uncomfortable. There are many many shops selling chilli based products and only a few (that we could see) that focussed on the crafts",
          "The first time I came here in 2014, Ciqikou was very nice. It was crowded, but nice. Now it is packed and nothing more then a wall to wall place where anyone is selling their Knick knacks. Please do not waste your time. It has gone down hill and I do not recommend this place",
          "It is an ancient street since Song Dynasty. Presently, it is a pedestrian street where tourists can enjoy shopping for local gifts and souvenirs.",
          "This old town area was a nice place to explore with many food options and items to purchase. It gets very crowded with both local & foreign tourists",
          "I was told this is the place to go to to buy Sichuan peppers and other authentic ingredients for Chinese food. I got green Sichuan peppers, some dried red chilies and aniseed also. Plenty of souvenir vendors. There's probably a lot more to see there, but it was hot and the place",
          "You find a lot of interesting things to buy ranging from Spices to souvenirs. You can also watch Sichuan Opera there!! (Recommend)",
          "The area has some charm but the crowds and the sticky tofu smell makes it \u201caverage\u201d. They are some nice gallery overlooking the river (unfortunately there is a big construction at this time of the year). There are a lot of food specialty. Suggested to go for a quick tour of",

          "Be warned, this \"village\" is PACKED with tourists, and in the main street it is more like a shopping arcade than an old town street. Chongqing tourist broad promote this place relentlessly, the result is it has lost all old town charms and it is just a glorified place for",

          "If you are looking for some local spicy food or some nice lovely souvenir, then you can\u2019t miss Ciqikou. Easy to access since it\u2019s close to the Metro (line one) and it takes just 20 minutes from the city center (30rmb or less)",
          "Much more authentic feel than other old town streets that we\u2019ve been to in China. Touristy but at least they seem to sell less plastic trinkets and fake goods marketed to foreigners. Mostly foods and souvenirs for Chinese tourists. Nice artwork, nougats and if you can find her,",
          "We visited Ciqikou on a weekday and it was still very busy. Bustling crowds along the main streets add to the atmosphere of the place. Yes it is clearly targeting tourists (but those are by far Chinese visitors). However, the smell of the food cocking and the spices available is",
          "Ciqikou is an ancient town in the Shapingba District of Chongqing. Long, winding, streets with a mix of new and old shops, a glimpse into the past with traditional dress and cooking techniques, all done with the flair that centuries of history brings. You\u2019ll find temples,",
          "Enjoyed the markets, and watching stall operators turn their trade to attract shoppers. Authentic China meets modern markets - clean & very busy. Go early to avoid crowds.",
          "Loved the visit here. Look up, look down, walk to take in a bit of history and just think what it \u201cused to be\u201d. There are lots of shops, lots of food, bars, shows, and many sights to see. We were there three hours and could have stayed longer. Talk to he craftsmen and feel",

          "The Metro station that stops/leaves here, the place itself, is simply insane with people. Smoking, spitting, pushing, loud, and no idea how to behave in a crowd. Everybody who visits Chongqing comes here. 90% of the stalls are for food, the other 10% sell tourist items. The",
          "We were lucky to stop here for lunch with our tour group.Being on the balcony of the top floor of the restaurant we were able to see so much more and in a more leisurely fashion than fighting our way through the crowds .The placed is busy ,noisy ,packed with people and food",
          "great old buildings but all decorated in red latterns etc. most them are restaurants. how much can you eat?! one visit is more than enough..",
          "Interesting way to spend a few hours if weather is good. Very crowded, the stores certainly get repetitive as you walk around. Good food options if you look hard.",

          "It is very convenient to go to this location as the CRT train line was at the entrance of the town. You will enjoy yourself eating and tasting foods from the very beginning. Shops are all around and quite crowded with tourists but overall it a must visit place. Enjoy exploring!",

          "I had an unplanned one day stop over in Chongching and ventured out to the ancient port town of Ciqikou. I stayed in the city close to the airport and it was about a \u00a570 taxi ride (40 mins) This is an amazing tourist destination... huge, you could easily allow a couple of days",
          "well.. we went there on Sunday, and that was just crazy. Plenty of people. But this small village has some charm. There are small boho style, crazy teahouses, vendors who will sell you eveything. but again, its all about buying and selling. I didnt see any info about village",

          "Crowded with people. Many hawkers selling you Chinese stuffs. Food is ok but is not recommented. Wonder through the old town is part of the China's tour.",
          "So crowded in the weekend. It\u2019s like a huge market which sell everything. Foods, souvenirs, local delicacies. Some of the food stall has a long queu. And it\u2019s also a good place to take some pictures.",
          "This was in keeping with what we know of China. The narrow streets with quaint chinese architectured buildings housing small shops selling oodles of food, chinese knickknacks, porcelain ware, embroidered paintings, shawls etc was really refreshing",
          "Visited this place after lunch and find it so crowded with people. You will need to weave in and out and constantly being pushed. The ancient street is so full of character with the buildings being built during the Ming Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty. Some were refurbished and",
          "When we visited this area it was so crowded that we were pushed and shoved in all directions. There was a lot of colourful street food on display but as an unpleasant smell pervaded throughout we were glad to get out.",
          "We went there by subway on a Sunday. It was lively and crowded. Many stores selling snacks and food.",
          "This place is very nice. It's easy to get there by public transport or taxi. Even i visited it on Wednesday it was full of people. It did not change my view on it. Old architecture and smell of The Hot Pot on every corner took me to differet world. There is a Budha's temple.",
          "Have to try all the traditional food of ChongQing here, so many shops... You have to spend a whole day here, check out any shop with a long queue, they surely have something you need to try. I bought those Mahua snack, spent half an hour in the queue, but worth it. They offer",
          "mostly touristy attraction, not authentic by rebuilt by new China to attract $$$. This is a tourist trap to avoid if you have this option",
          "We spent 3 hours at Ciqikou, longer than planned, enjoying the crowds, craziness, and hustle-bustle. It's a very large place. Some of the food being sold is actually quite good, including the grilled octopus on a stick, and Beggar's Chicken (cooked in a clay container",

          "My colleague and I visited this as it was accessible by metro. The directions were well signposted and though busy it was quite easy to find quiet space. The wares on sale were the usual tourist tat but we did find a few interesting pieces. Worth 2 hours of anyone's time.",

          "Narrow streets, rather crowdly. Old houses, with street bars and shops. Eat something - obligatory. Buy something. Try the sychuan pepper - green and red - and feel the difference between what you know from shops in Europe and original taste. Funny meat (p.e. rabbit heads),",

          "We were in Chongqing for about six hours, en route to our Yangtze Cruise from Chengdu. Hence our tour operator could choose only one attraction to visit, and still let us have time enough for a nice leisurely dinner. I am really glad they chose this delightful little village.",

          "Back in my days at high school, i used to study history and one of the topics we studied was the Chinese conquest. It was so real for me to visit the place and be taken through a journey of thousands of years, some of which I could relate with back home. We are all humans. The",
          "This place is always packed with crowd. Even on weekdays. However, the streets are wider than most other ancient streets in China so it\u2019s easier to stroll. But it\u2019s not suitable for elderly and those who needs assistance as there are quite some stairs and slopes. Overall, a nice",
          "I caught the Metro out to Cicikou. Cicikou is well signposted from the Metro. The ancient village is extensive and you spend plenty of time there. I found seeing the various stages of preparing the hot pot base really interesting. The smells are pretty cool as well. As you get",
          "I was hoping for more history from this than it offerred. Mostly it was shopping. My group appeared to be the only Westerners while we were there. The food stalls were interesting, but the retails shops were pretty standard. On the day we went there was a foul odor because of",
          "Yes it is often crowded and touristy, but it is worth a couple of hours to survey the architecture of the older city, see local delicacies being prepared, and there are ample free tastings if you are so inclined. Some areas are nicely treed, and there are some nice shops tucked",

          "We spent about an hour here which was enough. It was fascinating walking around and seeing all of the shops and stores. Live scorpions, stinking hotpots so brutal the smell will make you gag, comb shops (and people dressed up as combs?!), cheap souvenirs, bakeries, and so many",
          "Our Chongqing guide took us to Cicikou in the afternoon after lunch. It is a quaint little town with lots of curio shops and food places. There are all sorts of crafts on display, including weaving, tea pouring, comb-making, leaf painting etc. We spent a very nice afternoon",
          "Let's be honest: most of the \"old towns\" are basically shopping malls presented as if this is how people used to live. And it may well be that many of these are representative, but the main purpose of these places is to sell goods. That said, this place does it in a charming and",
          "About 30-40 min by car/taxi outside out Chongqing, it is worth the visit. Tons of shops, traditional & more contemporary shops, you can find pretty much everything. Great place to buy souvenirs. For a better experience, go early in the morning (9h - 10h) as the place gets",
          "this place was packed when we visited, which was tough given the narrow streets. the main street is basically lined with shophouses; rather uninteresting. there are some buildings of historical interest but the narrow streets and hilly terrain makes it rather tedious to cover.",
          "Very crowded area but many shops selling the same things. If you enjoy crowds shovingyou rudely (and the local Chinese do that extremely well) and end up buying nothing, then you should not miss this place.",
          "We toured this village and found it very quant and lively. We had the best coffee at a restaurant on the first floor. The market sells many local food and handicraft items and is lively and entertaining. Worth a visit!",

          "Always very crowded. Entertaining for a couple of hours. Lots of food tasting available, but it is mostly the same food over and over again. Wall to wall people. Nice riverfront area to get away from the crowds for a bit.",

          "When we visited this area it was very busy and bustling which made it fun, lots of shops and places to eat. It may not be the best place to buy things as there is very little bargaining but it is very entertaining to watch all of the different sales pitches and food",
          "I really like a good snack street, so I did enjoy this area; however, the one in Xi'an is a lot better, but the food is different. Definitely worth a visit - get some traditional Chongqing snacks (way different then that of the rest of China).",
          "We had a great time walking around, looking at the shops and people. I would highly recommend that anyone visiting Chongqing visit this area. It is crowded and very popular. I bought a few small souveniers here that I found much cheaper later on my trip.",
          "If you are new to China, you would probably find this place worth the experience. There is plenty to look at and plenty of potential photo opportunities. However this area has little unique to offer a more seasoned China traveler. Every Chinese city has an old area just like",

          "The porcelain village is a must see spot in Chongqing! The whole area is like an old town, built from ages ago. The wooden structures house and pebble road bring out the ancient feeling. There are a ton of shops in the Porcelain village. It is well worth the walk throughout",
          "A very interesting place to visit in Chongqing. It is like Jiufen in Taiwan but the streets are much wider with shops and restaurants selling all and sunder. Although a restored ancient town, the place is lovely and worth a visit. Was told by hotel staff this place operates 24",
          "No visit to Chongqing is complete without a trip to Ciqikou. It consists of one main street lined with tourist shops, mainly food, but also trinkets, antiques and porcelain. The old buildings are quaint, but redeveloped recently, so how much of it is genuinely old, I don\u2019t know.",
          "I joined a group tour to the Three Gorges in October 2017 and the last destination is Ci Qi Kou of Chongqing. It was the hub for porcelain trade in old days owing to it connection to river traffic and the manufacturing plant from surrounding area. Except the slate floor",

          "It was an old town with history. But like a lot of old towns in China, Ci Qi Kou is very commercialised. You'd find a lot of stores for souvenirs and snacks there. Not much about culture is emphasised. You can easily finish the visit to this place in 2 hours. It's quite",
          "While this area is relatively new it is still a fun place to wander around if you like seeing various foodstuffs etc. There were very few western tourists when we visited and it seems it has an appeal to anyone. Get there early to avoid the inevitable crowds and get away from",
          "I've traveled to quite a few cities in China (over a 15), and have seen many of the key tourist sites in each. Ci Qi Kou is similar to what I've seen in most, though I'd say better than average in that you can see the making of Sichuan hot sauce and some other foods that you",
          "Busy, bustling, but nice enough tourist zone. Don't expect any actual old buildings - this \"ancient town\" was built about the year 2000, and is having its \"ancient port\" built and opened to the public later this year (2017). Lots of interesting and attractive, if a little price",

          "This was a nice way to spend a day but the crowds made it impossible to get any good photos. I would still say it is worth a visit as there is a lot of history and some beautiful old buildings. There is a lot of food but like all of these places it is expensive.",

          "5 mins walk from the train. Very crowded with tour groups. It is more like a shopping market with many eateries and repeated souvenir shops. Sadly with very little traces of it being a pottery village. Do try the crab meat dumpling. Over rated ground baked chicken as it was",
          "Lots of local snacks on offer, problem is that they are all similar to each other. I recommend the Indian sweet roti. It was delicious. Good place for souvenirs. Long Street but fun. Has it's own MTR station",
          "This place is easy to reach - just take Line 1 of the Chongqing Metro Westwards. I visited on a Sunday and it was very crowded but I still could see all the stalls that I wanted. A good range of local traditional gifts and delicious foods. Food tends to be a little more",

          "This a really great spot to visit. It has great old charm and architecture. It feels like you are walking through a fun old village. It is just non stop food treats. You can enjoy some great grilled meats to traditional sweats, and so much in between. It is also full of fun",
          "You can find lots of souvenirs here and they have several street food vendors. I actually went in May 2016. I will say that shops in here come and go. In a matter of a year and a half of visiting 2014-2016, shops I had been to had disappeared. That said, this place is a",

          "We didnt book optional tour but walked to museum. Great pics along the way and the museum was pretty good with a great collection of history and pieces to see.. Off boat at 0800 but museum doesn\u2019t open till 0900 had to be back on board at 0930.. needed more time to go through",
          "This museum is free and it has 4 floors with different exhibitions. It will take 2-3 hours if you like history. We went on Wednesday no much queue but lots of local tourists. Strongly recommended.",
          "The museum does not only display the Three Gorges environmental history but also respects to cultural heritage the region of the Yangtze River. There are four main displays: Three Gorges, Ancient Ba-Yu \u2013 early history of Chongqing, the Anti-Japanese War and displays of painting",
          "This is an incredible piece of engineering - well worth seeing. It is helpful to have a guide that can explain everything. There are escalotors so it easy to get to the top. Make sure that you have water, good shoes, hat and sunscreen. Fantastic views.",
          "Worth a trip to see the Hydro-dam, new and old lift systems. The journey to the top is eased by escalators (thank God!) and the further 170 odd steps are quite easy....apart from the Chinese that refuse to obey the one-way signs for going up and down! Worth a trip, just for",
          "I hav visited it twice. The museum and all the surroundings are impressive, super well maintained and very interesting. Beautifull gardens and amazing view. I travelled here in 2016, in spring.",
          "You descend 150 feet under water to the exhibit room to view he ancient rock carvings. It is the longest steepest escalator both up and down we have ever seen. The museum is fine, but not that interesting. The decent and view under water is.",
          "Four floors covering the history of the area, including the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. Open from 9 AM to 5 PM, free to the public, CLOSED on MONDAY. Closest metro stop is zengjiayan, stop #5 on Line #2. There is a 25 minute movie detailing the construction of the",

          "If you are doing the Yangtze cruise, do this tour, you get to understand the mind blowing scale of this project, and some of the complexities. For examples 1. There is a ship lift, that can lift up to a 3000 tonne vessel up the damn wall in 3 minutes... 2. The hydro electric",
          "Its difficult to get excited about a standard museum when there is so much exciting things to see in China. Its worth a visit and interesting to understand the history of the area before getting on the river cruise.",
          "First time travelling to China, specifically Chongqing. Very impressive. Very polite people, not minding their curiosity of being black, and wanting to take pictures with me. Extensive food choices. The museum itself is an art. The ancient and very rich culture that dates back",
          "I used to live beside the museum, i visit frequently. it's clean, clear, spacy. free to visit. Special exhibition every month",
          "We enjoyed visiting this museum for an hour our so before our Three Gorges river cruise and it offered good perspective. It was modern with plenty of English interpretation. Also, a really good gift store.",
          "There was only 1 exhibit directly connected to the Three Gorges Dam. I was hoping for more about the engineering, although the Chinese Government's perspective on the negative effects had an interesting spin. The other exhibits didn't have much connection to the dam. The gift",
          "This museum is excellent and tells the history of the Three Gorges region. There are four levels of exhibits containing a wide range of artifacts. Admission to the Three Gorges Museum is free! I highly recommend visiting this museum.",
          "the visit gives you a good general orientation of where you are relative to Chongqing and general knowledge plus history of the gorges. I also enlighten you to places that you never thought of visiting.",
          "Viewing the museum was a comprehensive introduction to the Yangtze river history and the building of the Three Gorges Dam. I would skip the movie as it was of very poor quality. Your time will be better spent viewing the museum.",
          "Take a few minutes and visit this museum. It is free and very interesting. It is impressive to see the engineering involved in building the dam. You can also take an escalator to the top of the mountain and see the surrounding countryside.",
          "If you have the time, well worth going. No entrance fee, beautiful and very well maintained. Not too busy",
          "Went to this museum fairly late in the day and did by that not have the time to go through all of it, but I went through parts of it and thought it to be nice and as I'm here for a while I might go back to see what I missed. What i apreciated was the exihibition of the chinese",
          "This three gorge dam is quite an engineering project. It is massive and controls flooding along the Yangtze River. It is the largest hydroelectric power station in the world.",
          "Well worth a visit, many displays, not only of the dam but historic China, through many dynesties. Would need a few hours to see all.",
          "The on screen presentation was in Chinese with English subtitles at the beginning which disappeared the moment the narration started. I know a little Chinese and even found that it went on for too long. Many people (including the Chinese conversant ones) left before the end of",
          "Had a great time here. The museum is very big but still well organized. And the best of it is it\u2019s free! Make sure you check out the gift shop too which isn\u2019t overpriced like many others.",
          "Well worth a visit. The 3 gorges dam is an amazing feat of engineering.The actual scale of what the Chinese had to do to build this dam is simply mind blowing. Before building, the Chinese built a trial prototype . The museum has 3 floors.",
          "The Three Gorges Museum (3GM) would be in the TOP THREE of places to visit in CQ! It has over three floors - at least the first couple of floors have English translations and the remaining exhibits have random translations in English - but not all! We'd been a whole WEEK in CQ",
          "The museum could have been really good if they had English captions. They only have that in one room on ground floor :-(",
          "It's worth taking the 10 minute stroll from Zengjiayan metro station to visit here, the people halls opposite and the square in-between... We were able to walk straight in and it was completely free... There were some interesting articles but there was not a huge amount of",
          "Big outside, but nothing special inside. If you want to relax on sunday afternoon, in the square there are a lot of Chinese people and you can enjoy with lifestyle.",
          "This is a quite large museum with many different departments. There are texts in english at the first floor, but no in every ather floor. That didn't bother us, because there is so much to see that you just don't have time to read everything. I find this museum one of the best",
          "I am Chinese but I live and work in Hong Kong. It was an eye opener for me to come to Chongqing for only the second time in my life. You need good feet to cover the museum. It has several floors but there are lifts. I saw a great deal about the history, geography and",

          "A museum very informational on the Yangtze River's Three Gorges Dam project. It's free and convenient -- only 10 min walk from the metro's Zengjiayan stn on Line 2. It has 4 floors of different exhibits plus two movies incl. a 360-degree tour of the Three Gorges. One big",

          "Honestly, I was really disappointed with this museum. It was free which was nice, but the exhibits weren't particularily interesting! Most of it was written in Mandarin, and despite the building being beautiful, it was a huge disappointment inside!",
          "It has four floors of galleries, of rather mixed quality. Some sections are quite good, others less so. Overall, I\u2019d give this museum an \u2018average\u2019 rating. All galleries have an English-language introduction, but, with few exceptions, the individual exhibits are only labelled",
          "Had a few hours to spend. We went to the Great Hall of the people and opposite was the Three Gorges Museum. 4 floors and four exhibitions per floor. Very limited English explanations because few westerners. Free entrance!",
          "Here you can get a better understanding of this project before riding the escalator up to the viewing area. No charge so just wander in, its not a big place but considering China gets nearly 6 percent of its electricity from here worth taking a look at. Note that although this",
          "A beautiful building and the exhibitions are interesting and informative. You need at least three hours to get around to view everything.",
          "Compulsory visit but it does not add much to your knowledge from seeing and sailing through the real thing.",
          "An afternoon visit on Sunday with hundreds of senior citizens and children. A massive structure with 4 floors and plenty of fixed and temporary exhibition halls. Need more than 3 hours to go through.",
          "The name of the museum is rather misleading as the Three Gorges exhibit only takes up one third of the first of three floors. The rest is taken up of various Chinese artifacts such as art, porcelain, cultural etc. There is one anti-Japanese room. Rather disappointing as it would",
          "This fabulous free museum over 4 floors looks at the history of Chongqing. There is an also an exhibition of the Three Gorges and a model of the dam.1.4 million people were displaced to finish the dam which took 17 yrs to complete but was on the drawing board for more than 40",
          "This world's largest hydroelectric project is not to be missed when visiting China. The Dam itself has 5 times the hydro generation of Hoover Dam. Although it's not as tall as Hoover it is much longer (1.4 miles). It serves the hydro needs of 1.5% of China's population. The",

          "The size of this project is breathtaking, the repercussions to the local people and the benefits are so interesting to see. The size of the dam is unbelievable, to see the height that the river has increased by is astounding. The actual gorges are beautiful and now so easy to",
          "This museum has exhibitions on the various minority ethnicities in Chongqing. Also, on the construction and impact of the Three Gorges Dam. It has displays of ancient Ba-Yu civilisation, from the ancient kingdom of Ba, ancestor to the modern center of Chongqing (Yu Zhong). It",
          "A large museum with a wide selection of exhibits. Its in central Chongqing, so very convenient to get to - and you can spend the whole day in there if you're the sort of person who likes to go slowly round museums. The curation of the ground floor has English as well as Chinese",
          "What a wonderful piece of construction. It might not be as tall as other dams we have toured like Glen Canyon or Hoover Dam but the size is extremely impressive. The 2 ship locks are huge. The weather is unpredictable, ought guide said that we were there on a pretty good day, it",
          "I took a taxi here which was most efficient. There is a simplistic guide in English. I found the information on the dam sadly lacking but you are given a view of the three gorge environment. There are a number of rooms about the town of Chongqing and its history as well as",
          "This is a very beautiful museum with lots to see across the 4 floors. It is definitely worth a visit when you have a spare half day. The main display of the Three Gorges is on 1st floor and has some great images and details from before the dam was built.",
          "If you are intending to cruise the Yangtze, this museum offers a lot of insight to the development of the Three Gorges dam and the archeological finds prior to the flooding. We visited with a local guide and found it very useful.",
          "It's a good place to look at the history of the 3 gorges. The best is it's free and so cool to spend our time in the museum. Best 4 storey tour",

          "Overall this is a nice museum. It covers not only the three gorges project, but also Chongqing history and various other topics. It is clean but the hallways are hot. However, the inside of the exhibit halls are air conditioned.",
          "The Museum is really a general Museum. The facts about the Three Gorges Dam are on the 1st Floor. There is a lot of statements about the 1.1 million people who were re-located, calling them \"migrants\" when they were the original settlers of that area! Also the copy in the",
          "This place is truly amazing and worth a visit. It is so big and such a massive build and needs to be seen. The grounds are well kept. I was also fortunate to have travelled on a river cruise through the Three Gorges.",
          "A must visit. Many people were moved in order to build the dam. Also many artifacts will never be excavated because many, many sites are now underwater. Educational...do not miss.",
          "Good exhibits on the local area and the Three Gorges, particularly the Ba people that lived here. The geologic history of the gorges was interesting, and I enjoyed that they had river stones from before the dam was put in. They also had an informative, if a bit random, exhibit",
          "Heard about how people were originally forced from their homes, but to see how things have improved in terms of housing and employment is mind boggling. Most impressive is the re-forestation everywhere.",
          "We did the boattrip on the Yangsteriver, the third longest river in the world. The museum is a good insight of this big project of the building the 3 Gorges dam. The cruise on the river is a nice way to relax and getting more insight of the Chinese cultural.",

          "The museum's modern building differs from the traditional architecture of the people's square and the administrative buildings around it. Its three floors contain a rich collection of artifacts that describe the region's host from prehistoric times. The collections of Chinese",
          "This piece of engineering is explained in detail in the museum. An amazing place to visit whilst on a river cruise.",
          "Easy to get too, Bus, Train or Taxi's. Taxis' are very cheap in Chongqing, and entry to the Museum is free. So if you are in Chongqing it's worth a visit.",

          "We were part of a Sinorama travel group on the Sinorama Gold 3 Yangtze River cruise ship. After docking, we had a 1 hour bus ride to the Three Gorges Dam and Museum. The museum is a very informative place to start BEFORE looking at the dam, ship locks, etc. I suggest you learn",

          "An interesting visit to see the history of the Three gorges area that has now culminated in the largest dam in the world. Quite a few steps out the front. Accessible by metro train station, but if limited time best to arrange a day tour of Chongqing with driver and guide. Just",
          "We really loved visiting this museum but because of limited time, only saw sections of it. As we already visited the museum at Yichang, we concentrated on the photos/information of war time history against the Japanese at Chongqing. Would recommend spending a whole day there",
          "Worth a visit if you're going on the cruise to understand the history behind it. Also a part with memorial to the fallen from Second World War.",
          "No time to travel the entire three gorges? Just visit the museum and it will bring you thru the gorges a 3D tour. I also learnt about Chongqing at WWII in another section of the museum.",
          "Visited this museum after enjoying a 5 day / 4 night Yangtze River Gorge upstream druise from Yichang to Chongqing. The ground floor part of this large, modern and well maintained museum highlights both the construction of the dam and the flora and fauna of the Three Gorges",

          "They do say than some museums are worth a visit on a wet day and this summed this one up. It was dipping down with rain so it was nice to go somewhere dry. Modern museum with several good exhibitions and a few dull ones. Nice coffee shop and gift shop. Seen it, done it,",
          "This was a self guided at your own pace visit. I was with a tour but it was optional whether or not you wanted to visit or how long you stayed inside. We hit some of the high points on the main floor and purchased a few interesting treasures to take home with us to remember our",
          "What a stunning building inside and out. Representing the dam and the water on the outside does not prepare for the grandious interior which was very impressive. Nicely laid out museum and as others have commented, shame for us non-natives that only thr ground floor has",

          "While not the most fascinating museum, Three Gorges Museum is a nice place to spend an hour or two learning a bit about the city of Chongqing, its history and about the surrounding geography. Most of the exhibits on the lower floors are explained in English as well as Mandarin.",
          "The Three Gorges Museum is located near the CRT easily to reach by getting off the train at Zhenjianyan and walk for about 300 meters. The place is nice and great for making selfie. Marvelous place, enormous museum.",

          "The visit we undertook to the dam at Sandouping was a little rushed, so we did not get a chance to see everything. However, what we did see was awesome. The dam, the biggest power generation station in the world, was constructed to generate electricity and control flooding of",
          "Museum about the three gorges dam, how it build and history. It is also an English explanation, quite modern Free admission",
          "If you can't make the trip to the actual venue, this museum gives you a good sense of the scale of human endeavour in putting this together. The western media would report on the environmental impact and massive relocation of millions of people but if you see it from the lens",
          "Seems to be more of a tribute to communist party than the dam. Lots of pics of happy workers All in Chinese so no great for foreigners",

          "Full of treasures; some of them taken from villages and towns that were drowned during the construction of the 3 gorges dam. I particularly liked the art section. There were many prehistoric stone rubbings of animals and mythical creatures that I have never seen the like of in",

          "It's in the name- it is the Three Gorges Museum. That is what it is, and that is all it strives to be. Absolutely nothing wrong with that, as the Three Gorges area is an archeologically and anthropologically highly important area of southwest China. As a resident of Beijing,",
          "Very interesting presentation on how they selected the dam site, construction details and some mention of the controversy of the results. Information with working models. Highly recommended.",

          "I give it average score because it was for free, but otherwise it was pretty boring museum. The exhibits were largely poor, many lacking english translations. The old Chinese currency on display was neat, the photos of old Chongqing interesting and there appears to be an",

          "Lots of different exhibits for different tastes: a couple hours worth at least. The historical section is fascinating, both for the history and for the propaganda. It's free and gets you out of the heat/rain. Definitely worth visiting once. Lots of stairs. Can't remember if",
          "There is free admission and air conditioning inside which is pretty cool. There are a lot of exhibits including Chinese paintings, ecology, money, pottery, in addition to the dams. But there is so much that it gets a little repetitive. It's better to find one you are interested",
          "Split over a number of levels, the museum have a variety of exhibitions. I particularly like the ground floor about the building of the dam. Disappointing there aren't more English translations.",
          "If you need an example of Chinese technology, this is their number one attraction. You go to the store/museum and it has a small scale replica of the dam. You walk outside and see how it works. Everything about this attraction is not only engaging but the scope of the",
          "The three gorges museum is definitely worth visiting, particularly for those people who likes the history. The entrance is free of charge but need to queue up and pass through the security check. It opens from 9AM. We stayed there approximately. 1.5 hours, stroll from the top",
          "Unlike other museums in Chongqing, the Three gorges museum has lot more to offer than just pictures and remains from the chinese polical and war era. Its huge and worth going. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes. Do not go during public holidays or weekends, it will be crowded",
          "A beautiful facility located in an historic setting, the museum chronicles the history of the region of Chongqing and the three gorges dam development. History of Chongqing, including the war years of 1937 to 1949 are well covered, but English translations are only present about",

          "We went on the self guided tour before our three day Yangtze River tour. Different exhibits showing how the project came to be. Clean, modern museum.",
          "Before visiting this Museum,we sailed for 4 days up the river. This gave us a better understanding of this largest world hydro project.",
          "The good thing about this museum is that it's free. It's quite a beautiful museum and despite being mostly in Chinese it was still a very enjoyable experience",
          "Its got good insight into ChongQings culture and the 3 Gorges and parts of ancient history too. You would need to get an English guide as there isnt toooo much english here.",
          "The museum is easy to get to via subway. It's a magnificent building directly opposite the impressive People's Hall. Entry is free and you should allocate about three hours to see the exhibits. There are permanent and temporary exhibitions and they are all extremely well",
          "We visited this dome shaped museum in Chongqing .It displays four main theme for educational , research and perservation purposes.They were the ancient Ba-Yu culture and history , early Chongqing , Japanese invasion during WW2 and the epic Three Gorges Dam.. The museum has",
          "The museum is free to enter, after the security check. It has 4 floors and there are exhibitions and displays on all the floors. There are plenty of toilets and a coffee shop. Unfortunately we didn't get a coffee as it was near closing time and we couldn't sit down inside with",
          "First good thing is that its for free. No admission cost. The building itself is spectacular made of huge pieces of white marble. The museum displays are fantastic. You have to go look. No wonder this attraction is rated so high.",
          "Ok - another security check to enter this Museum, and another cigarette lighter lost lol - that makes around 20 during my Chinese adventure... The Museum is multi levels, and has some very impressive pieces. Worth a visit (but not another lighter!)...",
          "Well worth visiting for the ancient and modern history of the Chongqing area. Look out for the some lovely retelling of the plight of the 1.3m people moved for the new dam. Be prepared to catch taxi back to downtown area.",
          "Great maps and mini-scale depictions of the area. Of course there are stores selling memorabilia, but it's worth looking at. We enjoyed the tour as it gave us the history of the building of the three gorges area and the locks and how many people were displaced because of the",
          "Three Gorges is one of the exhibits. There are other Halls filled with exhibitions of the war against the Japanese and the history of the city.",
          "This was much better than I had expected. It is worthwhile visiting as it is free to enter, has some interesting exhibitions, and is in a lovely area near the impressive looking great hall. At the moment there are two exhibitions in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the end",
          "This was a good preview of the area before we got on the Three Gorges boat excursion the next day. There is definitely some propaganda in it too like \"all the people gladly gave up their land and homes for the betterment of the country\".",
          "We thought the displays and information was very well organized and very informative. Nice building and very first rate!",
          "The museum has a model of the three Gorge dam and the 5 locks it takes for a ship to travel the Yangtze River. Information on the 10 years construction and massive movement of people to higher ground or to cities and housing provided to them.",
          "surely worth a visit to check out some of the local attractions as well as historic insights into the area around",
          "We spent an enjoyable morning exploring the museum. It has five levels of exhibits, some better than others, but overall a good time.",
          "The section on the Three Gorges is quite good, though of course not without propaganda. The ancient Chinese art sections are uneven, but with outstanding 2000 year old Han Dynasty sculpture.",
          "This modern museum covers the history of the three Gorges dam and the history of the area flooded by the dam.",
          "My wife and I, a sixty something couple, visited the museum on a wet day and found it absolutely fascinating. There are many exhibits not only of the Three Gorges Project but of the history of the region and its peoples, the Ba. The exhibits were first rate - we particularly",
          "I loved the location. You have to climb some steps to get to the doors. As you are in there are marble floors and four floor exhibitions to look at. My favorite exhibition the one on the Three Gorges.",
          "Museaum showed the design of the Three Gorges. More interesting was the display of household things of people displaced by the project.",
          "I did go there to get Information about the history of the dam, politically as well as technically. But there almost no such Kind of Information! The museam is talking about the ancient history of the Three Gorges, typical chinese Museum. 3 Levels, rather big At least for",
          "We visited this museum as part of an over-priced conference city tour, but the museum was a good way to get a perspective of the Three Gorges Dam project, as it was mean to be. We visited in May, and it was a below average tourist time, so we could take our time examining the",
          "This building is a testament to Chinese ingenuity and building skills ,it shows how the great dam was built and how they tamed the Yangtze river",
          "The museum displays a lot of information about the Three Gorges project that flooded enormous areas. Too bad it is mostly in Chinese. It is free. Worth an hour or two visit. Wish they would clean the bathrooms.",
          "I had visited the Three Gorges Museum both before the renovation and after the renovation as well as that area. The Museum both inside and outside and especially outside is large, very pretty, a real site to see.",
          "The building itself is huge and modern! It is situation just opposite the City Hall. I went there on a Sunday afternoon. The open ground between the Museum and the City Hall are huge and hence many Chinese locals relax there and some vendors were selling handicrafts and food.",
          "Wow, this museum is BIG! We spent almost the whole day and still did not get to see everything. So many rooms. And you have to walk up the stairs to get to the next level. There is a lot to see. So if you like museums and history then this the place to go when you visit",
          "This was a truly amazing and unexpected sight, the dam was explained fully with many shops available for souvenirs. THE dam itself compares favourably wih the Panama Canal with five locks to raise the ships to the higher level. in fact they are now constructing a mechanism to",
          "Spent a good couple of hours here today and it was a very impressive museum. It is well laid out with plenty of English translations on 5 of the 9 exhibits that were open to the public today. For me the only part hard to fathom was the politicization of the building of the dam",
          "We visited the Three Gorges Museum while in Chongqing waiting to board our Yangtze River cruise. The fa\u00e7ade of the museum is striking and resembles a dam. There are a number of informative displays covering the history of the area affected by the dam construction as well as",
          "Prior reviews noted little transation. I did not find this the case. Although a few temporary exhibits had no translation--the permenent exhibits did a good job. I spent 3 hours there, and left only because I was exhausted. The Ba room, Minorities, and Porcelin rooms were",
          "A large museum with so much history to learn and appreciate. There are several levels to see and learn. Take your time to carefully read and appreciate history. The museum is well organized and very clean. The restrooms are very clean and attendants are everywhere to assist",
          "My biggest complaint is that so much of it doesn't have English translations. Thought the part about 1.3 million people happily moving away from their ancestral home a bit overdone, all were not happy about it. Rather sad, but hopefully the dam will help China more than hurt",
          "The museum was interesting. I enjoyed it. If you are in the region, it's definitely something to see.",
          "LIKES 1)The effort in building this wonderful museum 2)The layout and display are both good and educational 3)The up keeping of the place is very good DISLIKES 1)Not enough English verse for the displays 2)Some of the controls of the displays are not working properly",
          "Went to the Three Gorges Museum on March 18, 2015. The museum is free and is right across from the people's hall so you can see 2 sights in a short period of time. There is a nice history of the three gorges area and you get to see exhibits detailing the history of Chongqing",
          "This was a very large and spread out museum, with a lot of exhibits that were of little or no interest to me personally. It does portray a lot of information on the environmental and relocation impact of the Three Gorges Dam. The engineering marvel came at a great cost to",
          "The museum is on 3 floors, covering large area, it will take at least 1 or 2 hours to see all the items. The museum has 2 cinemas, one is showing a movie about the three gorges dam, and the other cinema is presenting a movie about WWII struggle of Chongqing people against",
          "The museum is located across from the Great Hall of Chongqing. A total of four exhibition halls, From the original \"ancient Bayu\" to \"magnificent Three Gorges\" to \"War Years\" to \"Chongqing. In addition to the above mentioned four exhibition halls, there are \"history painting\",",
          "There's a lot of interesting things to see and learn about there. It is worth the trip. Especially liked the displays under the glass floor and learning about chongqing' s role during wartime.",
          "The Three Gorges Museum is on the first floor. Obviously the information is skewed pro-government, but there is information about the people and the natural landscapes. The huge slabs of stone carved with characters and art were breathtaking. The Three Gorges section took me",
          "This museums shows the history around yangtze river and 3 gorges. It has 4 floors and also a well known 360 degree cinema that shows a tour along the 3 gorges. Well, when I was there, 1 projector broke, so it was only 300 degree cinema. I find it so so, but it left me with a",
          "An architecturally interesting museum both inside and out. Beautiful presentations of the history, people, and geography. Exhibits were presented elegantly, guiding the visitor through fascinating spaces. Not to be missed!",
          "Exhibits in this Museum were very well arranged with detailed explanations. Good before and after overviews and history of the Three Gorges.",
          "There is an interesting cyclorama of a trip down the river and there are some excellent cultural displays. Also there are displays about the development of the city over the centuries. Worth half a day.",
          "Free Admission! The museum encompasses of artefacts discovered along the site of the rivers leading to the Three Gorges Dam and the way of life of the people living along the coasts before the villages got submerged due to the project. What I disliked about the museum was while",
          "Although not the biggest or richest museum you'll find when visiting the Yangze area, you can learn quite a bit from this nicely structured museum. Some exhibits unfortunately look unpolished and a big kitch but the pieces shown are all of great quality. Worth spending a few",
          "Brilliant information available about the three gorges dam. Idealy placed to have a look around and take in the sights above the dam",
          "The history of the dam and the gorges was explained and was very informative. It focused on the level of achievement it took to complete this mammoth project. Very impressive",
          "2hrs fun and info With allot of info about chongqing past Its part in war Plus point its near crt line1",
          "I went to the museum because I happened to be close to it. The building itself looks impressive, but then I started to go through the exhibition. It was good until I came to the part about the Three Gorges Dam project. They actually wrote that the project was one of the greatest",
          "4 storeyed building, good infrastructure...Lot of displays only in chinese, no english translation....good for 2 hours...no entry fee....see 3 gorges history & story....ancient currencies, culture, etc. But many interactive machines were not working",
          "This place is good if you are a history lover and more over a Chinese History enthusiast. I found the facility to be good. Ticket is free and that is way I did not feel I wasted my resources. It would have been good if all the information was also available in English. Someone",
          "The Museum and parkland give visitors a really thorough overview of this dam. I don't know if the hill it's on if man-made or not, but you've got a fabulous 360-degree view of the whole site. We had just the night before gone through the locks, so it was pretty cool to also",
          "The square outside of the museum is a wonderful place to hang out but inside is where the jewels are. There are many displays of artifacts, well presented and easily accessed. I managed only one floor in the time I allotted but there are five floors to explore. You can see",
          "The museum has various exhibitions about Chongqing area, but also about different aspects of Chinese culture. At the time I was there, there were exhibitions about Chinese ceramics through the dynasties, coins and money, Chinese minorities in the South-West of China, sculptures",
          "This museum offers an excellent overview of the Three Gorges Dam Project. If you do the cruise, do the museum tourQ!",
          "Visited last May. We stopped off to learn about this stretch of the Yangtze and the dam. We had a quick tour - it was interesting to see and hear about how it all came about. We were there 45 mins and that was plenty of time. If not part of a tour it's not worth a special visit",
          "I can speak and read Chinese, but if you can't, you probably shouldn't go there. This is a history of the Three Gorges, the Three Gorges Dam, and Chongqing as a whole. I love Chongqing and its history, so it was really great for me. It's a good museum with a lot of interesting",
          "Quite interesting information about both older and newer history of the Chongqing Yangtze river area - very well made",
          "A great way to get some background information on the Three Gorges either before or after travelling on the Yangtze in an entertaining way. Not just boring information.",
          "Museum was free, well-designed and had some of the best exhibits I've seen at a mainland museum. Some of the signage is in Mandarin only but even if you don't read any Chinese you could pick up the gist of it. Only qualm was that the hall covering the 'anti-Japanese resistance",
          "Went to Dam and cruised through locks. Amazing seeing the largest dam in the world. It's a modern marvel",
          "This is a very large museum devoted to not only the 3 Gorges but also local history and geography. You really need a local guide who can take you through the museum and point out the salient features, otherwise you could well spend 2 hours here and miss something important.",
          "This museum is really well done. Just take the statues of the smiling displaced farmers with a grain of salt.",
          "The main hall on the first (ground) floor is dedicated to the history, geology, nature etc. of the Three Gorges. We went the day before a cruise so as to get some context. Most of the exhibits in this hall were well labelled, in English as well as Chinese. Other halls aren't",
          "The museum is free, clean and well set out. Very spacious so you don't fell crowded. The exhibits seem interesting but are pretty much all only in Chinese so if you can't read Mandarin then unfortunately you leave not really knowing what you've seen!",
          "Very good insight into the flooding of the Yangtze and a good idea to visit before start of cruise. set in Erdling Park there are great views to and lovely gardens also to be enjoyed there.",
          "A lovely museum. Not at all crowded. A good history of the area. Well-laid out. There was a volunteer guide in the section about coins/money: 1st class guy. So knowledgeable and helpful, he answered all our questions and gave an interesting insight into the history of Chinese",
          "the Three Gorges Museum is a beautiful museum that just opened its doors in Chongqing. the museum taks your though the history and process for the building of the Three Gorges Dam, that had a great effect on the Jialing and Yangtze Rivers and the peopold living near them.",
          "The dioramas were really imaginative... some parts as if you are walking down the river with life size boats and models. Great little coffee shop in the museum and right across the plaza try Lucky Fish restaurant.",
          "Really worth a visit especially if you are to embark on a cruise of the 3 Gorges. Friendly and helpful staff.",
          "I thought it will be a boring museum on propaganda. Turns out to be pleasant surprise. There are many artefacts from the different eras. The museum is also well maintained. A must to visit.",
          "We had limited time here, so as we were sailing through the actual Three Gorges Locks a few days later, we confined ourselves to viewing their display of Neolithic Chinese ceramics. They were sensational, very well displayed, but with very few explanations in English (I suppose",
          "I think the name says it all, you are so close to the actual Three Gorges that it is better to just travel to the actual thing. Having said that, the museum is free so if you find yourself with extra time on your hand, why not pay a visit.",
          "The museum is good with english explanations. It is well laid out and provides an informative if bias description of the development of the damn and the local history that was \"saved\" when it was built",
          "The Three Gorges Museum was well worth the visit. The guide explained the history of the area really well. We also enjoyed the 3 day cruise on Century Legend and the tour from the boat on the sampan. Fantastic.",
          "There were many exhibition halls to look at. Nice and clean, plus it's free! It was raining when I was there so I kinda look for a restaurant to eat something. Unfortunately, there are only a caf\u00e9 which sells some drinks and instant noodles.",
          "I found the museum boring. I was expecting more details on the construction, engineering of this great build. Instead a museum filled with how great a nation we are. This was an ok experience if you're trying to kill a few hours but set your expectations low!",
          "many sample or painting,movie,to let visitors to know the local culture in history.if you like chongqing,you should go there.",
          "Good explanation of the dam construction, and amazing how 1.3 million people all volunteered to be relocated!",
          "The 3 Gorges part is pretty well done and well cared for, but be prepared for a bit of 'spin' and untranslated signs. The audio guide may add more humor, but we didn't realize guides were available. There are a few other galleries on other floors. And, it's free, so who can",
          "A short stop gave us an insight into the 3 Gorges Dam project and details of displaced communities as a result of the massive Yangtze River water level once the dam was completed. This was a benefit as we were embarking on a Yangtze River cruise that evening.",
          "You must visit! This is very interesting museo just opposite of The Great Hall. Much to see and you can easily spend one day here.",
          "worth the visit. What an impressive engineering task! Caters for english people and well documented.",
          "Really worth a visit to see not only the dam project but the history of the entire region and city! Very intersting as CQ itself has not a lot of history to recognize as a traveller.",
          "Half of the ground floor has the \"three gorges display\" the rest of the museum has a 360 deg cinema showing shots of the gorges other floors have other ethnic exhibits. The three gorges part takes about 45 min. film is about 20minutes. Could take much longer to view the rest.",
          "We arrived in Chongqing a day prior to boarding a Yangtze River Cruise - which was not scheduled to leave until 9:00PM. So we had almost a full day to explorer the city and one place that we stopped to visit was the Three Gorges Museum. This Museum gives the history about the",
          "It's a museum of building a dam. The model is interesting and gives perspective, esp.if you came thru the locks.",
          "This is a free attraction, situated next to the hall of the people, it is new, impressive and well worth a visit. The museum is on four floors and tells the story of the three gorges from an ecological perspective, a sociological perspective and also examines the culture",
          "Worth visiting just to see what the authorities saved before the area was flooded and one can imagine what was lost! Avoiding and ignoring the propaganda, it is still an amazing structural project but at what cost?",
          "The Three Gorges Museum will show what it was like before the government submerged the whole communities that used to inhabit in the area when they made the dam. Tens of Thousands of people were relocated to give way to the dam. The museum also showed how the government",
          "It's free and very informative, we went bon the boat the next day and I was glad to have learned more aboutvthe area before the cruise down the river. The vist certainly made the boat trip more interesting.",
          "guide explained what was involved in creating the 3 gorges dam and how it effected people living in the area.",
          "Whilst not a spectacular museum, I would recommend visiting it if you have time. It is certainly interesting enough and is located in a pleasant area, opposite the attractive 'People's Great Hall'. Between both buildings are nice park areas, sculptures and fruit sellers.",
          "a must see when visiting there. missed by most tourists as they do not stop over. an interesting place but little in english or other language so a bit of guess work is required",
          "I had a guide with me telling me about the history and all the artifacts in the museum. the museum was free. There was also a possibility to rent a audiotour for a small fee but as i was in a hurry i asked for a guide in advance. Spent 2 hours at the museum. The exhibition",
          "It is grandiose building.It is good place to learn local people's history,culture,life style,developing course.Many picutres and material objects,vedio are showed in Museum.",
          "Can you see any other country being able to undertake such a venture,without too many worries about saving ancient history and ignoreing the few for the mass{2003}",
          "Also, Made In Kitchen, good but disfunctional restaurant is downstairs from the museum. The museum overlooks the public square which is best to visit at night, when you can see the locals dancing. The museum itself has nice exhibits and artifacts, plan about an hour to walk",
          "I visited 2 museums on this trip, The expensive (ticket and budget to build) Science and Tech museum and Three Gorges museum, the Three Gorges museum is far better.",
          "Very good value. It costs \u00a510 per person and it offers 4 floors of interesting facts about Three Gorges and the city of Chongqing and its history. Downstairs they have a 360\u00b0 Panorama movie of Three Gorges which is played couple times a day. It's in Chinese but I suggest it;",
          "The Chongqing museum and Three Gorges museum are now in the same building. It is a beautiful building and looks a bit like the Three Gorges Dam. Chongqing is not an international tourist destination, so the museum does not have much English - unfortunately for me. The section on",
          "Not much to say except that it's a collection of photos and a large mural that shows the devastation caused by the dam.",
          "If you are in Chongqing for a Three Gorges cruise, I highly recommend you start here. Entrance is free, and the displays and especially the scale model are MUCH better than at the Three Gorges Dam Visitors Center. Two hours is enough for most people.",
          "We were surprised to realize that entrance to this museum was free of charge, which is quite rare in China. Having said that, the museum gives very basic information regarding the Three Gorges dam. It somehow minimizes the actual impact this project had on mother nature. It",
          "It was well worth the visit, it is free entry and if you want to learn about Chongqing's past and its link to the Yangtze river this is the place to go, 2 hours was not enough.",
          "very basic, not finished yet (the new information regarding all the people moved from their villages) - when you go on the cruise, you are actually happy that you went to this informative place. the yangtze river project is an amazing chinese miracle",
          "This museum tells the story about the hard life of the boaters and linesmen when the Yangtze (Chang Jiang) river still had the three shallow gorges. Very interesting museum.",
          "I admit I am not a big fan of this place. Shows some interesting stuff, but it is limited in its displays. They could have made really displays with videos and hands on stuff for kids, but went with conservative, documentary type static displays. It is more informative than",
          "It's a nice museum, well set out, shows a lot of history and has some really interesting displays, but it's also a home to people who think that you want to give them money for talking to you. I would recommend not talking to anyone other than your companions and definitely",
          "The museum has a lot of really interesting items and information, but I was hoping for more information about the river itself and life along the river now and what it was like before the dam.",
          "A small to mid-sized provincial-type museum with a mish mash of galleries/halls with different displays around the broad Chongqing theme, each of which are decent but far from outstanding. Location is convenient in Yuzhong district in central Chongqing, and so those with time"

        "wiki": "Fengdu Ghost City (simplified Chinese: \u4e30\u90fd\u9b3c\u57ce; traditional Chinese: \u8c50\u90fd\u9b3c\u57ce (traditional form of the revised name); pinyin: F\u0113ngd\u016b Gu\u01d0 Ch\u00e9ng, originally \u9146\u90fd\u9b3c\u57ce) is a large complex of shrines, temples and monasteries dedicated to the afterlife located on the Ming mountain, in Fengdu County, Chongqing municipality, China. It is situated about 170 kilometres (110 mi) downstream from Chongqing on the north bank of the Yangtze River.\nThe city consists of buildings, structures, dioramas, and statues related to Diyu and Naraka, concepts from Chinese mythology and Buddhism that signify the underworld or hell. It is modeled to resemble Youdu, the capital of Diyu.\nAfter the building of the Three Gorges Dam and the rising of the water level of the river it became separated from the city of Fengdu, which was rebuilt higher up the mountainside on the south side of the river.In recent years, Fengdu Ghost City has become a tourist attraction. Cruise boats carrying tourists up or down the river stop at the docks and tourists are taken in vehicles halfway up the mountain. From there, there is an open-air escalator up to the complex or the visitor can climb up on foot.The site's history goes back nearly two thousand years, at least in legends. It focuses on the afterlife and combines the beliefs of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. It is mentioned in several classic Chinese works of literature like Journey to the West, Investiture of the Gods and Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio.According to legend, Fengdu got its name of Ghost City during the Eastern Han dynasty, when two imperial officials, Yin Changsheng and Wang Fangping, came to Ming Mountain to practice Taoism and in the process became immortals. The combination of their names, Yinwang, means \"King of Hell\" and that was the beginning of the site's focus on the underworld. Many of the temples and shrines show paintings and sculptures of people being tortured for their sins.According to Chinese beliefs, the dead must pass three tests before passing to the next life. First they must pass the \"Bridge of Helplessness\". This stone bridge was built during the Ming dynasty and is a test for Good and Evil. It has three arches and only the middle one is used for testing people. There are different protocols for crossing the bridge depending on sex, age, marital status. At the bridge, demons allow or forbid passage. The good are allowed to pass while the evil will be pushed to the water below. This is now done as a tourist attraction and performers characterised as demons momentarily stop tourists on the bridge but finally allow them across.\nThen the dead must proceed to Ghost-Torturing Pass where they present themselves for judgment before Yama, King of Hell. This is the second test. In this area there are large sculptures of demons.The third test is done at the entrance to Tianzi Palace where the dead must stand on a certain stone on one foot for three minutes. According to legend a virtuous person will be able to do it while an evil person will fail and be condemned to hell.Tianzi Palace is the largest and oldest building and it is three hundred years old.A more recent addition is the Last Glance to Home Tower (also called Home Viewing Pavilion) which was built in 1985 and is placed where according to legend the dead could have one last look towards their home and families.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSnowy Jade Cave, a cave 12 km away\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Fengdu Ghost City at Wikimedia Commons",

They lie within the Wulong Karst National Geology Park, itself a part of the South China Karst-Wulong Karst UNESCO World Heritage Site. In Chinese, the bridges are all named after dragons, namely Tianlong (Chinese: \u5929\u9f99\u6865; lit.: 'Sky Dragon') Qinglong (\u9752\u9f99\u6865; 'Azure Dragon') and Heilong (\u9ed1\u9f99\u6865; 'Black Dragon').\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nSpanning the Yangshui River, a tributary of the Wu River, the bridges are at the centre of a 20 km2 (7.7 sq mi) conservation area which also includes:\n\nQinglong Tiankeng (\u9752\u9f99\u5929\u5751);\nShenying Tiankeng (\u795e\u9e70\u5929\u5751);\nYangshui River Karst Canyon (\u7f8a\u6c34\u6cb3\u5580\u65af\u7279\u5ce1\u8c37);\nLongshui Gorge (\u9f99\u6c34\u5ce1\u5730\u7f1d);\nCentral Shiyuan Tiankeng (\u4e2d\u77f3\u9662\u5929\u5751);\nLower Shiyuan Tiankeng (\u4e0b\u77f3\u9662\u5929\u5751);\nSeventy-two Branch Cave (\u4e03\u5341\u4e8c\u5c94\u6d1e);\nLongquan Cave (\u9f99\u6cc9\u6d1e);\nImmortal Cave (\u4ed9\u4eba\u6d1e);\nHidden Monkey Stream (\u7334\u5b50\u5768\u4f0f\u6d41);\nHidden Baiguo Stream (\u767d\u679c\u4f0f\u6d41).Given that the distance between the upper end of the Tianlong Bridge and the lower end of the Heilong Bridge is only 1,500 m (4,900 ft), these are not the longest natural bridges. However, they are the only such group of karst structures in the world. Between the bridges lie the Qinglong and Shenying tiankengs which have a depth of 276\u2013285 metres and a circumference of 300\u2013522 metres.\n\n\n== Dimensions ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nWulong Karst\nFurong Cave\nXueyu Cave\nTianmen Mountain\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWonders of Nature: Wulong National Geological Park\nChina: Three Natural Bridges National Geopark",

The carvings date back as far as the 7th century AD, depicting and influenced by Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist beliefs.  Some are in rock-cut cave shrines, in the usual Chinese Buddhist style, but many others are rock reliefs carved into the open rock faces.\n\n\n== World Heritage Site ==\nListed as a World Heritage Site, the Dazu Rock Carvings are made up of 75 protected sites containing some 50,000 statues, with over 100,000 Chinese characters forming inscriptions and epigraphs. The sites are located in Chongqing Municipality within the steep hillsides throughout Dazu County, located about 165 kilometers west of the urban area of Chongqing. The highlights of the rock grotto are found on Mount Baoding and Mount Beishan.\nThe carvings were listed as a World Heritage Site in 1999, citing \"\u2026their aesthetic quality, their rich diversity of subject matter, both secular and religious, and the light that they shed on everyday life in China during this period. They provide outstanding evidence of the harmonious synthesis of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest carvings were begun in 650 AD during the early Tang dynasty, but the main period of their creation began in the late 9th century, when Wei Junjing, Prefect of Changzhou, pioneered the carvings on Mount Beishan, and his example was followed after the collapse of the Tang dynasty by local and gentry, monks and nuns, and ordinary people during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907-65). In the 12th century, during the Song dynasty, a Buddhist monk named Zhao Zhifeng began work on the elaborate sculptures and carvings on Mount Baoding, dedicating 70 years of his life to the project.\nOff limits to visitors for many years, the carvings were opened to Chinese travellers in 1961 and foreign visitors in 1980.  Until 1975, there was only a muddy path between the town of Dazu and the main cluster of carvings.  The isolation helped keep the art unharmed during the massive anti-religious vandalism of the Cultural Revolution.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nDazu Lotus Manor, a nearby attraction\nTianlongshan Grottoes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUNESCO World Heritage Centre page\nWisdom embodied: Chinese Buddhist and Daoist sculpture in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a collection catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on the Dazu Rock Carvings",

          "After checking around for the price to join a group tour from Chongqing city, we decided to take the public transportation for a fraction of the cost. Getting there: Subway line 1 or light rail line 3 to Lianglukou station, take exit 3 to Caiyuanba bus station. Take the",
          "One of my most favourite spot around Chongqing. I love to walk through the hand carved statues depicting the life and teaching of lord Buddha. As everywhere in China, the gate tickets / entry tickets are comparatively very costly to local life standard but it is always",

          "We are big fans of Buddhist cave art, so this place was long on our wish list, and we weren't disappointed by what we saw. The caves at Dazu are in a stunning location, set in a beautiful forest gully. The trees, bamboo and running streams are attractive enough of themselves,",
          "I recommend going here, make sure to use a guide to get the facts. The full program took a few hours. It can be made more efficient by taking a golf cart from the entrance to the caves. And then hire lift back to the parking. Only rest rooms by the entrances. You cannot get",

          "Never seen anything like this before. The rock carvings were amazing & fascinating the amount of work that went into them 1000 years ago with the use of modern tools/technology. There was hardly any other visitors to the site which allowed for great pictures. I'm not sure of",
          "Amazing place to visit, I chose an excellent guide for a private tour from Chongqing, the company was Lark-trip.com, and the guide made the experience as he explained all of the history and meaning behind the sculptures. Don't pass by the museum it's well worth a look, very",

          "I have heard of this place for almost 20 years. This is my first time here finally. I don't think I have appropriate words to comment this gorgeous treasure, because it's more than Amazing. We attended a tourist group for 1 day trip to DAZU. So we got a nice tourist guid who",
          "The rock carving in Baodangshan, about 12 kilometers outside Dazu, is amazing both due to its still being perfectly shown even after 800 years and the ability to express the Buddha instructions of behaviour in daily life. The carvings describe scenes of daily life and show",

        "wiki": "The Chongqing Rail Transit (branded as CRT; also known as Chongqing Metro) is the rapid transit system in the city of Chongqing, China. In operation since 2005, it serves the transportation needs of the city's main business and entertainment downtown areas and inner suburbs. As of December 2019, CRT consisted of eight lines, with a total track length of 326.9 km (203.1 mi). Lines 1, 4, 5, 6, 10 and the Loop line are conventional heavy-rail subways, while Lines 2 and 3 are high-capacity monorails. To keep up with urban growth, construction is under way on Lines 9, 18 and S5, in addition to extensions to Lines 1, 4, 5, 6, 10 and the Loop line. A network of 18 lines is planned.\nThe Chongqing Rail Transit is a unique transit system in China because of the geography of Chongqing being a densely-populated but mountainous city, with multiple river valleys. Two lines use heavy-monorail technology, leveraging the ability to negotiate steep grades and tight curves and rapid transit capacity. They are capable of transporting 32,000 passengers per hour per direction.  At 98 km (61 mi), the system's two monorail lines form the longest monorail system in the world, with the 56.1 km (34.9 mi) Line 3 being the world's longest single monorail line even if the 11.0 km (6.8 mi) Airport branch is excluded. The length and the capacity of its monorail network both also make it the world's busiest monorail system, with a total of 94 million and 250 million rides in 2015 on Line 2 and Line 3, respectively. The latter ridership statistic for Line 3 also makes it the world's busiest single monorail line.\nThe extreme difference in elevation between the river valleys and the hilly plateaus of Chongqing pose a unique challenge in designing alignments for conventional rail transit lines. The network currently has the world's highest metro-only bridge, the Caijia Rail Transit Bridge for Line 6, spanning the Jialing River valley, with the bridge deck being approximately 100 m above the water. Hongtudi station is the deepest subway station in China and the second-deepest station in the world, after the Kiev Metro's Arsenalna, with Line 10's platforms being more than 94 m (308 ft) below the surface. Liyuchi station, also on Line 10, is the second-deepest station in China, being 76 m (249 ft) below the surface.The Chongqing Rail Transit is also in the process of constructing a number of extremely-long metro-only suspension bridges. The Gaojiahuayuan Rail Transit Bridge is currently the longest transit only bridge in China and carries the western arc of the Loop line over the Jialing River using a long 594 m (1,949 ft) bridge with a main span of 340 m (1,120 ft). The 1,650 m (5,410 ft) long Egongyan Rail Transit Bridge carries the southern arc of the Loop line across the Yangtze River using a 600 m (2,000 ft) long suspension main span, making it the longest cable supported metro-only bridge by main span in the world. The Nanjimen Bridge will carry Line 10 trains across a 1,225 m (4,019 ft) cable-stayed bridge with a main span of 480 m (1,570 ft), making it the longest metro-only cable-stayed bridge by main span in the world. Finally, the Chongqing Rail Transit has numerous double-deck bridges carrying vehicle and metro traffic, such as the Chaotianmen Bridge, which is the world's longest arch bridge.\n\n\n== Network ==\n\n\n=== Loop line ===\n\nThe Loop line (also known as \"Line 0\"; Chinese: \u96f6\u53f7\u7ebf) is a rapid transit loop line.  The northeastern section was opened on 28 December 2018. When the line is fully completed, it will run through two important railway stations: Chongqing North Railway Station, and Chongqing West Railway Station.\n\n\n=== Line 1 ===\n\nLine 1 runs 16.4 km (10.2 mi) from Chaotianmen, in the central west, to Shapingba and then to Bishan with a total length of 44.5 km (27.7 mi). It has 24 stations, including interchange stations with Line 2, at Jiaochangkou in Jiefangbei CBD and at Daping, and with Line 3, at Lianglukou, near Chongqing railway station, in the Caiyuanba section of central Yuzhong. It is the first heavy-rail subway line in Chongqing and the second in Western China. The passenger capacity is 36,000 passengers per hour in each way. The line serves as the system's backbone connecting the densest areas including the main Central Business Districts of Jiefangbei, Lianglukou, Daping, and Shapingba. It is the first conventional subway, running in a deep-bored tunnel below Yuzhong and Shapingba Districts.\nIn 1992, the Chongqing government signed a Build-Operate-Transfer agreement with a Hong Kong company and provided the land for the project, but work ceased in 1997 because of legal issues. Work resumed from Chaotianmen to Shapingba on 9 June 2009, and a limited opening occurred on 28 July 2011. Thales provided an operations control centre for the line.\n\n\n=== Line 2 ===\n\nLine 2, a monorail line, runs 31.4 km (19.5 mi) and has 25 stations. It begins as a subway under downtown Jiefangbei, then runs west along the southern bank of Jialing River on an elevated line, and then turns south into the southwestern inner suburbs, looping back east, to terminate at Yudong, in Ba'nan District. It runs mostly elevated, but a 2.2 km (1.4 mi) section is underground, including three of its 18 stations in the Jiefangbei CBD and central Daping areas in the extremely-dense area of Yuzhong District. Line 2 runs through four administrative districts in the central city (Yuzhong, Jiulongpo, Dadukou, and Ba'nan). In 2010, Line 2 served 45 million passengers. It also runs through Daping CBD and Yangjiaping CBD in Jiulongpo District and Chongqing Zoo at Zoo Station. Most trains have four cars, and six-car trains began to operate in September 2012. Line 2 is the first rapid transit line to open in the Interior West of China, in 2005. In 2013, six-car trains are being implemented because of overcrowding and increasing demand.\n\n\n=== Line 3 ===\n\nLine 3 is the longest and busiest monorail in the world. It runs from north to south and links the districts separated by the Yangtze (Chang Jiang) and the Jialing Rivers. The initial segment, from Lianglukou to Yuanyang (18 stations, 17.5 km (10.9 mi)), opened on 29 September 2011, with a northern extension, from Yuanyang to Jiangbei Airport, opening on 30 December 2011. A southern extension, from Ertang to Yudong, opened on 28 December 2012.Most trains have six cars, more than on the older Line 2. The line started to equip eight-car trains in 2014, which are now in operation. There are interchange stations in central Yuzhong district with Line 1, at Lianglukou (Caiyuanba Intercity Railway/Coach Station), and with Line 2, at Niujiaotuo.\n\n\n=== Line 4 ===\n\nLine 4 is a rapid transit line. In June 2018, debugging of the first segment of Phase I commenced.  The line began operating on 28 December that year.\n\n\n=== Line 5 ===\n\nLine 5 is a northeast-southwest heavy-rail line crossing the centre, and the line has opened its northern section of phase 1, from the EXPO Garden Center to Dashiba. It will connect Yubei, Jiangbei, Yuzhong, Jiulongpo, Shapingba and Dadukou districts, and the extension line from Tiaodeng (the southern terminal) to Dingshan in Jiangjin district is under construction. New six-car trains were introduced on the line.\n\n\n=== Line 6 ===\n\nLine 6 is the second heavy-rail subway line of Chongqing. Opened on 28 September 2012, it connects Nan'an, Yuzhong, Jiangbei and Yubei districts, in central Chongqing.\nA northern branch, from Lijia to Wulukou, Beibei District, was opened on 31 December 2013, 26.2 km (16.3 mi) long with five stations. Phase 1 of the Chayuan extension was opened in 2014. Thales provided an operations control centre for the line.\n\n\n=== Line 10 ===\n\nThe line serves the North Railway station and the airport terminals. The first phase (Liyuchi to Wangjiazhuang) opened on 28 December 2017, and the second phase will connect Yuzhong and Nan'an districts by crossing the Jialing and the Yangtze rivers. Two new bridges, Zengjiayan Jialing River Bridge and Nanjimen Railway Bridge, are under construction for train services to the south.\n\n\n== Fares ==\n\n\n=== Single-journey ticket ===\nTickets range from CN\u00a52 (0.3 USD) to \u00a57 (1.06 USD), depending on the distance. Day passes cost \u00a518 (2.72 USD).\n\n\n==== Refund ====\nOnly unused tickets bought on the same day and at the same station can be refunded without an explanation. If the train was delayed for over 15 minutes, the tickets may be refunded, and a certificate of delay can be acquired.\n\n\n=== Transport cards ===\nCRT accepts Life & Transport Card (Chongqing Universal Card, released by Chongqing City Card Payment Co., Ltd.) and its compatible cards, released by partner companies in other cities of China. There is a 10% discount applied to the Regular Card if it is used on public transit in the city. The higher price is paid for transfers between the bus and the metro within 1 hour (not including metro-to-metro, according to the paying time). The Regular Card can be purchased at any CRT station, and a deposit can be recovered when the card is returned with its receipt. In addition the card can be used in many shops, cinemas, restaurants, etc. in Chongqing. The Students' Card and the Elders' Card can not be directly used on the metro since their monthly fee covers only buses unless a cash sub-account, which allows a 50% discount, is added to the cards for free at the service points.\n\n\n=== Time limit ===\nAll trips must be completed in 3 hours upon entering the fare-paid area, or the highest ticket price in the system will be charged in addition.\n\n\n== Operation ==\nDuring times of heavy use like for major events, CRT may close some stations to avoid overcrowding. In 2018, CRT closed Xiaoshizi, Jiaochangkou, Qixinggang, Lianglukou, Xiaolongkan, and Shapingba stations of Line 1; Jiaochangkou and Linjiangmen stations of Line 2; Lianglukou, Huaxinjie, Guanyinqiao, and Hongqihegou stations of Line 3; Shangxinjie, Xiaoshizi, Grand Theater, Jiangbeicheng, and Hongqihegou stations of Line 6 after 20:00 on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, after 19:00 on New Year's Eve. And they also closed Shapingba and Shangxinjie stations of Loop line after 19:00 on New Year's Eve.\nFrom 9 to 12 November 2018, they closed Grand Theater and Jiangbeicheng stations from 10:00 to 15:00 because of heavy use during Flower Expo; from 1 to 7 November 2019, they closed Grand Theater and Jiangbeicheng stations since 10:00 till 16:00 because of heavy use during Flower Expo.\n\n\n=== Wi-fi ===\nFree Wi-fi is provided on most platforms and trains on Lines 1 and 6 at 5 GHz. An app, Heikuai (Chinese: \u563f\u5feb), is required.\n\n\n=== Accessibility ===\nAlmost every station has accessible elevators and toilets, and almost every train has wheelchair locks. Only the oldest rolling stock and toilets of Line 2 are not fully accessible. In addition, many older interchange channels between lines are not designed with accessibility in mind, which means the disabled there must transfer via the main concourse.\n\n\n=== Luggage rack ===\nThe trains on Line 10, which links Jiangbei Airport and Chongqing North railway station, are equipped with a luggage rack on each car.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe CRT is part of the central government's project to develop the Western regions. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation provided some of the funding. Construction was carried out, with co-operation between Changchun Railway Vehicles Co. Ltd. and Hitachi Monorail, which used advanced Japanese monorail technology. Construction on Line 2 began in 1999, and the line was officially opened in June 2005 from Jiaochangkou (Jiefangbei CBD) to Zoo (Chongqing Zoo).\n\n\n=== Planning timeline ===\n\n\n==== 1946 ====\nThe Nationalist government made a plan of high-speed tram system. The rail weighs 47.77 kg/m, with a rail gauge of 1000 mm, a maximum slope of 9%, a minimum radius of curvature of 80 m. The top speed is 25 km/h (16 mph) in the urban area and 45 km/h (28 mph) in the suburban area. The train was 8 m long, 1.8 m wide, with two 35-horsepower motors and a trailer. Each train took 240 passengers. The headway was designed to be 10 minutes. The system was expected to carry 1 million passengers per day. Some of the tracks were underground.\n\nLine A, Longmenhao \u2013 Ciqikou, 9 Stations, 14.75 km (9.17 mi)\nLine B, Longmenhao \u2013 Nanwenquan, 7 Stations, 19.49 km (12.11 mi)\nLine C, Longmenhao \u2013 Datiankan, 3 Stations, 6.9 km (4.3 mi)\n\n\n==== 1960 ====\nA 100 km-long (62 mi) underground rapid rail transit system, linking the city center with Xinpaifang, Xiaolongkan, Yangjiaping, Shiqiaopu, Lianglukou, etc., was planned.\n\n\n==== 1983 ====\nA 12.2 km-long (7.6 mi) subway line (Chaotianmen \u2013 Yangjiaping) was planned. It is the precursor to today's Line 2.\n\n\n==== 1991 ====\nA 55 km-long (34 mi) monorail system was planned.\n\nChaotianmen \u2013 Shapingba (\u2013 Shuangbei), the forerunner of Line 1.\nChaotianmen \u2013 Xinshancun (\u2013 Jiugongmiao), the forerunner of Line 2.\nAirport Line: Xinpaifang \u2013 Nanping (\u2013 Sigongli), the forerunner of Line 3.\nLink Line: Yangjiaping \u2013 Shiqiaopu.\n\n\n==== 1998 ====\nIn a refreshed edition of the 1991 plan, the total length was about 119 km (74 mi).\n\nLine 1: Chaotianmen \u2013 Shuangbei.\nLine 2: Chaotianmen \u2013 Jiugongmiao.\nLine 3: Jiangbei Airport \u2013 Sigongli.\nLine 4: Sigongli \u2013 Shiqiaopu. (evolved from Link Line in the previous edition)\nLine 5: Tongjiayuanzi \u2013 Zhongliangshan.\n\n\n==== 2003 and 2007 ====\nTwo similar expanded editions of the 1998 plan included 10 lines, with a total length of about 522 km (324 mi). Line 4 in the previous blueprint received a huge update and was renamed to Loop line, according to its new shape.\n\n\n==== 2013 ====\nThe current plan is an expanded edition of the 2007 plan, with a length of about 820 km (510 mi). Eight new lines were merged to the plan, with some minor modifications.\n\n\n=== Testing timeline ===\nThe tests left some tunnels, which were reused in the construction of Lines 1 and 2.\n\nIn late 1958, the \"Yuzhong District Subway Engineering Unit\" was started, only to be suspended one year later.\nIn 1965, the unit was reinstated. It has 4 units, including more than 1000 workers in total. Construction was stopped again in late 1966 by the Cultural Revolution. The unit was officially disbanded again in 1971. The completed tunnel sections were taken over by the Civil Air Defense Department.\nIn 1988, some Hong Kong businessmen arrived to start a metro company in Lianglukou. The original completed tunnel sections where extended.\n\n\n=== Opening timeline ===\n\n\n=== Incidents ===\nAt around 14:00 of 8 January 2019, an improperly secured air defense lock was struck by an in service Loop line train, derailing it and causing serious damage to the cabcar. The accident injured three employees and one passenger. One of the employees, the driver, later died from their injuries shortly after being sent to the hospital.\n\n\n== Technology ==\n\n\n== Visual design ==\nUnlike most metro systems of other cities in China, CRT did not follow the design style of MTR Corporation in Hong Kong. The signage system was designed by GK Design Group in Japan, and the monorail lines are based on Hitachi Monorail technology. That gives the Chongqing Rail Transit a distinctive Japanese aesthetic, in contrast to other metro systems in China.\n\n\n=== Line theme ===\nCRT gave each line a theme about the local culture, and the stations on the line will have some art works in the theme.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Expansion ==\nCRT is expected to have 8 lines criss-crossing the urban districts by 2020 and a loop line connecting the commercial areas in the urban area. The other 9 lines are expected to be in operation by 2050.\n\n\n=== Projects under construction ===\n\n\n=== Scheduled projects ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nChongqing Suburban Railway\nList of metro systems\nList of monorail systems\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChongqing Rail Transit official website (in Chinese), Google translation\nChongqing Transport Card Info (in Chinese), Google translation\nUrbanRail.net's page on the Chongqing Rail Transit\nMap\nPhotographs of Chongqing Rail Transit",

        "wiki": "Chongqing (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0o\u014b\u02e8\u02e9t\u0255\u02b0in\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u028a\u030c\u014b.t\u0255\u02b0\u00ee\u014b] (listen), UK: , US: ,), alternately romanized as Chungking, is a megacity in southwest China. Administratively, it is one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of central government of the People's Republic of China (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), and the only such municipality located far away from the coast. The municipality of Chongqing, which is around the size of Austria, includes the city of Chongqing and various non-connected cities. As the Chongqing municipality government directly administers the city of Chongqing, as well as rural counties, and other cities not connected to the city of Chongqing, Chongqing municipality can technically claim to be the largest city proper in the world, even though this is due to a classification technicality and not because it is actually the world's largest urban area.\nChongqing was a municipality during the Republic of China (ROC) administration, within the Sichuan Province. It served as its wartime capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), being one of the world's anti-fascist command centers. The current municipality was separated from Sichuan province on 14 March 1997 to help develop the central and western parts of China. The Chongqing administrative municipality has a population of over 30 million. The city of Chongqing, comprising 9 urban and suburban districts, has a population of 8,518,000 as of 2016. According to the 2010 census, Chongqing is the most populous Chinese municipality, and also the largest direct-controlled municipality in China, containing 26 districts, eight counties, and four autonomous counties.\nThe official abbreviation of the city, \"Y\u00fa\" (\u6e1d), was approved by the State Council on 18 April 1997. This abbreviation is derived from the old name of a part of the Jialing River that runs through Chongqing and feeds into the Yangtze River.\nChongqing has a significant history and culture. Being one of China's National Central Cities, it serves as the economic centre of the Sichuan Basin and the upstream Yangtze. It is a major manufacturing centre and transportation hub; a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit described it as one of China's \"13 emerging megalopolises\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nTradition associates Chongqing with the State of Ba.\nThis new capital was first named Jiangzhou (\u6c5f\u5dde).\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\nJiangzhou subsequently remained under Qin Shi Huang's rule during the Qin dynasty, the successor of the Qin State, and under the control of Han dynasty emperors.\nJiangzhou was subsequently renamed during the Northern and Southern dynasties to Chu Prefecture (\u695a\u5dde), then in 581 AD (Sui dynasty) to Yu Prefecture (\u6e1d\u5dde), and later in 1102 during Northern Song to Gong Prefecture (\u606d\u5dde). The name Yu however survives to this day as an abbreviation for Chongqing, and the city centre where the old town stood is also called Yuzhong (\u6e1d\u4e2d, Central Yu). It received its current name in 1189, after Prince Zhao Dun of the Southern Song dynasty described his crowning as king and then Emperor Guangzong as a \"double celebration\" (simplified Chinese: \u53cc\u91cd\u559c\u5e86; traditional Chinese: \u96d9\u91cd\u559c\u6176; pinyin: shu\u0101ngch\u00f3ng x\u01d0q\u00ecng, or chongqing in short). In his honour, Yu Prefecture was therefore converted to Chongqing Fu, marking the occasion of his enthronement.\nIn 1362, (Yuan dynasty), Ming Yuzhen, a peasant rebel leader, established the Daxia Kingdom (\u5927\u590f) at Chongqing for a short time. In 1621 (Ming dynasty), another short-lived kingdom of Daliang (\u5927\u6881) was established by She Chongming (\u5962\u5d07\u660e) with Chongqing as its capital. In 1644, after the fall of the Ming dynasty to a rebel army, Chongqing, together with the rest of Sichuan, was captured by Zhang Xianzhong, who was said to have massacred a large number of people in Sichuan and depopulated the province, in part by causing many people to flee to safety elsewhere. The Manchus later conquered the province, and during the Qing dynasty, immigration to Chongqing and Sichuan took place with the support of the Qing emperor.In 1890, the British Consulate General was opened in Chongqing. The following year, the city became the first inland commerce port open to foreigners. The French, German, US and Japanese consulates were opened in Chongqing in 1896\u20131904.\n\n\n=== Provisional capital of the Republic of China ===\n\nDuring and after the Second Sino-Japanese War, from Nov 1937 to May 1946, it was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's provisional capital. Indeed, after the General and remaining army had lived there for a time following their retreat in 1938 from the previous capital of Wuhan, it was formally declared the second capital city (pei du) on 6 September 1940. After Britain, the United States, and other Allies entered the war in Asia in December 1941, one of the Allies' deputy commanders of operations in South East Asia (South East Asia Command SEAC), Joseph Stilwell, was based in the city. This made it a city of world importance in the fight against Axis powers, together with London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. The city was also visited by Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of SEAC which was itself headquartered in Ceylon, modern day Sri Lanka. Chiang Kai Shek as Supreme Commander in China worked closely with Stilwell. From 1938 to 1943, the city suffered from continuous terror bombing by the Japanese air force. Lives were saved by the air-raid shelters which took the advantage of the mountainous terrain. Chongqing was acclaimed to be the \u201cCity of Heroes\u201d due to the indomitable spirits of its people as well as their contributions and sacrifices during World War II. Many factories and universities were relocated from eastern China to Chongqing during the war, transforming this city from inland port to a heavily industrialized city. In late November 1949, the Nationalist KMT government retreated from the city.\n\n\n=== Municipality status ===\n\nOn 14 March 1997, the Eighth National People's Congress decided to merge the Sub-provincial city with the neighbouring Fuling, Wanxian, and Qianjiang prefectures that it had governed on behalf of the province since September 1996. The resulting single division became Chongqing Municipality, containing 30,020,000 people in forty-three former counties (without intermediate political levels). The municipality became the spearhead of China's effort to develop its western regions and to coordinate the resettlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges Dam project. Its first official ceremony took place on 18 June 1997. On 8 February 2010, Chongqing became one of the four National Central/Core cities, the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. On 18 June 2010, Liangjiang New Area was established in Chongqing, which is the third State-level new areas at the time of its establishment.In August 2020 the city was hit by a large scale flood, the highest water level seen since the Cuntan hydrographic station was opened in 1939. This came after other smaller scale floods during the year. It is estimated the flood killed hundreds of people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography and topography ===\n\nChongqing is situated at the transitional area between the Tibetan Plateau and the plain on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the sub-tropical climate zone often swept by moist monsoons. It often rains at night in late spring and early summer, and thus the city is famous for its \"night rain in the Ba Mountains\", as described by poems throughout Chinese history including the famous Written on a Rainy Night-A Letter to the North by Li Shangyin. The municipality reaches a maximum width of 470 kilometres (290 mi) from east to west, and a maximum length of 450 km (280 mi) from north to south. It borders the following provinces: Hubei in the east, Hunan in the southeast, Guizhou in the south, Sichuan in the west and northwest, and Shaanxi to the north in its northeast corner.\n\nChongqing covers a large area crisscrossed by rivers and mountains. The Daba Mountains stand in the north, the Wu Mountains in the east, the Wuling Mountains in the southeast, and the Dalou Mountains in the south. The whole area slopes down from north and south towards the Yangtze River valley, with sharp rises and falls. The area is featured by a large geological massif, of mountains and hills, with large sloping areas at different heights. Typical karst landscape is common in this area, and stone forests, numerous collections of peaks, limestone caves and valleys can be found in many places. The Longshuixia Gap (\u9f99\u6c34\u5ce1\u5730\u7f1d), with its natural arch-bridges, has made the region a popular tourist attraction. The Yangtze River runs through the whole area from west to east, covering a course of 665 km (413 mi), cutting through the Wu Mountains at three places and forming the well-known Three Gorges: the Qutang, the Wuxia and the Xiling gorges. Coming from northwest and running through \"the Jialing Lesser Three Gorges\" of Libi, Wentang and Guanyin, the Jialing River joins the Yangtze in Chongqing.\n\nThe central urban area of Chongqing, or Chongqing proper, is a city of unique features. Built on mountains and partially surrounded by the Yangtze and Jialing rivers, it is known as a \"mountain city\" and a \"city on rivers\". The night scene of the city is very illuminated, with millions of lights and their reflection on the rivers. With its special topographical features, Chongqing has the unique scenery of mountains, rivers, forests, springs, waterfalls, gorges, and caves. Li Bai, a famous poet of the Tang dynasty, was inspired by the natural scenery and wrote this epigram.Specifically, the central urban area is located on a huge folding area. Yuzhong District, Nan'an District, Shapingba District and Jiangbei District are located right on a big syncline. And the \"Southern Mountain of Chongqing\" (Tongluo Mountain), along with the Zhongliang Mountain are two anticlines next to the syncline of downtown.Zhongliang Mountains (\u4e2d\u6881\u5c71) and Tongluo Mountains (\u94dc\u9523\u5c71) roughly forms the eastern and western boundaries of Chongqing's urban area. The highest point in downtown is the top of Eling Hill, which is a smaller syncline hill that keeps Yangtze River and Jialing River apart for some more kilometres. The elevation of Eling Hill is 379 metres (1,243 feet). The lowest point is Chaotian Gate, where the two rivers merge with each other. The altitude there is 160 metres (520 feet). The average height of the area is 259 metres (850 feet). However, there are several high mountains outside central Chongqing, such as the Wugong Ling Mountain, with the altitude of 1,709.4 metres (5,608 feet), in Jiangjin.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nChongqing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa), bordering on a monsoonal humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and for most of the year experiences very high relative humidity, with all months above 75%. Known as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" of the Yangtze river, along with Wuhan and Nanjing, its summers are long and among the hottest and most humid in China, with highs of 33 to 34 \u00b0C (91 to 93 \u00b0F) in July and August in the urban area. Winters are short and somewhat mild, but damp and overcast. The city's location in the Sichuan Basin causes it to have one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, at only 1,055 hours, lower than much of Northern Europe; the monthly percent possible sunshine in the city proper ranges from a mere 8% in December and January to 48% in August. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.8 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 15 December 1975 (unofficial record of \u22122.5 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) was set on 8 February 1943) to 43.0 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) on 15 August 2006 (unofficial record of 44.0 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F) was set on 8 and 9 August 1933).Chongqing, with over 100 days of fog per year, is known as the \"Fog City\" (\u96fe\u90fd), like San Francisco, and a thick layer of fog enshrouds it for 68 days per year during the spring and autumn. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, this special weather possibly played a role in protecting the city from being overrun by the Imperial Japanese Army.\nAs exemplified by Youyang County below, conditions are often cooler in the southeast part of the municipality due to the higher elevations there.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nChongqing has been, since 1997, a direct-controlled municipality in the Chinese administrative structure, making it a provincial-level division with commensurate political importance. The municipality's top leader is the secretary of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China (\"party chief\"), which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, the country's second highest governing council. Under the Soviet-inspired nomenklatura system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the Communist Party, and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include He Guoqiang, Wang Yang, Bo Xilai, Zhang Dejiang, and Sun Zhengcai, the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal party standing committee, the de facto top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.\nThe municipal People's Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor, who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.The municipality also has a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (zhengxie) meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The zhengxie is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.\n\n\n=== Military ===\nChongqing was the wartime capital of China during the Second Sino-Japanese war (i.e., World War II), and from 1938 to 1946, the seat of administration for the Republic of China's government before its departure to Nanjing and then Taiwan. After the eventual defeat at the Battle of Wuhan General Chiang-Kai Shek and the army were forced to use it as base of resistance from 1938 onwards. It also contains a military museum named after the Chinese Korean War hero Qiu Shaoyun.Chongqing used to be the headquarters of the 13th Group Army of the People's Liberation Army, one of the two group armies that formerly comprised the Chengdu Military Region, which in 2016 was re-organized into the Western Theater Command.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nChongqing is the largest of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China. The municipality is divided into 38 subdivisions (3 were abolished in 1997, and Wansheng and Shuangqiao districts were abolished in October 2011), consisting of 26 districts, 8 counties, and 4 autonomous counties. The boundaries of Chongqing municipality reach much farther into the city's hinterland than the boundaries of the other three provincial level municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and much of its administrative area, which spans over 80,000 square kilometres (30,900 sq mi), is rural. At the end of year 2017, the total population is 30.75 million.[1]\n\n\n==== Urban areas ====\n\na Indicates with which district the division was associated below prior to the merging of Chongqing, Fuling, Wanxian (now Wanzhou) and Qianjiang in 1997.\n\n\n==== Central Chongqing ====\n\nThe main urban area of Chongqing city (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e3b\u57ce\u533a) spans approximately 5,473 square kilometres (2,113 square miles), and includes the following nine districts:\nYuzhong District (\u6e1d\u4e2d\u533a, or \"Central Chongqing District\"), the central and most densely populated district, where government and international business offices and the city's best shopping are located in the district's Jeifangbei CBD area. Yuzhong is located on the peninsula surrounded by Eling Hill, Yangtze River and Jialing River.\nJiangbei District (\u6c5f\u5317\u533a, or \"River North District\"), located to the north of Jialing River.\nShapingba District (\u6c99\u576a\u575d\u533a), roughly located between Jialing River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nJiulongpo District (\u4e5d\u9f99\u5761\u533a), roughly located between Yangtze River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nNan'an District (\u5357\u5cb8\u533a, or \"Southern Bank District\"), located on the south side of Yangtze River.\nDadukou District (\u5927\u6e21\u53e3\u533a)\nBanan District (\u5df4\u5357\u533a, or \"Southern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Ba County, and changed to the current name in 1994. Its northern area merged into Chongqing, and its capital town Yudong is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nYubei District (\u6e1d\u5317\u533a, or \"Northern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Jiangbei County, and changed into the current name in 1994. Its southern area merged into Chongqing, and the capital town Lianglu Town is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nBeibei District (\u5317\u789a\u533a), a satellite city northwest of Chongqing.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAccording to a July 2010 article from the official Xinhua news agency, the municipality has a population of 32.8 million, including 23.3 million farmers. Among them, 8.4 million farmers have become migrant workers, including 3.9 million working and living in urban areas of Chongqing.\nThe metropolitan area encompassing the central urban area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 17 million.This would mean that the locally registered farmers who work in other jurisdictions number 4.5 million, reducing the local, year-round population of Chongqing in 2010 to 28.3 million, plus those who are registered in other jurisdictions but live and work in Chongqing. According to China's 2005 statistical yearbook, of a total population of 30.55 million, those with residence registered in other jurisdictions but residing in the Chongqing enumeration area numbered 1.4 million, including 46,000 who resided in Chongqing \"for less than half-year\". An additional 83,000 had registered in Chongqing, but not yet settled there.The 2005 statistical yearbook also lists 15.22 million (49.82%) males and 15.33 million (50.18%) females.In terms of age distribution in 2004, of the 30.55 million total population, 6.4 million (20.88%) were age 0\u201314, 20.7 million (67.69%) were 15\u201364, and 3.5 million (11.46%) were 65 and over.Of a total 10,470,000 households (2004), 1,360,000 consisted of one person, 2,940,000 two-person, 3,190,000 three-person, 1,790,000 four-person, 783,000 five-person, 270,000 six-person, 89,000 seven-person, 28,000 eight-person, 6,000 nine-person, and 10,000 households of 10 or more persons per household.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe predominant religions in Chongqing are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 26.63% of the population believes and is involved in cults of ancestors, while 1.05% of the population identifies as Christian.The reports didn't give figures for other types of religion; 72.32% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects.\n\n\n== Crime ==\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the city became notorious for organised crime and corruption. Gangsters oversaw businesses involving billions of yuan and the corruption reached into the law-enforcement and justice systems. In 2009, city authorities under the auspices of municipal Communist Party secretary Bo Xilai undertook a large-scale crackdown, arresting 4,893 suspected gangsters, \"outlaws\" and corrupt cadres, leading to optimism that the period of gangsterism was over. However, local media later highlighted the apparent reliance by the authorities on torture to extract confessions upon which convictions were based. In December 2009, one defence lawyer was controversially arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison for \"coaching his client to make false claims of torture\" and in July 2010, another lawyer released videotapes of his client describing the torture in detail. In 2014, four policemen involved in the interrogation were charged with the practice of \"opposed illegal interrogation techniques\", considered by observers to be torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nChongqing was separated from Sichuan province and made into a municipality in its own right in 14 March 1997 in order to accelerate its development and subsequently China's relatively poorer western areas (see China Western Development strategy). An important industrial area in western China, Chongqing is also rapidly urbanising. For instance, statistics suggest that new construction added approximately 137,000 square metres (1,470,000 square feet) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. In addition, more than 1,300 people moved into the city daily, adding almost 100 million yuan (US$15 million) to the local economy.\nTraditionally, due to its geographical remoteness, Chongqing and neighbouring Sichuan have been important military bases in weapons research and development. Chongqing's industries have now diversified but unlike eastern China, its export sector is small due to its inland location. Instead, factories producing local-oriented consumer goods such as processed food, cars, chemicals, textiles, machinery, sports equipment and electronics  are common.\nChongqing is China's third largest centre for motor vehicle production and the largest for motorcycles. In 2007, it had an annual output capacity of 1 million cars and 8.6 million motorcycles. Leading makers of cars and motor bikes includes China's fourth biggest automaker; Changan Automotive Corp and Lifan Hongda Enterprise, as well as Ford Motor Company, with the US car giant having 3 plants in Chongqing.  The municipality is also one of the nine largest iron and steel centres in China and one of the three major aluminium producers. Important manufacturers include Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and South West Aluminium which is Asia's largest aluminium plant. Agriculture remains significant. Rice and fruits, especially oranges, are the area's main produce. Natural resources are also abundant with large deposits of coal, natural gas, and more than 40 kinds of minerals such as strontium and manganese. Coal reserves \u2248 4.8 billion tonnes. Chuandong Natural Gas Field is China's largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270 billion m3 \u2013 more than 1/5 of China's total. Has China's largest reserve of strontium (China has the world's 2nd biggest strontium deposit). Manganese is mined in the Xiushan area. although the mining sector has been criticised for being wasteful, heavily polluting and unsafe. Chongqing is also planned to be the site of a 10 million ton capacity refinery operated by CNPC (parent company of PetroChina) to process imported crude oil from the Sino-Burma pipelines. The pipeline itself, though not yet finished, will eventually run from Sittwe (in Myanmar's western coast) through Kunming in Yunnan before reaching Chongqing and it will provide China with fuels sourced from Myanmar, the Middle East and Africa. Recently, there has been a drive to move up the value chain by shifting towards high technology and knowledge intensive industries resulting in new development zones such as the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ). Chongqing's local government is hoping through the promotion of favorable economic policies for the electronics and information technology sectors, that it can create a 400 billion RMB high technology manufacturing hub which will surpass its car industry and account for 25% of its exports.The city has also invested heavily in infrastructure to attract investment. The network of roads and railways connecting Chongqing to the rest of China has been expanded and upgraded reducing logistical costs. Furthermore, the nearby Three Gorges Dam which is the world's largest, supplies Chongqing with power and allows oceangoing ships to reach Chongqing's Yangtze River port. These infrastructure improvements have led to the arrivals of numerous foreign direct investors (FDI) in industries ranging from car to finance and retailing; such as Ford, Mazda, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, ANZ Bank, Scotiabank, Wal-Mart, Metro AG and Carrefour, among other multinational corporations.\nChongqing's nominal GDP in 2011 reached 1001.1 billion yuan (US$158.9 billion) while registering an annual growth of 16.4%. However, its overall economic performance is still lagging behind eastern coastal cities such as Shanghai. For instance, its per capita GDP was 22,909 yuan (US$3,301) which is below the national average. Nevertheless, there is a massive government support to transform Chongqing into the region's economic, trade, and financial centre and use the municipality as a platform to open up the country's western interior to further development.Chongqing has been identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei, Anshan, Maanshan, Pingdingshan and Shenyang), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China.\n\n\n=== Economic and technological development zones ===\nThe city includes a number of economic and technological development zones:\n\nChongqing Chemical Industrial Park\nChongqing Economic & Technological Development Zone\nChongqing Hi-Tech Industry Development Zone\nChongqing New North Zone (CNNZ)\nChongqing Export Processing Zone\nJianqiao Industrial Park (located in Dadukou District)\nLiangjiang New Area\nLiangjiang Cloud Computing Center (the largest of its kind in China)Chongqing itself is part of the West Triangle Economic Zone, along with Chengdu and Xi'an.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nChongqing University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University of Political Science and Law (\u897f\u5357\u653f\u6cd5\u5927\u5b66)\nThird Military Medical University (\u7b2c\u4e09\u519b\u533b\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (\u91cd\u5e86\u90ae\u7535\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u7406\u5de5\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Jiaotong University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Medical University (\u91cd\u5e86\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Normal University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e08\u8303\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Technology and Business University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5de5\u5546\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Three Gorges University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e09\u5ce1\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing Telecommunication Institute (\u91cd\u5e86\u901a\u8baf\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Science and Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u79d1\u6280\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan Fine Arts Institute (\u56db\u5ddd\u7f8e\u672f\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan International Studies University (\u56db\u5ddd\u5916\u56fd\u8bed\u5927\u5b66)\nUniversity of Logistics (\u540e\u52e4\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Arts and Science (\u91cd\u5e86\u6587\u7406\u5b66\u9662)\nYangtze Normal University (\u957f\u6c5f\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Education (\u91cd\u5e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\n\n\n=== Notable high schools ===\nFuling Experimental High School (\u6daa\u9675\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.1 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u4e2d)\nChongqing Nankai Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5357\u5f00\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.8 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u516b\u4e2d)\nBashu Secondary School (\u5df4\u8700\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Railway High School (\u91cd\u5e86\u94c1\u8def\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Yucai Secondary School (\u80b2\u624d\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Foreign Language School (The High School Affiliated to Sichuan International Studies University \u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u5916)\nVerakin High School of Chongqing (The 2nd Chongqing Foreign Language School, \u91cd\u5e86\u4e8c\u5916)\nChongqing Qiujing High School (\u6c42\u7cbe\u4e2d\u5b66)\nHigh School Affiliated to Southwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u4e2d)\nChongqing NO.18 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5341\u516b\u4e2d)\n\n\n=== International schools ===\nYew Chung International School of Chongqing (\u91cd\u5e86\u8000\u4e2d\u56fd\u9645\u5b66\u6821)\nKL International School of Chongqing Bashu (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e02\u8bfa\u6797\u5df4\u8700\u5916\u7c4d\u4eba\u5458\u5b50\u5973\u5b66\u6821)\n\n\n== Transport ==\nSince its elevation to national-level municipality in 1997, the city has dramatically expanded its transportation infrastructure. With the construction of railways and expressways to the east and southeast, Chongqing is a major transportation hub in southwestern China.\nAs of October 2014, the municipality had 31 bridges across the Yangtze River including over a dozen in the city's urban core. Aside from the city's first two Yangtze River bridges, which were built, respectively, in 1960 and 1977, all of the other bridges were completed since 1995.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nPublic transport in Chongqing consists of metro, intercity railway, a ubiquitous bus system and the world's largest monorail network.\nAccording to the Chongqing Municipal Government's ambitious plan in May 2007, Chongqing is investing 150 billion RMB over 13 years to finish a system that combines underground metro lines with heavy monorail (called 'light rail' in China).\nAs of 2017, four metro lines, the 14 km (8.7 mi) long CRT Line 1, a conventional subway, and the 19 km (12 mi) long heavy monorail CRT Line 2 (through Phase II), Line 3, a heavy monorail connects the airport and the southern part of downtown., Line 6, runs between Beibei, a commuter city in the far north to the centre. Line 5 opened in late 2017.\nBy 2020 CRT will consist of 6 straight lines and 1 circular line resulting in 363.5 km (225.9 mi) of road and railway to the existing transportation infrastructure and 93 new train stations will be added to the 111 stations that are already in place.By 2050, Chongqing will have as many as 18 lines planned to be in operation.\n\n\n==== Aerial tramway ====\n\nChongqing is the only Chinese city that keeps public aerial tramways. Historically there were three aerial tramways in Chongqing: the Yangtze River Tramway, the Jialing River Tramway and the South Mountain Tramway. Currently, only Yangtze River Tramway is still operating and it is Class 4A Tourist Attractions in China. This tramway is 1,160 metres (3,810 feet) long, connecting the southern and northern banks of Yangtze River. The daily passenger volume is about 10,000.\n\n\n=== River port ===\n\nChongqing is one of the most important inland ports in China. There are numerous luxury cruise ships that terminate at Chongqing, cruising downstream along the Yangtze River to Yichang, Wuhan, Nanjing or even Shanghai. In the recent past, this provided virtually the only transportation option along the river. However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several port handling facilities exist throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nMajor train stations in Chongqing:\n\nChongqing railway station in Yuzhong, accessible via Metro Lines 1 & 3 (Lianglukou Metro station), is the city's oldest railway station and located near the city centre. The station handles mostly long-distance trains. There are plans for a major renovation and overhaul of this station, thus many services have been transferred to Chongqing North Railway Station.\nChongqing North railway station is a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to Chengdu, Beijing and other cities. It was completed in 2006 and is connected to Metro Line.\nChongqing West railway station is in Shapingba, a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to many cities. It is completed in 2018.\nShapingba railway station is in Shapingba, near Shapingba CBD, accessible via Metro Line 1. It handles many local and regional train services. It is completed in 2018.Chongqing is a major freight destination for rail with continued development with improved handling facilities. Due to subsidies and incentives, the relocation and construction of many factories in Chongqing has seen a huge increase in rail traffic.\nChongqing is a major rail hub regionally.\n\nChengdu\u2013Chongqing railway to Chengdu\nSichuan-Guizhou railway to Guiyang\nXiangyang\u2013Chongqing railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Huaihua railway to Hunan\nChongqing-Suining railway (Sichuan province)\nChongqing-Lichuan railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Lanzhou railway (Gansu) railway\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nTraditionally, the road network in Chongqing has been narrow, winding and limited to smaller vehicles because of the natural terrain, large rivers and the huge population demands on the area, especially in the Yuzhong District. In other places, such as Jiangbei, large areas of homes and buildings have recently been cleared to improve the road network and create better urban planning. This has seen many tunnels and large bridges needing to be built across the city. Construction of many expressways have connected Chongqing to neighbouring provinces. Several ring roads have also been constructed. The natural mountainous terrain that Chongqing is built on makes many road projects difficult to construct, including for example some of the world's highest road bridges.Unlike many other Chinese cities, it is rare for motorbikes, electric scooters or bicycles to be seen on Chongqing Roads. This is due to the extremely hilly and mountainous nature of Chongqing's roads and streets. However, despite this, Chongqing is a large manufacturing centre for these types of vehicles.\nChongqing-Chengdu Expressway\nChongqing-Chengdu 2nd Expressway (under construction)\nChongqing-Wanzhou-Yichang Highway (Wanzhou-Yichang section under construction)\nChongqing-Guiyang Highway\nChongqing-Changsha Expressway (Xiushan-Changsha section under construction)\nChongqing-Dazhou-Xi'a Highway (Dazhou-Xi'an section under construction)\nChongqing-Suining Expressway\nChongqing-Nanchong Expressway\nChina National Highway 210\nChina National Highway 212\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nWith so many bridges crossing the Yangtze and Jialing rivers in the urban area, Chongqing is sometimes known as the 'Bridge Capital of China'. The first important bridge in urban Chongqing was the Niujiaotuo Jialing River Bridge, built in 1958. The first bridge over the Yangtze river was the Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge (or Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge) built in 1977.\nAs of 2014, within the area of the 9 districts, there were 20 bridges on the Yangtze river and 28 bridges on the Jialing river. The bridges in Chongqing exhibit a variety of shapes and structures, making Chongqing a showcase for bridge design.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe major airport of Chongqing is Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport (IATA: CKG, ICAO: ZUCK). It is located in Yubei District. The airport offers a growing network of direct flights to China, South East Asia, the Middle East, North America, and Europe. It is located 21 km (13 mi) north of the city-centre of Chongqing and serves as an important aviation hub for south-western China. Jiangbei airport is a hub for China Southern Airlines, Chongqing Airlines, Sichuan Airlines, China Express Airlines, Shandong Airlines and Hainan Airlines's new China West Air. Chongqing also is a focus city of Air China, therefore it is very well connected with Star Alliance and Skyteam's international network. The airport currently has three parallel runways in operation. It serves domestic routes to most other Chinese cities, as well as international routes to Auckland, New York City, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, Doha, Dubai, Seoul, Bangkok, Phuket, Osaka, Singapore, Chiang Mai, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Mal\u00e9, Bali, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Batam, Rome and Helsinki. As of 2018, Jiangbei Airport is the 9th busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic in mainland China.Currently, Jiangbei airport has three terminals. Chongqing Airport has metro access (CRT Line 3 and Line 10) to its central city, and two runways in normal use.There are two other airports in Chongqing Municipality: Qianjiang Wulingshan Airport (IATA: JIQ, ICAO: ZUQJ) and Wanzhou Wuqiao Airport (IATA: WXN, ICAO: ZUWX). They are both class 4C airports and serve passenger flights to some domestic destinations including Beijing, Shanghai and Kunming. Two more airports are being constructed soon: Wulong Xiann\u00fcshan Airport and Wushan Shenn\u00fcfeng Airport.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe language native to Chongqing is Southwestern Mandarin. More precisely, the great majority of the municipality, save for Xiushan, speak Sichuanese, including the primary Chengdu-Chongqing dialect and Minjiang dialect spoken in Jiangjin and Qijiang. There are also a few speakers of Xiang and Hakka in the municipality, due to the great immigration wave to the Sichuan region (\u6e56\u5e7f\u586b\u56db\u5ddd) during the Ming and Qing dynasties. In addition, in parts of southeastern Chongqing, the Miao and Tujia languages are also used by some Miao and Tujia people.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAs the provisional Capital of China for almost ten years (1937 to 1945), the city was also known as one of the three headquarters of the Allies during World War II, as well as being a strategic center of many other wars throughout China's history. Chongqing has many historic war-time buildings or sites, some of which have since been destroyed. These sites include the People's Liberation Monument, located in the center of Chongqing city. It used to be the highest building in the area, but is now surrounded and dwarfed by numerous shopping centres. Originally named the Monument for the Victory over Axis Armies, it is the only building in China for that purpose. Today, the monument serves as a symbol for the city. The General Joseph W. Stilwell Museum, dedicated to General \"Vinegar Joe\" Stilwell, a World War II general. the air force cemetery in the Nanshan area, in memory of those air force personnel killed during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), and the Red Rock Village Museum, a diplomatic site for the Communist Party in Chongqing led by Zhou Enlai during World War II, and Guiyuan, Cassia Garden, where Mao Zedong signed the \"Double 10 (10 October) Peace Agreement\" with the Kuomintang in 1945.\n\nThe Baiheliang Underwater Museum, China's first underwater museum,\nThe Memorial of Great Tunnel Massacre, a former air-raid shelter where a major massacre occurred during World War II.\nThe Great Hall of the People in Chongqing is based on the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Chongqing is known for its spicy food. Its food is normally considered numbing because of the use of Sichuan pepper, also known as Sichuan peppercorn, containing hydroxy alpha sanshool. Chongqing's city centre has many restaurants and food stalls where meals often cost less than RMB10. Local specialties here include dumplings and pickled vegetables and, different from many other Chinese cuisines, Chongqing dishes are suitable for the solo diner as they are often served in small individual sized portions. Among the delicacies and local specialties are these dishes:\n\nChongqing hot pot (Huoguo) \u2013 Chongqing's local culinary specialty which was originally from Northern China.

          "Difficult to objectively rate this one as we were here for one thing and one thing only which was to see the Pandas, and for that experience it was excellent. We went as part of a guided tour who make sure as much as they can that your visit coincides with one of the times the",
          "They had many different animals. We saw the red panda and a rare tiger. There were also many types of lizards and birds. Plus elephants and rhinos. It was raining when we were there but we still enjoyed it.",

          "I felt very sad or the monkeys...it's like life imprisonment and solitary confinement. Either release them back to the wild or built better and bigger enclosures with trees etc etc for them.",
          "I was lucky enough to get to the zoo before the bus loads of tourists arrived. I had taken a taxi from my hotel which seemed the obvious thing to do. The entrance is 30 yuan and the panda enclosure is open most of the day. I went late morning just after the bamboo had been",
          "Extremely small enclosures for all animals. Sad to see. Pandas were interesting but need to go in morning before 10am or around 4pm to see them as that is when they are fed.",
          "You will see pandas, but the grounds are more pleasant for us than for the animals. Not large for us but clearly inadequate enclosures for the pandas and tigers. We took only a short visit to fill time while waiting for the cruise so admit there may be more to this zoo than we",
          "We visited here as part of our tour, mainly to see the pandas. The zoo itself is set in some lovely gardens but the enclosures are so old and small it saddened me to see,it was like the zoos of old. We visited the playful pandas and this is obviously the big drawcard for the",
          "At the end of our 4 night Yangtze River cruise in arrival in Chongqing we visited the City Zoo to mainly see the Giant Panda's. When visiting China there are a number of places where one can see the Panda - so do try if you can. Amazing to see and to know so much is being done",
          "Everything was old and had a communist feeling over it. The park was therefor much more interesting.",
          "I was part of a tour group and it wasn't too bad a day to go to the zoo. We got to see the pandas but most of our group lost our guide as we were meant to see the baby pandas so it was a bit disappointed. I found my way to see the adult giant pandas and they looks so cute. I",
          "It was extremely hot the day we visited the zoo. It was easily accessible by Metro.We only saw one giant panda, but it was happily eating lots of bamboo. My main criticism of the zoo was that many of the other animals had virtually NO water in their enclosures. Rhinos,",
          "We were there in the pouring rain and off course some of the animals where hiding in their shelters. I have been to many zoos and this was not the best zoo I have seen. I did enjoy seeing the Pandas in China but we have two pandas in Adelaide loaned from China in much nicer",
          "The main purpose of this small zoo is the presentation of the Panda. There are the small and very nice brown Pandas and also the big black and white Panda bears. It\u00b4s the nature of these animals to spend most of the time with eating bamboo.",
          "to be fair - I have seen many better zoo's. Perhaps the gold-fish feeding was the only thing a bit different. Maybe the entry sculptures are worth a photo stop. That's it.",
          "It was raining and we didn't see the baby pandas. They were inside the enclosure but 2 giant pandas were out.One was asleep and the other was eating bamboo. The grounds were immaculate. Plenty of animals, but it's the pandas we came to see.",
          "We visited this zoo to see some pandas - they were looking quite happy as they don't really move far and seem to eat continually. Most other animals here don't have enough space. A white tiger mother paced all day as her newly born cub was put in a glass box for visitors to look",
          "This zoo is better then most. It has much larger areas for the animals to roam. The pandas were numerous and the habitats were well designed. They placed fresh cut bamboo in very cute display points/areas, for some really fun pictures. The park is large and the verity of",
          "Generally people come to see the Panda's and I dont really support animals in captivity but if used correctly ie: to help the species and promote awareness I suppose its a necessary evil. \"didnt see much of this going on however ! animals cared for in nice grounds.",
          "Great little zoo, obviously highlighted by panda exhibit. Our guide was hopeful when we arrived, it was lightly raining and the pandas had just received their bamboo. We saw eight of nine and it was up close. They were very active, lots of great picture spots, cool little",
          "Chongqing Zoo is a wonderful place to visit. Although I was excited to see the pandas, this zoo has hundreds af animals in a setting that is close to natural. The baby pandas were the highlight for me.",
          "It was raining heavily when we arrived early in the morning on our Wendy Wu tour at the Chongquing Zoo. I had wanted to visit the Panda Reserve but it was too far away and wouldn't fit into our tour and I had been expecting there to be only one Panda and to be at the Zoo for a",
          "This is a place you have to visit. We spent so much time around the Giant Pandas and enjoyed every minute of it. There is so much to see and do and along with the sights, sounds and smells you could definitely spend a full day here. There are so many chances to get some great",
          "Three baby pandas, the highlight of visit. Brought out often for viewing. Zoo well organized, clean, plenty western style toliets. Most interpretive signs in English as well as Chinese.",
          "The panda enclosure was the highlight of our trip. We arrived when the adult panda's were having breakfast. Enjoyed watching them feast on bamboo. Then the 3 baby pandas arrived and we spent half an hour watching them play. We quickly walked the rest of the zoo but the panda's",
          "Very inexpensive, quiet on weekdays and a wide selection of animals. Small food outlets all around the zoo serving reasonably priced and palatable fare. The funfair rides are extra but it's only 30rmb to get in for adults and kids are free under a certain age (probably 5 yrs).",
          "Easy to get too, if you want to see the Giant Panda's go early, 9.00am when the zoo opens, also have Red Panda's which are just as adorable. Very relaxing",
          "It was raining when we visited the zoo but , in spite of that, the zoo was beautiful. The grounds were like walking through a garden. I was not excited about seeing the pandas but when I did, it was pretty interesting. It was a lot of fun to see them eat their breakfasts. I",
          "The zoo is set in an extensive wooded enclosure and is very pleasant to walk around. There seemed to be a wide variety of creatures on display e.g Hippos, Red Pandas etc but the highlight that everyone wanted to see are the Pandas. Go at feeding time as the Pandas spend most of",
          "This is an excellent day to stroll around and see not only pandas, but also a white tiger and many others. The pandas are certainly the highlight of the zoo. They are fun to just watch.",
          "We were part of a Sinorama travel group. Unfortunately, we experienced a late April day of cool temps and continuous rain while visiting Chongqing. Our trip to the zoo was not much fun EXCEPT for seeing all of the pandas. Young and old, the pandas were captivating to watch and",
          "The zoo in Chongqing is the place to see several pandas. After you pay your admission to the zoo stroll towards the left until you are greeted by the two baby pandas. These two are twins born September 2016. Their mother is a few meters away at the top of the hill. Here you",
          "We came to see the Pandas and we were not disappointed. They stole the show. The babies were adorable, cavorting and having fun. Great photo ops with no glass in front. The enclosures seemed large and natural. We loved it. There were also Red Pandas, and many other animals. Due",
          "As zoos go, this is a good one. The star attraction here are the 14 pandas in residence, including three babies who played and cavorted for us. They climb trees and fall out of them. They roll around with each other. They are endearing. The older pandas mostly sit there and",
          "Sinorama brought us here to see the pandas before going to our hotel. We were lucky as 5 of them were moving around and (mostly) eating bamboo. Cute beasts. We didn't have too much time to spend here but from what we saw you could easily spend a day here. The alleys are",
          "I would say it is a must see. The Pandas old ones, middle aged ones, and babies are adorable and their enclosures are ample and they appear to be well cared for. The Tigers were also a treat, particular the South China Tiger (orange in color) which is the most rare animal in",
          "We came to see the pandas and only had enough time to watch the babies play (3 of them). The panda part was clean and they looked happy and healthy...they were eating at the time the Sinorama group was there. Really a must if you like pandas.",
          "This is a well organized zoo with pleasant treed walkways between the animal and enclosures. The animal enclosures are conventional and rather small and unnatural and do not present the animals particularly well. The highlight of course are the pandas and despite all the hype",
          "We went to this zoo with our tour group just to see the pandas. The pandas are a very short walk in from the entrance. The zoo looked very well maintained, even though we only saw a tiny portion. It was amazing to actually see pandas in China, even though we have pandas at",
          "Ten Pandas are available for viewing, including two twin cubs. The cubs were in constant frolic and play. It was so much fun watching them. The adult pandas were all in separate enclosures and were all chowing down on bamboo. Some said this zoo looked rundown, but the place",
          "Pandas there looked very happy and healthy. Other animals looked ok too. Not as clean as western zoos but no sign of diseases. There's a water park in middle which looked disused and uncared for. Worth a visit if you like pandas.",
          "We hit the zoo early in the spring season, so it needed some tlc. We were lucky enough to catch all the pandas moving. They also have a wide variety of other animals, but we only had a limited time.",
          "Old and a bit run down in the heart of a bustling city. They have hippos! The monkey exhibits were my favorite.",
          "One can't avoid feeling sorry for the animals. Better not to have a zoo than to have it like this. The zoo was empty on a weekday. Entrance fees are ridiculously low, which may be part of the problem",
          "We travelled with a group organised by Sinorama tours and because of our strict scedule we didn't spend much time in the zoo. Our goal was to see pandas and so we did. All of them were outside so we could see the pandas very good. Unfortunatly we didn't had the time to visit",
          "Tthe upstream Yangtze River cruise from Jingzhou ends in Chongqing. Aside from the super spicy hot foods in Chongqing (they'll burn your palate), the Chongqing zoo has a special Giant Panda zoo where a number of the giant pandas were on display. We came at about 10:00 AM and the",
          "We didn't get enough time here unfortunately to see all of the zoo so we concentrated on the Giant Pandas and we weren't disappointed. We were luck enough to see most of the pandas eating and playing. They were wonderful. It certainly was a great experience.",
          "This was my first time seeing these beautiful animals and they put a quite a show. As much as I was disturbed to see these wonderful pandas behind bars , I had to admit they seemed oblivious to us the tourists and the bars as they happily chomped their bamboo. We learned how",
          "I'm not a fan of zoos. I don't enjoy seeing animals caged but although the enclosures were small and had cement floors, the panda exhibit wasn't too bad. All pandas were out pacing in their enclosures and munching bamboo. Our guide assured us they like walking the same path for",
          "A nice day out and many animals to look at. Sad the Giant Pandas were sleeping when we visited. Recommend a visit",
          "The pandas are the stars here, and there are several of them sitting around all day, munching bamboo. The cages for the carnivores held the saddest, most depressing creatures I have seen. But everyone comes out with their families, and it is a very lively place. Avoid the",
          "We went to the zoo to see the panda exhibit. It was raining that day, but we still managed to see the pandas and the babies. The zoo is very big and is like most zoos in any major city.",
          "The pandas were the big draw for me, although I'm not sure their enclosures were great. I don't know how far they travel in the wild - they were eating when we arrived and sleeping when we left. The video feed for the babies wasn't working. The planting is beautiful",
          "Even though the day of our visit was raining, it was AWSOME Just loved the Pandas Could have dtayed all day abd watched them We saw both the red & black/white pandas . Our tour was arranged by Wendy Dan from chinadiscovery.com. Great agent and very rekiabke compaby Would",
          "First the highlights: 1 Panda exhibit well done 2. Gardens pretty and well maintained. Low lights So sad and depressing. Reminds me of zoos of the 1950's. Small enclosures for most of the other animals and they did now look well cared for. Seeing beautiful animals in",
          "We only went to the Zoo to visit the Panda's, they were absolutely wonderful to see, we were on our way to the airport.,",
          "We found it disturbing. China needs to up its game when it comes to caring for animals. Big time. Dirty, small enclosures. Animals looked sad bored. Hated it!!",
          "What a terrific zoo. We could have spent all day just watching the giant pandas. There was a two year old panda having a blast wrestling with a car tire on a rope. Very nice place to visit.",
          "Our tour group made a special request to see the Panda's while touring Chongqing. The zoo is right dfowntown and quite extensive. We only visited thagt Panda exhibit since our time was limited. They have lots of Pandas in natural settings, but the all are in seperate",
          "everything is so easy to find, clean. \u201cHippos, Chimps, Zebras, Elephants, Tigers, Lions Where my favorites hippos especially where the most Active.\u201d",
          "We spent an hour just watching the Pandas. Really good enclosures, they appeared very happy and well looked after.",
          "The zoo is laid out beautifully. It was really fascinating to see the pandas. It was lunchtime we we went and each in its own area sat and munched their was through the bamboo and ignored the massive crowds around them.",
          "Tin Tin was out to play! We had so much fun watching him. I took videos and photos, and he just kept playing. It was awesome. I bought a panda puppet there who is my new favourite thing. As we went with a tour group, I don't know the entry fee, nor do I know how much time",
          "We spent a really nice afternoon here. We went on a cool day in September and all the animals were out and moving around, coming right up to the edges of their encolsures. The pandas are very well cared for, with their cages cleaned and fresh food multiple times each day. There",
          "I always go here on each visit. I love to watch the Pandas, they have a lot here. It's spread out and has a beautiful park like setting. It's also cheap, about $10 U.S. Dollars to go all day. It's a must visit for your Chongqing trip.",
          "The zoo is actually very nice. But try not to go there when it is too hot. None of the animals want to come out of their enclosures. And when they do come out they are not very active. The grounds are beautiful though with many places to stop and rest.",
          "Many animals in this large city zoo. Get there early to see the pandas before it gets too warm. Many other animals to see.",
          "The wife's highlight was to see the pandas and she got front row viewing of a panda chewing bamboo the rest of the zoo was good to a good selection of animals every where was well signposted in English allow 2 hours to see every thing and take a umbrella for sun protection it",
          "Just two brown pandas holed up inside Not many interesting animals Too hot n smelly Lots of walking Not worth the trouble",
          "The Chongqing Zoo has several specially designed habitats for the Panda bears. They are very interesting to watch, especially the smaller bears. This is a really nice zoo to walk around because of the ponds and the beautiful landscaping.",
          "If you would like to see Giant Pandas, then this is one of the places. Visit before 12:00 PM or after 2:00 PM because the Pandas are kept inside between 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM. We saw three of them munching on the bamboo leaves. They are gorgeous. Other than that, there are lots of",
          "The pandas are wonderful, with plenty of space for each of them, and their enclosures are well kept. However, the same cannot be said for other animals in this zoo. It's quite fun watching the locals who like coming here for their Tai Chi and dancing routines.",
          "As other reviewers have said, the pandas get the best deal here. Their enclosures are largeand just about acceptable. The rest of the zoo is actually quite spectacular. Their gardens, landscaping and walkways are very extensive, but the other animals get very substandard",
          "We went in the afternoon after a morning of rain. I guess the pandas had been napping before we arrive and then were spunky in the afternoon. The baby panda was doing summersaults!!!!",
          "We only had about 45 minutes to visit the zoo and it was raining which made more difficult to navigate during these 45 minutes. I had the pleasure of filming a panda as he was eating. As far as the conditions of the grounds as far as I could see they were well maintained and",
          "We visited the zoo at the end of our Yangtze river cruise. Fifteen years ago I paid my first visit here to see the Pandas and it was in a very tired, sad state with only two Pandas looking not particularly well-kept. However this time, the zoo was a much smarter, calm",
          "Maybe we had a bad luck with the weather - it was pouring with rain all afternoon. Most of the animals were hidden all the time, fortunately we had a chance to see one of the pandas and had a good time feeding the Golden fishes. But the conditions the animals are living in are",
          "After our morning flight from Xi\u2019an, our tour group took a chartered bus to the zoo. The stars of course are the 7 or 8 panda bears housed in what appears to be separate enclosures. The youngest and cutest bear is \u201cTinTin\u201d, born on August 30, 2015. This zoo has the usual",
          "If you are not going to Chengdu, don't despair. There are plenty of healthy well kept pandas to see in the Chongqing zoo, in large enclosures. Pandas can be seen from both ground level and from a walkway above some of the enclosures. The zoo is a short taxi ride from downtown.",
          "Our first point of tour @ Chongqing, and our first visit was to the Panda section. We were lucky to have have Ya Ya do a show of climbing on to the swing and feasting on Arrow bamboos. The zoo has a fairly good collection and considering it being in the city has fairly spacious",
          "This was just a flying visit on our way to Xian, and everyone wanted to see the pandas out and about. The zoo is in the middle of the city, but it pretty well set out with lots of park settings and green areas. The pandas were out and about, eating and then getting themselves",
          "The city of Chongqing has a nicely landscaped zoo and it has pandas as the premier attraction. It is a pleasant place to walk and amble around, except that the weather is not always conducive for this activity. There is a lake around a playground for children to play. There is",
          "We were lucky to visit when the pandas were feeding, munching on their bamboo shoots. As we were leaving all the pandas were moving into their covered accommodation so pot luck if you see any close up. As we only had time for a 40 minute visit we were only able to see a few of",
          "We stopped off at the zoo on the way to pick up our boat on the Yangtze river. The main attractions are the pandas, they have 9 black and white giant pandas and 4 red pandas. We were lucky to catch them at 3 pm just agter they had been fed, and we spent ages just watching them",
          "We are on a 20 day Grand Circle tour of China We stopped at the 55-acre Chongqing zoo mainly to see a total of 9 panda bears. This zoo has the full variety of animals you see at most zoos but again our target was the Panda's. In the 1950\u2019s China sent out Panda\u2019s to zoos all",
          "Not too many pandas but there are a few. The place is clean and good walking areas and well designed garden features. Lots of interesting birds. I felt that the big cat cages could have been larger. Given the crowding and degradation of a lot of tourist sites in China, this zoo",
          "The zoo was crowded as it was a weekend. We visited the panda section and the corresponding gift shop. We did not explore other animals. We saw the red panda as well. We were lucky as most of the pandas were active and playful. The exhibit is fairly close to the entrance.",
          "Mostly I went to take pictures of pandas for lady at work but enjoyed my time there although it was crowded but it was so large I did not notice crowds too much! It was a great day for wandering around zoo, met a tour from Australia so I could at least understood language.",
          "There is lot of Tripadvoser-report of this ZOO. It is one of Best Zoo, what we have seen and we have alot seen But how to go By own using very good MRT - I tell you it - see also pictures Start from Station 2 with Mrt line 2 ( green ) we had MRT-card which you can bye from",
          "There was a red Panda and eight black and white pandas. Loved watching them. They each had a huge area to sit and eat their bamboo. Lovely zoo. Plenty of places to sit. Very crowded but we were there on a weekend and a Holiday. Fun watching the children at the zoo. Intrigued by",
          "We spent about 2 hours at the zoo and most of the time was watching the Pandas eat. This was around 2 p.m. They were adorable sitting there eating their bamboo. Once they were finished, they went back inside their cave to nap. The baby panda, however, stayed outside and",
          "As part of a tour group, we were dropped at the Chongqing Zoo for 30 minutes. Not nearly enough time to see all of the zoo or even the highlights. We quickly made our way to the panda and were not disappointed. They had 8 pandas, including a baby, and all were outside and",
          "The Chongqing Zoo is only average and unexciting compared to some of China's great zoos and animal programs, such as the Giant Panda program in Chengdu, the aviaries in Hong Kong, and the zoos in Beijing and Shanghai. Nevertheless, I was able to see some bird species that were",
          "We went to this zoo to see the panda bears. Be sure to go to see them when they are feeding otherwise you will not see them. They feed for two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon. It was great to see them eating the bamboo. I had a chance to get some really",
          "The pandas are worth the visit. When we were there, there was a cute, playful 8 month old, in addition to the adults. The adults are cute also, but don't do much other than eat. It was also a lot of fun to people watch. Its as much a public park as a zoo, so you can see",
          "Great. Home of the famous panda, Ling Ling! Loads of animals to see. Great foliage and atmosphere. Wonderful. It wasn't part of our tour, but our group convinced our guide to bring us there for a couple hours since we had extra time in Chongqing. So, so glad we did. Don't",
          "We went with a group of friends. Expected a bit more than we saw. It is situated in the city area, the amount of animals is impressive but the conditions where they live are very poor. So do the animals. It stinks in most of the areas. Pandas park was the only place that",
          "Many of the cages (especially the seveal speices of primates) at the zoo were small and dirty. The highlight of course are the panda displays. The zoo is laid out in a nice setting with ponds and forests between the animal displays.",
          "Arrived early Sunday morning. The zoo keepers made special arrangements with the tour company to wake the pandas. The morning was cool and was drizzling. The 8 month old panda was the first. Later the mother and other siblings came out. We saw 6 pandas that morning. It",
          "We toured Chongqing Zoo with Sinorama tours. The highlights were the numerous panda exhibits as well as the white tiger exhibits. Both are thrilling, although the pandas are quite lazy! The zoo is clean and well organized with English signage. The lush tropical landscaping adds",
          "The panda enclosure was supper. so many times you visit zoos and the animals are asleep or inactive, these animals were out and about. Got great pics that will be share soon. The white tiger was active too. What a treat. we could have spent all day.",
          "There are no doubt better places to see pandas, but this zoo is pretty good. Hopefully, it's a day when they are out and about. It's nice that they have a good amount of space to roam while still being visible to the zoo visitors. We, unfortunately, did not have time for the",
          "Spent over 3 hours wondering around. Off course the the Pandas are the main attraction for us westerners! They were great to view as they devoured their morning meal, so arrive around 9.30 so you won't miss out. Train station right outside zoo entrance. As you enter the complex",
          "The Chongqing zoo is huge, and has a very wide array of different animals. The conditions of the animals are sad, though; most live in concrete boxes with not much to engage themselves with. That alone takes two stars away from my score, but another is added because of the",
          "We went to the Chongqing Zoo as a family (parents and grown-up children) with the specific reason to see the giant Pandas. We saw them all and they were wonderful. The young one, Curious, put on quite a show for us on his feeding platform. We got there just after 9am (after",
          "Fantastic family outing with the little ones. The zoo is not too big, and it was an easy walk for our 3 and 5 year olds. The pandas are one of the first enclosures which was definitely a highlight. The dinosaur exhibition before we left frightened our 3 year old but the 5 year",
          "The zoo was first built in 1953 and officially opened to the public in 1955 covering an area of 111 Acres. The zoo is not only an attractive place for the animals, but also an important base for protection and research of the immigrant wild animals. all kinds of animals are",
          "I don't know if any of you remember Ling Ling at the Toronto Zoo in the 1980's? She is retired at he Chongqing Zoo. The Panda exhibit was wonderful, and to be so close to the Panda's for some great shots. The rest of the zoo needs updating for the animals to have a better life.",
          "My wife and I visited this zoo to see the pandas. The pandas were cute to watch. This zoo is more of a park for the locals to exercise, as there are not many animals to see. The lone elephant was in poor condition and looked miserable.",
          "Seeing pandas close up was a great experience and my rating is based on that alone. The rest of the zoo whilst set in attractive gardens has concrete enclosures reminiscent of overseas zoos of the last century. The zoo really needs to be updated to improve the environment for",
          "We never dreamed we'd get this close to the Giant Pandas- it was a thrill. Our tour company took us fairly early in the morning when the animals are eating. The zoo has cleverly set up wooden platforms close to the visitors' walkway and puts the food ( bamboo leaves) on these",
          "The zoo is famous for the pandas but it has much more. We arrived when the pandas were feeding so saw them when they were very active. The red pandas are also interesting. There are also tigers, Tibetan bears, hippos, and other animals. Visiting is easy with plenty of walkways.",
          "We learned that pandas are similar to koalas in that they eat bamboo which is not particularly nutritional. Thus the do little other than eat. sleep and poop. We were lucky to arrive just as they were being let out of their overnight quarters and ready for their morning meal.",
          "It is home to few Pandas. Kangaroo, white peacock are other specials. Originally we planned to visit Chengdu just for seeing Panda. Came to know that Chongqing zoo has Panda through trip advisor forum. Saved lots of time.",
          "We visited this zoo to see a panda. We were able to see them close up which was a highlight. After leaving the panda enclosure we walked around to see other exhibits. This zoo is so rundown the animal enclosures were so small and mostly on concrete with no grass or dirt to",
          "We visited here as part of a Sinorama tour and were delighted to see the Giant Pandas. Luckily we arrived at feeding time so all the Giant Pandas were out and feeding. They were quite active and were a lovely sight. The Lesser (red) Pandas were an unexpected pleasure too. We",
          "We mainly went to see the Pandas and were not disappointed. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. All animals have plenty of space to walk around...",
          "I love all animals and I own pets. China takes great pride in their panda population and so they should. I was lucky to see four on my visit at feeding time. Each was alone in a sad enclosure and it may be more than adequate, but I'm not sure. A stray dog with mange wandered",
          "The best part of this zoo was the lesser or red pandas. They are sooooooo cute! An easy place to get lost so pay attention. The great pandas are nice too.",
          "We had a quick but pleasant visit to the Zoo to see the Red Pandas as well as the regular Pandas and nice Tigers. . The grounds are nice and it was a nice walk about for about an hour! Just perfect as we were enroute to our Yangtze ship.",
          "We went to see the infamous pandas who were awake while we were there. Try to go in the am and avoid Chinese National Week. There was also a mechanical dinosaur exhibit, same as we've seen in the US.",
          "What a site to see so many Pandas in a zoo. We got to the zoo at the best time, feeding time. Our guide suggested we get there at feeding time to see them and he was right. The Pandas were in a small platform easily within sight. Some put on a show for us sitting back in their",
          "A trip to this Zoo was part of our APT itinerary mainly to see the Pandas. That we had already spent considerable time at the Chengdu Breeding Centre some days earlier seemed to have escaped our Tour company. Our guide also seemed oblivious to the fact that it was raining, that",
          "Well laid out zoo with variety of animals. The zoo has a number of pandas in enclosures that make it easy to see the animals. Zoo appears to be transitioning from old style enclosures to more modern ones appropriate to the animals' needs as most animals are in larger open areas",

          "So much better than Shanghai zoo, they have 8 pandas, get there about 9.30-10 to see them eating their breakfast. You can also feed the hippos and the elephants.. but well run overall.",
          "The Panda we saw was up high in a tree looking at peace with the world and doing its best to ignore the visitors that had come to see it. There were other animal at the Zoo, however, we came to see the Pandas. Also we caught glimpses of a tiger pacing back and forth in its",
          "What a beautiful park and zoo, the grounds felt like you were entering a wildlife preserve. There were many local people in the zoo who seemed to be just enjoying the park itself. Of course, the pandas were amazing.",
          "Great zoo! Thoroughly enjoyed the entertaining Pandas! The rest of the zoo is well worth spending the day. Beautifully manicured grounds, ponds and a good assortment of animals to see.",
          "Although some people have different views on the zoo, i thought it was nice, never nice seeing animals in cages but from what i saw i enjoyed it!!",
          "The Chongqing zoo has a good collection of pandas as well as a large number of other animals including the south china tiger. The grounds are nicely manicured as this formerly was a private garden. If one of your bucket list items is to see pandas in China, this is a good place",
          "The only enclosures that we saw that were acceptable to the animals were the Panda's. Most of the others could do with a good clean and make over. A lot of the animals looked old and in need of a good feed. We would not visit again if we visit Chongqing again!",
          "Worth going for the Pandas....:Chester Zoo is our local zoo and by comparison this was a poor zoo, particularly for the animals. The zoo was clean and the Pandas were mesmerising, with a little more thought this could be a much better zoo",
          "We were very disappointed when we visited the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base at Chengdu. We had to travel long distance and didn't see many Pandas. But here at Cheonquig zoo we saw more pandas in a small area. They were active and playful. We also saw the normal and white",
          "This zoo was part of our all day city tour, and the hour we spent here was worthwhile. We started with the pandas, and it was a different experience seeing 6 to 8 of them in individual habitats, than seeing the one or two in a US zoo. The ape exhibit was also memorable, and the",
          "We couldn't leave China without seeing the Panda bears.There were 3 on display here. You can view them without glass or wire between you, making photos supremely good! This is a lovely zoo, and though we only stopped to see the pandas, I expect other exhibits were equally well",
          "Our tour guide dropped us at the entrance and we have several hours to visit the Zoo. Very well kept and the panda viewing area was excellent.",
          "The one thing that was not on our agenda for China was seeing the Giant Pandas. Then we arrived early to Chongqing and off we went. It was fabulous. It was a hot day on early June and there were no vendors for water or soda. The creatures were fabulous. Lions, tigers,",
          "It was wonderful to see the Pandas and other animals found in China. Pity about the rain but it was still good",
          "I've been obgligated to visit pandas in the zoo in a cage in Shenzen in 1993 because tour groups wrongly assume Americans are dying to see pandas! Not so! How could this be any different ? Well it was beautifully landscaped. The bears were comfortable ensconce on a mountain",
          "PANDAS! we only had an hour before we had to go to the airport but to see Pandas when we were not expecting to, we were thrilled. Our main reason for coming to China was to see Pandas and we were on our way to Chengdu to do just that. We got off the Yangtze River cruise on",
          "Yes, the pandas are wonderful animals and they seem to be well. However, the other animals seem neglected and in bad conditions. They don't have enough space where to dwell, The lots are muddy, there is no clear water in their surrounding and not enough green. The wolves as well",
          "We enjoyed our zoo visit. We saw the Panda's all in a row munching away. We saw the little red panda too. There was plenty to see and a lot of walking.",
          "Difficult review to write, because this was a \"smash & grab\" visit to see the Giant Pandas. We were on a tour and had a plane to catch, so we saw the entrance, the Pandas, and the exit! The grounds that we saw were very well kept and there were bronze statues of various animals",
          "a well designed Zoo with pleasant walks and clean well fed animals the Pandas were the highlight of the visit eatign contentedly on the plentifull bamboo I really enjoyed this sight",
          "We went to see the pandas, and they indeed looked happy as anything so I don't want to tarnish the zoo on that. However, the other animals are neglected, matted and skinny. They have no greenery in their small pens, let alone water. The camels, donkeys, antelope and more were",
          "We had an ideal time to visit here. We went around 10 a.m. and it was raining. As a result, there were very few people. At times it felt as though we had the zoo to ourselves. Our priority was to see the pandas and we did. The baby was sitting high up in the tree, the red panda",
          "we were on a tour and therefore time limited to this attraction. We came to the zoo primarily to see the pandas and were not disappointed. The lovely sunny weather had brought all 7 pandas out to eat and sunbathe; the 8th panda is too old to be on show. We also saw white rhinos",
          "now this is the place if want to see the Pandas, the most laid back animal I have ever seen, comfortable surroundings plenty food to eat, personal servant to tend to their every needs, Indeed a protected bear, not for cuddling.",
          "Nice zoo. The locals love it and visit to dance and do their tai chi. You can get close to the pandas. Also saw white rhinos and hippos. A pleasant way to spend a few hours.",
          "We had a few hours before boarding our Yangtze river cruise so went to the zoo. Best attraction is all of the pandas, especially if you can't make Chengdu. Word of warning... not the best restroom facilities. Seemed like they were closed before the zoo closed. No western toilets",
          "If you didn't have a chance to make it to Chengdu, this would be a decent replacement, but not even in the same league. Overall, it is a good stop on your way to something else and obviously has more pandas than pretty much everywhere else in the world (except Chengdu). If you",
          "chongqing zoo is basically a standard zoo, but located amongst the typical high buildings of chongqing... In this busy center it's a nice place to come to rest. And... you can watch the panda bears... unfortunately they are a bit dirty (and lazy!). Actually for the many chinese",
          "Went to the zoo on March 20, 2015. It is situated in the city across from a shopping mall where we went and had lunch. The zoo is notable for its panda exhibit. There are 7 pandas at the zoo, though not all of them are visible at once. They are in separate areas presumably",
          "We traveled to this zoo in September 2014 with a tour group. It was a rainy day when we were at the zoo. We did see a two year old baby panda up in a tree. There were three other pandas eating. Some of the pandas were red. It was exciting to see the pandas at the zoo - but",
          "We visited the zoo on our way to the Yangtze River cruise because we'd been given an Encounter with a Panda. We cuddled Lan Xiang, a twelve year old female. She was very cooperative and posed for photos. I believe anyone can book a similar experience by exchanging some cash...",
          "Our tour guide, Charlie, was wonderful. He took us first to see the Chongqing Zoo... to see the pandas! We were lucky enough to arrive right at breakfast time and spent close to an hour just watching the pandas amble out into their open-air enclosures to eat their morning",
          "Great zoo for a city of 33 million people. The pandas were animated and entertaining the crowds. Great facilities for snaks and restroom stops. Did not cost as we had time befor our embarkation in the Viking Emerald for a five day cruise down the Yangtze. The oddest thing",
          "We visited the zoo prior to our Yangtze River Cruise (Nexus Tours). Of course, the entire reason to visit was to see the 8 Giant Pandas (we saw 7). That said, I think that the Red Pandas stole the show - much cuter really. It wasn't that special for us though. It was a zoo,",
          "The hilly terrain and lush green of Chongqing make for an excellent setting for a zoo. There is an elevated train stop that is labeled specifically for the zoo, so it is easy and cheap to find. The dinosaur area was especially fun.",
          "Spent about an hour at this beautiful zoo to see the Pandas. Worth the visit as they were all outside, feasting on bamboo. The park like setting is well maintained. We also were able to see red pandas as well.",
          "We visited the zoo after we disembarked the Century Legend cruise down the Yangtze as part of an Avalon Waterways trip through China. The main purpose of our visit was to view the Giant Pandas, and we were fortunate to see 5 of the 8 pandas who live there. The lesser, or red,",
          "A nice big zoo, with many giant and red pandas. The zoo is structured more like a park than a traditional zoo, so you get to enjoy a big green area in a huge city.",
          "I did not like visiting the zoo as I felt that the animals did not have the correct environment. I felt quite sad coming away from there.",
          "A nicely maintained zoo with a beautiful setting. The panda exhibits had seven pandas with one being a youngster. All were active and seemed well cared for. We did not have a lot of time here but we did the yaks, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and pelicans. Could get pretty close to",
          "We were taken here by our guide from Travelchinaguide. It was a very restful place.Lots of trees. Loved seeing the pandas eating bamboo and the amazing tigers.Fantastic selection of birds. Lots of stairs up and down. Worth a visit",
          "The pandas were obviously well taken care of. Could not say the same for the great apes, and huge felines. Not enough space; old-style \"cages\". The setting (huge park) is beautiful -- CQ should invest seriously to make it a modern animal-friendly as well as tourist-friendly",
          "Went here for about an hour as part of our tour. We got there as it opened and the pandas appeared for breakfast. We saw close up lions, tigers, bears and monkeys. I would liked to have stayed longer to explore but we had a plane to catch. I love well run zoos and this one",
          "But really, that's it. If you're in Chongqing for another reason it would be foolish not to go see the Pandas, but don't expect much more out of this zoo. I will give it one more prop: the animals (including the pandas) are closer to you than they usually are, so that's",
          "We visited the Zoo while on a short stop before boarding our Yangtze River Cruise ship. To see Pandas was one of the reasons we chose to visit China for our holidays. I got it wrong, I was happy we got to see them in their fine enclosures but I believe there are better places to",
          "Very good presentation of animals especially the panda! But too much people here. Just leave when you finish your panda visit.",
          "We had a short stop here after our river cruise. We went early in the morning and it was uncrowded, most people being locals practicing tai chi etc. The main attraction is the panda area. There were 7 or 8 pandas in a fairly big paddock, in which it was easy to get good and",
          "They have some cute pandas but the enclosures were large (good) and when I went the pandas stayed way in the back (bad). Along the way there was lots of funny English translations of the signs. Those signs are enough for me to add an extra point.",
          "by far is not one of the best zoos i ever visit... but Chongqing has FOUR pandas... so for sure it worth a visit.",
          "If you like zoos, this one was fine. We only went to the zoo to see the pandas. The pandas were cute, though.",
          "If you want to see pandas in China & you're not going to Chengdu, this is an opportunity to see some. The zoo itself isn't that clean. Some of the animals look under weight. Go to see the pandas but I wouldn't waste too much more time there.",
          "This extensive zoo has one of the best panda exhibits in China. The foliage on the grounds is beautiful and there are many animals to view.",
          "We visited the giant panda exhibit at the Chongqing Zoo as part of a Chongqing area tour arranged for us by Abercrombie and Kent, largely to kill some time before we were able to embark our boat to start a downstream river cruise. I was not enthusiastic about going, but our",
          "While on tour with Viking cruises we had some extra time to stop in at the zoo. I was excited as the Pandas in Beijing zoo were depressed and lethargic. These pandas were happy and eating and showing off for the crowd. They are in a shaded area so you can spend some time",
          "Visited this as part of a tour with viking cruises. Not a huge fan of Zoos, but this one was manageable and the Pandas were lovely. There are several cages for the pandas, who seem to be very lazy animals, they just eat bamboo and doze, but they are extremely cute. Apparently",
          "The Panda centre in Chongquing is a must see venue. Not only are there close up views of fully grown pandas but a delightful insight into the upbringing of Panda cubs. One interesting fact is that young panda cubs love to climb trees and sleep dangled over branches.",
          "Personally I don't like zoos, but I guess it is the only way most people get to see the more unusual animals. In all my 76 years on this planet, I've never seen a live Giant Panda (and if I came from another planet I can't remember seeing any there either!), so it was quite an",
          "It was really nice to see the pandas (red and great) live and in person just sitting on their platforms placidly munching away on their morning bamboo shoots. We got some great photos and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",
          "The pandas were amazing. They fed them while they were there (on platforms for easy viewing). We got such amazing photos! We were there in the morning as part of a tour and LOVED this exhibit!",
          "All the animals seemed well kept and had some energy. Great value of \u00a33 which included seeing 6 of the 8 Pandas which they had - one out on loan somewhere .Well laid out park.",
          "If you like Pandas, this is the mother lode in the huge central China city of Chongqing. I also went here on recent Viking cruise. Unless you speak Mandarin and some dialects, nothing is better than a Viking guide to show you around. My guide Jimmy was excellent. He brings",
          "While traveling with Viking River Cruises, we stopped at the Chongqing Zoo. This zoo is far superior to the Beijing Zoo. These Pandas actually looked happy. If you're traveling with a group, you probably won't have a choice when to visit, but if you can avoid mid day unless you",
          "Our guide made an unexpected excursion to this zoo for us. It was fantastic. The landscaping is beautiful, there were lots of people there doing Tai Chi and socializing. There were red pandas (which are actually members of the raccoon family) and 7 or 8 Great Pandas. We were",
          "Don't miss the Chongqing Zoo if you are in that city. The beautiful grounds represent the best in Chinese design of parks. Our time was limited so we only got to the Panda section. We were lucky: several were out and about in their separate landscaped enclosures, one of them",
          "The animals except pandas & lesser pandas was kept in horrible conditions. Dead reptiles in their terrariums etc. Basically no stimulation for the animals and the audience behaving .. Well, not behaving at all. Feeding the animals with snacks and tapping & screaming for the",
          "If you want to spend a couple of hours away from the city this is not a bad place to come, subway line 2 and you are there. The entry fee is only 30rmb so it won't break the bank, the place itself is large and incorporates a reasonable funfair too. However most of the exhibits",
          "This zoo could be very nice but it's not kept up well, and the animal pens are small and very dirty. The grounds are also not kept up well, and the water ponds and small rivers are very dirty. The only way this place would be worth visiting is if you really need to see pandas",
          "I had to remember that zoo's in China are different then back home, once dealt with that enjoyed myself, pandas out and about eating, some lions and tigers wandering around. First impression as you walk in is excellent, bit slipperly when its raining, as they have used a lot of",
          "The pandas werent there when we first went in which was why we went there, but there was 2 when we left. The best part was actually the lion cubs there at the moment - 5 of them. So cute!! There were no hippos or elephants out even though there were enclosures for the animals",
          "The zoo in general is OK. The only thing that stands out in comparison with other Zoos is indeed the Pandas. Having said that, one thing really annoyed me and my wife, which motivated me to write this review. For god sake, if one cannot educate people to behave properly, the",
          "It was incredible. Initially we were a touch disappointed when we got to the panda exhibit as the first exhibit was of an empty pen with a sign saying that this was Ling Ling's pen and he moved in 2003. The second was a similar story but Yum Cha or Dim Sum or something had moved",
          "Not being a 'zoo' person, the main attraction were the Pandas and they did not disappoint. It was a public holiday, very hot and very crowded so it was a little difficult to appreciate the Pandas because of the jostling for position to take photos and observe the antics of these",
          "We were with an organised tour, so had limited time at the zoo, so headed straight for the pandas. Managed to get there when they were all out, eating huge quantities of bamboo. The pandas are all in large enclosures, with plenty of room for them to exercise (though they didn't",
          "I did go there by myself and could spend how much time as needed for strolling around. I would say the park were better than expected except the Bird and Kids area. But the main attraction is the Pandas and there comes tourist groups all the time. But let them leave and you will",
          "We had only a short time in Chingqing on our way to a cruise on the Yangtze river, but we really wanted to see Pandas while in China. Well, we were not disappointed ! we saw a bunch of them, displayed in a large habitat (as opposed to some of the less 'famous' animals that were",
          "While we were with an organized tour, we had little time. Our destination was the Panda exhibit. It was morning and there were few people at the zoo. The pandas didn't disappoint. 3 Pandas strutted their stuff..one climbing some small stairs in the middle of the arena putting on",
          "We visited the zoo solely to see the pandas. I must admit, I had concerns that I might be disappointed by the standards of care and presentation. I am pleased to report that I was very impressed by the quality of the grounds with its beautiful planting and statuary . The",
          "A beautiful zoo. As all of the sites we visited in China, this was very clean-no litter. Also very crowded. Excellent habitats for animals and the Pandas put on quite. Show. However be sure to go early while it is still cool enough for them to be out and active.",
          "We went there because a colleague really wanted to see pandas. We saw the back of one sleeping in a cage... and that's all there was. To be fair we were in CQ in the summer (very hot) and I assume those poor furry animals do suffer from the heat.",
          "Pandas are some of the most adorable animals, and there are very few zoos where you can see them, so this is probably the main reason people go here. Well, the pandas are there, there are a lot of them and they are cute and adorable indeed. However, there are more things to",
          "With Viking we did a short stop here to see the pandas. It was quite nice as the zoo had not yet opened so we enjoyed an intimate experience with the waking pandas. They were eating and scratching and otherwise entertaining and we had no crowds to battle for a look. The park",
          "We stopped here to visit the Giant Panda and the little Red Panda. Zoo layout was quite nice and very clean. Our visit was only hampered by the excessive heat (almost 100 degrees F), but our big Panda (You You) was in the shade eating his bamboo til his hearts content. Glad",
          "Can't get enough of pandas. Their demeanor is slow and deliberate, yet playful. Seems like these gentle creatures are playing up to the cameras. We were lucky to see them awake and hungry. Unique to see multiple pandas, rather than one or two. The other animals appear to",
          "Chongqing zoo is very old, a lot of the animals have only small areas to live in, but they seem well looked after. The pandas have quite a good area, they would be the zoos biggest attraction and one of the main things people come to China for. We arrived in the morning, which",
          "Chongqing has a population of 33 million, larger than Canada. It is mile after mile of high rise apartments. In the center of the city is a delightful zoo that attracts tai chi aficionados, grandparents and their grandchildren (mostly boys). It also has a wonderful and",
          "This was a stop on our itinerary while waiting to board a ship for a cruise on the Yangtze River. We only went to see the Pandas, and that is probably a good thing as it was getting warm and this was April. I understand Chongqing gets quite hot in the summer and can't imagine",
          "This is a zoo ,, but not so many an\u00edmals. Feels like it was almost empty with animals,,Clean everywhere, and nothing fanzy at all, doesnt look like a zoo something missing.. it is a good Place to visit if you like to have a day of the city Life, even if this is in the middle",
          "This is a zoo typical of what I have experienced in North America in the 70's and 80's. It is not a nature reserve or safari. On the other hand, is a place to bring children to see a lot of live animals, they will not see otherwise. From the elephants, giraffes, hippos,",
          "A good place to visit but for the visitors. It seems that \"Don't feed or tease the animals\" to the Chinese means \"Throw as many oranges and crisps to the monkeys and birds and shout as loud as you can and bang the cage glass with anything you have available to wake the pandas.\"",
          "If you want Pandas, this is the place to go. I have seen pandas before at the Berlin Zoo. But here, thay have a lot of them, we even got a glimpse of a baby!",

          "If you really want to see the Pandas, this is the place. Their enclosures are meant to mimic the wild. They do look and act like big teddy bears, but I wouldn't want one angry at me. They seemed to be fairly sociable and like the human attention. The Siberian tigers are",
          "I went there on a friday and it was quite a few visitors. I walked around for about 3 hours and the best part was the Pandas. The only thing I missed was that the animal training show was closed this day.",
          "Nice to see the Pandas but this zoo does not deserve to be on anyone's agenda. The animals are kept in deplorable conditions, some show great neglect, some in dark cages and the facilities are disgusting as well. This facility needs upgrading or close it down.",
          "Lovely to see the Pandas , conditions they live in not brilliant but fairly clean. However the facilities for tourists not good -never seen such disgusting ladies toilets -not able to use them as so gross !!!!!!!!!!!!",

          "This zoo is famous for Panda.But you must choose suitale time to watch panda.Normally Panda will have some activities outside in the moring.it is better to visit there between 9:00-11:00am. Of course,there are many other animals.it is good place for children.",
          "They have Pandas. You knew that already. That's why you're going to visit. They have other stuff too. But they do have Pandas. They can be relied upon to come out early morning and late afternoon for feeding. So they are good times to visit. Say by half past nine. (Assuming you",

          "it is located in Yangjiaping District, but i heard another one located in Yongchuan District. This zoo is not very big but it is good for kids. That's why i write here for parents. If you travel with your kids of just working in Chongqing, this destination is worthy to go/",
          "Although not a great fan of Zoo's I would suggest that you should visit this zoo. The Tigers and surroundings do not look too stressed by the tourists. Take a walk around and form your own opinion though.",
          "This is one of the better zoos I have been to. It is lush with plants, bamboo, cherry trees, etc. It is located near the Line 2 Monorail in Chongqing, and easy to get to. Go on a weekday to avoid the crowds. The Lesser Pandas are probably the best exhibit!",
          "My husband and I visited here beginning of June 2012, only to see the giant pandas. We did not even go to the rest of the zoo because it was too crowded, but it did not matter ... I saw what I came to see! The pandas are lovely and look really happy in their surroundings. I",

Stilwell, the Allied Chief of Staff in the China Theater during World War II.

He arrived in Chongqing on March 4, 1942.  Stilwell was in charge of the United States' Lend-Lease policy with Chinese forces and had an acrimonious relationship with Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek, who he derisively called \"Peanut.\"\nHis low regard for Chiang, and positive words towards the Communist forces, contributed to his high standing in the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n== Description ==\nLocated in Stilwell's former residence and headquarters, the museum comprises a three-storied house furnished in 1940s style. In the courtyard there is an engraving of a speech by American President Franklin D. Roosevelt.The building opened as a museum in 1994 and is run by the Chongqing Municipal Government. Financial support for the Museum is provided by the Joseph W. Stilwell Institute Foundation Ltd. a US tax-exempt foundation.\nThe Museum was renovated and reopened in March 2003. The renovation was funded by the Freeman Foundation in Vermont, USA.

It became a national 4A tourist site in 2002 then in June 2006 part of the South China Karst UNESCO World Heritage Site ; the only cave in China on the UNESCO list.In 1994, 1996 and 2001, cave experts from countries including China, the UK, USA, Ireland and Australia undertook comprehensive explorations of the cave.\n\n\n== Description ==\nFurong Cave has a total length of 2,846 m (9,337 ft) and a width varying from 30 m (98 ft)\u201350 m (160 ft). Inside, the cave is divided into three sections, with the first featuring colorful subterranean features. The remaining two areas  focus on the science of cave formation. There are more than 30 features inside the cave including the 15.76 m (51.7 ft), 21.04 m (69.0 ft) stone waterfall (\u5de8\u578b\u77f3) at the foot of which coral-like projections extend to 120 cm (47 in).In the vicinity of the cave spread over a total area of around 20 km2 (7.7 sq mi), there are more than 50 vertical shafts with a depth of over 100 m (330 ft). including the 920 m (3,020 ft) deep Steam Shaft (\u6c7d\u5751\u6d1e), the deepest in Asia.Formed during the Cambrian/Ordovician Periods some 500 million years ago, the cave features numerous rarely found speleothems including coral and dog-tooth like crystalline calcite flowers as well as a variety of helictites, and crystalline gypsum flowers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nXueyu Cave\nThree Natural Bridges\nSouth China Karst\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in English)\u2014China Radio International: \"Furong Cave, Chongqing\"\nCam111.com: Furong Cave \u2014 photos gallery",

        "wiki": "Chongqing (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0o\u014b\u02e8\u02e9t\u0255\u02b0in\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u028a\u030c\u014b.t\u0255\u02b0\u00ee\u014b] (listen), UK: , US: ,), alternately romanized as Chungking, is a megacity in southwest China. Administratively, it is one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of central government of the People's Republic of China (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), and the only such municipality located far away from the coast. The municipality of Chongqing, which is around the size of Austria, includes the city of Chongqing and various non-connected cities. As the Chongqing municipality government directly administers the city of Chongqing, as well as rural counties, and other cities not connected to the city of Chongqing, Chongqing municipality can technically claim to be the largest city proper in the world, even though this is due to a classification technicality and not because it is actually the world's largest urban area.\nChongqing was a municipality during the Republic of China (ROC) administration, within the Sichuan Province. It served as its wartime capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), being one of the world's anti-fascist command centers. The current municipality was separated from Sichuan province on 14 March 1997 to help develop the central and western parts of China. The Chongqing administrative municipality has a population of over 30 million. The city of Chongqing, comprising 9 urban and suburban districts, has a population of 8,518,000 as of 2016. According to the 2010 census, Chongqing is the most populous Chinese municipality, and also the largest direct-controlled municipality in China, containing 26 districts, eight counties, and four autonomous counties.\nThe official abbreviation of the city, \"Y\u00fa\" (\u6e1d), was approved by the State Council on 18 April 1997. This abbreviation is derived from the old name of a part of the Jialing River that runs through Chongqing and feeds into the Yangtze River.\nChongqing has a significant history and culture. Being one of China's National Central Cities, it serves as the economic centre of the Sichuan Basin and the upstream Yangtze. It is a major manufacturing centre and transportation hub; a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit described it as one of China's \"13 emerging megalopolises\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nTradition associates Chongqing with the State of Ba.\nThis new capital was first named Jiangzhou (\u6c5f\u5dde).\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\nJiangzhou subsequently remained under Qin Shi Huang's rule during the Qin dynasty, the successor of the Qin State, and under the control of Han dynasty emperors.\nJiangzhou was subsequently renamed during the Northern and Southern dynasties to Chu Prefecture (\u695a\u5dde), then in 581 AD (Sui dynasty) to Yu Prefecture (\u6e1d\u5dde), and later in 1102 during Northern Song to Gong Prefecture (\u606d\u5dde). The name Yu however survives to this day as an abbreviation for Chongqing, and the city centre where the old town stood is also called Yuzhong (\u6e1d\u4e2d, Central Yu). It received its current name in 1189, after Prince Zhao Dun of the Southern Song dynasty described his crowning as king and then Emperor Guangzong as a \"double celebration\" (simplified Chinese: \u53cc\u91cd\u559c\u5e86; traditional Chinese: \u96d9\u91cd\u559c\u6176; pinyin: shu\u0101ngch\u00f3ng x\u01d0q\u00ecng, or chongqing in short). In his honour, Yu Prefecture was therefore converted to Chongqing Fu, marking the occasion of his enthronement.\nIn 1362, (Yuan dynasty), Ming Yuzhen, a peasant rebel leader, established the Daxia Kingdom (\u5927\u590f) at Chongqing for a short time. In 1621 (Ming dynasty), another short-lived kingdom of Daliang (\u5927\u6881) was established by She Chongming (\u5962\u5d07\u660e) with Chongqing as its capital. In 1644, after the fall of the Ming dynasty to a rebel army, Chongqing, together with the rest of Sichuan, was captured by Zhang Xianzhong, who was said to have massacred a large number of people in Sichuan and depopulated the province, in part by causing many people to flee to safety elsewhere. The Manchus later conquered the province, and during the Qing dynasty, immigration to Chongqing and Sichuan took place with the support of the Qing emperor.In 1890, the British Consulate General was opened in Chongqing. The following year, the city became the first inland commerce port open to foreigners. The French, German, US and Japanese consulates were opened in Chongqing in 1896\u20131904.\n\n\n=== Provisional capital of the Republic of China ===\n\nDuring and after the Second Sino-Japanese War, from Nov 1937 to May 1946, it was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's provisional capital. Indeed, after the General and remaining army had lived there for a time following their retreat in 1938 from the previous capital of Wuhan, it was formally declared the second capital city (pei du) on 6 September 1940. After Britain, the United States, and other Allies entered the war in Asia in December 1941, one of the Allies' deputy commanders of operations in South East Asia (South East Asia Command SEAC), Joseph Stilwell, was based in the city. This made it a city of world importance in the fight against Axis powers, together with London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. The city was also visited by Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of SEAC which was itself headquartered in Ceylon, modern day Sri Lanka. Chiang Kai Shek as Supreme Commander in China worked closely with Stilwell. From 1938 to 1943, the city suffered from continuous terror bombing by the Japanese air force. Lives were saved by the air-raid shelters which took the advantage of the mountainous terrain. Chongqing was acclaimed to be the \u201cCity of Heroes\u201d due to the indomitable spirits of its people as well as their contributions and sacrifices during World War II. Many factories and universities were relocated from eastern China to Chongqing during the war, transforming this city from inland port to a heavily industrialized city. In late November 1949, the Nationalist KMT government retreated from the city.\n\n\n=== Municipality status ===\n\nOn 14 March 1997, the Eighth National People's Congress decided to merge the Sub-provincial city with the neighbouring Fuling, Wanxian, and Qianjiang prefectures that it had governed on behalf of the province since September 1996. The resulting single division became Chongqing Municipality, containing 30,020,000 people in forty-three former counties (without intermediate political levels). The municipality became the spearhead of China's effort to develop its western regions and to coordinate the resettlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges Dam project. Its first official ceremony took place on 18 June 1997. On 8 February 2010, Chongqing became one of the four National Central/Core cities, the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. On 18 June 2010, Liangjiang New Area was established in Chongqing, which is the third State-level new areas at the time of its establishment.In August 2020 the city was hit by a large scale flood, the highest water level seen since the Cuntan hydrographic station was opened in 1939. This came after other smaller scale floods during the year. It is estimated the flood killed hundreds of people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography and topography ===\n\nChongqing is situated at the transitional area between the Tibetan Plateau and the plain on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the sub-tropical climate zone often swept by moist monsoons. It often rains at night in late spring and early summer, and thus the city is famous for its \"night rain in the Ba Mountains\", as described by poems throughout Chinese history including the famous Written on a Rainy Night-A Letter to the North by Li Shangyin. The municipality reaches a maximum width of 470 kilometres (290 mi) from east to west, and a maximum length of 450 km (280 mi) from north to south. It borders the following provinces: Hubei in the east, Hunan in the southeast, Guizhou in the south, Sichuan in the west and northwest, and Shaanxi to the north in its northeast corner.\n\nChongqing covers a large area crisscrossed by rivers and mountains. The Daba Mountains stand in the north, the Wu Mountains in the east, the Wuling Mountains in the southeast, and the Dalou Mountains in the south. The whole area slopes down from north and south towards the Yangtze River valley, with sharp rises and falls. The area is featured by a large geological massif, of mountains and hills, with large sloping areas at different heights. Typical karst landscape is common in this area, and stone forests, numerous collections of peaks, limestone caves and valleys can be found in many places. The Longshuixia Gap (\u9f99\u6c34\u5ce1\u5730\u7f1d), with its natural arch-bridges, has made the region a popular tourist attraction. The Yangtze River runs through the whole area from west to east, covering a course of 665 km (413 mi), cutting through the Wu Mountains at three places and forming the well-known Three Gorges: the Qutang, the Wuxia and the Xiling gorges. Coming from northwest and running through \"the Jialing Lesser Three Gorges\" of Libi, Wentang and Guanyin, the Jialing River joins the Yangtze in Chongqing.\n\nThe central urban area of Chongqing, or Chongqing proper, is a city of unique features. Built on mountains and partially surrounded by the Yangtze and Jialing rivers, it is known as a \"mountain city\" and a \"city on rivers\". The night scene of the city is very illuminated, with millions of lights and their reflection on the rivers. With its special topographical features, Chongqing has the unique scenery of mountains, rivers, forests, springs, waterfalls, gorges, and caves. Li Bai, a famous poet of the Tang dynasty, was inspired by the natural scenery and wrote this epigram.Specifically, the central urban area is located on a huge folding area. Yuzhong District, Nan'an District, Shapingba District and Jiangbei District are located right on a big syncline. And the \"Southern Mountain of Chongqing\" (Tongluo Mountain), along with the Zhongliang Mountain are two anticlines next to the syncline of downtown.Zhongliang Mountains (\u4e2d\u6881\u5c71) and Tongluo Mountains (\u94dc\u9523\u5c71) roughly forms the eastern and western boundaries of Chongqing's urban area. The highest point in downtown is the top of Eling Hill, which is a smaller syncline hill that keeps Yangtze River and Jialing River apart for some more kilometres. The elevation of Eling Hill is 379 metres (1,243 feet). The lowest point is Chaotian Gate, where the two rivers merge with each other. The altitude there is 160 metres (520 feet). The average height of the area is 259 metres (850 feet). However, there are several high mountains outside central Chongqing, such as the Wugong Ling Mountain, with the altitude of 1,709.4 metres (5,608 feet), in Jiangjin.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nChongqing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa), bordering on a monsoonal humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and for most of the year experiences very high relative humidity, with all months above 75%. Known as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" of the Yangtze river, along with Wuhan and Nanjing, its summers are long and among the hottest and most humid in China, with highs of 33 to 34 \u00b0C (91 to 93 \u00b0F) in July and August in the urban area. Winters are short and somewhat mild, but damp and overcast. The city's location in the Sichuan Basin causes it to have one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, at only 1,055 hours, lower than much of Northern Europe; the monthly percent possible sunshine in the city proper ranges from a mere 8% in December and January to 48% in August. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.8 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 15 December 1975 (unofficial record of \u22122.5 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) was set on 8 February 1943) to 43.0 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) on 15 August 2006 (unofficial record of 44.0 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F) was set on 8 and 9 August 1933).Chongqing, with over 100 days of fog per year, is known as the \"Fog City\" (\u96fe\u90fd), like San Francisco, and a thick layer of fog enshrouds it for 68 days per year during the spring and autumn. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, this special weather possibly played a role in protecting the city from being overrun by the Imperial Japanese Army.\nAs exemplified by Youyang County below, conditions are often cooler in the southeast part of the municipality due to the higher elevations there.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nChongqing has been, since 1997, a direct-controlled municipality in the Chinese administrative structure, making it a provincial-level division with commensurate political importance. The municipality's top leader is the secretary of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China (\"party chief\"), which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, the country's second highest governing council. Under the Soviet-inspired nomenklatura system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the Communist Party, and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include He Guoqiang, Wang Yang, Bo Xilai, Zhang Dejiang, and Sun Zhengcai, the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal party standing committee, the de facto top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.\nThe municipal People's Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor, who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.The municipality also has a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (zhengxie) meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The zhengxie is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.\n\n\n=== Military ===\nChongqing was the wartime capital of China during the Second Sino-Japanese war (i.e., World War II), and from 1938 to 1946, the seat of administration for the Republic of China's government before its departure to Nanjing and then Taiwan. After the eventual defeat at the Battle of Wuhan General Chiang-Kai Shek and the army were forced to use it as base of resistance from 1938 onwards. It also contains a military museum named after the Chinese Korean War hero Qiu Shaoyun.Chongqing used to be the headquarters of the 13th Group Army of the People's Liberation Army, one of the two group armies that formerly comprised the Chengdu Military Region, which in 2016 was re-organized into the Western Theater Command.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nChongqing is the largest of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China. The municipality is divided into 38 subdivisions (3 were abolished in 1997, and Wansheng and Shuangqiao districts were abolished in October 2011), consisting of 26 districts, 8 counties, and 4 autonomous counties. The boundaries of Chongqing municipality reach much farther into the city's hinterland than the boundaries of the other three provincial level municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and much of its administrative area, which spans over 80,000 square kilometres (30,900 sq mi), is rural. At the end of year 2017, the total population is 30.75 million.[1]\n\n\n==== Urban areas ====\n\na Indicates with which district the division was associated below prior to the merging of Chongqing, Fuling, Wanxian (now Wanzhou) and Qianjiang in 1997.\n\n\n==== Central Chongqing ====\n\nThe main urban area of Chongqing city (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e3b\u57ce\u533a) spans approximately 5,473 square kilometres (2,113 square miles), and includes the following nine districts:\nYuzhong District (\u6e1d\u4e2d\u533a, or \"Central Chongqing District\"), the central and most densely populated district, where government and international business offices and the city's best shopping are located in the district's Jeifangbei CBD area. Yuzhong is located on the peninsula surrounded by Eling Hill, Yangtze River and Jialing River.\nJiangbei District (\u6c5f\u5317\u533a, or \"River North District\"), located to the north of Jialing River.\nShapingba District (\u6c99\u576a\u575d\u533a), roughly located between Jialing River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nJiulongpo District (\u4e5d\u9f99\u5761\u533a), roughly located between Yangtze River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nNan'an District (\u5357\u5cb8\u533a, or \"Southern Bank District\"), located on the south side of Yangtze River.\nDadukou District (\u5927\u6e21\u53e3\u533a)\nBanan District (\u5df4\u5357\u533a, or \"Southern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Ba County, and changed to the current name in 1994. Its northern area merged into Chongqing, and its capital town Yudong is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nYubei District (\u6e1d\u5317\u533a, or \"Northern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Jiangbei County, and changed into the current name in 1994. Its southern area merged into Chongqing, and the capital town Lianglu Town is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nBeibei District (\u5317\u789a\u533a), a satellite city northwest of Chongqing.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAccording to a July 2010 article from the official Xinhua news agency, the municipality has a population of 32.8 million, including 23.3 million farmers. Among them, 8.4 million farmers have become migrant workers, including 3.9 million working and living in urban areas of Chongqing.\nThe metropolitan area encompassing the central urban area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 17 million.This would mean that the locally registered farmers who work in other jurisdictions number 4.5 million, reducing the local, year-round population of Chongqing in 2010 to 28.3 million, plus those who are registered in other jurisdictions but live and work in Chongqing. According to China's 2005 statistical yearbook, of a total population of 30.55 million, those with residence registered in other jurisdictions but residing in the Chongqing enumeration area numbered 1.4 million, including 46,000 who resided in Chongqing \"for less than half-year\". An additional 83,000 had registered in Chongqing, but not yet settled there.The 2005 statistical yearbook also lists 15.22 million (49.82%) males and 15.33 million (50.18%) females.In terms of age distribution in 2004, of the 30.55 million total population, 6.4 million (20.88%) were age 0\u201314, 20.7 million (67.69%) were 15\u201364, and 3.5 million (11.46%) were 65 and over.Of a total 10,470,000 households (2004), 1,360,000 consisted of one person, 2,940,000 two-person, 3,190,000 three-person, 1,790,000 four-person, 783,000 five-person, 270,000 six-person, 89,000 seven-person, 28,000 eight-person, 6,000 nine-person, and 10,000 households of 10 or more persons per household.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe predominant religions in Chongqing are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 26.63% of the population believes and is involved in cults of ancestors, while 1.05% of the population identifies as Christian.The reports didn't give figures for other types of religion; 72.32% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects.\n\n\n== Crime ==\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the city became notorious for organised crime and corruption. Gangsters oversaw businesses involving billions of yuan and the corruption reached into the law-enforcement and justice systems. In 2009, city authorities under the auspices of municipal Communist Party secretary Bo Xilai undertook a large-scale crackdown, arresting 4,893 suspected gangsters, \"outlaws\" and corrupt cadres, leading to optimism that the period of gangsterism was over. However, local media later highlighted the apparent reliance by the authorities on torture to extract confessions upon which convictions were based. In December 2009, one defence lawyer was controversially arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison for \"coaching his client to make false claims of torture\" and in July 2010, another lawyer released videotapes of his client describing the torture in detail. In 2014, four policemen involved in the interrogation were charged with the practice of \"opposed illegal interrogation techniques\", considered by observers to be torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nChongqing was separated from Sichuan province and made into a municipality in its own right in 14 March 1997 in order to accelerate its development and subsequently China's relatively poorer western areas (see China Western Development strategy). An important industrial area in western China, Chongqing is also rapidly urbanising. For instance, statistics suggest that new construction added approximately 137,000 square metres (1,470,000 square feet) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. In addition, more than 1,300 people moved into the city daily, adding almost 100 million yuan (US$15 million) to the local economy.\nTraditionally, due to its geographical remoteness, Chongqing and neighbouring Sichuan have been important military bases in weapons research and development. Chongqing's industries have now diversified but unlike eastern China, its export sector is small due to its inland location. Instead, factories producing local-oriented consumer goods such as processed food, cars, chemicals, textiles, machinery, sports equipment and electronics  are common.\nChongqing is China's third largest centre for motor vehicle production and the largest for motorcycles. In 2007, it had an annual output capacity of 1 million cars and 8.6 million motorcycles. Leading makers of cars and motor bikes includes China's fourth biggest automaker; Changan Automotive Corp and Lifan Hongda Enterprise, as well as Ford Motor Company, with the US car giant having 3 plants in Chongqing.  The municipality is also one of the nine largest iron and steel centres in China and one of the three major aluminium producers. Important manufacturers include Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and South West Aluminium which is Asia's largest aluminium plant. Agriculture remains significant. Rice and fruits, especially oranges, are the area's main produce. Natural resources are also abundant with large deposits of coal, natural gas, and more than 40 kinds of minerals such as strontium and manganese. Coal reserves \u2248 4.8 billion tonnes. Chuandong Natural Gas Field is China's largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270 billion m3 \u2013 more than 1/5 of China's total. Has China's largest reserve of strontium (China has the world's 2nd biggest strontium deposit). Manganese is mined in the Xiushan area. although the mining sector has been criticised for being wasteful, heavily polluting and unsafe. Chongqing is also planned to be the site of a 10 million ton capacity refinery operated by CNPC (parent company of PetroChina) to process imported crude oil from the Sino-Burma pipelines. The pipeline itself, though not yet finished, will eventually run from Sittwe (in Myanmar's western coast) through Kunming in Yunnan before reaching Chongqing and it will provide China with fuels sourced from Myanmar, the Middle East and Africa. Recently, there has been a drive to move up the value chain by shifting towards high technology and knowledge intensive industries resulting in new development zones such as the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ). Chongqing's local government is hoping through the promotion of favorable economic policies for the electronics and information technology sectors, that it can create a 400 billion RMB high technology manufacturing hub which will surpass its car industry and account for 25% of its exports.The city has also invested heavily in infrastructure to attract investment. The network of roads and railways connecting Chongqing to the rest of China has been expanded and upgraded reducing logistical costs. Furthermore, the nearby Three Gorges Dam which is the world's largest, supplies Chongqing with power and allows oceangoing ships to reach Chongqing's Yangtze River port. These infrastructure improvements have led to the arrivals of numerous foreign direct investors (FDI) in industries ranging from car to finance and retailing; such as Ford, Mazda, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, ANZ Bank, Scotiabank, Wal-Mart, Metro AG and Carrefour, among other multinational corporations.\nChongqing's nominal GDP in 2011 reached 1001.1 billion yuan (US$158.9 billion) while registering an annual growth of 16.4%. However, its overall economic performance is still lagging behind eastern coastal cities such as Shanghai. For instance, its per capita GDP was 22,909 yuan (US$3,301) which is below the national average. Nevertheless, there is a massive government support to transform Chongqing into the region's economic, trade, and financial centre and use the municipality as a platform to open up the country's western interior to further development.Chongqing has been identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei, Anshan, Maanshan, Pingdingshan and Shenyang), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China.\n\n\n=== Economic and technological development zones ===\nThe city includes a number of economic and technological development zones:\n\nChongqing Chemical Industrial Park\nChongqing Economic & Technological Development Zone\nChongqing Hi-Tech Industry Development Zone\nChongqing New North Zone (CNNZ)\nChongqing Export Processing Zone\nJianqiao Industrial Park (located in Dadukou District)\nLiangjiang New Area\nLiangjiang Cloud Computing Center (the largest of its kind in China)Chongqing itself is part of the West Triangle Economic Zone, along with Chengdu and Xi'an.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nChongqing University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University of Political Science and Law (\u897f\u5357\u653f\u6cd5\u5927\u5b66)\nThird Military Medical University (\u7b2c\u4e09\u519b\u533b\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (\u91cd\u5e86\u90ae\u7535\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u7406\u5de5\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Jiaotong University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Medical University (\u91cd\u5e86\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Normal University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e08\u8303\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Technology and Business University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5de5\u5546\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Three Gorges University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e09\u5ce1\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing Telecommunication Institute (\u91cd\u5e86\u901a\u8baf\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Science and Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u79d1\u6280\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan Fine Arts Institute (\u56db\u5ddd\u7f8e\u672f\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan International Studies University (\u56db\u5ddd\u5916\u56fd\u8bed\u5927\u5b66)\nUniversity of Logistics (\u540e\u52e4\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Arts and Science (\u91cd\u5e86\u6587\u7406\u5b66\u9662)\nYangtze Normal University (\u957f\u6c5f\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Education (\u91cd\u5e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\n\n\n=== Notable high schools ===\nFuling Experimental High School (\u6daa\u9675\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.1 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u4e2d)\nChongqing Nankai Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5357\u5f00\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.8 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u516b\u4e2d)\nBashu Secondary School (\u5df4\u8700\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Railway High School (\u91cd\u5e86\u94c1\u8def\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Yucai Secondary School (\u80b2\u624d\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Foreign Language School (The High School Affiliated to Sichuan International Studies University \u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u5916)\nVerakin High School of Chongqing (The 2nd Chongqing Foreign Language School, \u91cd\u5e86\u4e8c\u5916)\nChongqing Qiujing High School (\u6c42\u7cbe\u4e2d\u5b66)\nHigh School Affiliated to Southwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u4e2d)\nChongqing NO.18 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5341\u516b\u4e2d)\n\n\n=== International schools ===\nYew Chung International School of Chongqing (\u91cd\u5e86\u8000\u4e2d\u56fd\u9645\u5b66\u6821)\nKL International School of Chongqing Bashu (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e02\u8bfa\u6797\u5df4\u8700\u5916\u7c4d\u4eba\u5458\u5b50\u5973\u5b66\u6821)\n\n\n== Transport ==\nSince its elevation to national-level municipality in 1997, the city has dramatically expanded its transportation infrastructure. With the construction of railways and expressways to the east and southeast, Chongqing is a major transportation hub in southwestern China.\nAs of October 2014, the municipality had 31 bridges across the Yangtze River including over a dozen in the city's urban core. Aside from the city's first two Yangtze River bridges, which were built, respectively, in 1960 and 1977, all of the other bridges were completed since 1995.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nPublic transport in Chongqing consists of metro, intercity railway, a ubiquitous bus system and the world's largest monorail network.\nAccording to the Chongqing Municipal Government's ambitious plan in May 2007, Chongqing is investing 150 billion RMB over 13 years to finish a system that combines underground metro lines with heavy monorail (called 'light rail' in China).\nAs of 2017, four metro lines, the 14 km (8.7 mi) long CRT Line 1, a conventional subway, and the 19 km (12 mi) long heavy monorail CRT Line 2 (through Phase II), Line 3, a heavy monorail connects the airport and the southern part of downtown., Line 6, runs between Beibei, a commuter city in the far north to the centre. Line 5 opened in late 2017.\nBy 2020 CRT will consist of 6 straight lines and 1 circular line resulting in 363.5 km (225.9 mi) of road and railway to the existing transportation infrastructure and 93 new train stations will be added to the 111 stations that are already in place.By 2050, Chongqing will have as many as 18 lines planned to be in operation.\n\n\n==== Aerial tramway ====\n\nChongqing is the only Chinese city that keeps public aerial tramways. Historically there were three aerial tramways in Chongqing: the Yangtze River Tramway, the Jialing River Tramway and the South Mountain Tramway. Currently, only Yangtze River Tramway is still operating and it is Class 4A Tourist Attractions in China. This tramway is 1,160 metres (3,810 feet) long, connecting the southern and northern banks of Yangtze River. The daily passenger volume is about 10,000.\n\n\n=== River port ===\n\nChongqing is one of the most important inland ports in China. There are numerous luxury cruise ships that terminate at Chongqing, cruising downstream along the Yangtze River to Yichang, Wuhan, Nanjing or even Shanghai. In the recent past, this provided virtually the only transportation option along the river. However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several port handling facilities exist throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nMajor train stations in Chongqing:\n\nChongqing railway station in Yuzhong, accessible via Metro Lines 1 & 3 (Lianglukou Metro station), is the city's oldest railway station and located near the city centre. The station handles mostly long-distance trains. There are plans for a major renovation and overhaul of this station, thus many services have been transferred to Chongqing North Railway Station.\nChongqing North railway station is a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to Chengdu, Beijing and other cities. It was completed in 2006 and is connected to Metro Line.\nChongqing West railway station is in Shapingba, a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to many cities. It is completed in 2018.\nShapingba railway station is in Shapingba, near Shapingba CBD, accessible via Metro Line 1. It handles many local and regional train services. It is completed in 2018.Chongqing is a major freight destination for rail with continued development with improved handling facilities. Due to subsidies and incentives, the relocation and construction of many factories in Chongqing has seen a huge increase in rail traffic.\nChongqing is a major rail hub regionally.\n\nChengdu\u2013Chongqing railway to Chengdu\nSichuan-Guizhou railway to Guiyang\nXiangyang\u2013Chongqing railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Huaihua railway to Hunan\nChongqing-Suining railway (Sichuan province)\nChongqing-Lichuan railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Lanzhou railway (Gansu) railway\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nTraditionally, the road network in Chongqing has been narrow, winding and limited to smaller vehicles because of the natural terrain, large rivers and the huge population demands on the area, especially in the Yuzhong District. In other places, such as Jiangbei, large areas of homes and buildings have recently been cleared to improve the road network and create better urban planning. This has seen many tunnels and large bridges needing to be built across the city. Construction of many expressways have connected Chongqing to neighbouring provinces. Several ring roads have also been constructed. The natural mountainous terrain that Chongqing is built on makes many road projects difficult to construct, including for example some of the world's highest road bridges.Unlike many other Chinese cities, it is rare for motorbikes, electric scooters or bicycles to be seen on Chongqing Roads. This is due to the extremely hilly and mountainous nature of Chongqing's roads and streets. However, despite this, Chongqing is a large manufacturing centre for these types of vehicles.\nChongqing-Chengdu Expressway\nChongqing-Chengdu 2nd Expressway (under construction)\nChongqing-Wanzhou-Yichang Highway (Wanzhou-Yichang section under construction)\nChongqing-Guiyang Highway\nChongqing-Changsha Expressway (Xiushan-Changsha section under construction)\nChongqing-Dazhou-Xi'a Highway (Dazhou-Xi'an section under construction)\nChongqing-Suining Expressway\nChongqing-Nanchong Expressway\nChina National Highway 210\nChina National Highway 212\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nWith so many bridges crossing the Yangtze and Jialing rivers in the urban area, Chongqing is sometimes known as the 'Bridge Capital of China'. The first important bridge in urban Chongqing was the Niujiaotuo Jialing River Bridge, built in 1958. The first bridge over the Yangtze river was the Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge (or Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge) built in 1977.\nAs of 2014, within the area of the 9 districts, there were 20 bridges on the Yangtze river and 28 bridges on the Jialing river. The bridges in Chongqing exhibit a variety of shapes and structures, making Chongqing a showcase for bridge design.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe major airport of Chongqing is Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport (IATA: CKG, ICAO: ZUCK). It is located in Yubei District. The airport offers a growing network of direct flights to China, South East Asia, the Middle East, North America, and Europe. It is located 21 km (13 mi) north of the city-centre of Chongqing and serves as an important aviation hub for south-western China. Jiangbei airport is a hub for China Southern Airlines, Chongqing Airlines, Sichuan Airlines, China Express Airlines, Shandong Airlines and Hainan Airlines's new China West Air. Chongqing also is a focus city of Air China, therefore it is very well connected with Star Alliance and Skyteam's international network. The airport currently has three parallel runways in operation. It serves domestic routes to most other Chinese cities, as well as international routes to Auckland, New York City, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, Doha, Dubai, Seoul, Bangkok, Phuket, Osaka, Singapore, Chiang Mai, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Mal\u00e9, Bali, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Batam, Rome and Helsinki. As of 2018, Jiangbei Airport is the 9th busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic in mainland China.Currently, Jiangbei airport has three terminals. Chongqing Airport has metro access (CRT Line 3 and Line 10) to its central city, and two runways in normal use.There are two other airports in Chongqing Municipality: Qianjiang Wulingshan Airport (IATA: JIQ, ICAO: ZUQJ) and Wanzhou Wuqiao Airport (IATA: WXN, ICAO: ZUWX). They are both class 4C airports and serve passenger flights to some domestic destinations including Beijing, Shanghai and Kunming. Two more airports are being constructed soon: Wulong Xiann\u00fcshan Airport and Wushan Shenn\u00fcfeng Airport.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe language native to Chongqing is Southwestern Mandarin. More precisely, the great majority of the municipality, save for Xiushan, speak Sichuanese, including the primary Chengdu-Chongqing dialect and Minjiang dialect spoken in Jiangjin and Qijiang. There are also a few speakers of Xiang and Hakka in the municipality, due to the great immigration wave to the Sichuan region (\u6e56\u5e7f\u586b\u56db\u5ddd) during the Ming and Qing dynasties. In addition, in parts of southeastern Chongqing, the Miao and Tujia languages are also used by some Miao and Tujia people.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAs the provisional Capital of China for almost ten years (1937 to 1945), the city was also known as one of the three headquarters of the Allies during World War II, as well as being a strategic center of many other wars throughout China's history. Chongqing has many historic war-time buildings or sites, some of which have since been destroyed. These sites include the People's Liberation Monument, located in the center of Chongqing city. It used to be the highest building in the area, but is now surrounded and dwarfed by numerous shopping centres.

        "wiki": "Luohan Temple (simplified Chinese: \u7f57\u6c49\u5bfa; traditional Chinese: \u7f85\u6f22\u5bfa; pinyin: Lu\u00f3h\u00e0n S\u00ec; lit.: 'Temple of Arhat') is a Buddhist temple located in Yuzhong District, Chongqing. It is the site of the Buddhist Association of Chongqing. The temple was used for Ning Hao's black comedy film Crazy Stone.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Song dynasty ===\nThis temple was built by a prominent monk Zuyue (\u7956\u6708) in the Zhiping period (1064\u20131067) of the Song dynasty (960\u20131276).  At that time it initially called \"Zhiping Temple\", which was named after the reign title of \"Zhiping\".\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty ===\nIn the Xuande period (1426\u20131435) of the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), monk Xi'an (\u66e6\u5eb5) erected the dwellings, wing-rooms, and reception rooms.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nIn 1666, in the 5th year of Kangxi period in the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), governor-general Li Guoying (\u674e\u56fd\u82f1) renovated the temple. Then the temple was refurbished in 1753 during the reign of Qianlong Emperor. In 1885 in the Guangxu era, abbot Longfa (\u9686\u6cd5) supervised the construction of 500 statues of Arhat, the temple was renowned \"Luohan Temple\".\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nAfter the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, Shi Haiqing (\u91ca\u6d77\u6e05) added the Dharma Hall, Ordination Hall, Meditation Hall in the temple. The temple was burned out in one of the numerous air raids that targeted Chongqing during the Second Sino-Japanese War on May 4, 1939. Only the Shanmen and Thousand Buddha Rock survived. By 1947, under the leadership of Zongxian (\u5b97\u4ed9), the Mahavira Hall, Buddhist Texts Library, Arhat Hall were gradually rebuilt.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\nDuring the ten-year Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards had attacked the temple in 1966. The 500 statues of Arhat were smashed by them.After the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, according to the national policy of free religious belief, Luohan Temple was officially reopened to the public in 1984. The Chongqing Municipal Government appropriated a large sum of money for constructing the temple.\nLuohan Temple has been inscribed as a National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area by the State Council of China in 1983. In September 2006, the temple has been designated as a provincial key cultural unit by the Chongqing Municipal Government.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Mahavira Hall ===\nThe Mahavira Hall was built in 1947. In the middle of the hall placed the statue of Sakyamuni, at the back of Sakyamuni's statue are statues of the Three Sages of the West (\u897f\u65b9\u4e09\u5723), namely Guanyin, Amitabha and Mahasthamaprapta. The statues of Sixteen Arhats stand on both sides of the hall.\n\n\n=== Arhat Hall ===\nThe Arhat Hall was constructed in 1986, a total of 524 statues of Arhat are enshrined in the hall.\n\n\n== National Treasure ==\nThe temple is renowned for its cliff inscriptions. Over 400 statues of Buddha are carved with integrate structural and exquisite techniques, they were made in the Song dynasty.\n\n\n== Film ==\nLuohan Temple was used for location filming of the 2006 black comedy film Crazy Stone.\n\n\n== References ==",

Administratively, it is one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of central government of the People's Republic of China (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), and the only such municipality located far away from the coast. The municipality of Chongqing, which is around the size of Austria, includes the city of Chongqing and various non-connected cities. As the Chongqing municipality government directly administers the city of Chongqing, as well as rural counties, and other cities not connected to the city of Chongqing, Chongqing municipality can technically claim to be the largest city proper in the world, even though this is due to a classification technicality and not because it is actually the world's largest urban area.\nChongqing was a municipality during the Republic of China (ROC) administration, within the Sichuan Province. It served as its wartime capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), being one of the world's anti-fascist command centers. The current municipality was separated from Sichuan province on 14 March 1997 to help develop the central and western parts of China. The Chongqing administrative municipality has a population of over 30 million. The city of Chongqing, comprising 9 urban and suburban districts, has a population of 8,518,000 as of 2016. According to the 2010 census, Chongqing is the most populous Chinese municipality, and also the largest direct-controlled municipality in China, containing 26 districts, eight counties, and four autonomous counties.\nThe official abbreviation of the city, \"Y\u00fa\" (\u6e1d), was approved by the State Council on 18 April 1997. This abbreviation is derived from the old name of a part of the Jialing River that runs through Chongqing and feeds into the Yangtze River.\nChongqing has a significant history and culture. Being one of China's National Central Cities, it serves as the economic centre of the Sichuan Basin and the upstream Yangtze. It is a major manufacturing centre and transportation hub; a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit described it as one of China's \"13 emerging megalopolises\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nTradition associates Chongqing with the State of Ba.\nThis new capital was first named Jiangzhou (\u6c5f\u5dde).\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\nJiangzhou subsequently remained under Qin Shi Huang's rule during the Qin dynasty, the successor of the Qin State, and under the control of Han dynasty emperors.\nJiangzhou was subsequently renamed during the Northern and Southern dynasties to Chu Prefecture (\u695a\u5dde), then in 581 AD (Sui dynasty) to Yu Prefecture (\u6e1d\u5dde), and later in 1102 during Northern Song to Gong Prefecture (\u606d\u5dde). The name Yu however survives to this day as an abbreviation for Chongqing, and the city centre where the old town stood is also called Yuzhong (\u6e1d\u4e2d, Central Yu). It received its current name in 1189, after Prince Zhao Dun of the Southern Song dynasty described his crowning as king and then Emperor Guangzong as a \"double celebration\" (simplified Chinese: \u53cc\u91cd\u559c\u5e86; traditional Chinese: \u96d9\u91cd\u559c\u6176; pinyin: shu\u0101ngch\u00f3ng x\u01d0q\u00ecng, or chongqing in short). In his honour, Yu Prefecture was therefore converted to Chongqing Fu, marking the occasion of his enthronement.\nIn 1362, (Yuan dynasty), Ming Yuzhen, a peasant rebel leader, established the Daxia Kingdom (\u5927\u590f) at Chongqing for a short time. In 1621 (Ming dynasty), another short-lived kingdom of Daliang (\u5927\u6881) was established by She Chongming (\u5962\u5d07\u660e) with Chongqing as its capital. In 1644, after the fall of the Ming dynasty to a rebel army, Chongqing, together with the rest of Sichuan, was captured by Zhang Xianzhong, who was said to have massacred a large number of people in Sichuan and depopulated the province, in part by causing many people to flee to safety elsewhere. The Manchus later conquered the province, and during the Qing dynasty, immigration to Chongqing and Sichuan took place with the support of the Qing emperor.In 1890, the British Consulate General was opened in Chongqing. The following year, the city became the first inland commerce port open to foreigners. The French, German, US and Japanese consulates were opened in Chongqing in 1896\u20131904.\n\n\n=== Provisional capital of the Republic of China ===\n\nDuring and after the Second Sino-Japanese War, from Nov 1937 to May 1946, it was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's provisional capital. Indeed, after the General and remaining army had lived there for a time following their retreat in 1938 from the previous capital of Wuhan, it was formally declared the second capital city (pei du) on 6 September 1940. After Britain, the United States, and other Allies entered the war in Asia in December 1941, one of the Allies' deputy commanders of operations in South East Asia (South East Asia Command SEAC), Joseph Stilwell, was based in the city. This made it a city of world importance in the fight against Axis powers, together with London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. The city was also visited by Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of SEAC which was itself headquartered in Ceylon, modern day Sri Lanka. Chiang Kai Shek as Supreme Commander in China worked closely with Stilwell. From 1938 to 1943, the city suffered from continuous terror bombing by the Japanese air force. Lives were saved by the air-raid shelters which took the advantage of the mountainous terrain. Chongqing was acclaimed to be the \u201cCity of Heroes\u201d due to the indomitable spirits of its people as well as their contributions and sacrifices during World War II. Many factories and universities were relocated from eastern China to Chongqing during the war, transforming this city from inland port to a heavily industrialized city. In late November 1949, the Nationalist KMT government retreated from the city.\n\n\n=== Municipality status ===\n\nOn 14 March 1997, the Eighth National People's Congress decided to merge the Sub-provincial city with the neighbouring Fuling, Wanxian, and Qianjiang prefectures that it had governed on behalf of the province since September 1996. The resulting single division became Chongqing Municipality, containing 30,020,000 people in forty-three former counties (without intermediate political levels). The municipality became the spearhead of China's effort to develop its western regions and to coordinate the resettlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges Dam project. Its first official ceremony took place on 18 June 1997. On 8 February 2010, Chongqing became one of the four National Central/Core cities, the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. On 18 June 2010, Liangjiang New Area was established in Chongqing, which is the third State-level new areas at the time of its establishment.In August 2020 the city was hit by a large scale flood, the highest water level seen since the Cuntan hydrographic station was opened in 1939. This came after other smaller scale floods during the year. It is estimated the flood killed hundreds of people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography and topography ===\n\nChongqing is situated at the transitional area between the Tibetan Plateau and the plain on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the sub-tropical climate zone often swept by moist monsoons. It often rains at night in late spring and early summer, and thus the city is famous for its \"night rain in the Ba Mountains\", as described by poems throughout Chinese history including the famous Written on a Rainy Night-A Letter to the North by Li Shangyin. The municipality reaches a maximum width of 470 kilometres (290 mi) from east to west, and a maximum length of 450 km (280 mi) from north to south. It borders the following provinces: Hubei in the east, Hunan in the southeast, Guizhou in the south, Sichuan in the west and northwest, and Shaanxi to the north in its northeast corner.\n\nChongqing covers a large area crisscrossed by rivers and mountains. The Daba Mountains stand in the north, the Wu Mountains in the east, the Wuling Mountains in the southeast, and the Dalou Mountains in the south. The whole area slopes down from north and south towards the Yangtze River valley, with sharp rises and falls. The area is featured by a large geological massif, of mountains and hills, with large sloping areas at different heights. Typical karst landscape is common in this area, and stone forests, numerous collections of peaks, limestone caves and valleys can be found in many places. The Longshuixia Gap (\u9f99\u6c34\u5ce1\u5730\u7f1d), with its natural arch-bridges, has made the region a popular tourist attraction. The Yangtze River runs through the whole area from west to east, covering a course of 665 km (413 mi), cutting through the Wu Mountains at three places and forming the well-known Three Gorges: the Qutang, the Wuxia and the Xiling gorges. Coming from northwest and running through \"the Jialing Lesser Three Gorges\" of Libi, Wentang and Guanyin, the Jialing River joins the Yangtze in Chongqing.\n\nThe central urban area of Chongqing, or Chongqing proper, is a city of unique features. Built on mountains and partially surrounded by the Yangtze and Jialing rivers, it is known as a \"mountain city\" and a \"city on rivers\". The night scene of the city is very illuminated, with millions of lights and their reflection on the rivers. With its special topographical features, Chongqing has the unique scenery of mountains, rivers, forests, springs, waterfalls, gorges, and caves. Li Bai, a famous poet of the Tang dynasty, was inspired by the natural scenery and wrote this epigram.Specifically, the central urban area is located on a huge folding area. Yuzhong District, Nan'an District, Shapingba District and Jiangbei District are located right on a big syncline. And the \"Southern Mountain of Chongqing\" (Tongluo Mountain), along with the Zhongliang Mountain are two anticlines next to the syncline of downtown.Zhongliang Mountains (\u4e2d\u6881\u5c71) and Tongluo Mountains (\u94dc\u9523\u5c71) roughly forms the eastern and western boundaries of Chongqing's urban area. The highest point in downtown is the top of Eling Hill, which is a smaller syncline hill that keeps Yangtze River and Jialing River apart for some more kilometres. The elevation of Eling Hill is 379 metres (1,243 feet). The lowest point is Chaotian Gate, where the two rivers merge with each other. The altitude there is 160 metres (520 feet). The average height of the area is 259 metres (850 feet). However, there are several high mountains outside central Chongqing, such as the Wugong Ling Mountain, with the altitude of 1,709.4 metres (5,608 feet), in Jiangjin.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nChongqing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa), bordering on a monsoonal humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and for most of the year experiences very high relative humidity, with all months above 75%. Known as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" of the Yangtze river, along with Wuhan and Nanjing, its summers are long and among the hottest and most humid in China, with highs of 33 to 34 \u00b0C (91 to 93 \u00b0F) in July and August in the urban area. Winters are short and somewhat mild, but damp and overcast. The city's location in the Sichuan Basin causes it to have one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, at only 1,055 hours, lower than much of Northern Europe; the monthly percent possible sunshine in the city proper ranges from a mere 8% in December and January to 48% in August. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.8 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 15 December 1975 (unofficial record of \u22122.5 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) was set on 8 February 1943) to 43.0 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) on 15 August 2006 (unofficial record of 44.0 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F) was set on 8 and 9 August 1933).Chongqing, with over 100 days of fog per year, is known as the \"Fog City\" (\u96fe\u90fd), like San Francisco, and a thick layer of fog enshrouds it for 68 days per year during the spring and autumn. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, this special weather possibly played a role in protecting the city from being overrun by the Imperial Japanese Army.\nAs exemplified by Youyang County below, conditions are often cooler in the southeast part of the municipality due to the higher elevations there.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nChongqing has been, since 1997, a direct-controlled municipality in the Chinese administrative structure, making it a provincial-level division with commensurate political importance. The municipality's top leader is the secretary of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China (\"party chief\"), which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, the country's second highest governing council. Under the Soviet-inspired nomenklatura system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the Communist Party, and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include He Guoqiang, Wang Yang, Bo Xilai, Zhang Dejiang, and Sun Zhengcai, the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal party standing committee, the de facto top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.\nThe municipal People's Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor, who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.The municipality also has a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (zhengxie) meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The zhengxie is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.\n\n\n=== Military ===\nChongqing was the wartime capital of China during the Second Sino-Japanese war (i.e., World War II), and from 1938 to 1946, the seat of administration for the Republic of China's government before its departure to Nanjing and then Taiwan. After the eventual defeat at the Battle of Wuhan General Chiang-Kai Shek and the army were forced to use it as base of resistance from 1938 onwards. It also contains a military museum named after the Chinese Korean War hero Qiu Shaoyun.Chongqing used to be the headquarters of the 13th Group Army of the People's Liberation Army, one of the two group armies that formerly comprised the Chengdu Military Region, which in 2016 was re-organized into the Western Theater Command.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nChongqing is the largest of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China. The municipality is divided into 38 subdivisions (3 were abolished in 1997, and Wansheng and Shuangqiao districts were abolished in October 2011), consisting of 26 districts, 8 counties, and 4 autonomous counties. The boundaries of Chongqing municipality reach much farther into the city's hinterland than the boundaries of the other three provincial level municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and much of its administrative area, which spans over 80,000 square kilometres (30,900 sq mi), is rural. At the end of year 2017, the total population is 30.75 million.[1]\n\n\n==== Urban areas ====\n\na Indicates with which district the division was associated below prior to the merging of Chongqing, Fuling, Wanxian (now Wanzhou) and Qianjiang in 1997.\n\n\n==== Central Chongqing ====\n\nThe main urban area of Chongqing city (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e3b\u57ce\u533a) spans approximately 5,473 square kilometres (2,113 square miles), and includes the following nine districts:\nYuzhong District (\u6e1d\u4e2d\u533a, or \"Central Chongqing District\"), the central and most densely populated district, where government and international business offices and the city's best shopping are located in the district's Jeifangbei CBD area. Yuzhong is located on the peninsula surrounded by Eling Hill, Yangtze River and Jialing River.\nJiangbei District (\u6c5f\u5317\u533a, or \"River North District\"), located to the north of Jialing River.\nShapingba District (\u6c99\u576a\u575d\u533a), roughly located between Jialing River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nJiulongpo District (\u4e5d\u9f99\u5761\u533a), roughly located between Yangtze River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nNan'an District (\u5357\u5cb8\u533a, or \"Southern Bank District\"), located on the south side of Yangtze River.\nDadukou District (\u5927\u6e21\u53e3\u533a)\nBanan District (\u5df4\u5357\u533a, or \"Southern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Ba County, and changed to the current name in 1994. Its northern area merged into Chongqing, and its capital town Yudong is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nYubei District (\u6e1d\u5317\u533a, or \"Northern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Jiangbei County, and changed into the current name in 1994. Its southern area merged into Chongqing, and the capital town Lianglu Town is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nBeibei District (\u5317\u789a\u533a), a satellite city northwest of Chongqing.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAccording to a July 2010 article from the official Xinhua news agency, the municipality has a population of 32.8 million, including 23.3 million farmers. Among them, 8.4 million farmers have become migrant workers, including 3.9 million working and living in urban areas of Chongqing.\nThe metropolitan area encompassing the central urban area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 17 million.This would mean that the locally registered farmers who work in other jurisdictions number 4.5 million, reducing the local, year-round population of Chongqing in 2010 to 28.3 million, plus those who are registered in other jurisdictions but live and work in Chongqing. According to China's 2005 statistical yearbook, of a total population of 30.55 million, those with residence registered in other jurisdictions but residing in the Chongqing enumeration area numbered 1.4 million, including 46,000 who resided in Chongqing \"for less than half-year\". An additional 83,000 had registered in Chongqing, but not yet settled there.The 2005 statistical yearbook also lists 15.22 million (49.82%) males and 15.33 million (50.18%) females.In terms of age distribution in 2004, of the 30.55 million total population, 6.4 million (20.88%) were age 0\u201314, 20.7 million (67.69%) were 15\u201364, and 3.5 million (11.46%) were 65 and over.Of a total 10,470,000 households (2004), 1,360,000 consisted of one person, 2,940,000 two-person, 3,190,000 three-person, 1,790,000 four-person, 783,000 five-person, 270,000 six-person, 89,000 seven-person, 28,000 eight-person, 6,000 nine-person, and 10,000 households of 10 or more persons per household.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe predominant religions in Chongqing are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 26.63% of the population believes and is involved in cults of ancestors, while 1.05% of the population identifies as Christian.The reports didn't give figures for other types of religion; 72.32% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects.\n\n\n== Crime ==\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the city became notorious for organised crime and corruption. Gangsters oversaw businesses involving billions of yuan and the corruption reached into the law-enforcement and justice systems. In 2009, city authorities under the auspices of municipal Communist Party secretary Bo Xilai undertook a large-scale crackdown, arresting 4,893 suspected gangsters, \"outlaws\" and corrupt cadres, leading to optimism that the period of gangsterism was over. However, local media later highlighted the apparent reliance by the authorities on torture to extract confessions upon which convictions were based. In December 2009, one defence lawyer was controversially arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison for \"coaching his client to make false claims of torture\" and in July 2010, another lawyer released videotapes of his client describing the torture in detail. In 2014, four policemen involved in the interrogation were charged with the practice of \"opposed illegal interrogation techniques\", considered by observers to be torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nChongqing was separated from Sichuan province and made into a municipality in its own right in 14 March 1997 in order to accelerate its development and subsequently China's relatively poorer western areas (see China Western Development strategy). An important industrial area in western China, Chongqing is also rapidly urbanising. For instance, statistics suggest that new construction added approximately 137,000 square metres (1,470,000 square feet) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. In addition, more than 1,300 people moved into the city daily, adding almost 100 million yuan (US$15 million) to the local economy.\nTraditionally, due to its geographical remoteness, Chongqing and neighbouring Sichuan have been important military bases in weapons research and development. Chongqing's industries have now diversified but unlike eastern China, its export sector is small due to its inland location. Instead, factories producing local-oriented consumer goods such as processed food, cars, chemicals, textiles, machinery, sports equipment and electronics  are common.\nChongqing is China's third largest centre for motor vehicle production and the largest for motorcycles. In 2007, it had an annual output capacity of 1 million cars and 8.6 million motorcycles. Leading makers of cars and motor bikes includes China's fourth biggest automaker; Changan Automotive Corp and Lifan Hongda Enterprise, as well as Ford Motor Company, with the US car giant having 3 plants in Chongqing.  The municipality is also one of the nine largest iron and steel centres in China and one of the three major aluminium producers. Important manufacturers include Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and South West Aluminium which is Asia's largest aluminium plant. Agriculture remains significant. Rice and fruits, especially oranges, are the area's main produce. Natural resources are also abundant with large deposits of coal, natural gas, and more than 40 kinds of minerals such as strontium and manganese. Coal reserves \u2248 4.8 billion tonnes. Chuandong Natural Gas Field is China's largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270 billion m3 \u2013 more than 1/5 of China's total. Has China's largest reserve of strontium (China has the world's 2nd biggest strontium deposit). Manganese is mined in the Xiushan area. although the mining sector has been criticised for being wasteful, heavily polluting and unsafe. Chongqing is also planned to be the site of a 10 million ton capacity refinery operated by CNPC (parent company of PetroChina) to process imported crude oil from the Sino-Burma pipelines. The pipeline itself, though not yet finished, will eventually run from Sittwe (in Myanmar's western coast) through Kunming in Yunnan before reaching Chongqing and it will provide China with fuels sourced from Myanmar, the Middle East and Africa. Recently, there has been a drive to move up the value chain by shifting towards high technology and knowledge intensive industries resulting in new development zones such as the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ). Chongqing's local government is hoping through the promotion of favorable economic policies for the electronics and information technology sectors, that it can create a 400 billion RMB high technology manufacturing hub which will surpass its car industry and account for 25% of its exports.The city has also invested heavily in infrastructure to attract investment. The network of roads and railways connecting Chongqing to the rest of China has been expanded and upgraded reducing logistical costs. Furthermore, the nearby Three Gorges Dam which is the world's largest, supplies Chongqing with power and allows oceangoing ships to reach Chongqing's Yangtze River port. These infrastructure improvements have led to the arrivals of numerous foreign direct investors (FDI) in industries ranging from car to finance and retailing; such as Ford, Mazda, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, ANZ Bank, Scotiabank, Wal-Mart, Metro AG and Carrefour, among other multinational corporations.\nChongqing's nominal GDP in 2011 reached 1001.1 billion yuan (US$158.9 billion) while registering an annual growth of 16.4%. However, its overall economic performance is still lagging behind eastern coastal cities such as Shanghai. For instance, its per capita GDP was 22,909 yuan (US$3,301) which is below the national average. Nevertheless, there is a massive government support to transform Chongqing into the region's economic, trade, and financial centre and use the municipality as a platform to open up the country's western interior to further development.Chongqing has been identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei, Anshan, Maanshan, Pingdingshan and Shenyang), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China.\n\n\n=== Economic and technological development zones ===\nThe city includes a number of economic and technological development zones:\n\nChongqing Chemical Industrial Park\nChongqing Economic & Technological Development Zone\nChongqing Hi-Tech Industry Development Zone\nChongqing New North Zone (CNNZ)\nChongqing Export Processing Zone\nJianqiao Industrial Park (located in Dadukou District)\nLiangjiang New Area\nLiangjiang Cloud Computing Center (the largest of its kind in China)Chongqing itself is part of the West Triangle Economic Zone, along with Chengdu and Xi'an.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nChongqing University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University of Political Science and Law (\u897f\u5357\u653f\u6cd5\u5927\u5b66)\nThird Military Medical University (\u7b2c\u4e09\u519b\u533b\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (\u91cd\u5e86\u90ae\u7535\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u7406\u5de5\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Jiaotong University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Medical University (\u91cd\u5e86\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Normal University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e08\u8303\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Technology and Business University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5de5\u5546\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Three Gorges University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e09\u5ce1\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing Telecommunication Institute (\u91cd\u5e86\u901a\u8baf\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Science and Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u79d1\u6280\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan Fine Arts Institute (\u56db\u5ddd\u7f8e\u672f\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan International Studies University (\u56db\u5ddd\u5916\u56fd\u8bed\u5927\u5b66)\nUniversity of Logistics (\u540e\u52e4\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Arts and Science (\u91cd\u5e86\u6587\u7406\u5b66\u9662)\nYangtze Normal University (\u957f\u6c5f\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Education (\u91cd\u5e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\n\n\n=== Notable high schools ===\nFuling Experimental High School (\u6daa\u9675\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.1 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u4e2d)\nChongqing Nankai Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5357\u5f00\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.8 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u516b\u4e2d)\nBashu Secondary School (\u5df4\u8700\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Railway High School (\u91cd\u5e86\u94c1\u8def\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Yucai Secondary School (\u80b2\u624d\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Foreign Language School (The High School Affiliated to Sichuan International Studies University \u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u5916)\nVerakin High School of Chongqing (The 2nd Chongqing Foreign Language School, \u91cd\u5e86\u4e8c\u5916)\nChongqing Qiujing High School (\u6c42\u7cbe\u4e2d\u5b66)\nHigh School Affiliated to Southwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u4e2d)\nChongqing NO.18 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5341\u516b\u4e2d)\n\n\n=== International schools ===\nYew Chung International School of Chongqing (\u91cd\u5e86\u8000\u4e2d\u56fd\u9645\u5b66\u6821)\nKL International School of Chongqing Bashu (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e02\u8bfa\u6797\u5df4\u8700\u5916\u7c4d\u4eba\u5458\u5b50\u5973\u5b66\u6821)\n\n\n== Transport ==\nSince its elevation to national-level municipality in 1997, the city has dramatically expanded its transportation infrastructure. With the construction of railways and expressways to the east and southeast, Chongqing is a major transportation hub in southwestern China.\nAs of October 2014, the municipality had 31 bridges across the Yangtze River including over a dozen in the city's urban core. Aside from the city's first two Yangtze River bridges, which were built, respectively, in 1960 and 1977, all of the other bridges were completed since 1995.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nPublic transport in Chongqing consists of metro, intercity railway, a ubiquitous bus system and the world's largest monorail network.\nAccording to the Chongqing Municipal Government's ambitious plan in May 2007, Chongqing is investing 150 billion RMB over 13 years to finish a system that combines underground metro lines with heavy monorail (called 'light rail' in China).\nAs of 2017, four metro lines, the 14 km (8.7 mi) long CRT Line 1, a conventional subway, and the 19 km (12 mi) long heavy monorail CRT Line 2 (through Phase II), Line 3, a heavy monorail connects the airport and the southern part of downtown., Line 6, runs between Beibei, a commuter city in the far north to the centre. Line 5 opened in late 2017.\nBy 2020 CRT will consist of 6 straight lines and 1 circular line resulting in 363.5 km (225.9 mi) of road and railway to the existing transportation infrastructure and 93 new train stations will be added to the 111 stations that are already in place.By 2050, Chongqing will have as many as 18 lines planned to be in operation.\n\n\n==== Aerial tramway ====\n\nChongqing is the only Chinese city that keeps public aerial tramways. Historically there were three aerial tramways in Chongqing: the Yangtze River Tramway, the Jialing River Tramway and the South Mountain Tramway. Currently, only Yangtze River Tramway is still operating and it is Class 4A Tourist Attractions in China. This tramway is 1,160 metres (3,810 feet) long, connecting the southern and northern banks of Yangtze River. The daily passenger volume is about 10,000.\n\n\n=== River port ===\n\nChongqing is one of the most important inland ports in China. There are numerous luxury cruise ships that terminate at Chongqing, cruising downstream along the Yangtze River to Yichang, Wuhan, Nanjing or even Shanghai. In the recent past, this provided virtually the only transportation option along the river. However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several port handling facilities exist throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nMajor train stations in Chongqing:\n\nChongqing railway station in Yuzhong, accessible via Metro Lines 1 & 3 (Lianglukou Metro station), is the city's oldest railway station and located near the city centre. The station handles mostly long-distance trains. There are plans for a major renovation and overhaul of this station, thus many services have been transferred to Chongqing North Railway Station.\nChongqing North railway station is a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to Chengdu, Beijing and other cities. It was completed in 2006 and is connected to Metro Line.\nChongqing West railway station is in Shapingba, a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to many cities. It is completed in 2018.\nShapingba railway station is in Shapingba, near Shapingba CBD, accessible via Metro Line 1. It handles many local and regional train services. It is completed in 2018.Chongqing is a major freight destination for rail with continued development with improved handling facilities. Due to subsidies and incentives, the relocation and construction of many factories in Chongqing has seen a huge increase in rail traffic.\nChongqing is a major rail hub regionally.\n\nChengdu\u2013Chongqing railway to Chengdu\nSichuan-Guizhou railway to Guiyang\nXiangyang\u2013Chongqing railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Huaihua railway to Hunan\nChongqing-Suining railway (Sichuan province)\nChongqing-Lichuan railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Lanzhou railway (Gansu) railway\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nTraditionally, the road network in Chongqing has been narrow, winding and limited to smaller vehicles because of the natural terrain, large rivers and the huge population demands on the area, especially in the Yuzhong District. In other places, such as Jiangbei, large areas of homes and buildings have recently been cleared to improve the road network and create better urban planning. This has seen many tunnels and large bridges needing to be built across the city. Construction of many expressways have connected Chongqing to neighbouring provinces. Several ring roads have also been constructed. The natural mountainous terrain that Chongqing is built on makes many road projects difficult to construct, including for example some of the world's highest road bridges.Unlike many other Chinese cities, it is rare for motorbikes, electric scooters or bicycles to be seen on Chongqing Roads. This is due to the extremely hilly and mountainous nature of Chongqing's roads and streets. However, despite this, Chongqing is a large manufacturing centre for these types of vehicles.\nChongqing-Chengdu Expressway\nChongqing-Chengdu 2nd Expressway (under construction)\nChongqing-Wanzhou-Yichang Highway (Wanzhou-Yichang section under construction)\nChongqing-Guiyang Highway\nChongqing-Changsha Expressway (Xiushan-Changsha section under construction)\nChongqing-Dazhou-Xi'a Highway (Dazhou-Xi'an section under construction)\nChongqing-Suining Expressway\nChongqing-Nanchong Expressway\nChina National Highway 210\nChina National Highway 212\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nWith so many bridges crossing the Yangtze and Jialing rivers in the urban area, Chongqing is sometimes known as the 'Bridge Capital of China'. The first important bridge in urban Chongqing was the Niujiaotuo Jialing River Bridge, built in 1958. The first bridge over the Yangtze river was the Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge (or Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge) built in 1977.\nAs of 2014, within the area of the 9 districts, there were 20 bridges on the Yangtze river and 28 bridges on the Jialing river. The bridges in Chongqing exhibit a variety of shapes and structures, making Chongqing a showcase for bridge design.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe major airport of Chongqing is Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport (IATA: CKG, ICAO: ZUCK). It is located in Yubei District. The airport offers a growing network of direct flights to China, South East Asia, the Middle East, North America, and Europe. It is located 21 km (13 mi) north of the city-centre of Chongqing and serves as an important aviation hub for south-western China. Jiangbei airport is a hub for China Southern Airlines, Chongqing Airlines, Sichuan Airlines, China Express Airlines, Shandong Airlines and Hainan Airlines's new China West Air. Chongqing also is a focus city of Air China, therefore it is very well connected with Star Alliance and Skyteam's international network. The airport currently has three parallel runways in operation. It serves domestic routes to most other Chinese cities, as well as international routes to Auckland, New York City, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, Doha, Dubai, Seoul, Bangkok, Phuket, Osaka, Singapore, Chiang Mai, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Mal\u00e9, Bali, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Batam, Rome and Helsinki. As of 2018, Jiangbei Airport is the 9th busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic in mainland China.Currently, Jiangbei airport has three terminals. Chongqing Airport has metro access (CRT Line 3 and Line 10) to its central city, and two runways in normal use.There are two other airports in Chongqing Municipality: Qianjiang Wulingshan Airport (IATA: JIQ, ICAO: ZUQJ) and Wanzhou Wuqiao Airport (IATA: WXN, ICAO: ZUWX). They are both class 4C airports and serve passenger flights to some domestic destinations including Beijing, Shanghai and Kunming. Two more airports are being constructed soon: Wulong Xiann\u00fcshan Airport and Wushan Shenn\u00fcfeng Airport.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe language native to Chongqing is Southwestern Mandarin. More precisely, the great majority of the municipality, save for Xiushan, speak Sichuanese, including the primary Chengdu-Chongqing dialect and Minjiang dialect spoken in Jiangjin and Qijiang. There are also a few speakers of Xiang and Hakka in the municipality, due to the great immigration wave to the Sichuan region (\u6e56\u5e7f\u586b\u56db\u5ddd) during the Ming and Qing dynasties. In addition, in parts of southeastern Chongqing, the Miao and Tujia languages are also used by some Miao and Tujia people.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAs the provisional Capital of China for almost ten years (1937 to 1945), the city was also known as one of the three headquarters of the Allies during World War II, as well as being a strategic center of many other wars throughout China's history. Chongqing has many historic war-time buildings or sites, some of which have since been destroyed. These sites include the People's Liberation Monument, located in the center of Chongqing city. It used to be the highest building in the area, but is now surrounded and dwarfed by numerous shopping centres. Originally named the Monument for the Victory over Axis Armies, it is the only building in China for that purpose. Today, the monument serves as a symbol for the city. The General Joseph W. Stilwell Museum, dedicated to General \"Vinegar Joe\" Stilwell, a World War II general. the air force cemetery in the Nanshan area, in memory of those air force personnel killed during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), and the Red Rock Village Museum, a diplomatic site for the Communist Party in Chongqing led by Zhou Enlai during World War II, and Guiyuan, Cassia Garden, where Mao Zedong signed the \"Double 10 (10 October) Peace Agreement\" with the Kuomintang in 1945.\n\nThe Baiheliang Underwater Museum, China's first underwater museum,\nThe Memorial of Great Tunnel Massacre, a former air-raid shelter where a major massacre occurred during World War II.\nThe Great Hall of the People in Chongqing is based on the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. This is one of the largest public assembly buildings in China which, though built in modern times, emulates traditional architectural styles. It is adjacent to the densely populated and hilly central district, with narrow streets and pedestrian only walkways,\nThe large domed Three Gorges Museum presents the history, culture, and environment of the Three Gorges area and Chongqing.\nChongqing Art Museum is known for striking architecture.\nChongqing Science and Technology Museum has an IMAX theatre.\nLuohan Si, a Ming dynasty temple,\nHuangguan Escalator, the second longest escalator in Asia.\nFormer sites for embassies of major countries during the 1940s. As the capital at that time, Chongqing had many residential and other buildings for these officials.\nWuxi County, noted as a major tourism area of Chongqing,\nThe Dazu Rock Carvings, in Dazu county, are a series of Chinese religious sculptures and carvings, dating back as far as the 7th century A.D., depicting and influenced by Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist beliefs.

        "wiki": "Chongqing (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0o\u014b\u02e8\u02e9t\u0255\u02b0in\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u028a\u030c\u014b.t\u0255\u02b0\u00ee\u014b] (listen), UK: , US: ,), alternately romanized as Chungking, is a megacity in southwest China. Administratively, it is one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of central government of the People's Republic of China (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), and the only such municipality located far away from the coast. The municipality of Chongqing, which is around the size of Austria, includes the city of Chongqing and various non-connected cities. As the Chongqing municipality government directly administers the city of Chongqing, as well as rural counties, and other cities not connected to the city of Chongqing, Chongqing municipality can technically claim to be the largest city proper in the world, even though this is due to a classification technicality and not because it is actually the world's largest urban area.\nChongqing was a municipality during the Republic of China (ROC) administration, within the Sichuan Province. It served as its wartime capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), being one of the world's anti-fascist command centers. The current municipality was separated from Sichuan province on 14 March 1997 to help develop the central and western parts of China. The Chongqing administrative municipality has a population of over 30 million. The city of Chongqing, comprising 9 urban and suburban districts, has a population of 8,518,000 as of 2016. According to the 2010 census, Chongqing is the most populous Chinese municipality, and also the largest direct-controlled municipality in China, containing 26 districts, eight counties, and four autonomous counties.\nThe official abbreviation of the city, \"Y\u00fa\" (\u6e1d), was approved by the State Council on 18 April 1997. This abbreviation is derived from the old name of a part of the Jialing River that runs through Chongqing and feeds into the Yangtze River.\nChongqing has a significant history and culture. Being one of China's National Central Cities, it serves as the economic centre of the Sichuan Basin and the upstream Yangtze. It is a major manufacturing centre and transportation hub; a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit described it as one of China's \"13 emerging megalopolises\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nTradition associates Chongqing with the State of Ba.\nThis new capital was first named Jiangzhou (\u6c5f\u5dde).\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\nJiangzhou subsequently remained under Qin Shi Huang's rule during the Qin dynasty, the successor of the Qin State, and under the control of Han dynasty emperors.\nJiangzhou was subsequently renamed during the Northern and Southern dynasties to Chu Prefecture (\u695a\u5dde), then in 581 AD (Sui dynasty) to Yu Prefecture (\u6e1d\u5dde), and later in 1102 during Northern Song to Gong Prefecture (\u606d\u5dde). The name Yu however survives to this day as an abbreviation for Chongqing, and the city centre where the old town stood is also called Yuzhong (\u6e1d\u4e2d, Central Yu). It received its current name in 1189, after Prince Zhao Dun of the Southern Song dynasty described his crowning as king and then Emperor Guangzong as a \"double celebration\" (simplified Chinese: \u53cc\u91cd\u559c\u5e86; traditional Chinese: \u96d9\u91cd\u559c\u6176; pinyin: shu\u0101ngch\u00f3ng x\u01d0q\u00ecng, or chongqing in short). In his honour, Yu Prefecture was therefore converted to Chongqing Fu, marking the occasion of his enthronement.\nIn 1362, (Yuan dynasty), Ming Yuzhen, a peasant rebel leader, established the Daxia Kingdom (\u5927\u590f) at Chongqing for a short time. In 1621 (Ming dynasty), another short-lived kingdom of Daliang (\u5927\u6881) was established by She Chongming (\u5962\u5d07\u660e) with Chongqing as its capital. In 1644, after the fall of the Ming dynasty to a rebel army, Chongqing, together with the rest of Sichuan, was captured by Zhang Xianzhong, who was said to have massacred a large number of people in Sichuan and depopulated the province, in part by causing many people to flee to safety elsewhere. The Manchus later conquered the province, and during the Qing dynasty, immigration to Chongqing and Sichuan took place with the support of the Qing emperor.In 1890, the British Consulate General was opened in Chongqing. The following year, the city became the first inland commerce port open to foreigners. The French, German, US and Japanese consulates were opened in Chongqing in 1896\u20131904.\n\n\n=== Provisional capital of the Republic of China ===\n\nDuring and after the Second Sino-Japanese War, from Nov 1937 to May 1946, it was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's provisional capital. Indeed, after the General and remaining army had lived there for a time following their retreat in 1938 from the previous capital of Wuhan, it was formally declared the second capital city (pei du) on 6 September 1940. After Britain, the United States, and other Allies entered the war in Asia in December 1941, one of the Allies' deputy commanders of operations in South East Asia (South East Asia Command SEAC), Joseph Stilwell, was based in the city. This made it a city of world importance in the fight against Axis powers, together with London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. The city was also visited by Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of SEAC which was itself headquartered in Ceylon, modern day Sri Lanka. Chiang Kai Shek as Supreme Commander in China worked closely with Stilwell. From 1938 to 1943, the city suffered from continuous terror bombing by the Japanese air force. Lives were saved by the air-raid shelters which took the advantage of the mountainous terrain. Chongqing was acclaimed to be the \u201cCity of Heroes\u201d due to the indomitable spirits of its people as well as their contributions and sacrifices during World War II. Many factories and universities were relocated from eastern China to Chongqing during the war, transforming this city from inland port to a heavily industrialized city. In late November 1949, the Nationalist KMT government retreated from the city.\n\n\n=== Municipality status ===\n\nOn 14 March 1997, the Eighth National People's Congress decided to merge the Sub-provincial city with the neighbouring Fuling, Wanxian, and Qianjiang prefectures that it had governed on behalf of the province since September 1996. The resulting single division became Chongqing Municipality, containing 30,020,000 people in forty-three former counties (without intermediate political levels). The municipality became the spearhead of China's effort to develop its western regions and to coordinate the resettlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges Dam project. Its first official ceremony took place on 18 June 1997. On 8 February 2010, Chongqing became one of the four National Central/Core cities, the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. On 18 June 2010, Liangjiang New Area was established in Chongqing, which is the third State-level new areas at the time of its establishment.In August 2020 the city was hit by a large scale flood, the highest water level seen since the Cuntan hydrographic station was opened in 1939. This came after other smaller scale floods during the year. It is estimated the flood killed hundreds of people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography and topography ===\n\nChongqing is situated at the transitional area between the Tibetan Plateau and the plain on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the sub-tropical climate zone often swept by moist monsoons. It often rains at night in late spring and early summer, and thus the city is famous for its \"night rain in the Ba Mountains\", as described by poems throughout Chinese history including the famous Written on a Rainy Night-A Letter to the North by Li Shangyin. The municipality reaches a maximum width of 470 kilometres (290 mi) from east to west, and a maximum length of 450 km (280 mi) from north to south. It borders the following provinces: Hubei in the east, Hunan in the southeast, Guizhou in the south, Sichuan in the west and northwest, and Shaanxi to the north in its northeast corner.\n\nChongqing covers a large area crisscrossed by rivers and mountains. The Daba Mountains stand in the north, the Wu Mountains in the east, the Wuling Mountains in the southeast, and the Dalou Mountains in the south. The whole area slopes down from north and south towards the Yangtze River valley, with sharp rises and falls. The area is featured by a large geological massif, of mountains and hills, with large sloping areas at different heights. Typical karst landscape is common in this area, and stone forests, numerous collections of peaks, limestone caves and valleys can be found in many places. The Longshuixia Gap (\u9f99\u6c34\u5ce1\u5730\u7f1d), with its natural arch-bridges, has made the region a popular tourist attraction. The Yangtze River runs through the whole area from west to east, covering a course of 665 km (413 mi), cutting through the Wu Mountains at three places and forming the well-known Three Gorges: the Qutang, the Wuxia and the Xiling gorges. Coming from northwest and running through \"the Jialing Lesser Three Gorges\" of Libi, Wentang and Guanyin, the Jialing River joins the Yangtze in Chongqing.\n\nThe central urban area of Chongqing, or Chongqing proper, is a city of unique features. Built on mountains and partially surrounded by the Yangtze and Jialing rivers, it is known as a \"mountain city\" and a \"city on rivers\". The night scene of the city is very illuminated, with millions of lights and their reflection on the rivers. With its special topographical features, Chongqing has the unique scenery of mountains, rivers, forests, springs, waterfalls, gorges, and caves. Li Bai, a famous poet of the Tang dynasty, was inspired by the natural scenery and wrote this epigram.Specifically, the central urban area is located on a huge folding area. Yuzhong District, Nan'an District, Shapingba District and Jiangbei District are located right on a big syncline. And the \"Southern Mountain of Chongqing\" (Tongluo Mountain), along with the Zhongliang Mountain are two anticlines next to the syncline of downtown.Zhongliang Mountains (\u4e2d\u6881\u5c71) and Tongluo Mountains (\u94dc\u9523\u5c71) roughly forms the eastern and western boundaries of Chongqing's urban area. The highest point in downtown is the top of Eling Hill, which is a smaller syncline hill that keeps Yangtze River and Jialing River apart for some more kilometres. The elevation of Eling Hill is 379 metres (1,243 feet). The lowest point is Chaotian Gate, where the two rivers merge with each other. The altitude there is 160 metres (520 feet). The average height of the area is 259 metres (850 feet). However, there are several high mountains outside central Chongqing, such as the Wugong Ling Mountain, with the altitude of 1,709.4 metres (5,608 feet), in Jiangjin.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nChongqing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa), bordering on a monsoonal humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and for most of the year experiences very high relative humidity, with all months above 75%. Known as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" of the Yangtze river, along with Wuhan and Nanjing, its summers are long and among the hottest and most humid in China, with highs of 33 to 34 \u00b0C (91 to 93 \u00b0F) in July and August in the urban area. Winters are short and somewhat mild, but damp and overcast. The city's location in the Sichuan Basin causes it to have one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, at only 1,055 hours, lower than much of Northern Europe; the monthly percent possible sunshine in the city proper ranges from a mere 8% in December and January to 48% in August. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.8 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 15 December 1975 (unofficial record of \u22122.5 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) was set on 8 February 1943) to 43.0 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) on 15 August 2006 (unofficial record of 44.0 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F) was set on 8 and 9 August 1933).Chongqing, with over 100 days of fog per year, is known as the \"Fog City\" (\u96fe\u90fd), like San Francisco, and a thick layer of fog enshrouds it for 68 days per year during the spring and autumn. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, this special weather possibly played a role in protecting the city from being overrun by the Imperial Japanese Army.\nAs exemplified by Youyang County below, conditions are often cooler in the southeast part of the municipality due to the higher elevations there.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nChongqing has been, since 1997, a direct-controlled municipality in the Chinese administrative structure, making it a provincial-level division with commensurate political importance. The municipality's top leader is the secretary of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China (\"party chief\"), which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, the country's second highest governing council. Under the Soviet-inspired nomenklatura system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the Communist Party, and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include He Guoqiang, Wang Yang, Bo Xilai, Zhang Dejiang, and Sun Zhengcai, the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal party standing committee, the de facto top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.\nThe municipal People's Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor, who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.The municipality also has a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (zhengxie) meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The zhengxie is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.\n\n\n=== Military ===\nChongqing was the wartime capital of China during the Second Sino-Japanese war (i.e., World War II), and from 1938 to 1946, the seat of administration for the Republic of China's government before its departure to Nanjing and then Taiwan. After the eventual defeat at the Battle of Wuhan General Chiang-Kai Shek and the army were forced to use it as base of resistance from 1938 onwards. It also contains a military museum named after the Chinese Korean War hero Qiu Shaoyun.Chongqing used to be the headquarters of the 13th Group Army of the People's Liberation Army, one of the two group armies that formerly comprised the Chengdu Military Region, which in 2016 was re-organized into the Western Theater Command.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nChongqing is the largest of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China. The municipality is divided into 38 subdivisions (3 were abolished in 1997, and Wansheng and Shuangqiao districts were abolished in October 2011), consisting of 26 districts, 8 counties, and 4 autonomous counties. The boundaries of Chongqing municipality reach much farther into the city's hinterland than the boundaries of the other three provincial level municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and much of its administrative area, which spans over 80,000 square kilometres (30,900 sq mi), is rural. At the end of year 2017, the total population is 30.75 million.[1]\n\n\n==== Urban areas ====\n\na Indicates with which district the division was associated below prior to the merging of Chongqing, Fuling, Wanxian (now Wanzhou) and Qianjiang in 1997.\n\n\n==== Central Chongqing ====\n\nThe main urban area of Chongqing city (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e3b\u57ce\u533a) spans approximately 5,473 square kilometres (2,113 square miles), and includes the following nine districts:\nYuzhong District (\u6e1d\u4e2d\u533a, or \"Central Chongqing District\"), the central and most densely populated district, where government and international business offices and the city's best shopping are located in the district's Jeifangbei CBD area. Yuzhong is located on the peninsula surrounded by Eling Hill, Yangtze River and Jialing River.\nJiangbei District (\u6c5f\u5317\u533a, or \"River North District\"), located to the north of Jialing River.\nShapingba District (\u6c99\u576a\u575d\u533a), roughly located between Jialing River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nJiulongpo District (\u4e5d\u9f99\u5761\u533a), roughly located between Yangtze River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nNan'an District (\u5357\u5cb8\u533a, or \"Southern Bank District\"), located on the south side of Yangtze River.\nDadukou District (\u5927\u6e21\u53e3\u533a)\nBanan District (\u5df4\u5357\u533a, or \"Southern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Ba County, and changed to the current name in 1994. Its northern area merged into Chongqing, and its capital town Yudong is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nYubei District (\u6e1d\u5317\u533a, or \"Northern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Jiangbei County, and changed into the current name in 1994. Its southern area merged into Chongqing, and the capital town Lianglu Town is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nBeibei District (\u5317\u789a\u533a), a satellite city northwest of Chongqing.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAccording to a July 2010 article from the official Xinhua news agency, the municipality has a population of 32.8 million, including 23.3 million farmers. Among them, 8.4 million farmers have become migrant workers, including 3.9 million working and living in urban areas of Chongqing.\nThe metropolitan area encompassing the central urban area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 17 million.This would mean that the locally registered farmers who work in other jurisdictions number 4.5 million, reducing the local, year-round population of Chongqing in 2010 to 28.3 million, plus those who are registered in other jurisdictions but live and work in Chongqing. According to China's 2005 statistical yearbook, of a total population of 30.55 million, those with residence registered in other jurisdictions but residing in the Chongqing enumeration area numbered 1.4 million, including 46,000 who resided in Chongqing \"for less than half-year\". An additional 83,000 had registered in Chongqing, but not yet settled there.The 2005 statistical yearbook also lists 15.22 million (49.82%) males and 15.33 million (50.18%) females.In terms of age distribution in 2004, of the 30.55 million total population, 6.4 million (20.88%) were age 0\u201314, 20.7 million (67.69%) were 15\u201364, and 3.5 million (11.46%) were 65 and over.Of a total 10,470,000 households (2004), 1,360,000 consisted of one person, 2,940,000 two-person, 3,190,000 three-person, 1,790,000 four-person, 783,000 five-person, 270,000 six-person, 89,000 seven-person, 28,000 eight-person, 6,000 nine-person, and 10,000 households of 10 or more persons per household.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe predominant religions in Chongqing are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 26.63% of the population believes and is involved in cults of ancestors, while 1.05% of the population identifies as Christian.The reports didn't give figures for other types of religion; 72.32% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects.\n\n\n== Crime ==\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the city became notorious for organised crime and corruption. Gangsters oversaw businesses involving billions of yuan and the corruption reached into the law-enforcement and justice systems. In 2009, city authorities under the auspices of municipal Communist Party secretary Bo Xilai undertook a large-scale crackdown, arresting 4,893 suspected gangsters, \"outlaws\" and corrupt cadres, leading to optimism that the period of gangsterism was over. However, local media later highlighted the apparent reliance by the authorities on torture to extract confessions upon which convictions were based. In December 2009, one defence lawyer was controversially arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison for \"coaching his client to make false claims of torture\" and in July 2010, another lawyer released videotapes of his client describing the torture in detail. In 2014, four policemen involved in the interrogation were charged with the practice of \"opposed illegal interrogation techniques\", considered by observers to be torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nChongqing was separated from Sichuan province and made into a municipality in its own right in 14 March 1997 in order to accelerate its development and subsequently China's relatively poorer western areas (see China Western Development strategy). An important industrial area in western China, Chongqing is also rapidly urbanising. For instance, statistics suggest that new construction added approximately 137,000 square metres (1,470,000 square feet) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. In addition, more than 1,300 people moved into the city daily, adding almost 100 million yuan (US$15 million) to the local economy.\nTraditionally, due to its geographical remoteness, Chongqing and neighbouring Sichuan have been important military bases in weapons research and development. Chongqing's industries have now diversified but unlike eastern China, its export sector is small due to its inland location. Instead, factories producing local-oriented consumer goods such as processed food, cars, chemicals, textiles, machinery, sports equipment and electronics  are common.\nChongqing is China's third largest centre for motor vehicle production and the largest for motorcycles. In 2007, it had an annual output capacity of 1 million cars and 8.6 million motorcycles. Leading makers of cars and motor bikes includes China's fourth biggest automaker; Changan Automotive Corp and Lifan Hongda Enterprise, as well as Ford Motor Company, with the US car giant having 3 plants in Chongqing.  The municipality is also one of the nine largest iron and steel centres in China and one of the three major aluminium producers. Important manufacturers include Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and South West Aluminium which is Asia's largest aluminium plant. Agriculture remains significant. Rice and fruits, especially oranges, are the area's main produce. Natural resources are also abundant with large deposits of coal, natural gas, and more than 40 kinds of minerals such as strontium and manganese. Coal reserves \u2248 4.8 billion tonnes. Chuandong Natural Gas Field is China's largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270 billion m3 \u2013 more than 1/5 of China's total. Has China's largest reserve of strontium (China has the world's 2nd biggest strontium deposit). Manganese is mined in the Xiushan area. although the mining sector has been criticised for being wasteful, heavily polluting and unsafe. Chongqing is also planned to be the site of a 10 million ton capacity refinery operated by CNPC (parent company of PetroChina) to process imported crude oil from the Sino-Burma pipelines. The pipeline itself, though not yet finished, will eventually run from Sittwe (in Myanmar's western coast) through Kunming in Yunnan before reaching Chongqing and it will provide China with fuels sourced from Myanmar, the Middle East and Africa. Recently, there has been a drive to move up the value chain by shifting towards high technology and knowledge intensive industries resulting in new development zones such as the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ). Chongqing's local government is hoping through the promotion of favorable economic policies for the electronics and information technology sectors, that it can create a 400 billion RMB high technology manufacturing hub which will surpass its car industry and account for 25% of its exports.The city has also invested heavily in infrastructure to attract investment. The network of roads and railways connecting Chongqing to the rest of China has been expanded and upgraded reducing logistical costs. Furthermore, the nearby Three Gorges Dam which is the world's largest, supplies Chongqing with power and allows oceangoing ships to reach Chongqing's Yangtze River port. These infrastructure improvements have led to the arrivals of numerous foreign direct investors (FDI) in industries ranging from car to finance and retailing; such as Ford, Mazda, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, ANZ Bank, Scotiabank, Wal-Mart, Metro AG and Carrefour, among other multinational corporations.\nChongqing's nominal GDP in 2011 reached 1001.1 billion yuan (US$158.9 billion) while registering an annual growth of 16.4%. However, its overall economic performance is still lagging behind eastern coastal cities such as Shanghai. For instance, its per capita GDP was 22,909 yuan (US$3,301) which is below the national average. Nevertheless, there is a massive government support to transform Chongqing into the region's economic, trade, and financial centre and use the municipality as a platform to open up the country's western interior to further development.Chongqing has been identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei, Anshan, Maanshan, Pingdingshan and Shenyang), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China.\n\n\n=== Economic and technological development zones ===\nThe city includes a number of economic and technological development zones:\n\nChongqing Chemical Industrial Park\nChongqing Economic & Technological Development Zone\nChongqing Hi-Tech Industry Development Zone\nChongqing New North Zone (CNNZ)\nChongqing Export Processing Zone\nJianqiao Industrial Park (located in Dadukou District)\nLiangjiang New Area\nLiangjiang Cloud Computing Center (the largest of its kind in China)Chongqing itself is part of the West Triangle Economic Zone, along with Chengdu and Xi'an.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nChongqing University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University of Political Science and Law (\u897f\u5357\u653f\u6cd5\u5927\u5b66)\nThird Military Medical University (\u7b2c\u4e09\u519b\u533b\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (\u91cd\u5e86\u90ae\u7535\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u7406\u5de5\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Jiaotong University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Medical University (\u91cd\u5e86\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Normal University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e08\u8303\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Technology and Business University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5de5\u5546\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Three Gorges University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e09\u5ce1\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing Telecommunication Institute (\u91cd\u5e86\u901a\u8baf\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Science and Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u79d1\u6280\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan Fine Arts Institute (\u56db\u5ddd\u7f8e\u672f\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan International Studies University (\u56db\u5ddd\u5916\u56fd\u8bed\u5927\u5b66)\nUniversity of Logistics (\u540e\u52e4\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Arts and Science (\u91cd\u5e86\u6587\u7406\u5b66\u9662)\nYangtze Normal University (\u957f\u6c5f\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Education (\u91cd\u5e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\n\n\n=== Notable high schools ===\nFuling Experimental High School (\u6daa\u9675\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.1 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u4e2d)\nChongqing Nankai Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5357\u5f00\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.8 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u516b\u4e2d)\nBashu Secondary School (\u5df4\u8700\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Railway High School (\u91cd\u5e86\u94c1\u8def\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Yucai Secondary School (\u80b2\u624d\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Foreign Language School (The High School Affiliated to Sichuan International Studies University \u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u5916)\nVerakin High School of Chongqing (The 2nd Chongqing Foreign Language School, \u91cd\u5e86\u4e8c\u5916)\nChongqing Qiujing High School (\u6c42\u7cbe\u4e2d\u5b66)\nHigh School Affiliated to Southwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u4e2d)\nChongqing NO.18 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5341\u516b\u4e2d)\n\n\n=== International schools ===\nYew Chung International School of Chongqing (\u91cd\u5e86\u8000\u4e2d\u56fd\u9645\u5b66\u6821)\nKL International School of Chongqing Bashu (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e02\u8bfa\u6797\u5df4\u8700\u5916\u7c4d\u4eba\u5458\u5b50\u5973\u5b66\u6821)\n\n\n== Transport ==\nSince its elevation to national-level municipality in 1997, the city has dramatically expanded its transportation infrastructure. With the construction of railways and expressways to the east and southeast, Chongqing is a major transportation hub in southwestern China.\nAs of October 2014, the municipality had 31 bridges across the Yangtze River including over a dozen in the city's urban core. Aside from the city's first two Yangtze River bridges, which were built, respectively, in 1960 and 1977, all of the other bridges were completed since 1995.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nPublic transport in Chongqing consists of metro, intercity railway, a ubiquitous bus system and the world's largest monorail network.\nAccording to the Chongqing Municipal Government's ambitious plan in May 2007, Chongqing is investing 150 billion RMB over 13 years to finish a system that combines underground metro lines with heavy monorail (called 'light rail' in China).\nAs of 2017, four metro lines, the 14 km (8.7 mi) long CRT Line 1, a conventional subway, and the 19 km (12 mi) long heavy monorail CRT Line 2 (through Phase II), Line 3, a heavy monorail connects the airport and the southern part of downtown., Line 6, runs between Beibei, a commuter city in the far north to the centre. Line 5 opened in late 2017.\nBy 2020 CRT will consist of 6 straight lines and 1 circular line resulting in 363.5 km (225.9 mi) of road and railway to the existing transportation infrastructure and 93 new train stations will be added to the 111 stations that are already in place.By 2050, Chongqing will have as many as 18 lines planned to be in operation.\n\n\n==== Aerial tramway ====\n\nChongqing is the only Chinese city that keeps public aerial tramways. Historically there were three aerial tramways in Chongqing: the Yangtze River Tramway, the Jialing River Tramway and the South Mountain Tramway. Currently, only Yangtze River Tramway is still operating and it is Class 4A Tourist Attractions in China. This tramway is 1,160 metres (3,810 feet) long, connecting the southern and northern banks of Yangtze River. The daily passenger volume is about 10,000.\n\n\n=== River port ===\n\nChongqing is one of the most important inland ports in China. There are numerous luxury cruise ships that terminate at Chongqing, cruising downstream along the Yangtze River to Yichang, Wuhan, Nanjing or even Shanghai. In the recent past, this provided virtually the only transportation option along the river. However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several port handling facilities exist throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nMajor train stations in Chongqing:\n\nChongqing railway station in Yuzhong, accessible via Metro Lines 1 & 3 (Lianglukou Metro station), is the city's oldest railway station and located near the city centre. The station handles mostly long-distance trains. There are plans for a major renovation and overhaul of this station, thus many services have been transferred to Chongqing North Railway Station.\nChongqing North railway station is a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to Chengdu, Beijing and other cities. It was completed in 2006 and is connected to Metro Line.\nChongqing West railway station is in Shapingba, a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to many cities. It is completed in 2018.\nShapingba railway station is in Shapingba, near Shapingba CBD, accessible via Metro Line 1. It handles many local and regional train services. It is completed in 2018.Chongqing is a major freight destination for rail with continued development with improved handling facilities. Due to subsidies and incentives, the relocation and construction of many factories in Chongqing has seen a huge increase in rail traffic.\nChongqing is a major rail hub regionally.\n\nChengdu\u2013Chongqing railway to Chengdu\nSichuan-Guizhou railway to Guiyang\nXiangyang\u2013Chongqing railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Huaihua railway to Hunan\nChongqing-Suining railway (Sichuan province)\nChongqing-Lichuan railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Lanzhou railway (Gansu) railway\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nTraditionally, the road network in Chongqing has been narrow, winding and limited to smaller vehicles because of the natural terrain, large rivers and the huge population demands on the area, especially in the Yuzhong District. In other places, such as Jiangbei, large areas of homes and buildings have recently been cleared to improve the road network and create better urban planning. This has seen many tunnels and large bridges needing to be built across the city. Construction of many expressways have connected Chongqing to neighbouring provinces. Several ring roads have also been constructed. The natural mountainous terrain that Chongqing is built on makes many road projects difficult to construct, including for example some of the world's highest road bridges.Unlike many other Chinese cities, it is rare for motorbikes, electric scooters or bicycles to be seen on Chongqing Roads. This is due to the extremely hilly and mountainous nature of Chongqing's roads and streets. However, despite this, Chongqing is a large manufacturing centre for these types of vehicles.\nChongqing-Chengdu Expressway\nChongqing-Chengdu 2nd Expressway (under construction)\nChongqing-Wanzhou-Yichang Highway (Wanzhou-Yichang section under construction)\nChongqing-Guiyang Highway\nChongqing-Changsha Expressway (Xiushan-Changsha section under construction)\nChongqing-Dazhou-Xi'a Highway (Dazhou-Xi'an section under construction)\nChongqing-Suining Expressway\nChongqing-Nanchong Expressway\nChina National Highway 210\nChina National Highway 212\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nWith so many bridges crossing the Yangtze and Jialing rivers in the urban area, Chongqing is sometimes known as the 'Bridge Capital of China'. The first important bridge in urban Chongqing was the Niujiaotuo Jialing River Bridge, built in 1958. The first bridge over the Yangtze river was the Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge (or Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge) built in 1977.\nAs of 2014, within the area of the 9 districts, there were 20 bridges on the Yangtze river and 28 bridges on the Jialing river. The bridges in Chongqing exhibit a variety of shapes and structures, making Chongqing a showcase for bridge design.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe major airport of Chongqing is Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport (IATA: CKG, ICAO: ZUCK). It is located in Yubei District. The airport offers a growing network of direct flights to China, South East Asia, the Middle East, North America, and Europe. It is located 21 km (13 mi) north of the city-centre of Chongqing and serves as an important aviation hub for south-western China. Jiangbei airport is a hub for China Southern Airlines, Chongqing Airlines, Sichuan Airlines, China Express Airlines, Shandong Airlines and Hainan Airlines's new China West Air. Chongqing also is a focus city of Air China, therefore it is very well connected with Star Alliance and Skyteam's international network. The airport currently has three parallel runways in operation. It serves domestic routes to most other Chinese cities, as well as international routes to Auckland, New York City, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, Doha, Dubai, Seoul, Bangkok, Phuket, Osaka, Singapore, Chiang Mai, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Mal\u00e9, Bali, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Batam, Rome and Helsinki. As of 2018, Jiangbei Airport is the 9th busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic in mainland China.Currently, Jiangbei airport has three terminals. Chongqing Airport has metro access (CRT Line 3 and Line 10) to its central city, and two runways in normal use.There are two other airports in Chongqing Municipality: Qianjiang Wulingshan Airport (IATA: JIQ, ICAO: ZUQJ) and Wanzhou Wuqiao Airport (IATA: WXN, ICAO: ZUWX). They are both class 4C airports and serve passenger flights to some domestic destinations including Beijing, Shanghai and Kunming. Two more airports are being constructed soon: Wulong Xiann\u00fcshan Airport and Wushan Shenn\u00fcfeng Airport.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe language native to Chongqing is Southwestern Mandarin. More precisely, the great majority of the municipality, save for Xiushan, speak Sichuanese, including the primary Chengdu-Chongqing dialect and Minjiang dialect spoken in Jiangjin and Qijiang. There are also a few speakers of Xiang and Hakka in the municipality, due to the great immigration wave to the Sichuan region (\u6e56\u5e7f\u586b\u56db\u5ddd) during the Ming and Qing dynasties. In addition, in parts of southeastern Chongqing, the Miao and Tujia languages are also used by some Miao and Tujia people.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAs the provisional Capital of China for almost ten years (1937 to 1945), the city was also known as one of the three headquarters of the Allies during World War II, as well as being a strategic center of many other wars throughout China's history. Chongqing has many historic war-time buildings or sites, some of which have since been destroyed. These sites include the People's Liberation Monument, located in the center of Chongqing city. It used to be the highest building in the area, but is now surrounded and dwarfed by numerous shopping centres. Originally named the Monument for the Victory over Axis Armies, it is the only building in China for that purpose. Today, the monument serves as a symbol for the city. The General Joseph W. Stilwell Museum, dedicated to General \"Vinegar Joe\" Stilwell, a World War II general. the air force cemetery in the Nanshan area, in memory of those air force personnel killed during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), and the Red Rock Village Museum, a diplomatic site for the Communist Party in Chongqing led by Zhou Enlai during World War II, and Guiyuan, Cassia Garden, where Mao Zedong signed the \"Double 10 (10 October) Peace Agreement\" with the Kuomintang in 1945.\n\nThe Baiheliang Underwater Museum, China's first underwater museum,\nThe Memorial of Great Tunnel Massacre, a former air-raid shelter where a major massacre occurred during World War II.\nThe Great Hall of the People in Chongqing is based on the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Chongqing is known for its spicy food. Its food is normally considered numbing because of the use of Sichuan pepper, also known as Sichuan peppercorn, containing hydroxy alpha sanshool. Chongqing's city centre has many restaurants and food stalls where meals often cost less than RMB10. Local specialties here include dumplings and pickled vegetables and, different from many other Chinese cuisines, Chongqing dishes are suitable for the solo diner as they are often served in small individual sized portions.

        "wiki": "Twelve Views of Bayu are popular scenic views in and around the city of Chongqing, China. Ba and Yu (Chinese: \u5df4\u6e1d; pinyin: B\u0101y\u00fa) are old names of Chongqing in imperial time. Influenced by Eight Views of Xiaoxiang in Hunan Province, people in Chongqing listed their own most beloved views during the reign of Tianshun Emperor of Ming Dynasty. Scenic views in the list changed throughout the history. Some scenic views appeared in earlier lists no longer exist in modern days due to the change of physical geography, landscapes and land-uses.\n\n\n== Original Eight Views ==\nThe first version of the list contains eight popular scenic views, the same number of views in the Xiaoxiang list. In the second year of Tianshun Emperor's reign (1453), people carved the list on to the bronze bell in Chongyin Temple (later renamed as Chang'an Temple), a former buddhism temple located at current Chongqing No. 25 Middle School's campus. The eight views on the original list are:\n\nJin Bi Xiang Feng (Chinese: \u91d1\u78a7\u9999\u98ce; lit.: 'Fragrant wind in Jinbi Mountain'): Jinbi Mountain is the highest peak of Mountain Ba, and currently it is part of the Renmin Park in  Yuzhong District. Jinbi literally means golden and blue. During Song Dynasty, a governor of Chongqing built a hall with golden and blue tiles on top of the mountain. In Ming Dynasty, another governor of Chongqing raised many species of flowers on the mountain and made the air there smells balmiest.\nHong Yan Di Cui (\u6d2a\u5ca9\u6ef4\u7fe0; 'Clear water drops down from the Hongyan Cave'): Hongyan (now called Hongya, \u6d2a\u5d16) literally means waterful cliff. It is located near the riverside area of modern Yuzhong District and close to the Chongqing CBD. Today it is known for the clustered Diaojiaolou buildings. There is a cave on the cliff, and spring water flows out of the cave and drops down the cliff.\nLong Men Hao Yue (\u9f99\u95e8\u6d69\u6708; 'Bright moon of the Long Men'): Long Men literally means Gate of Chinese Dragon. There used to be two giant rock in the near-shore shallow water of Yangtze River, on which there were two big Chinese characters Long Men carved in Song Dynasty. In clear nights, the inverted image of the moon will appear in between those two rocks and makes there to be a beautiful scene. It is now a part of Nanbin Park in Nan'an District.\nHuang Ge Wan Du (\u9ec4\u845b\u665a\u6e21; 'The night view at Huang Ge Ferry'): Huang Ge Ferry was a major ferry crossing the Yangtze River and connecting the main town of Chongqing (today's Yuzhong District) and the Nanping Town (the core area of today's Nan'an District) in previous times. Huang Ge is the local name of ficus virens, a type of tree distributed in Asia and Australia. The Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge replaced Huang Ge Ferry in 1980s, so that the ferry no longer exists. However, this scene is still manually preserved and become a part of Nanbin Park in 2005.\nFo Tu Ye Yu (\u4f5b\u56fe\u591c\u96e8; 'Yeyu Temple in Fotu Pass'): Fotu Pass was located to the west of today's Chongqing CBD area, close to Pipa Mountain Park and Eling Park, and it was an important military fort to defend Chongqing from the west in ancient times. Yeyu Temple was a major temple in Fotu Pass. Yeyu literally means raining at night. Years ago, there was a rock in the front of Yeyu Temple, and water permeated out of the rock every night and made the air moist, as if it were rainy. As a result, people call the rock Yeyu Shi (Rock that raining at night) and called the temple Yeyu Temple.\nKong Dian Qiu Xiang (\u5b54\u6bbf\u79cb\u9999; 'Autumn's fragrance in the Confucian temple'): In Ming Dynasty, there was a Confucian temple in today's Chongqing No.29 Middle School's campus. During autumn, guihua flowers would be in full bloom and bring fragrance to the temple.\nJue Lin Xiao Zhong (\u89c9\u6797\u6653\u949f; 'The sound of bell in the morning at Juelin Temple'): Juelin Temple, located in the forest of Lianhua Mountain in Nan'an District, was built during Song Dynasty. Every morning, monks in the temple would ring the bell (just like any other monks in buddhism temples in China), and the sound of bell made people be joyful. In last years of Ming Dynasty, the temple and the bell were destroyed in wars and chaos. In Qing Dynasty, the temple was rebuilt and turned to be even more glorious. It had its own Eight Views, but the Jue Lin Xiao Zhong was removed from later lists.\nBei Zhen Jin Sha (\u5317\u9547\u91d1\u6c99; 'Golden sands of the northern town'): The northern town refers to the old Jiangbei Town (part of today's Jiangbei District). Jiangbei Town was located near the place where Jialing River merges into Yangtze River. At the northern bank of where the two river merge, there is a sandy beach. Under the sun, sands on the beach shines like gold.\n\n\n== Traditional Twelve Views ==\nChongqing is a major city with diverse landscapes and culture. The original eight views were not able to present all popular scenic views in Chongqing. Therefore, the number of views in the list was later expanded from eight to twelve. The traditional twelve views of Chongqing was proposed in 1760 by Wang Erjian (\u738b\u5c14\u9274), a county-level governor of Chongqing during the reign of Qianlong Emperor in Qing Dynasty. In the new list, three of former eight views were removed due to various reasons, and several other views in and around Chongqing were added. The twelve views in Wang's list are:\n\nJin Bi Liu Xiang (Chinese: \u91d1\u78a7\u6d41\u9999; lit.: 'Floating fragrance in Jinbi Mountain'): The same view as Jin Bi Xiang Feng in the original list of eight views.

Currently, it is also known for hot springs.\nGe Le Ling Yin (\u6b4c\u4e50\u7075\u97f3; 'Heavenly sound on Gele Mountain'): Geleshan is a mountain range in today's Shapingba District. Currently, this mountain is known for the Red Rock Village, a historic memorial site of Communist Party of China. However, in Qing Dynasty, this place was known for the heavenly sound on top of the mountain. The heavenly sound was created by wind blowing through forests in the valley. It made people happy and relaxed.\nYun Zhuan Feng Qing (\u4e91\u7bc6\u98ce\u6e05; 'Cool breeze in Yunzhuan Mountain'): Yunzhuan Mountain is about 8 kilometers away from Yudong Subdistrict in today's Ba'nan District. Yunzhuan Temple, constructed in the 7th year of Chenghua Emperor's reign in Ming Dynasty (1473), was a famous temple in this mountain. Chongqing is considered as one of the stove cities of China, where the temperature in summer is very high. However, people can always feel the cool breeze in Yunzhuan Temple due to its high altitude. Unfortunately, the temple was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution period (1966 - 1976).\nHong Ya Di Cui (\u6d2a\u5d16\u6ef4\u7fe0; 'Green water drops down from the Hongya Cave'): The same view as Hong Yan Di Cui in the original list of eight views.

In Tang Dynasty, a female poet Xue Tao travelled to Chongqing and visited Haitang Creek in a rainy spring day. She saw the beautiful scene of haitang flowers blooming in misty rain, and then wrote a poem called Haitang Creek, which later made this scene popular. Today, there are no clustered haitang flowers along the creek any more, but a portion of the scene is preserved in Nanbin Park.\nZi Shui Xiao Deng (\u5b57\u6c34\u9704\u706f; 'The Chinese-character-shaped flowing patterns and the inverted images of lamps in the river'): This view is in Yangtze River. Near the southern bank, the water of Yangtze flows over a series of rocks and reefs. Disturbed by those rocks, river water flows in a pattern that looks like the Chinese character Ba (\u5df4), which is one of Chongqing's former names in ancient time. People was able to see this stream pattern from the southern bank. In the distance, the lamps and street lights of the northern bank are inverted in the river, and light up the character Ba. The water stream pattern was weakened after the construction of Three Gorges Dam which lifted the water level and slowed down the stream speed of Yangtze River in Chongqing However, the relic of this view is still preserved in Nanbin Park.\nHua Ying Xue Ji (\u534e\u84e5\u96ea\u9701; 'The sunshine after snow in Huaying Mountain'): Huaying Mountain is a major mountain range in eastern edge of Sichuan Basin.

This activity lasted for one year.

          "Place is good to visit the flowers and plants from most part of the world. But its too much pricey , and most part are not maintained well. There is a trick , if you pay 50 RMB , its only one side of the garden you can visit , if you want to visit the inside portion you have",
          "visited during spring and the crowd was crazy. it'd better if the pollution coming from the cars visiting the garden wasn't that bad, but then again it was during weekend.",
          "Another example of Chinese putting entry gate just to gather money for a normal part that in any other country is for free. First it's complicated to get here as its on a mountain and takes time to get, then you pay money to either just enter (just a part with trees) or more",
          "I am not a big fan of botanic gardens but if you are looking for a fresh air and clean parks, Nanshan Botanical Garden is one of the best in the city. It was quite crowed on my weekday visit, however, the area is big. You would need a separate ticket for an exhibition hall but",
          "Easy to go 386 last stop is near garden. In winter nothing much to see so batter buy 50rmb ticket and see both parts.",
          "Before I tell you how good this place is I will warn you about the rude and unhelpful staff at the gate. They advertise cheaper tickets of you pay using your travel card but if you try to do this the staff are less than helpful and bordering on rude. So without any discount it",
          "It is not a spectacular garden. But it is a peaceful place to spend the morning away from the traffic jams in Chongqing.",
          "This is a most delightful spot. Well work a visit. It is a mix of indoor and outdoor. You'll have to pay more to do both. The outdoor includes an amazing display of gourds, all suspended from trellises above you. Indoors, there is a variety of plants from around the world,",
          "Very peaceful! No harassing from vendors ,no huge crowd,just a delightful visit? I can't recall if here is where wesaw the Panda bears but that was a treat! It's wortha visit!",

          "This place is excellent! Worth the 30 minute ride up the hill. Spend the day there though, or at least half of it. It is beautiful.",
          "This trip was really worth it. Never have we seen such a huge botanical garden so welll managed. We will go there again next trip. Great fod jogging!",
          "This is worth the trip up the mountain! Especially during cherry blossom season. We went there on a weekend, and it was crowded, but it was well worth it. There is also a greenhouse with a great collection of cactus. The gardens are all set on the side of Nanshan Mountain,",

        "wiki": "Chongqing (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0o\u014b\u02e8\u02e9t\u0255\u02b0in\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u028a\u030c\u014b.t\u0255\u02b0\u00ee\u014b] (listen), UK: , US: ,), alternately romanized as Chungking, is a megacity in southwest China. Administratively, it is one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of central government of the People's Republic of China (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), and the only such municipality located far away from the coast. The municipality of Chongqing, which is around the size of Austria, includes the city of Chongqing and various non-connected cities. As the Chongqing municipality government directly administers the city of Chongqing, as well as rural counties, and other cities not connected to the city of Chongqing, Chongqing municipality can technically claim to be the largest city proper in the world, even though this is due to a classification technicality and not because it is actually the world's largest urban area.\nChongqing was a municipality during the Republic of China (ROC) administration, within the Sichuan Province. It served as its wartime capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), being one of the world's anti-fascist command centers. The current municipality was separated from Sichuan province on 14 March 1997 to help develop the central and western parts of China. The Chongqing administrative municipality has a population of over 30 million. The city of Chongqing, comprising 9 urban and suburban districts, has a population of 8,518,000 as of 2016. According to the 2010 census, Chongqing is the most populous Chinese municipality, and also the largest direct-controlled municipality in China, containing 26 districts, eight counties, and four autonomous counties.\nThe official abbreviation of the city, \"Y\u00fa\" (\u6e1d), was approved by the State Council on 18 April 1997. This abbreviation is derived from the old name of a part of the Jialing River that runs through Chongqing and feeds into the Yangtze River.\nChongqing has a significant history and culture. Being one of China's National Central Cities, it serves as the economic centre of the Sichuan Basin and the upstream Yangtze. It is a major manufacturing centre and transportation hub; a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit described it as one of China's \"13 emerging megalopolises\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nTradition associates Chongqing with the State of Ba.\nThis new capital was first named Jiangzhou (\u6c5f\u5dde).\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\nJiangzhou subsequently remained under Qin Shi Huang's rule during the Qin dynasty, the successor of the Qin State, and under the control of Han dynasty emperors.\nJiangzhou was subsequently renamed during the Northern and Southern dynasties to Chu Prefecture (\u695a\u5dde), then in 581 AD (Sui dynasty) to Yu Prefecture (\u6e1d\u5dde), and later in 1102 during Northern Song to Gong Prefecture (\u606d\u5dde). The name Yu however survives to this day as an abbreviation for Chongqing, and the city centre where the old town stood is also called Yuzhong (\u6e1d\u4e2d, Central Yu). It received its current name in 1189, after Prince Zhao Dun of the Southern Song dynasty described his crowning as king and then Emperor Guangzong as a \"double celebration\" (simplified Chinese: \u53cc\u91cd\u559c\u5e86; traditional Chinese: \u96d9\u91cd\u559c\u6176; pinyin: shu\u0101ngch\u00f3ng x\u01d0q\u00ecng, or chongqing in short). In his honour, Yu Prefecture was therefore converted to Chongqing Fu, marking the occasion of his enthronement.\nIn 1362, (Yuan dynasty), Ming Yuzhen, a peasant rebel leader, established the Daxia Kingdom (\u5927\u590f) at Chongqing for a short time. In 1621 (Ming dynasty), another short-lived kingdom of Daliang (\u5927\u6881) was established by She Chongming (\u5962\u5d07\u660e) with Chongqing as its capital. In 1644, after the fall of the Ming dynasty to a rebel army, Chongqing, together with the rest of Sichuan, was captured by Zhang Xianzhong, who was said to have massacred a large number of people in Sichuan and depopulated the province, in part by causing many people to flee to safety elsewhere. The Manchus later conquered the province, and during the Qing dynasty, immigration to Chongqing and Sichuan took place with the support of the Qing emperor.In 1890, the British Consulate General was opened in Chongqing. The following year, the city became the first inland commerce port open to foreigners. The French, German, US and Japanese consulates were opened in Chongqing in 1896\u20131904.\n\n\n=== Provisional capital of the Republic of China ===\n\nDuring and after the Second Sino-Japanese War, from Nov 1937 to May 1946, it was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's provisional capital. Indeed, after the General and remaining army had lived there for a time following their retreat in 1938 from the previous capital of Wuhan, it was formally declared the second capital city (pei du) on 6 September 1940. After Britain, the United States, and other Allies entered the war in Asia in December 1941, one of the Allies' deputy commanders of operations in South East Asia (South East Asia Command SEAC), Joseph Stilwell, was based in the city. This made it a city of world importance in the fight against Axis powers, together with London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. The city was also visited by Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of SEAC which was itself headquartered in Ceylon, modern day Sri Lanka. Chiang Kai Shek as Supreme Commander in China worked closely with Stilwell. From 1938 to 1943, the city suffered from continuous terror bombing by the Japanese air force. Lives were saved by the air-raid shelters which took the advantage of the mountainous terrain. Chongqing was acclaimed to be the \u201cCity of Heroes\u201d due to the indomitable spirits of its people as well as their contributions and sacrifices during World War II. Many factories and universities were relocated from eastern China to Chongqing during the war, transforming this city from inland port to a heavily industrialized city. In late November 1949, the Nationalist KMT government retreated from the city.\n\n\n=== Municipality status ===\n\nOn 14 March 1997, the Eighth National People's Congress decided to merge the Sub-provincial city with the neighbouring Fuling, Wanxian, and Qianjiang prefectures that it had governed on behalf of the province since September 1996. The resulting single division became Chongqing Municipality, containing 30,020,000 people in forty-three former counties (without intermediate political levels). The municipality became the spearhead of China's effort to develop its western regions and to coordinate the resettlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges Dam project. Its first official ceremony took place on 18 June 1997. On 8 February 2010, Chongqing became one of the four National Central/Core cities, the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. On 18 June 2010, Liangjiang New Area was established in Chongqing, which is the third State-level new areas at the time of its establishment.In August 2020 the city was hit by a large scale flood, the highest water level seen since the Cuntan hydrographic station was opened in 1939. This came after other smaller scale floods during the year. It is estimated the flood killed hundreds of people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography and topography ===\n\nChongqing is situated at the transitional area between the Tibetan Plateau and the plain on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the sub-tropical climate zone often swept by moist monsoons. It often rains at night in late spring and early summer, and thus the city is famous for its \"night rain in the Ba Mountains\", as described by poems throughout Chinese history including the famous Written on a Rainy Night-A Letter to the North by Li Shangyin. The municipality reaches a maximum width of 470 kilometres (290 mi) from east to west, and a maximum length of 450 km (280 mi) from north to south. It borders the following provinces: Hubei in the east, Hunan in the southeast, Guizhou in the south, Sichuan in the west and northwest, and Shaanxi to the north in its northeast corner.\n\nChongqing covers a large area crisscrossed by rivers and mountains. The Daba Mountains stand in the north, the Wu Mountains in the east, the Wuling Mountains in the southeast, and the Dalou Mountains in the south. The whole area slopes down from north and south towards the Yangtze River valley, with sharp rises and falls. The area is featured by a large geological massif, of mountains and hills, with large sloping areas at different heights. Typical karst landscape is common in this area, and stone forests, numerous collections of peaks, limestone caves and valleys can be found in many places. The Longshuixia Gap (\u9f99\u6c34\u5ce1\u5730\u7f1d), with its natural arch-bridges, has made the region a popular tourist attraction. The Yangtze River runs through the whole area from west to east, covering a course of 665 km (413 mi), cutting through the Wu Mountains at three places and forming the well-known Three Gorges: the Qutang, the Wuxia and the Xiling gorges. Coming from northwest and running through \"the Jialing Lesser Three Gorges\" of Libi, Wentang and Guanyin, the Jialing River joins the Yangtze in Chongqing.\n\nThe central urban area of Chongqing, or Chongqing proper, is a city of unique features. Built on mountains and partially surrounded by the Yangtze and Jialing rivers, it is known as a \"mountain city\" and a \"city on rivers\". The night scene of the city is very illuminated, with millions of lights and their reflection on the rivers. With its special topographical features, Chongqing has the unique scenery of mountains, rivers, forests, springs, waterfalls, gorges, and caves. Li Bai, a famous poet of the Tang dynasty, was inspired by the natural scenery and wrote this epigram.Specifically, the central urban area is located on a huge folding area. Yuzhong District, Nan'an District, Shapingba District and Jiangbei District are located right on a big syncline. And the \"Southern Mountain of Chongqing\" (Tongluo Mountain), along with the Zhongliang Mountain are two anticlines next to the syncline of downtown.Zhongliang Mountains (\u4e2d\u6881\u5c71) and Tongluo Mountains (\u94dc\u9523\u5c71) roughly forms the eastern and western boundaries of Chongqing's urban area. The highest point in downtown is the top of Eling Hill, which is a smaller syncline hill that keeps Yangtze River and Jialing River apart for some more kilometres. The elevation of Eling Hill is 379 metres (1,243 feet). The lowest point is Chaotian Gate, where the two rivers merge with each other. The altitude there is 160 metres (520 feet). The average height of the area is 259 metres (850 feet). However, there are several high mountains outside central Chongqing, such as the Wugong Ling Mountain, with the altitude of 1,709.4 metres (5,608 feet), in Jiangjin.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nChongqing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa), bordering on a monsoonal humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and for most of the year experiences very high relative humidity, with all months above 75%. Known as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" of the Yangtze river, along with Wuhan and Nanjing, its summers are long and among the hottest and most humid in China, with highs of 33 to 34 \u00b0C (91 to 93 \u00b0F) in July and August in the urban area. Winters are short and somewhat mild, but damp and overcast. The city's location in the Sichuan Basin causes it to have one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, at only 1,055 hours, lower than much of Northern Europe; the monthly percent possible sunshine in the city proper ranges from a mere 8% in December and January to 48% in August. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.8 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 15 December 1975 (unofficial record of \u22122.5 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) was set on 8 February 1943) to 43.0 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) on 15 August 2006 (unofficial record of 44.0 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F) was set on 8 and 9 August 1933).Chongqing, with over 100 days of fog per year, is known as the \"Fog City\" (\u96fe\u90fd), like San Francisco, and a thick layer of fog enshrouds it for 68 days per year during the spring and autumn. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, this special weather possibly played a role in protecting the city from being overrun by the Imperial Japanese Army.\nAs exemplified by Youyang County below, conditions are often cooler in the southeast part of the municipality due to the higher elevations there.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nChongqing has been, since 1997, a direct-controlled municipality in the Chinese administrative structure, making it a provincial-level division with commensurate political importance. The municipality's top leader is the secretary of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China (\"party chief\"), which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, the country's second highest governing council. Under the Soviet-inspired nomenklatura system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the Communist Party, and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include He Guoqiang, Wang Yang, Bo Xilai, Zhang Dejiang, and Sun Zhengcai, the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal party standing committee, the de facto top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.\nThe municipal People's Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor, who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.The municipality also has a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (zhengxie) meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The zhengxie is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.\n\n\n=== Military ===\nChongqing was the wartime capital of China during the Second Sino-Japanese war (i.e., World War II), and from 1938 to 1946, the seat of administration for the Republic of China's government before its departure to Nanjing and then Taiwan. After the eventual defeat at the Battle of Wuhan General Chiang-Kai Shek and the army were forced to use it as base of resistance from 1938 onwards. It also contains a military museum named after the Chinese Korean War hero Qiu Shaoyun.Chongqing used to be the headquarters of the 13th Group Army of the People's Liberation Army, one of the two group armies that formerly comprised the Chengdu Military Region, which in 2016 was re-organized into the Western Theater Command.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nChongqing is the largest of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China. The municipality is divided into 38 subdivisions (3 were abolished in 1997, and Wansheng and Shuangqiao districts were abolished in October 2011), consisting of 26 districts, 8 counties, and 4 autonomous counties. The boundaries of Chongqing municipality reach much farther into the city's hinterland than the boundaries of the other three provincial level municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and much of its administrative area, which spans over 80,000 square kilometres (30,900 sq mi), is rural. At the end of year 2017, the total population is 30.75 million.[1]\n\n\n==== Urban areas ====\n\na Indicates with which district the division was associated below prior to the merging of Chongqing, Fuling, Wanxian (now Wanzhou) and Qianjiang in 1997.\n\n\n==== Central Chongqing ====\n\nThe main urban area of Chongqing city (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e3b\u57ce\u533a) spans approximately 5,473 square kilometres (2,113 square miles), and includes the following nine districts:\nYuzhong District (\u6e1d\u4e2d\u533a, or \"Central Chongqing District\"), the central and most densely populated district, where government and international business offices and the city's best shopping are located in the district's Jeifangbei CBD area. Yuzhong is located on the peninsula surrounded by Eling Hill, Yangtze River and Jialing River.\nJiangbei District (\u6c5f\u5317\u533a, or \"River North District\"), located to the north of Jialing River.\nShapingba District (\u6c99\u576a\u575d\u533a), roughly located between Jialing River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nJiulongpo District (\u4e5d\u9f99\u5761\u533a), roughly located between Yangtze River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nNan'an District (\u5357\u5cb8\u533a, or \"Southern Bank District\"), located on the south side of Yangtze River.\nDadukou District (\u5927\u6e21\u53e3\u533a)\nBanan District (\u5df4\u5357\u533a, or \"Southern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Ba County, and changed to the current name in 1994. Its northern area merged into Chongqing, and its capital town Yudong is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nYubei District (\u6e1d\u5317\u533a, or \"Northern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Jiangbei County, and changed into the current name in 1994. Its southern area merged into Chongqing, and the capital town Lianglu Town is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nBeibei District (\u5317\u789a\u533a), a satellite city northwest of Chongqing.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAccording to a July 2010 article from the official Xinhua news agency, the municipality has a population of 32.8 million, including 23.3 million farmers. Among them, 8.4 million farmers have become migrant workers, including 3.9 million working and living in urban areas of Chongqing.\nThe metropolitan area encompassing the central urban area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 17 million.This would mean that the locally registered farmers who work in other jurisdictions number 4.5 million, reducing the local, year-round population of Chongqing in 2010 to 28.3 million, plus those who are registered in other jurisdictions but live and work in Chongqing. According to China's 2005 statistical yearbook, of a total population of 30.55 million, those with residence registered in other jurisdictions but residing in the Chongqing enumeration area numbered 1.4 million, including 46,000 who resided in Chongqing \"for less than half-year\". An additional 83,000 had registered in Chongqing, but not yet settled there.The 2005 statistical yearbook also lists 15.22 million (49.82%) males and 15.33 million (50.18%) females.In terms of age distribution in 2004, of the 30.55 million total population, 6.4 million (20.88%) were age 0\u201314, 20.7 million (67.69%) were 15\u201364, and 3.5 million (11.46%) were 65 and over.Of a total 10,470,000 households (2004), 1,360,000 consisted of one person, 2,940,000 two-person, 3,190,000 three-person, 1,790,000 four-person, 783,000 five-person, 270,000 six-person, 89,000 seven-person, 28,000 eight-person, 6,000 nine-person, and 10,000 households of 10 or more persons per household.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe predominant religions in Chongqing are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 26.63% of the population believes and is involved in cults of ancestors, while 1.05% of the population identifies as Christian.The reports didn't give figures for other types of religion; 72.32% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects.\n\n\n== Crime ==\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the city became notorious for organised crime and corruption. Gangsters oversaw businesses involving billions of yuan and the corruption reached into the law-enforcement and justice systems. In 2009, city authorities under the auspices of municipal Communist Party secretary Bo Xilai undertook a large-scale crackdown, arresting 4,893 suspected gangsters, \"outlaws\" and corrupt cadres, leading to optimism that the period of gangsterism was over. However, local media later highlighted the apparent reliance by the authorities on torture to extract confessions upon which convictions were based. In December 2009, one defence lawyer was controversially arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison for \"coaching his client to make false claims of torture\" and in July 2010, another lawyer released videotapes of his client describing the torture in detail. In 2014, four policemen involved in the interrogation were charged with the practice of \"opposed illegal interrogation techniques\", considered by observers to be torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nChongqing was separated from Sichuan province and made into a municipality in its own right in 14 March 1997 in order to accelerate its development and subsequently China's relatively poorer western areas (see China Western Development strategy). An important industrial area in western China, Chongqing is also rapidly urbanising. For instance, statistics suggest that new construction added approximately 137,000 square metres (1,470,000 square feet) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. In addition, more than 1,300 people moved into the city daily, adding almost 100 million yuan (US$15 million) to the local economy.\nTraditionally, due to its geographical remoteness, Chongqing and neighbouring Sichuan have been important military bases in weapons research and development. Chongqing's industries have now diversified but unlike eastern China, its export sector is small due to its inland location. Instead, factories producing local-oriented consumer goods such as processed food, cars, chemicals, textiles, machinery, sports equipment and electronics  are common.\nChongqing is China's third largest centre for motor vehicle production and the largest for motorcycles. In 2007, it had an annual output capacity of 1 million cars and 8.6 million motorcycles. Leading makers of cars and motor bikes includes China's fourth biggest automaker; Changan Automotive Corp and Lifan Hongda Enterprise, as well as Ford Motor Company, with the US car giant having 3 plants in Chongqing.  The municipality is also one of the nine largest iron and steel centres in China and one of the three major aluminium producers. Important manufacturers include Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and South West Aluminium which is Asia's largest aluminium plant. Agriculture remains significant. Rice and fruits, especially oranges, are the area's main produce. Natural resources are also abundant with large deposits of coal, natural gas, and more than 40 kinds of minerals such as strontium and manganese. Coal reserves \u2248 4.8 billion tonnes. Chuandong Natural Gas Field is China's largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270 billion m3 \u2013 more than 1/5 of China's total. Has China's largest reserve of strontium (China has the world's 2nd biggest strontium deposit). Manganese is mined in the Xiushan area. although the mining sector has been criticised for being wasteful, heavily polluting and unsafe. Chongqing is also planned to be the site of a 10 million ton capacity refinery operated by CNPC (parent company of PetroChina) to process imported crude oil from the Sino-Burma pipelines. The pipeline itself, though not yet finished, will eventually run from Sittwe (in Myanmar's western coast) through Kunming in Yunnan before reaching Chongqing and it will provide China with fuels sourced from Myanmar, the Middle East and Africa. Recently, there has been a drive to move up the value chain by shifting towards high technology and knowledge intensive industries resulting in new development zones such as the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ). Chongqing's local government is hoping through the promotion of favorable economic policies for the electronics and information technology sectors, that it can create a 400 billion RMB high technology manufacturing hub which will surpass its car industry and account for 25% of its exports.The city has also invested heavily in infrastructure to attract investment. The network of roads and railways connecting Chongqing to the rest of China has been expanded and upgraded reducing logistical costs. Furthermore, the nearby Three Gorges Dam which is the world's largest, supplies Chongqing with power and allows oceangoing ships to reach Chongqing's Yangtze River port. These infrastructure improvements have led to the arrivals of numerous foreign direct investors (FDI) in industries ranging from car to finance and retailing; such as Ford, Mazda, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, ANZ Bank, Scotiabank, Wal-Mart, Metro AG and Carrefour, among other multinational corporations.\nChongqing's nominal GDP in 2011 reached 1001.1 billion yuan (US$158.9 billion) while registering an annual growth of 16.4%. However, its overall economic performance is still lagging behind eastern coastal cities such as Shanghai. For instance, its per capita GDP was 22,909 yuan (US$3,301) which is below the national average. Nevertheless, there is a massive government support to transform Chongqing into the region's economic, trade, and financial centre and use the municipality as a platform to open up the country's western interior to further development.Chongqing has been identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei, Anshan, Maanshan, Pingdingshan and Shenyang), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China.\n\n\n=== Economic and technological development zones ===\nThe city includes a number of economic and technological development zones:\n\nChongqing Chemical Industrial Park\nChongqing Economic & Technological Development Zone\nChongqing Hi-Tech Industry Development Zone\nChongqing New North Zone (CNNZ)\nChongqing Export Processing Zone\nJianqiao Industrial Park (located in Dadukou District)\nLiangjiang New Area\nLiangjiang Cloud Computing Center (the largest of its kind in China)Chongqing itself is part of the West Triangle Economic Zone, along with Chengdu and Xi'an.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nChongqing University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University of Political Science and Law (\u897f\u5357\u653f\u6cd5\u5927\u5b66)\nThird Military Medical University (\u7b2c\u4e09\u519b\u533b\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (\u91cd\u5e86\u90ae\u7535\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u7406\u5de5\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Jiaotong University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Medical University (\u91cd\u5e86\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Normal University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e08\u8303\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Technology and Business University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5de5\u5546\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Three Gorges University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e09\u5ce1\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing Telecommunication Institute (\u91cd\u5e86\u901a\u8baf\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Science and Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u79d1\u6280\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan Fine Arts Institute (\u56db\u5ddd\u7f8e\u672f\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan International Studies University (\u56db\u5ddd\u5916\u56fd\u8bed\u5927\u5b66)\nUniversity of Logistics (\u540e\u52e4\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Arts and Science (\u91cd\u5e86\u6587\u7406\u5b66\u9662)\nYangtze Normal University (\u957f\u6c5f\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Education (\u91cd\u5e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\n\n\n=== Notable high schools ===\nFuling Experimental High School (\u6daa\u9675\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.1 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u4e2d)\nChongqing Nankai Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5357\u5f00\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.8 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u516b\u4e2d)\nBashu Secondary School (\u5df4\u8700\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Railway High School (\u91cd\u5e86\u94c1\u8def\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Yucai Secondary School (\u80b2\u624d\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Foreign Language School (The High School Affiliated to Sichuan International Studies University \u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u5916)\nVerakin High School of Chongqing (The 2nd Chongqing Foreign Language School, \u91cd\u5e86\u4e8c\u5916)\nChongqing Qiujing High School (\u6c42\u7cbe\u4e2d\u5b66)\nHigh School Affiliated to Southwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u4e2d)\nChongqing NO.18 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5341\u516b\u4e2d)\n\n\n=== International schools ===\nYew Chung International School of Chongqing (\u91cd\u5e86\u8000\u4e2d\u56fd\u9645\u5b66\u6821)\nKL International School of Chongqing Bashu (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e02\u8bfa\u6797\u5df4\u8700\u5916\u7c4d\u4eba\u5458\u5b50\u5973\u5b66\u6821)\n\n\n== Transport ==\nSince its elevation to national-level municipality in 1997, the city has dramatically expanded its transportation infrastructure. With the construction of railways and expressways to the east and southeast, Chongqing is a major transportation hub in southwestern China.\nAs of October 2014, the municipality had 31 bridges across the Yangtze River including over a dozen in the city's urban core. Aside from the city's first two Yangtze River bridges, which were built, respectively, in 1960 and 1977, all of the other bridges were completed since 1995.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nPublic transport in Chongqing consists of metro, intercity railway, a ubiquitous bus system and the world's largest monorail network.\nAccording to the Chongqing Municipal Government's ambitious plan in May 2007, Chongqing is investing 150 billion RMB over 13 years to finish a system that combines underground metro lines with heavy monorail (called 'light rail' in China).\nAs of 2017, four metro lines, the 14 km (8.7 mi) long CRT Line 1, a conventional subway, and the 19 km (12 mi) long heavy monorail CRT Line 2 (through Phase II), Line 3, a heavy monorail connects the airport and the southern part of downtown., Line 6, runs between Beibei, a commuter city in the far north to the centre. Line 5 opened in late 2017.\nBy 2020 CRT will consist of 6 straight lines and 1 circular line resulting in 363.5 km (225.9 mi) of road and railway to the existing transportation infrastructure and 93 new train stations will be added to the 111 stations that are already in place.By 2050, Chongqing will have as many as 18 lines planned to be in operation.\n\n\n==== Aerial tramway ====\n\nChongqing is the only Chinese city that keeps public aerial tramways. Historically there were three aerial tramways in Chongqing: the Yangtze River Tramway, the Jialing River Tramway and the South Mountain Tramway. Currently, only Yangtze River Tramway is still operating and it is Class 4A Tourist Attractions in China. This tramway is 1,160 metres (3,810 feet) long, connecting the southern and northern banks of Yangtze River. The daily passenger volume is about 10,000.\n\n\n=== River port ===\n\nChongqing is one of the most important inland ports in China. There are numerous luxury cruise ships that terminate at Chongqing, cruising downstream along the Yangtze River to Yichang, Wuhan, Nanjing or even Shanghai. In the recent past, this provided virtually the only transportation option along the river. However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several port handling facilities exist throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nMajor train stations in Chongqing:\n\nChongqing railway station in Yuzhong, accessible via Metro Lines 1 & 3 (Lianglukou Metro station), is the city's oldest railway station and located near the city centre. The station handles mostly long-distance trains. There are plans for a major renovation and overhaul of this station, thus many services have been transferred to Chongqing North Railway Station.\nChongqing North railway station is a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to Chengdu, Beijing and other cities. It was completed in 2006 and is connected to Metro Line.\nChongqing West railway station is in Shapingba, a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to many cities. It is completed in 2018.\nShapingba railway station is in Shapingba, near Shapingba CBD, accessible via Metro Line 1. It handles many local and regional train services. It is completed in 2018.Chongqing is a major freight destination for rail with continued development with improved handling facilities. Due to subsidies and incentives, the relocation and construction of many factories in Chongqing has seen a huge increase in rail traffic.\nChongqing is a major rail hub regionally.\n\nChengdu\u2013Chongqing railway to Chengdu\nSichuan-Guizhou railway to Guiyang\nXiangyang\u2013Chongqing railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Huaihua railway to Hunan\nChongqing-Suining railway (Sichuan province)\nChongqing-Lichuan railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Lanzhou railway (Gansu) railway\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nTraditionally, the road network in Chongqing has been narrow, winding and limited to smaller vehicles because of the natural terrain, large rivers and the huge population demands on the area, especially in the Yuzhong District. In other places, such as Jiangbei, large areas of homes and buildings have recently been cleared to improve the road network and create better urban planning. This has seen many tunnels and large bridges needing to be built across the city. Construction of many expressways have connected Chongqing to neighbouring provinces. Several ring roads have also been constructed. The natural mountainous terrain that Chongqing is built on makes many road projects difficult to construct, including for example some of the world's highest road bridges.Unlike many other Chinese cities, it is rare for motorbikes, electric scooters or bicycles to be seen on Chongqing Roads. This is due to the extremely hilly and mountainous nature of Chongqing's roads and streets. However, despite this, Chongqing is a large manufacturing centre for these types of vehicles.\nChongqing-Chengdu Expressway\nChongqing-Chengdu 2nd Expressway (under construction)\nChongqing-Wanzhou-Yichang Highway (Wanzhou-Yichang section under construction)\nChongqing-Guiyang Highway\nChongqing-Changsha Expressway (Xiushan-Changsha section under construction)\nChongqing-Dazhou-Xi'a Highway (Dazhou-Xi'an section under construction)\nChongqing-Suining Expressway\nChongqing-Nanchong Expressway\nChina National Highway 210\nChina National Highway 212\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nWith so many bridges crossing the Yangtze and Jialing rivers in the urban area, Chongqing is sometimes known as the 'Bridge Capital of China'. The first important bridge in urban Chongqing was the Niujiaotuo Jialing River Bridge, built in 1958. The first bridge over the Yangtze river was the Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge (or Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge) built in 1977.\nAs of 2014, within the area of the 9 districts, there were 20 bridges on the Yangtze river and 28 bridges on the Jialing river. The bridges in Chongqing exhibit a variety of shapes and structures, making Chongqing a showcase for bridge design.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe major airport of Chongqing is Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport (IATA: CKG, ICAO: ZUCK). It is located in Yubei District. The airport offers a growing network of direct flights to China, South East Asia, the Middle East, North America, and Europe. It is located 21 km (13 mi) north of the city-centre of Chongqing and serves as an important aviation hub for south-western China. Jiangbei airport is a hub for China Southern Airlines, Chongqing Airlines, Sichuan Airlines, China Express Airlines, Shandong Airlines and Hainan Airlines's new China West Air. Chongqing also is a focus city of Air China, therefore it is very well connected with Star Alliance and Skyteam's international network. The airport currently has three parallel runways in operation. It serves domestic routes to most other Chinese cities, as well as international routes to Auckland, New York City, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, Doha, Dubai, Seoul, Bangkok, Phuket, Osaka, Singapore, Chiang Mai, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Mal\u00e9, Bali, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Batam, Rome and Helsinki. As of 2018, Jiangbei Airport is the 9th busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic in mainland China.Currently, Jiangbei airport has three terminals. Chongqing Airport has metro access (CRT Line 3 and Line 10) to its central city, and two runways in normal use.There are two other airports in Chongqing Municipality: Qianjiang Wulingshan Airport (IATA: JIQ, ICAO: ZUQJ) and Wanzhou Wuqiao Airport (IATA: WXN, ICAO: ZUWX). They are both class 4C airports and serve passenger flights to some domestic destinations including Beijing, Shanghai and Kunming. Two more airports are being constructed soon: Wulong Xiann\u00fcshan Airport and Wushan Shenn\u00fcfeng Airport.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe language native to Chongqing is Southwestern Mandarin. More precisely, the great majority of the municipality, save for Xiushan, speak Sichuanese, including the primary Chengdu-Chongqing dialect and Minjiang dialect spoken in Jiangjin and Qijiang. There are also a few speakers of Xiang and Hakka in the municipality, due to the great immigration wave to the Sichuan region (\u6e56\u5e7f\u586b\u56db\u5ddd) during the Ming and Qing dynasties. In addition, in parts of southeastern Chongqing, the Miao and Tujia languages are also used by some Miao and Tujia people.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAs the provisional Capital of China for almost ten years (1937 to 1945), the city was also known as one of the three headquarters of the Allies during World War II, as well as being a strategic center of many other wars throughout China's history. Chongqing has many historic war-time buildings or sites, some of which have since been destroyed. These sites include the People's Liberation Monument, located in the center of Chongqing city. It used to be the highest building in the area, but is now surrounded and dwarfed by numerous shopping centres. Originally named the Monument for the Victory over Axis Armies, it is the only building in China for that purpose. Today, the monument serves as a symbol for the city. The General Joseph W. Stilwell Museum, dedicated to General \"Vinegar Joe\" Stilwell, a World War II general. the air force cemetery in the Nanshan area, in memory of those air force personnel killed during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), and the Red Rock Village Museum, a diplomatic site for the Communist Party in Chongqing led by Zhou Enlai during World War II, and Guiyuan, Cassia Garden, where Mao Zedong signed the \"Double 10 (10 October) Peace Agreement\" with the Kuomintang in 1945.\n\nThe Baiheliang Underwater Museum, China's first underwater museum,\nThe Memorial of Great Tunnel Massacre, a former air-raid shelter where a major massacre occurred during World War II.\nThe Great Hall of the People in Chongqing is based on the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Chongqing is known for its spicy food. Its food is normally considered numbing because of the use of Sichuan pepper, also known as Sichuan peppercorn, containing hydroxy alpha sanshool. Chongqing's city centre has many restaurants and food stalls where meals often cost less than RMB10. Local specialties here include dumplings and pickled vegetables and, different from many other Chinese cuisines, Chongqing dishes are suitable for the solo diner as they are often served in small individual sized portions.

        "wiki": "The Yangtze or Yangzi (English:   or ) is the longest river in Asia, the third-longest in the world and the longest in the world to flow entirely within one country. It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains (Tibetan Plateau) and flows 6,300 km (3,900 mi) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea. It is the sixth-largest river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country's population.The Yangtze has played a major role in the history, culture and economy of China. For thousands of years, the river has been used for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking and war. The prosperous Yangtze River Delta generates as much as 20% of China's GDP. The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world. In mid-2014, the Chinese government announced it was building a multi-tier transport network, comprising railways, roads and airports, to create a new economic belt alongside the river.The Yangtze flows through a wide array of ecosystems and is habitat to several endemic and threatened species including the Chinese alligator, the narrow-ridged finless porpoise and the Yangtze sturgeon, but also was the home of the extinct Yangtze river dolphin (or baiji) and Chinese paddlefish. In recent years, the river has suffered from industrial pollution, plastic pollution, agricultural runoff, siltation, and loss of wetland and lakes, which exacerbates seasonal flooding. Some sections of the river are now protected as nature reserves. A stretch of the upstream Yangtze flowing through deep gorges in western Yunnan is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Names ==\n\n\n=== Chinese ===\nBecause the source of the Yangtze was not ascertained until modern times, the Chinese have given different names to lower and upstream sections of the river.\n\n\n==== Chang Jiang \u2013 \"Long River\" ====\nCh\u00e1ng Ji\u0101ng (\u957f\u6c5f; \u9577\u6c5f) is the modern Chinese name for the lower 2,884 km (1,792 mi) of the Yangtze from its confluence with the Min River at Yibin in Sichuan to the river mouth at Shanghai.  Chang Jiang literally means the \"Long River.\"  In Old Chinese, this stretch of the Yangtze was simply called Jiang/Kiang   \u6c5f, a character of phono-semantic compound origin, combining the water radical \u6c35 with the homophone \u5de5 (now pronounced g\u014dng, but *k\u02e4o\u014b in Old Chinese). Krong was probably a word in the Austroasiatic language of local peoples such as the Yue. Similar to *krong in Proto-Vietnamese and krung in Mon, all meaning \"river\", it is related to modern Vietnamese s\u00f4ng (river) and Khmer k\u00f4ngkea (water).By the Han dynasty, Ji\u0101ng had come to mean any river in Chinese, and this river was distinguished as the \"Great River\" \u5927\u6c5f (D\u00e0ji\u0101ng).  The epithet \u9577 (simplified version \u957f), means \"long\", was first formally applied to the river during the Six Dynasties period.Various sections of the Yangtze have local names. From Yibin to Yichang, the river through Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality is also known as the Chu\u0101n Ji\u0101ng (\u5ddd\u6c5f) or \"Sichuan River.\"\nIn Hubei, the river is also called the J\u012bng Ji\u0101ng (\u8346\u6c5f) or the \"Jing River\" after Jingzhou.  In Anhui, the river takes on the local name W\u01cen Ji\u0101ng after the shorthand name for Anhui, w\u01cen (\u7696).  And Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0 Ji\u0101ng (\u63da\u5b50\u6c5f; \u626c\u5b50\u6c5f) or the \"Yangzi River\", from which the English name Yangtze is derived, is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou. The name likely comes from an ancient ferry crossing called Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0 or Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0j\u012bn (\u63da\u5b50 / \u63da\u5b50\u6d25). Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river. The dividing site between upstream and midstream is considered to be at Yichang and that between midstream and downstream at Hukou (Jiujiang).\n\n\n==== Jinsha Jiang \u2013 \"Gold Sands River\" ====\nThe Jinsha River (Chinese: \u91d1\u6c99\u6c5f; lit.: 'Gold Dust or Golden-Sanded River') is the name for 2,308 km (1,434 mi) of the Yangtze from Yibin upstream to the confluence with the Batang River near Yushu in Qinghai.  From antiquity until the Ming dynasty, this stretch of the river was believed to be a tributary of the Yangtze while the Min River was thought to be the main course of the river above Yibin.  The name \"Jinsha\" originates in the Song dynasty when the river attracted large numbers of gold prospectors.  Gold prospecting along the Jinsha continues to this day. Prior to the Song dynasty, other names were used including, for example L\u00faji\u0101ng (\u7018\u6c5f) from the Three Kingdoms period.\n\n\n==== Tongtian River ====\nThe Tongtian River (Chinese: \u901a\u5929\u6cb3; lit.: 'River Passing Through Heaven') describes the 813 km (505 mi) section from Yushu up to the confluence with the Dangqu River.  The name comes from a fabled river in the Journey to the West.  In antiquity, it was called the Yak River.  In Mongolian, this section is known as the Murui-ussu (lit. \"Winding Stream\"). and sometimes confused with the nearby Baishui.\n\n\n==== Tuotuo River ====\nThe Tuotuo River (\u6cb1\u6cb1\u6cb3; Tu\u00f3tu\u00f3 H\u00e9; 'Tearful River') is the official headstream of the Yangtze, and flows 358 km (222 mi) from the glaciers of the Gar Kangri and the Geladandong Massifs in the Tanggula Mountains of southwestern Qinghai to the confluence with the Dangqu River to form the Tongtian River.   In Mongolian, this section of the river known as the Ulaan M\u00f6r\u00f6n or the \"Red River.\"\nThe Tuotuo is one of three main headstreams of the Yangtze.  The Dangqu River (\u5f53\u66f2, p D\u0101ngq\u016b) is the actual geographic headwater of the Yangtze. The name is derived the Classical Tibetan for \"Marsh River\" (\u0f60\u0f51\u0f58\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f74, w 'Dam Chu).  The Chumar River (\u695a\u739b\u5c14\u6cb3) is the Chinese name for the northern headwater of the Yangtze, which flows from the Hoh Xil Mountains in Qinghai into the Tongtian.  Chumar is Tibetan for the \"Red River.\"\n\n\n=== English ===\n\nThe river was called Quian (\u6c5f) and Quianshui (\u6c5f\u6c34) by Marco Polo and appeared on the earliest English maps as Kian or Kiam, all recording dialects which preserved forms of the Middle Chinese pronunciation of \u6c5f as K\u00e6wng. By the mid-19th century, these romanizations had standardized as Kiang; Dajiang, e.g., was rendered as \"Ta-Kiang.\" \"Keeang-Koo,\" \"Kyang Kew,\" \"Kian-ku,\" and related names derived from mistaking the Chinese term for the mouth of the Yangtze (\u6c5f\u53e3, p Ji\u0101ngk\u01d2u) as the name of the river itself.\n\nThe name Blue River began to be applied in the 18th century, apparently owing to a former name of the Dam Chu or Min and to analogy with the Yellow River, but it was frequently explained in early English references as a 'translation' of Jiang, Jiangkou, or Yangzijiang. Very common in 18th- and 19th-century sources, the name fell out of favor due to growing awareness of its lack of any connection to the river's Chinese names and to the irony of its application to such a muddy waterway.Matteo Ricci's 1615 Latin account included descriptions of the \"Ian\u017fu\" and \"Ian\u017fuchian.\" The posthumous account's translation of the name as \"Son of the Ocean\" shows that Ricci, who by the end of his life was fluent in literary Chinese, was introduced to it as the homophonic \u6d0b\u5b50\u6c5f rather than the 'proper' \u63da\u5b50\u6c5f. Further, although railroads and the Shanghai concessions subsequently turned it into a backwater, Yangzhou was the lower river's principal port for much of the Qing dynasty, directing Liangjiang's important salt monopoly and connecting the Yangtze with the Grand Canal to Beijing. (That connection also made it one of the Yellow River's principal ports between the floods of 1344 and the 1850s, during which time the Yellow River ran well south of Shandong and discharged into the ocean only a few hundred kilometres away from the mouth of the Yangtze.) By 1800, English cartographers such as Aaron Arrowsmith had adopted the French style of the name as Yang-tse or Yang-tse Kiang. The British diplomat Thomas Wade emended this to Yang-tzu Chiang as part of his formerly popular romanization of Chinese, based on the Beijing dialect instead of Nanjing's and first published in 1867. The spellings Yangtze and Yangtze Kiang was a compromise between the two methods adopted at the 1906 Imperial Postal Conference in Shanghai, which established postal romanization. Hanyu Pinyin was adopted by the PRC's First Congress in 1958, but it was not widely employed in English outside mainland China prior to the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the PRC in 1979; since that time, the spelling Yangzi has also been used.\n\n\n=== Tibetan ===\n\nThe source and upper reaches of the Yangtze are located in ethnic Tibetan areas of Qinghai. In Tibetan, the Tuotuo headwaters are the Machu (\u0f62\u0fa8\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f74\u0f0b, w rMa-chu, literally \"Red River\" or (perhaps \"Wound-[like Red] River?\")). The Tongtian is the Drichu (\u0f60\u0f56\u0fb2\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f74\u0f0b, w 'Bri Chu, literally \"River of the Female Yak\"; transliterated into Chinese as \u76f4\u66f2, p Zh\u00edq\u016b).\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe river originates from several tributaries in the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, two of which are commonly referred to as the \"source.\"  Traditionally, the Chinese government has recognized the source as the Tuotuo tributary at the base of a glacier lying on the west of Geladandong Mountain in the Tanggula Mountains.  This source is found at 33\u00b025\u203244\u2033N 91\u00b010\u203257\u2033E and while not the furthest source of the Yangtze, it is the highest source at 5,342 m (17,526 ft) above sea level.  The true source of the Yangtze, hydrologically the longest river distance from the sea, is at Jari Hill at the head of the Dam Qu tributary, approximately 325 km (202 mi) southeast of Geladandong. This source was only discovered in the late 20th century and lies in wetlands at 32\u00b036\u203214\u2033N 94\u00b030\u203244\u2033E and 5,170 m (16,960 ft) above sea level just southeast of Chadan Township in Zadoi County, Yushu Prefecture, Qinghai. As the historical spiritual source of the Yangtze, the Geladandong source is still commonly referred to as the source of the Yangtze since the discovery of the Jari Hill source.These tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through Qinghai (Tsinghai), turning southward down a deep valley at the border of Sichuan (Szechwan) and Tibet to reach Yunnan. In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above 5,000 m (16,000 ft) to less than 1,000 m (3,300 ft). The headwaters of the Yangtze are situated at an elevation of about 4,900 m (16,100 ft). In its descent to sea level, the river falls to an altitude of 305 m (1,001 ft) at Yibin, Sichuan, the head of navigation for riverboats, and to 192 m (630 ft) at Chongqing (Chungking). Between Chongqing and Yichang (I-ch'ang), at an altitude of 40 m (130 ft) and a distance of about 320 km (200 mi), it passes through the spectacular Yangtze Gorges, which are noted for their natural beauty but are dangerous to shipping.\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at Yibin. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through Mount Wushan bordering Chongqing and Hubei to create the famous Three Gorges. Eastward of the Three Gorges, Yichang is the first city on the Yangtze Plain.\nAfter entering Hubei, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.\nThe origin of the Yangtze River has been dated by some geologists to about 45 million years ago in the Eocene, but this dating has been disputed.\n\n\n=== Image gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe Yangtze flows into the East China Sea and was navigable by ocean-going vessels up 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from its mouth even before the Three Gorges Dam was built.The Yangtze is flanked with metallurgical, power, chemical, auto, building materials and machinery industrial belts and high-tech development zones. It is playing an increasingly crucial role in the river valley's economic growth and has become a vital link for international shipping to the inland provinces. The river is a major transportation artery for China, connecting the interior with the coast.\nThe river is one of the world's busiest waterways. Traffic includes commercial traffic transporting bulk goods such as coal as well as manufactured goods and passengers. Cargo transportation reached 795 million tons in 2005. River cruises several days long, especially through the beautiful and scenic Three Gorges area, are becoming popular as the tourism industry grows in China.\nFlooding along the river has been a major problem. The rainy season in China is May and June in areas south of Yangtze River, and July and August in areas north of it. The huge river system receives water from both southern and northern flanks, which causes its flood season to extend from May to August. Meanwhile, the relatively dense population and rich cities along the river make the floods more deadly and costly. The most recent major floods were the 1998 Yangtze River Floods, but more disastrous were the 1954 Yangtze River Floods, which killed around 30,000 people.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Geologic history ===\nAlthough the mouth of the Yellow River has fluctuated widely north and south of the Shandong peninsula within the historical record, the Yangtze has remained largely static. Based on studies of sedimentation rates, however, it is unlikely that the present discharge site predates the late Miocene (c.\u200911 Ma). Prior to this, its headwaters drained south into the Gulf of Tonkin along or near the course of the present Red River.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Yangtze River is important to the cultural origins of southern China and Japan. Human activity has been verified in the Three Gorges area as far back as 27,000 years ago, and by the 5th millennium BC, the lower Yangtze was a major population center occupied by the Hemudu and Majiabang cultures, both among the earliest cultivators of rice. By the 3rd millennium  BC, the successor Liangzhu culture showed evidence of influence from the Longshan peoples of the North China Plain. What is now thought of as Chinese culture developed along the more fertile Yellow River basin; the \"Yue\" people of the lower Yangtze possessed very different traditions \u2013 blackening their teeth, cutting their hair short, tattooing their bodies, and living in small settlements among bamboo groves \u2013 and were considered barbarous by the northerners.\nThe Central Yangtze valley was home to sophisticated Neolithic cultures. Later it became the earliest part of the Yangtze valley to be integrated into the North Chinese cultural sphere. (Northern Chinese were active there from the Bronze Age).\n\nIn the lower Yangtze, two Yue tribes, the Gouwu in southern Jiangsu and the Yuyue in northern Zhejiang, display increasing Zhou (i.e., North Chinese) influence from the 9th century BC. Traditional accounts credit these changes to northern refugees (Taibo and Zhongyong in Wu and Wuyi in Yue) who assumed power over the local tribes, though these are generally assumed to be myths invented to legitimate them to other Zhou rulers. As the kingdoms of Wu and Yue, they were famed as fishers, shipwrights, and sword-smiths. Adopting Chinese characters, political institutions, and military technology, they were among the most powerful states during the later Zhou. In the middle Yangtze, the state of Jing seems to have begun in the upper Han River valley a minor Zhou polity, but it adapted to native culture as it expanded south and east into the Yangtze valley. In the process, it changed its name to Chu.Whether native or nativizing, the Yangtze states held their own against the northern Chinese homeland: some lists credit them with three of the Spring and Autumn period's Five Hegemons and one of the Warring States' Four Lords. They fell in against themselves, however. Chu's growing power led its rival Jin to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu's capital Ying in 506 BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu's southern flank. In 473 BC, King Goujian of Yue fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its eponymous capital at modern Suzhou. In 333 BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the Minyue kingdom in Fujian. Qin was able to unite China by first subduing Ba and Shu on the upper Yangtze in modern Sichuan, giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river.\nThe state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region, previous heartland of Chu, in 278 BC, and incorporated the region into its expanding empire. Qin then used its connections along the Yangtze River the Xiang River to expand China into Hunan, Jiangxi and Guangdong, setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the collapse of the Qin Dynasty, these southern commanderies became the independent Nanyue Empire under Zhao Tuo while Chu and Han vied with each other for control of the north.\nFrom the Han dynasty, the region of the Yangtze River grew ever more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is Dujiangyan, northwest of Chengdu, built during the Warring States period) made agriculture very stable and productive, eventually exceeding even the Yellow River region. The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands, maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods. By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river. Early in the Qing dynasty, the region called Jiangnan (that includes the southern part of Jiangsu, the northern part of Zhejiang, and the southeastern part of Anhui) provided \u200b1\u20443\u2013\u200b1\u20442 of the nation's revenues.\nThe Yangtze has long been the backbone of China's inland water transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The Grand Canal connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the Jiangnan region south of the river (Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou) and with northern China (all the way from Yangzhou to Beijing). The less well known ancient Lingqu Canal, connecting the upper Xiang River with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the Pearl River Delta.Historically, the Yangtze became the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see History of China) because of the difficulty of crossing the river. This occurred notably during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the Southern Song. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD during the Three Kingdoms period.\nThe Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the Song dynasty and Jurchen Jin during the Jin\u2013Song wars. In the Battle of Caishi of 1161, the ships of the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang clashed with the Song fleet on the Yangtze. Song soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulphur using trebuchets at the Jurchen warships. The battle was a Song victory that halted the invasion by the Jin. The Battle of Tangdao was another Yangtze naval battle from the same year.\nPolitically, Nanjing was the capital of China several times, although most of the time its territory only covered the southeastern part of China, such as the Wu kingdom in the Three Kingdoms period, the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and during the Southern and Northern Dynasties and Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms periods. Only the Ming occupied most parts of China from their capital at Nanjing, though it later moved the capital to Beijing. The ROC capital was located in Nanjing in the periods 1911\u201312, 1927\u201337, and 1945\u201349.\n\n\n=== Age of steam ===\n\nThe first merchant steamer in China, the Jardine, was built to order for the firm of Jardine Matheson in 1835. She was a small vessel intended for use as a mail and passenger carrier between Lintin Island, Macau and Whampoa. However, after several trips, the Chinese authorities, for reasons best known to themselves, prohibited her entrance into the river. Lord Palmerston, the British Foreign Secretary who personified gunboat diplomacy, decided to wage war on China mainly on the \"suggestions\" of Jardine Matheson. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannon fire aimed at a British ship, the Royal Saxon, the British started the First Opium War. The Imperial Government, forced to surrender, gave in to the demands of the British. British military was vastly superior during the conflict. British warships, constructed using such innovations as steam power combined with sail and the use of iron in shipbuilding, wreaked havoc on coastal towns; such ships (like the Nemesis) were not only virtually indestructible using contemporary available weapons, but also highly mobile and able to support a gun platform with very heavy guns. In addition, the British troops were armed with modern rifled muskets and cannons, unlike the Qing forces. After the British took Canton, they sailed up the Yangtze and took the tax barges, a devastating blow to the Empire as it slashed the revenue of the imperial court in Beijing to just a small fraction of what it had been.\nIn 1842, the Qing authorities sued for peace, which concluded with the Treaty of Nanking signed on a gunboat in the river, negotiated in August of that year and ratified in 1843. In the treaty, China was forced to pay an indemnity to Britain, open five ports to Britain, and cede Hong Kong to Queen Victoria. In the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, the Qing empire also recognized Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects extraterritorial privileges in treaty ports.\n\n\n=== U.S. and French conflicts ===\nThe US, at the same time, wanting to protect its interests and expand trade, ventured the USS Wachusett six hundred miles up the river to Hankow sometime in the 1860s, while the USS Ashuelot, a sidewheeler, made her way up the river to Yichang in 1874. The first USS Monocacy, a sidewheel gunboat, began charting the Yangtze River in 1871. The first USS Palos, an armed tug, was on Asiatic Station into 1891, cruising the Chinese and Japanese coasts, visiting the open treaty ports and making occasional voyages up the Yangtze River. From June to September 1891, anti-foreign riots up the Yangtze forced the warship to make an extended voyage as far as Hankou, 600 miles upriver. Stopping at each open treaty port, the gunboat cooperated with naval vessels of other nations and repairing damage. She then operated along the north and central China coast and on the lower Yangtze until June 1892. The cessation of bloodshed with the Taiping Rebellion, Europeans put more steamers on the river. The French engaged the Chinese in war over the rule of Vietnam. The Sino-French Wars of the 1880s emerged with the Battle of Shipu having French cruisers in the lower Yangtze.\n\nThe China Navigation Company was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated. Most of the company's ships were seized by Japan in 1941 and services did not resume until 1946. Robert Dollar was a later shipping magnate, who became enormously influential moving Californian and Canadian lumber to the Chinese and Japanese market.\nYichang, or Ichang, 1,600 km (990 mi) from the sea, is the head of navigation for river steamers; oceangoing vessels may navigate the river to Hankow, a distance of almost 1,000 km (620 mi) from the sea. For about 320 km (200 mi) inland from its mouth, the river is virtually at sea level.\nThe Chinese Government, too, had steamers. It had its own naval fleet, the Nanyang Fleet, which fell prey to the French fleet. The Chinese would rebuild its fleet, only to be ravaged by another war with Japan (1895), Revolution (1911) and ongoing inefficiency and corruption. Chinese companies ran their own steamers, but were second tier to European operations at the time.\n\n\n=== Navigation on the upper river ===\n\nSteamers came late to the upper river, the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But summer was better navigationally and the three gorges, described as an \"150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass,\" posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 \u2013 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70\u201380 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges. Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the Chefoo Convention opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built Kuling but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes.  Kuling was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service.  In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native crafts.  In 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade.  Little took up residence in Chongqing and built Leechuan, to tackle the gorges in 1898.  In March Leechuan completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers.  Leechuan was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot. In 1898, Little persuaded Captain Samuel Cornell Plant to come out to China to lend his expertise.  Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia's Upper Karun River and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on Leechuan at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS Pioneer built with Plant in command.  In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing.  Pioneer was sold to British Royal Navy after its first run due to threat from the Boxer Rebellion and renamed HMS Kinsha.  Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS Suixing ended in catastrophe.  On Suixing's maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze.  In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing.  Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS Shutung and SS Shuhun. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too.  Plant was appointed by Chinese Maritime Customs Service as First Senior River Inspector in 1915.  In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems.  He also wrote Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River, a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction.  Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze.  Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield and Swire and Standard Oil added their own steamers on the river between 1917 and 1919.  Between 1918 and 1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business. Shutung was commandeered by warlords and Shuhun was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping. In 1921, when Captain Plant died tragically at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation.  The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie & Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots.  In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners.  One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English.  Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.Until 1881, the India and China coastal and river services were operated by several companies. In that year, however, these were merged into the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company Ltd, a public company under the management of Jardine's. The Jardine company pushed inland up the Yangtsze River on which a specially designed fleet was built to meet all requirements of the river trade. For many years, this fleet gave unequalled service. Jardine's established an enviable reputation for the efficient handling of shipping. As a result, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company invited the firm to attend to the Agency of their Shire Line which operated in the Far East. Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were all destroyed on December 12, 1937, when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.\n\n\n=== Navy ships ===\n\nWith the Treaty Ports, the European powers and Japan were allowed to sail navy ships into China's waters. The British, Americans, and French did this. A full international fleet featured on Chinese waters: Austro-Hungarian, Portuguese, Italian, Russian and German navy ships came to Shanghai and the treaty ports. The Japanese engaged in open warfare with the Chinese over conquest of the Chinese Qing Empire in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894\u20131895, and with Russia over Qing Empire territory in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905. Incidentally, both the French and Japanese navies were heavily involved in running opium and narcotics to Shanghai, where it was refined into morphine. It was then transhipped by liner back to Marseille and France (i.e. French Connection) for processing in Germany and eventual sale in the U.S. or Europe.\nIn 1909 the gunboat USS Samar changed station to Shanghai, where she regularly patrolled the lower Yangtze River up to Nanking and Wuhu. Following an anti-foreign riots in Changsha in April 1910, which destroyed a number of missions and merchant warehouses, Samar sailed up the Yangtze River to Hankow and then Changsa to show the flag and help restore order. The gunboat was also administratively assigned to the Asiatic Fleet that year, which had been reestablished by the Navy to better protect, in the words of the Bureau of Navigation, \"American interests in the Orient.\" After returning to Shanghai in August, she sailed up river again the following summer, passing Wuhu in June but then running aground off Kichau on July 1, 1911.\nAfter staying stuck in the mud for two weeks, Samar broke free and sailed back down river to coal ship. Returning upriver, the gunboat reached Hankow in August and Ichang in September where she wintered over owing to both the dry season and the outbreak of rebellion at Wuchang in October 1911. Tensions eased and the gunboat turned downriver in July 1912, arriving at Shanghai in October. Samar patrolled the lower Yangtze after fighting broke out in the summer 1913, a precursor to a decade of conflict between provincial warlords in China. In 1919, she was placed on the disposal list at Shanghai following a collision with a Yangtze River steamer that damaged her bow.\nThe Spanish boats were replaced in the 1920s by USS Luzon and USS Mindanao were the largest, USS Oahu and USS Panay next in size, and USS Guam and USS Tutuila the smallest. China in the first fifty years of the 20th century, was in low-grade chaos. Warlords, revolutions, natural disasters, civil war and invasions contributed. Yangtze boats were involved in the Nanking incident of 1927 when the Communists and Nationalists broke into open war. The Chiang Kai-shek's massacre of the Communists in Shanghai in 1927 furthered the unrest, U.S. Marines with tanks were landed. River steamers were popular targets for both Nationalists and Communists, and peasants who would take periodic pot-shots at vessels. During the course of service the second USS Palos protected American interests in China down the entire length of the Yangtze, at times convoying U.S. and foreign vessels on the river, evacuating American citizens during periods of disturbance and in general giving credible presence to U.S. consulates and residences in various Chinese cities. In the period of great unrest in central China in the 1920s, Palos was especially busy patrolling the upper Yangtze against bands of warlord soldiers and outlaws. The warship engaged in continuous patrol operations between Ichang and Chungking throughout 1923, supplying armed guards to merchant ships, and protecting Americans at Chungking while that city was under siege by a warlord army.\nThe British Royal Navy had a series of Insect-class gunboats which patrolled between Chungking and Shanghai. Cruisers and destroyers and Fly-class gunboats also patrolled. The most infamous incident was when Panay and HMS Bee in 1937, were dive-bombed by Japanese aeroplanes during the notorious Nanking massacre. The Westerners were forced to leave the Yangtze River with the Japanese takeover in 1941. The former steamers were either sabotaged or pressed into Japanese or Chinese service. Probably the most curious incident involved HMS Amethyst in 1949 during the Chinese Civil War between Kuomintang and People's Liberation Army forces; and led to the award of the Dickin Medal to the ship's cat Simon.\n\n\n=== Contemporary events ===\nIn August 2019, Welsh adventurer Ash Dykes became the first person to complete the 4,000-mile (6,437 km) trek along the course of the river, walking for 352 days from its source to its mouth.\n\n\n== Hydrology ==\n\n\n=== Periodic floods ===\n\nTens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes. The floods large enough to overflow the dikes have caused great distress to those who live and farm there. Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998.\nThe 1931 Central China floods or the Central China floods of 1931 were a series of floods that occurred in the Republic of China. The floods are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted). Estimates of the total death toll range from 145,000 to between 3.7 million and 4 million. The Yangtze again flooded in 1935, causing great loss of life.\nFrom June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at around 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.\nThe 1998 Yangtze River floods were a series of major floods that lasted from middle of June to the beginning of September 1998 along the Yangtze.\nIn the summer of 1998, China experienced massive flooding of parts of the Yangtze River, resulting in 3,704 dead, 15 million homeless and $26 billion in economic loss. Other sources report a total loss of 4150 people, and 180 million people were affected. A staggering 25 million acres (100,000 km2) were evacuated, 13.3 million houses were damaged or destroyed.  The floods caused $26 billion in damages.The 2016 China floods caused US$22 billion in damages.\n\n\n=== Degradation of the river ===\n\nBeginning in the 1950s dams and thousands of kilometres of dikes were built for flood control, land reclamation, irrigation and for the control of diseases vectors such as blood flukes that caused Schistosomiasis. More than a hundred lakes were thus cut off from the main river. There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction. Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, Baidang Lake shrunk from 100 square kilometers (39 sq mi) in the 1950s to 40 square kilometers (15 sq mi) in 2005. Zhangdu Lake dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of carp who thrived in eutrophic water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage. In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution. The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable \"iron barrier\" that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the baiji dolphin, narrow-ridged finless porpoise and the Yangtze alligator. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.\n\n\n=== Contribution to ocean pollution ===\nThe Yangtze River produces more ocean plastic pollution than any other, according to The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch environmental research foundation that focuses on ocean pollution. Together with 9 other rivers, the Yangtze transports 90% of all the plastic that reaches the oceans.\n\n\n=== Reconnecting lakes ===\nIn 2002 a pilot program was initiated to reconnect lakes to the Yangtze with the objective to increase biodiversity and to alleviate flooding. The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were Zhangdu Lake, Honghu Lake, and Tian'e-Zhou in Hubei on the middle Yangtze. In 2005 Baidang Lake in Anhui was also reconnected.Reconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better-quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea. In 2006 China's Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes. As of 2010, provincial governments in five provinces and Shanghai set up a network of 40 effective protected areas, covering 16,500 km2 (6,400 sq mi). As a result, populations of 47 threatened species increased, including the critically endangered Yangtze alligator. In the Shanghai area, reestablished wetlands now protect drinking water sources for the city. It is envisaged to extend the network throughout the entire Yangtze to eventually cover 102 areas and 185,000 km2 (71,000 sq mi). The mayor of Wuhan announced that six huge, stagnating urban lakes including the East Lake (Wuhan) would be reconnected at the cost of US$2.3 billion creating China's largest urban wetland landscape.\n\n\n== Major cities along the river ==\n\n\n== Crossings ==\n\nUntil 1957, there were no bridges across the Yangtze River from Yibin to Shanghai. For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry. On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the Zhong'anlun disaster (October 15, 1945).\nThe river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China.  In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at Hanyang and Pukou, and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from Wuchang or Nanjing West.\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, a dual-use road-rail bridge, built from 1955 to 1957.  It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River.  The second bridge across the river that was built was a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959.  The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in Nanjing.  It was built after the Sino-Soviet Split and did not receive foreign assistance.  Road-rail bridges were then built in Zhicheng (1971) and Chongqing (1980).\nBridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century.  The Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge was built in 1992 as part of the Beijing-Jiujiang Railway.  A second bridge in Wuhan was completed in 1995.  By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai.  These include some of the longest suspension and cable-stayed bridges in the world on the Yangtze Delta: Jiangyin Suspension Bridge (1,385 m, opened in 1999), Runyang Bridge (1,490 m, opened 2005), Sutong Bridge (1,088 m, opened 2008).  The rapid pace of bridge construction has continued.  The city of Wuhan now has six bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze.\nA number of power line crossings have also been built across the river.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Dams ==\n\nAs of 2007, there are two dams built on the Yangtze river: Three Gorges Dam and Gezhouba Dam.\nThe Three Gorges Dam is the largest power station in the world by installed capacity, at 22.5 GW.\nSeveral dams are operating or are being constructed on the upper portion of the river, the Jinsha River.\nAmong them, the Xiluodu Dam is the third largest power stations in the world, and the Baihetan Dam, planned to be commissioned in 2021, will be the second largest after the Three Gorges Dam.\n\n\n== Tributaries ==\n\nThe Yangtze River has over 700 tributaries. The major tributaries (listed from upstream to downstream) with the locations of where they join the Yangtze are:\n\nYalong River (Panzhihua, Sichuan)\nMin River (Yibin, Sichuan)\nTuo River (Luzhou, Sichuan)\nChishui River (Hejiang, Sichuan)\nJialing River (Chongqing)\nWu River (Fuling, Chongqing)\nQing River (Yidu, Hubei)\nYuan River (via Dongting Lake)\nLishui River (via Dongting Lake)\nZi River (via Dongting Lake)\nXiang River (Yueyang, Hunan)\nHan River (Wuhan, Hubei)\nGan River (near Jiujiang, Jiangxi)\nShuiyang River (Dangtu, Anhui)\nQingyi River (Wuhu, Anhui)\nChao Lake water system (Chaohu, Anhui)\nLake Tai water system (Shanghai)The Huai River flowed into the Yellow Sea until the 20th century, but now primarily discharges into the Yangtze.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Protected areas ==\nSanjiangyuan (\"Three Rivers' Sources\") National Nature Reserve in Qinghai\nThree Parallel Rivers of Yunnan\n\n\n== Wildlife ==\n\nThe Yangtze River has a high species richness, including many endemics. A high percentage of these are seriously threatened by human activities.\n\n\n=== Fish ===\n\nAs of 2011, 416 fish species are known from the Yangtze basin, including 362 that strictly are freshwater species. The remaining are also known from salt or brackish waters, such as the river's estuary or the East China Sea. This makes it one of the most species-rich rivers in Asia and by far the most species-rich in China (in comparison, the Pearl River has almost 300 fish species and the Yellow River 160). 178 fish species are endemic to the Yangtze River Basin. Many are only found in some section of the river basin and especially the upper reach (above Yichang, but below the headwaters in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) is rich with 279 species, including 147 Yangtze endemics and 97 strict endemics (found only in this part of the basin). In contrast, the headwaters, where the average altitude is above 4,500 m (14,800 ft), are only home to 14 highly specialized species, but 8 of these are endemic to the river. The largest orders in the Yangtze are Cypriniformes (280 species, including 150 endemics), Siluriformes (40 species, including 20 endemics), Perciformes (50 species, including 4 endemics), Tetraodontiformes (12 species, including 1 endemic) and Osmeriformes (8 species, including 1 endemic). No other order has more than four species in the river and one endemic.Many Yangtze fish species have declined drastically and 65 were recognized as threatened in the 2009 Chinese red list. Among these are three that are considered entirely extinct (Chinese paddlefish, Anabarilius liui liui and Atrilinea macrolepis), two that are extinct in the wild (Anabarilius polylepis, Schizothorax parvus), four that are critically endangered  Euchiloglanis kishinouyei, Megalobrama elongata, Schizothorax longibarbus and Leiocassis longibarbus). Additionally, both the Yangtze sturgeon and Chinese sturgeon are considered critically endangered by the IUCN. The survival of these two sturgeon may rely on the continued release of captive bred specimens. Although still listed as critically endangered rather than extinct by both the Chinese red list and IUCN, recent reviews have found that the Chinese paddlefish is extinct. Surveys conducted between 2006 and 2008 by ichthyologists failed to catch any, but two probable specimens were recorded with hydroacoustic signals. The last definite record was an individual that was accidentally captured near Yibin in 2003 and released after having been radio tagged. The Chinese sturgeon is the largest fish in the river and among the largest freshwater fish in the world, reaching a length of 5 m (16 ft); the extinct Chinese paddlefish reputedly reached as much as 7 m (23 ft), but its maximum size is labeled with considerable uncertainty.\n\nThe largest threats to the Yangtze native fish are overfishing and habitat loss (such as building of dams and land reclamation), but pollution, destructive fishing practices (such as fishing with dynamite or poison) and introduced species also cause problems. About \u200b2\u20443 of the total freshwater fisheries in China are in the Yangtze Basin, but a drastic decline in size of several important species has been recorded, as highlighted by data from lakes in the river basin. In 2015, some experts recommend a 10-year fishing moratorium to allow the remaining populations to recover, and in January 2020 China imposed a 10-year fishing moratorium on 332 sites along the Yangtze. Dams present another serious problem, as several species in the river perform breeding migrations and most of these are non-jumpers, meaning that normal fish ladders designed for salmon are ineffective. For example, the Gezhouba Dam blocked the migration of the paddlerfish and two sturgeon, while also effectively splitting the Chinese high fin banded shark population into two and causing the extirpation of the Yangtze population of the Japanese eel. In an attempt of minimizing the effect of the dams, the Three Gorges Dam has released water to mimic the (pre-dam) natural flooding and trigger the breeding of carp species downstream. In addition to dams already built in the Yangtze basin, several large dams are planned and these may present further problems for the native fauna.While many fish species native to the Yangtze are seriously threatened, others have become important in fish farming and introduced widely outside their native range. A total of 26 native fish species of the Yangtze basin are farmed. Among the most important are four Asian carp: grass carp, black carp, silver carp and bighead carp. Other species that support important fisheries include northern snakehead, Chinese perch, Takifugu pufferfish (mainly in the lowermost sections) and predatory carp.\n\n\n=== Other animals ===\n\nDue to commercial use of the river, tourism, and pollution, the Yangtze is home to several seriously threatened species of large animals (in addition to fish): the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, baiji (Yangtze river dolphin), Chinese alligator, Yangtze giant softshell turtle and Chinese giant salamander. This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species. In 2010, the Yangtze population of finless porpoise was 1000 individuals. In December 2006, the Yangtze river dolphin was declared functionally extinct after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin's inhabitance. In 2007, a large, white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a baiji. However, as there have been no confirmed sightings since 2004, the baiji is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time. \"Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins.\" It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze river dolphin was a result of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area.Numerous species of land mammals are found in the Yangtze valley, but most of these are not directly associated with the river. Three exceptions are the semi-aquatic Eurasian otter, water deer and P\u00e8re David's deer.\n\nIn addition to the very large and exceptionally rare Yangtze giant softshell turtle, several smaller turtle species are found in the Yangtze basin, its delta and valleys. These include the Chinese box turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Pan's box turtle, Yunnan box turtle, yellow pond turtle, Chinese pond turtle, Chinese stripe-necked turtle and Chinese softshell turtle, which all are considered threatened.More than 160 amphibian species are known from the Yangtze basin, including the world's largest, the critically endangered Chinese giant salamander. It has declined drastically due to hunting (it is considered a delicacy), habitat loss and pollution. The polluted Dian Lake, which is part of the upper Yangtze watershed (via Pudu River), is home to several highly threatened fish, but was also home to the Yunnan lake newt. This newt has not been seen since 1979 and is considered extinct. In contrast, the Chinese fire belly newt from the lower Yangtze basin is one of the few Chinese salamander species to remain common and it is considered least concern by the IUCN.\n\nThe Yangtze basin contains a large number of freshwater crab species, including several endemics. A particularly rich genus in the river basin is the potamid Sinopotamon. The Chinese mitten crab is catadromous (migrates between fresh and saltwater) and it has been recorded up to 1,400 km (870 mi) up the Yangtze, which is the largest river in its native range. It is a commercially important species in its native range where it is farmed, but the Chinese mitten crab has also been spread to Europe and North America where considered invasive.The freshwater jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbii, now an invasive species in large parts of the world, originates from the Yangtze.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCarles, William Richard, \"The Yangtse Chiang\", The Geographical Journal, Vol. 12, No. 3 (Sep. 1898), pp. 225\u2013240; Published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers)\nDanielson, Eric N. 2004.

          "Jiefangbei is famous enough that if you talk to a Chongqinger and say you haven't been yet they will be gobsmacked. That said the area is mostly expensive shops (western luxury brands, although it does have CQ's only forever 21), western restaurants, and night clubs. If this is",
          "The lights were this time of the year really nice. Lots of people but not too crowded. Nice for people watching! Luxorious stores are right here!",
          "The place is a modern walking area where the youth gather and shops. the location is just less than 2 km (less than 1 miles) from Chaotianmen area. you can find many famous branded shops in the area. I recommend to visit this place at night time.",
          "Significant walking street with luxurious brands stores available in every main/big cities in China. For me this is just a great place for me to search great gourmet local food. Try street foods like BBQ squids with local pepper and sour spicy noodles. Off course others China",

          "Nice developing city with stunning view, prettiest girls of China, delicious food especially the hotspot you must try, the old style one only with spicy oil:-)",
          "This shopping plaza in the CBD is flanked with luxury shopping. Not my kind of place, but only went there to find a coffee shop and caffeine up. It's a pleasant area to stroll, and look around. The scale of everything is typically gigantic, as befitting China.",
          "Didn't get enough Ferragamo, LV etc. back home? Then head here. Otherwise stay away. This was never a tourist destination when it had local shops all around it. Now its just another prestige build with high end Western brands that no locals shop at anyway. A curious circumstance",
          "An interesting place to marvel at the money that must be about in Chongqing. From Maserati cars on the street to top end designer shops it is an eyeopener.",
          "Great place for people watching even if it is packed with high-priced luxury shops. Families enjoying the cool(er) evening air.",
          "You'll love the square if you love shopping. There are countless brand names from around the world. But the square is a good place for taking photos and people watching as well. The good time to visit the square is in the evening when the lights turn on and people come out",
          "The most wonderful shopping area ever! I love all that luxury shop of very famous brand! Lots of people every single moment that make a magic atmosphere",

          "Jiefangbei square is the CBD of Chongqing. All the major banks, major retail banks and international hotels are in this area. There are also many restaurants as well as small eateries serving local Chongqing food, and pubs/nightclubs. The entire area can be covered by walking",

          "If you are in cq for few days not worth wasting time here. Just your average shopping square really. Nice at night when all the shops are lit up. Not somewhere to actually go shopping unless you're a millionaire",
          "We did not spend long here as we had already shopped at a department store that was on the way from Hongya Caves. It had a lot of specials so we got some bargains! The Square is interesting in that you can people watch and browse more expensive stores.",
          "All the upmarket stores but very few real shoppers. The monument looks very British and i would strongly avoid this area if you can. Otherwise you will find lots of western shops at high prices.",

          "Went to the Jiefangbei square and monument on March 19, 2015. I was hoping that the monument would have some English signage but it does not. The area around the monument is very well developed and you can find lots of dining choices as well as shopping choices. The apple store",
          "Plenty of good people watching, if your a shopper, this is the place to be. Good place to see the new Chongqing and modern development set amongst the old crumbling ruins being systematically torn down. Great lit up building at night.",
          "I got there by accident looking for the way to another place. I just gave up of my old plan and decided to stay a little longer. It was quite late, so many shops were already closed, but there was still lots of people around and the lights made it very beautiful. Before I was a",
          "It is considered the city center of Chongqing. It's a pedestrian area with in the middle an obelisk clock tower (sponsored by Rolex). Nothing extraordinary, you will find a lot of people walking on the street going in and out the busy shops. Most of them are considered luxury",
          "The monument is good for picture taking and it's a good shopping area too.",
          "There's isn't much here. It could be any modern shopping square in any growing city in China. I suppose if youre Chinese you would go here to see and be seen buying designer goods, but for the average tourist\u2026very meh",
          "It is a symbolic scenic spot of Chong Qing. There is a hugh, tall monument there, with a lot of modern shopping squares around it. A good place for shopping. And the night light sight is very beautiful, you can choose to have an eye of it at night after shopping.",
          "Not much to do here, unless you are very into shopping. A little monument stands near the entrance of a pedestrian only mall, flanked by several shopping malls fronted by big labels such as Rolex, Gucci, Armani etc.",
          "A must see in Chongqing, but not much to do except shopping and bars. Shop illuminations at night are still worth seeing.",

          "This is a great place to grab a take-away coffee, sit down and watch the people pass if high-end shops that litter this place don't appeal to you. Rolex, Dolce & Gabbana, Prada, etc all have at least one shop each.",
          "If you're not looking to buy high-end western goods it's worth a peek just to see the Rolex adverts on the Liberation Monument and marvel at just how far China has taken capitalism.",

          "We arrived at the square April 22, 2014 after our first lunch in China. The square was much like many other high end city shopping areas. The square was quite busy with the hustle and bustle of day to day activity. Lots of high end shops for the rich and famous but street",

          "Jiefangbei Square changes with the seasons. Many displays are setup for conferences through out the year. In December the trees are decorated with hundred of thousands of lights that literally light up the square after dark. It is something to see.",
          "We walked here from Hongyadong Folk Centre, a 10 minute walk. Being October 2 (Golden Week), it was very, very crowded. The liberation monument is a 27 metre high clock tower in the middle of a large open paved space surrounded by high rise buildings, mainly shopping centres",
          "Lots to see and do in this area, and soon to be a stop for the high speed train. Good place to visit , water fountain show, plenty of movement and colour, and don't miss the Chinglish signs spread around the gardens for a good laugh!",
          "This square, which really is more like 2 large area, has great shopping, splendid views of the buildings at night and several good restaurants. I preferred it over the more up-scale downtown plaza.",
          "There are many malls. You can find everything there, from global chains (starbucks, KFC, Japanese goods, Rolex, Prada, New Zealand Ice Cream) to supermarkets where you can buy local and overseas produce. Definitely worth the visit for retail therapy.",
          "Walking around Jiefangbei Square is like walking out of a football stadium except there is no football game. It's always very crowded. If you don't mind the walking bumping into others or others into you, you should go take a look. This is pretty much the old down town of",
          "It's called walking street in Chinese, means no automobile allowed. There are a lot of shopping mall in this area, also you can find some nice restaurant around. You may be disappointed if you want to find something special cause almost every Chinese city has it. However, it's",
          "Initially it is interesting to see the Chinese approach to the western style shopping plaza,until you realise it is mostly the same as anywhere else in the world. Lots of chic shops which you can find anywhere, and all the usual Mcdonalds/Starbucks/Subway franchises. However the",
          "Quite disappointed that there is no particular character for the place. Many expensive brands around but we did not travel this far to see such shops.",
          "I didn't realize that I was in this main shopping district, as I usually avoid them. A woman at my hotel had pointed out the walking street nearby; so I went. It's full of upscale stores, not my thing, but it's interesting to see. I ended out walking there again at dusk, and it",
          "Just shopping area.. Nothing much.. My local friend take me here because at the time I'm looking for shoes. Cant find what I want because they don't have my size. It was summer, lot of people outside. Lot of beautiful girl.",
          "Jiefangbei is the city center, and honestly, the only place in town to be if you have already travelled there. All the expensive shopping malls are gathered there and the atmosphere is the warmest in the city. Better still if you have a choice: do not travel to Chongqing. I",
          "We had great expectations of this monument, seeing that it was a must visit attraction in every source about Chongqing that we ready. But the minument is just a clock tower in the middle of a huge crowded square. It was seen in less than 30 seconds. Surely you could spend hours",
          "From the Square you can walk towards Paradise walk. It is an interesting area full of shops and restaurants. There are these small stalls selling delicious local treats, enjoyed nibbling on many of the snacks there, tasty and cheap too. For shopping, the brands like H&M, Gap,",

          "The actual monument in the square celebrates the liberation of China from Japanese occupation, it is small and dwarfed by the surrounding neon covered high rise stores. If it's shopping you want and you are in Chongqing then, if price is not a problem you are in the right",
          "The picture posted is not jiefangbei but that of hongyadong. Jiefangbei bei is the center of downtown chongqing. It is marked by a clock tower at its center which they call the liberation monument. This monument is surrounded by very tall modern buildings housing high-end shops",

          "Jiefangbei like any other city town is a popular spot for the local folks very much like visiting an American shopping mall. The feel of Jiefangbei is very much like any other city square which is filled with popular brand label retail shops. I didn't find English being spoken",
          "Pedestrianized square around the monument, Jiefangbei, is not the worst center compared to other Chinese cities. Even if you're jaded to shopping in China (which you should be), use it as a 'bookmark' for useful places like Citibank, Starbucks and subway. But what's more",
          "Jiefangbei is the main business place of Chongqing in the morning but in the evening and at night its one of the best place in Chongqing to go around, for those who prefer to visit bars and clubs. There are many many bars and clubs around. Many of those are of Western style.",

          "I visited Jiefangbei Square at the end of a tiring day, thinking that there would be lots of street food to choose from. This isn't really the case. The area is the downtown core of the city and has an abundance of brand name shops. There are some stalls selling street food,",

        "wiki": "Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport (IATA: CKG, ICAO: ZUCK) is located in Yubei District, Chongqing, People's Republic of China. The airport's IATA Airport code, CKG, is derived from the city's former romanized name, Chungking. Jiangbei airport is also a 128-hour transit visa-free airport for foreigners from many countries. It was awarded first place in the \"Best Airport in the 25\u201340 Million Passenger Size\" category by Airports Council International in 2017 and again in 2018.Situated 19 kilometres (12 mi) north of the city centre of Chongqing, the airport is a major aviation hub for airlines in western China, including China Express Airlines, China Southern Airlines (Chongqing Airlines), Sichuan Airlines, Shandong Airlines, XiamenAir and China West Air. Chongqing is a focus city of Air China and Hainan Airlines.\nThe airport has three terminals: Terminal 2 serving domestic flights and Terminal 3A other domestic flights and all international flights while Terminal 1 is currently closed. The first, second, and third phases of the airport came into operation in January 1990, December 2004, and December 2010, respectively. Terminal 2 is capable of handling 15 million passengers and Terminal 3A 45 million passengers annually.In terms of passenger traffic, Jiangbei Airport was the ninth-busiest airport nationwide in 2018, handling 41,595,887 passengers with a year-on-year growth of 7.4 percent. The airport was the eighth-busiest airport by traffic movements and tenth-busiest airport by cargo traffic in China in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe civil aviation of Chongqing dates back to the 1920s. After the completion of Baishiyi Airport in 1938, Chongqing became one of the four cities in China that had an airport in operation. In 1950, four flight routes from Tianjin, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Kunming to Chongqing became the earliest to be opened after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. In 1965, the Civil Aviation Administration of China opened an office in Sichuan Province and Chongqing Airport became subject to it. The development of Chongqing's civil aviation then stopped until the 1990s.On 22 January 1990, the new airport, Chongqing Jiangbei Airport was opened to replace the old Baishiyi Airport's commercial flight functions, which remained open as a military airport. The development of the civil aviation resumed. In 1997, when the Chongqing area became a 4th municipality of China, Civil Aviation Administration of China established a branch in Chongqing in the same year.\n\n\n== Development ==\nChongqing Jiangbei International Airport is currently undergoing a major expansion, with a vision of obtaining a major international air hub and becoming the largest airport in western China by 2030.  Jiangbei Airport has been outlined ambitious growth plans, competing with Chengdu Airport, Kunming Airport, Wuhan Airport and Xi'an Airport to be recognized as the nation's fourth largest aviation hub (after those hubs in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou).\nJiangbei Airport was reported to have reached the fastest growth rates since 2011, according to CAPA's Airport Traffic Benchmark Tool. On 1 November 2015, the annual passengers at Jiangbei Airport exceeded 30 million for the first time.\n\n\n=== Airport expansion ===\nThe expansion project Phase III, which included a second runway and an additional Terminal, T2, started construction in 2007 and completed in 2010. Major elements of the construction were adding a second runway of 3,200 meters (which was later lengthened to 3,600 meters to satisfy the landings and takeoffs of Boeing 747 and the demands of Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.) to the east of the existing runway, building a parallel taxiway in between the two runways, and setting up a visual aid lighting support system. It also added a second terminal building (T2) with an area of 86,000 square meters, 41 apron aircraft parking stands, and a freight station and support facilities occupying an area of 20,000 square metres (220,000 sq ft). It cost CNY3.3 billion (USD538 million). On 22 December 2010, the second runway was commissioned, which made Jiangbei Airport the fourth airport in mainland China to operate two runways, one exclusively for departures and the other exclusively for arrivals.The current major expansion - Phase IV - of Jiangbei Airport contains the construction of a third runway and a new terminal, T3A, which is expected to be 530,000 square meters, more than double the size of the existing terminals (T1 and T2A/T2B) combined, costing CNY26.0 billion (USD4.1 billion). T3A is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, after which the airport will have more than 725,000 square meters of terminal floor space, ranking Jiangbei Airport among China's 15 largest airports with an annual passenger capacity of 60 million and an annual cargo capacity of 2 million tons. Half of the new terminal is currently planned for international flights from major cities in South East Asia, East Asia, Middle East, Africa, Europe, and North America. After the completion of expansion Phase IV, Jiangbei Airport will become the 4th airport in Greater China (inc. Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) that has three runways in operation, of which Runway #3 (03/21) will be operated independently on top of the pair #1 (02L/20R) and #2 (02R/20L).\n\nThere is a fifth phase of expansion planned for Jiangbei Airport which is expected to include a new terminal, namely T3B, and a fourth runway. This phase will be finished in the mid-2020s.\nNote: Remote bays include the ones that serve the air freighters.\n\n\n=== Surge in cargo traffic ===\n\nCargo traffic increased at an average rate of 14% in the first six months of 2011, driven by exponential growth in international cargo. International cargo/mail volumes increased by 12 times from 2010 levels in the first half of 2011, to more than 9000 tonnes. In the second half of 2011, this growth rate is expected to be maintained, with Hewlett-Packard, Asus and other brands of large international IT production capacity supporting the increase, to an anticipated 60,000 to 80,000 tonnes of international cargo throughout the whole year.\n\n\n=== New international routes ===\nBefore 2010, Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport's international destinations all terminated in East and Southeast Asia, including direct flights to Tokyo (has stop-over in Beijing or Shanghai), Seoul, Singapore, Bangkok, Phuket, Siem Reap, etc. In 2011, Qatar Airways opened a new route to Doha.With the new T3A terminal in operation since August 2017, the airport has had multiple new international routes with non-stop flights to London, Dubai, Los Angeles, New York, Sydney, Melbourne, Rome, Paris, Budapest, etc.\nT3A Terminal and the third runway of Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport started operation at 06:00 on 29 August 2017. In the meantime, T1 was temporarily closed, T2 serve only domestic flights operated by Sichuan Airlines, West Airlines, Huaxia Airlines and Spring Airlines, and the remaining flights were transferred to T3A.  In addition, the airport operates a free trans-shipment shuttle between T2 and T3A in a 24-hour operation.\n\n\n=== Statistics ===\nSource: CAAC (Civil Aviation Administration of China)\nNumber of domestic and international/regional passengers (bar chart, 2009-2018)\n\nSource : CQA (Chongqing Airport Group Co., Ltd.)\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled flights to and from Chongqing\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Ground transportation ==\nThe airport's ground transportation is developing very fast. Four highways around the airport are under construction, as part of plans to turn Chongqing into an integrated regional transport hub in western China. There will be a 300,000-square-meter (3,200,000 sq ft) transportation transfer centre in T3A, which will include inter-city rail, light rail and subway.\nGeneral plan of integrated transportation Hub at Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport:\n\nOne inter-city rail: Branch of Chongqing-Wanzhou Inter-City Rail\nTwo lines of Chongqing Rail Transit: CRT Line 3 and Line 10\nThree latitudinal roadways: (1) outer ring expressway, (2) relocated National Highway G319, and (3) southern connecting freeway\nFour longitudinal roadways: (1) first freeway of CKG Airport (National Highway G210), (2) second freeway of CKG Airport (under construction), (3) Chongqing-Linshui expressway, and (4) northern connecting roadway\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\n\n==== Airport bus ====\nAirport Express lines are easily accessible at Terminal 2 and 3.\n\nRoute K01: Jiangbei Airport \u2192 Jiazhou (\u52a0\u5dde) \u2192 Damiao (\u5927\u5e99) \u2192 Shangqingsi (\u4e0a\u6e05\u5bfa) \u2192 Chongqing Great Hall \u2192 Jiefangbei. It takes about 50 minutes from the airport to the city centre (Jiefangbei).\nRoute K02: Jiangbei Airport \u2192 Qixia Road (\u6816\u971e\u8def) \u2192 North Square of Chongqingbei Railway Station. 40 minutes may be taken from the airport to the High-Speed railway station.\nRoute K03: Jiangbei Airport \u2192 Yanggongqiao (Shapingba)\nRoute K05: Jiangbei Airport \u2192 Sigongli Bus Terminal\nRoute K06: Jiangbei Airport \u2192 Chongqing West Railway Station\nRoute K07: Jiangbei Airport \u2192 Shapingba Railway Station\n\n\n==== Long-distance coaches ====\nThere is a transfer center for long-distance coaches between Terminal 2A and Terminal 2B, and it offers bus services to nearby cities in Sichuan and Guizhou Province, as well as suburban areas of Chongqing Municipality.\n\n\n=== Car ===\nThere is currently one airport freeway connecting the city center with the airport, and the second one is under construction and will be put into operation in the late 2016. The airport freeway is 23 kilometers long, but it usually takes as many as 30 minutes to get from the city center to the airport because of the heavy traffic.\n\n\n==== Parking ====\nThe airport has four parking lots:\n\nInternational (Outdoor) Parking Lot, located in front of Terminal 1\nDomestic (Outdoor) Parking Lot, located in front of Terminal 2\nUnderground (Indoor) Parking Lot, located under Terminal 2\nCentral Parking Garage, located in the transportation hub in front of Terminal 3All together, the airport can accommodate about 7,300 cars at one time.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n\n==== Chongqing Rail Transit ====\n\nChongqing Rail Transit Line 3 runs from Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport's Terminal 2 station, going through the city center via Lianglukou station and onto its final stop, Yudong, covering a distance of 60 kilometres (37 mi). It takes around 50 minutes to get to the city center (Lianglukou).Line 10, serves as the second metro line connecting the urban areas of Chongqing and the airport.  One station of Line 10 is at Terminal 3 and the other is at Terminal 2. This line runs under Runways #1 (02L/20R) and #2 (02R/20L), connecting Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 in landside. Line 10 is the only metro line access to the new Terminal 3, while Line 3 will not be elongated to Terminal 3. Line 10 also reduces the travel distance between Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport and Chongqingbei Railway Station, which can facilitate the transfers of passengers between air and rail.\n\n\n==== InterCity ====\nTerminal 3A has a huge underground railway station that will open in 2019 that will connect cities as far as 300 kilometers away, thus allowing Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport to serve a significantly larger population. The speed of the trains is designed to be 250 to 300 kilometers per hour, allowing journeys to take less than one hour from a relatively faraway locations within the Greater Chongqing Municipality.\n\n\n== Other facilities ==\nThe headquarters of China Express Airlines are on the airport property.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nOn July 8, 2020, a Ruili Airlines Boeing 737 flying from X'ian to Kunming had to make an emergency landing at Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport after suffering a broken cockpit window and plunging 10,000 feet before pilots recuperated control of the aircraft. None of the plane's occupants were injured during the incident.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nChongqing Baishiyi Air Base\nList of airports in the People's Republic of China\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChongqing Jiangbei International Airport (in Chinese)\nAirport information for ZUCK at World Aero Data.

It features a 300-metre-long horizontal skybridge called \"Crystal\" that connects the top of four of the skycrapers. The skybridge will be the second highest in the world after the Kingdom Centre. The entire project comprises eight towers with a total of 817,000 square metres of floor space. It was designed by Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie. It is one of the most expensive buildings being built in China.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\nConstruction began around 2013 and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019.\nAs of February 2019, the structures had been completed and the interior was being finished.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nRaffles City Chongqing consists of eight skyscrapers situated on a site covering 9.2 hectares, in Yuzhong District, at the tip of the peninsula where the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers meet.\nAtop four of the 250-metre-tall towers is an enclosed skyway, called the Crystal. Two 350-metre-tall towers connect to them, each via a cantilever bridge. Two other 250-metre-tall towers are adjacent to these six.\nThe project will contain 1.12 million square metres of space, 817,000 square metres of which will be floor space and will include 150,000m\u00b2 of offices and 1,400 residences, a hotel, a 235,000m\u00b2 shopping mall, and landscaped grounds.The buildings are reinforced concrete with concrete-encased steel columns and steel floor spanning.

        "wiki": "Badong County (simplified Chinese: \u5df4\u4e1c\u53bf; traditional Chinese: \u5df4\u6771\u7e23; pinyin: B\u0101d\u014dng Xi\u00e0n; lit.: 'East of (state of) Ba') is a county located in western Hubei province, People's Republic of China, bordering Chongqing municipality to the west. It is the northernmost county-level division under the administration of Enshi Prefecture. The Yangtze River flows through the county and the county seat is located just east of the Wu Gorge in the Three Gorges region.\nBadong County is famous for the Shen Nong Stream (\u795e\u519c\u6eaa; Sh\u00e9nn\u00f3ng X\u012b) gorges located near Badong town. The stream itself falls into the Yangtze opposite the Badong center city.\n\nThe Badong county seat, commonly referred to simply as \"Badong\", is in the town of Xinling (\u4fe1\u9675\u9547; X\u00ecnl\u00edng Zh\u00e8n), located on the high southern banks of the Yangtze River channel. The Yangtze valley was flooded during the first decade of the 21st century after the construction of the Three Gorges Dam to the east, but Badong county seat was mostly above the flood line, and so more of the original town survives than is the case in many other river towns along this section of the Yangtze.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nBadong County is divided into 10 towns and 2 townships.Ten towns:\n\nXinling (\u4fe1\u9675\u9547; X\u00ecnl\u00edng Zh\u00e8n)\nDongrangkou (\u4e1c\u703c\u53e3\u9547; D\u014dngr\u01cengk\u01d2u Zh\u00e8n)\nYanduhe (\u6cbf\u6e21\u6cb3\u9547; Y\u00e1nd\u00f9h\u00e9 Zh\u00e8n)\nGuandukou (\u5b98\u6e21\u53e3\u9547; Gu\u0101nd\u00f9k\u01d2u Zh\u00e8n)\nChadianzi (\u8336\u5e97\u5b50\u9547; Ch\u00e1di\u00e0nz\u01d0 Zh\u00e8n)\nL\u00fccongpo (\u7eff\u8471\u5761\u9547; L\u01dcc\u014dngp\u014d Zh\u00e8n)\nDazhiping (\u5927\u652f\u576a\u9547; D\u00e0zh\u012bp\u00edng Zh\u00e8n)\nYesanguan (\u91ce\u4e09\u5173\u9547; Y\u011bs\u0101ngu\u0101n Zh\u00e8n)\nQingtaiping (\u6e05\u592a\u576a\u9547; Q\u012bngt\u00e0ip\u00edng Zh\u00e8n)\nShuibuya (\u6c34\u5e03\u57ad\u9547; Shu\u01d0b\u00f9y\u00e0 Zh\u00e8n)Two townships:\n\nXiqiuwan (\u6eaa\u4e18\u6e7e\u4e61; X\u012bqi\u016bw\u0101n Xi\u0101ng)\nJinguoping (\u91d1\u679c\u576a\u4e61; J\u012bngu\u01d2p\u00edng Xi\u0101ng)The main urban area of the county (i.e., the place typically labeled \"Badong\" on less-detailed maps) consists of Xinling Town - the seat of the county government - on the right (southern)  bank of the Yangtze, and the smaller Dongrangkou and Guandukou towns on the opposite side of the river. They two sides of the Yangtze are connected by the Badong Bridge.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nCoal mining in small pits is the main commercial activity in the region, along with farming. There is also a large cement factory on the river to the east of the town, which is a significant polluter.\nThe rural population of Badong County, as with many other parts of inland China, has seen major changes in the past two decades. The Chinese government's population control policies in the 1980s and beyond resulted in a sharp drop in births, and also in a change in attitudes, making many couples uninterested in having more than one child. The new freedom to travel and work in other parts of China has also led to a major exodus of workers to the coastal areas of China to find work. The older people tend to stay in the villages, and the workers often return to have their children, but they then generally return to the factories. The overall result is that many villages in Badong are shrinking and some terraced farmland in this largely mountaintainous region is being abandoned and allowed to return to its original state.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nDue to the difficult terrain and the road conditions, the most convenient way to reach Badong's county seat is with a Yangtze riverboat. Both regular boats and hydrofoils call in the busy Badong harbor on the way up and down between Yichang and Chongqing.\nThe county has one Yangtze crossing, the Badong Bridge, carrying China National Highway 209.  The highway crosses the northern half of the county from the northeast to the southwest.  As of 2009, Highway 209 was little more than a dirt road for a 20-km stretch north of the bridge.\nChina National Highway 318 crosses the southern part of the county from the east to the west. The new G50 Shanghai\u2013Chongqing Expressway and Yichang-Wanzhou Railway have been recently completed along the same corridor as well. The Siduhe Bridge on the new highway, located near Yesanguan town, is one of the longest bridges of its kinds; the nearby Zhijinghe Bridge is one of the world's tallest arch bridges.\nThe Badong railway station, located near Yesanguan Town in the south-central part of the county, is the only railway station within the county. At the planning station it was known as Yesanguan Station, due to its location. A second, Badong North railway station, will open on the Zhengzhou\u2013Wanzhou high-speed railway\nA number of provincial highways run north to south through the county.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDeng Yujiao incident; occurred in Badong in 2009\nRan Jianxin incident; occurred in Lichuan and Badong in May and June 2011.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of Badong County Government",

A military megaproject, the nuclear base is located near what is now suburban Fuling, a municipality in Chongqing, China. In 2010, it was opened to Chinese tourists. It is a distinct network of nuclear-weapons manufacturing tunnels to the likewise defunct Underground Project 131 and the still operational \"Underground Great Wall of China.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe project was started in 1966 when Sino-Soviet relations dramatically declined (see also the Sino-Soviet split). To enhance China's national defence and prevent possible Soviet invasion and nuclear attack, the project was approved (directly by then-Premier Zhou Enlai) and undertaken in secret. More than 60,000 engineering soldiers of the People's Liberation Army participated in the construction of the base.  The underground base was designed to be able to tolerate thousands of tons of TNT explosives and 8-magnitude earthquakes.The project was under construction for 17 years, and the construction was nearly completed in 1984. In 1964 China made its first public nuclear test. Largely due to change in the Cold War international situation, the project was cancelled in February 1984. It was further declassified in April 2002. In April 2010, after being closed for over 25 years, the base was opened to tourists.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe surface area of the cave is more than 104,000 m2, and the total length of the tunnels is more than 20 kilometers. The whole complex consists of 13 levels, 18 artificial caves linked to each other, and has more than 80 roads and 130 tunnels. Automobiles are able to pass the roads and tunnels inside. The base has the \u201cWorld's Largest Artificial Cave\u201d., which has a height of 79.6 meters, roughly equal to that of a 20-floor building.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUnderground City (Beijing)\nNuclear warfare\nNuclear deterrent\nNuclear strategy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeographical coordinates: 29.556882\u00b0N 107.507164\u00b0E\ufeff / 29.556882; 107.507164\nPictures of the 816 Nuclear Military Plant (in Chinese)\nhttps://instagram.com/p/BilBiuIlvW9/\nCCTV: Chongqing opens former Nuclear Plant as tourist attraction",

          "Great place for tourist but was crowded over the weekend. Was told weekday will be less crowded. Great view of the river and lots of local eateries for those who can challenge the spicy food",
          "I visited Hongya Cave several times of my trip to Chongqing. I enjoyed eating the food, drinking the drinks and admiring the city view of Chongqing. This area is noisy, colourful and exciting. It can be crowded at night, but this is the best time to visit.",
          "Great place to find souvenirs, quick snacks, lunch or dinner. Afterwards, enjoy the sights. It looks beautiful after sunset.",
          "The Hongya caves is on paper a 2300 years old military fortress. But there is so much development over the past decades that it has become very commercialised. Locals will tell you that only tourist visit this place, A visit to this place isn't difficult to tell why. It is",
          "Amazing night view. Its so interesting to go true all the levels of this historic monument. Great experience. Many restaurants with delicious food and small snack places (my favourite is sesame peanut brittle, super great with coffee;)",
          "This is a must visit place when you are in Chongqing. Well, it gets pretty crowded at night time. You can see the river view at night. There are plenty of options to shop and eat here. This was just a 10-15 minutes cab ride from our hotel.",
          "Lots of eateries and shops, selling food, craft, and clothing. Quite good if you want to buy a simple cheongsam (qipao) or children's clothing.",
          "You probably should see it but be aware it is made for the tourist. It is a interesting climb through and some nice photo spots.",
          "You will amaze of the height of one side to the other, 11 floors different. This place always full of local and foreign tourist, lots of restaurant, cafe and hawker plus souvenir shops. Favorite place for memory photo taking.",
          "We came here twice. The first time we came was during the day. There weren\u2019t that many people, so it was quite relaxing to walk around. We came back at night and there were a lot more people talking photos and shopping in the commercial area. It\u2019s worth going here to take some",
          "Hongyadong located next to the mighty Yangtze River at the Jingbei area I\u2019d Chongqing is a popular tourist destination. In the past it could have been a structure built to allow passengers of river boat to stop and ascend to the higher ground from the river bank. The structure",
          "This spot is definitely best visited at night as the lights are a highlight. It has the usual range of restaurants, eating places and shops. The crowds were big the light we visited and it is worth a look.",
          "This place is free to enter. Although there is a queue in which it says you have to scan entry via Wechat, we entered Hongyadong via Jiefangbei (the top most level) and headed straight for the lift. It\u2019ll bring you to the different levels. However, the lift can get rather",
          "Hongya Dong probably was a significant historical landmark in the past but the place is now just another bustling shopping complex with photo taking stops . You probably wanna visit for a night view of the bridge and if you wanna buy local foodstuff or snacks which is being",
          "This is a nice shopping area. You are not going to find name brands here. They usually have aftermarket and probably outlet type of merchandise. Recently, the upgrades have made this a nicer place then when I went a few years ago. It looks overall clearner and more modern.",
          "Better not enter the area as it is super crowded. It is free to enter but you have to get your free ticket from scanning a code with your wechat. So you need wechat. I think I would be just happy by observing the place from a far. Super beautiful in the evening. We wanted to",
          "Food outlets, traditional craft and souvenir. Very commerical. Day and night views are totally different.",
          "Hongyadong is a cool place but too many tourists over there. Inside there are some souvenirs shops, and hotpot. That is all. Better to walk on the brigde. Need to pay to go in during holidays.",
          "A friend of ours visited from Chengdu so we decided to go for dinner at Hongya cave. It was very crowded but manageable, we went through many different floors of flea markets and bought wonderful souvenires before heading up to the food court to enjoy grilled lamb sticks and ice",
          "Don't let the ridiculous crowds...peddlers of selfie sticks and river boat rides irk you. Once you get past the hordes of people...and survive the squeeze up the elevator that seem to take an eternity to arrive at your level, you will find yourself submersed in a smorgasbord of",
          "It is said that this is one of the must see places due to being mentioned too many times on the net, but once there, I was not very impressed at all. It's full of shops selling almost identical local specialty items and quite a few restaurants. I couldn't find where the cave",
          "A focal point for shopping and tourist. Guide stayed late to show us this place which event at this time (winter) was hectic. Without the guide Lilly who also go us a tai back to our hotel it would have been much mored difficult. Interesting array of shops and food outlets to",
          "Great place to sight see, but watch the crowds at night when the city comes alive. Fantastic light views across the river and so many shops and restaurants.",
          "Very beautiful and interesting buildings by the river. Lots of small shops and food places. It looks great in the night too.",
          "This is such an eye catching place and I first viewed it on a river cruise - full of lights and bustling excitements. It's a fun place to wander around and look inside - great place to explore. I would recommend it.",
          "Best time to visit is at night for the lighted riverfront skyline. Take a cab & stop on opposite side of river and take a walk across the bridge. Wonderful photo opportunities.",
          "I love this place. It is very crowded and you have to be selective because some of the prices are very expensive. Most of the merchandise is probably second quality meaning there is a flaw somewhere, but it is still good quality. There is a Starbucks overlooking the river,",
          "If you like spicy food, here is a must go. And the best photograph position is on the bridge. Weekend is not a good schedule, even just local people could crowd it. Daytime better but without lights it will not satisfy you.",
          "If you are in town perhaps waiting to board a cruise make sure you go to Hongya Cave and walk around the city and see the magnificent lights. The best view if from the bridge and the bridge its self is very impressive. I wasn't too impressed with the inside but you go there for",
          "This is definitely a must visit sightseeing site if you are in town. After stages of development in different times, it is now quite new but still full of uniqueness. We walked to another side of the river to take this area\u2019s stunning picture. When you are here, you can eat",
          "I went on a Wednesday night and the area was packed! Recommend going at night as the lights make the area look nicer. I got there at street level and there were two options to get down to the bottom; walk down or use an elevator. You have to go through a line to get into the",
          "The main thing about Hongya Cave is all the lights! Viewing it from outside was spectacular! Even though only about half of the lights were on when we visited, it was still beautiful. Also looking at the lights across the Jialing River was an interesting sight. The whole",
          "The place has a number of local stores selling food, snacks, and souvenirs. Based on my understanding, it is a cave which relates to Chinese History. But nowadays it was constructed with Chinese ancient style buildings which makes this place more attractive.",
          "My gracious business hosts brought me here despite stating as locals they never went because there were so many tourists. ;-) They we\u2019re right! But now I can say I\u2019ve been there...and it was well worth the crowds.",
          "This is a favourite tourist stop both in day and night. Lots of restaurant and shops along the streets. Good views along river if you want to take the river cruise.",
          "When I flew in to Chongqing is was not raining heavily, so I decided to go for a walk. I asked my guide Sherry how far is Hongya Cave from my hotel. Even though this visit was not scheduled in my itinerary, Sherry agreed to take me there so she can show me around. I was very",

          "Hongya Cave (Hongyadong) is an 11-storey, 75 meters (245 feet) stilt house butting up against a steep cliff. It\u2019s a popular shopping/dining spot for locals and tourists alike. There are lifts to the top but you may be waiting a while. Alternately you can take the stairs - it\u2019ll",
          "If you can avoid to go there during Spring Festival or Week end. Too many People going all the ways. But the location surely is worth to be seen as one of the main attractions of Chongqing where you could find any kind of chinese gifts and foods.",
          "Lots of arts and crafts, stores for trinkets & food. The view up top is fantastic but you need to be patient as it\u2019s very busy here - at least it was at night!",
          "In the centre of town, a haven for dining and shopping, a photographer paradise... Although the German beer sign posted terrace, overlooking the river still has a lot to learn, beer is served warm with a glass of ice, and a glass of wine is unheard of, each to their own...the",
          "Even on a Sunday night this place is packed! Lots of shops, lots of food, lots of people. Suggest you start from the top and WALK down - elevators are crazy full. Take time to enjoy the performers, taste the samples of local food, and admire the sights. Make sure you go across",
          "This is essentially an old building used as a 11 story shopping center, in the shopping center you can find all sorts of Chinese products, food and other experiences. Most people arrive at 7 to experience the center at its peak, to see demonstrations from the shops making",
          "Hongya Cave, much like Chongqing itself, will totally blow your mind. A massive shopping complex built inside a cave, there is no shortage of eye-catching pictures here. This place has a plethora of Chinese snacks, restaurants, souvenirs, and much more. There's even a waterfall!",
          "When I first saw the huge crowd queuing in the snaking loooong line trying to enter this tourist attraction, I wondered if it is all worth it. My verdict: it was. There are so many food stalls and craft shops inside the 8-level building/facility. The architecture and the lights",
          "The city of Chongqing has most beautiful night view in China. Specially Hongya Cave with light decoration shows its ancient buildings. The best site to take picture is the other side of the river bank. You can walk cross the bridge to there or take subway 6 line to DaJuYuan",
          "What's to tell? This place is basically an indoor/outdoor market some inside the hill and some attached on the outside. Many stories tall. It's not quaint, or historic, it's become a tourist trap that everyone has to go to, and I mean everyone. The crowds are insane. Simply",
          "red lanterns again. everywhere. shops with loud speakers are yelling over your head.. take pictures then run!",
          "It is an old street type of tourists attraction. I is mostly junks and street hawkers. It is noisy but with live atmosphere. Many people are there and it is just like a typical China's old street scene. OK to visit for an hour or two.",
          "Very good attraction in Chongqing, so good and veey popular in Chongqing, every one said is a famous place",
          "I never thought it was a cave as it is more like a commercial building with different shops selling all sort of products and many restaurant. However trying to go up and down by the elevators is a challenge.",
          "This is a semi market mall in the theme of Cave. It is similar to Ciqikou but more modern with a lot of foods, souvenirs and restaurants.",
          "Interesting from the outside, but it is really just a collection of shops. Nice night time photos, and plenty of restaurants.",
          "For sure a MUST SEE. Busy and congested at times but if you are looking for small eateries .. This is the place!",
          "It is not a cave as the name suggests. I love to go to this place . It is very interesting with its many floors from the road level above. From the front to the back of the building, there is a 9 floors difference. It has very interesting light-up on every floor & I find it very",
          "Great night view. Worth to walk around. Many restaurants in the Hong ya dong, but suggest to eat around at JieFang Bei as the food not so nice.",
          "Well... the trip to Hongya was ok... it was saturday and it was crowded. there are many venders who sell some food etc. there are also lovely restaurants. interesting palce to visit if you are in Chongqing.",
          "Lots of cheap souvenirs and cheap eats - great for people watching, but limited access to lifts - a fun diversion but not a \"must see\"",
          "It\u2019s really beautiful at night. So crowded. You can go up thru the elevator to Jiefangbei. Or walk to the bridge.",
          "Visited in the morning when the shops were just opening up, and with less crowd. The ancient style architecture combining with the waterfall and walk bridge in front of the cave makes it look so artistic. There seem quite some variety of shops selling from souvenirs to",
          "Restaurants and bars in a 10 storeys or so building. Good to go there in the evening to see the great view of the river.",
          "Hongya Dong is becoming more and more popular recently. Among the skyscrapers it stands unique as a traditional Chinese style contraction, which turned to a tourist attraction with restaurants and shops with traditional souvenirs and food. While living in Chonqging we were",
          "This year I visited Chongqing a few times and had a chance to visit Hongya cave. I enjoyed purchasing tea, sitting down and going through the full pouring experience. You can also take a gamble an select a rock to make a jade bracelet out of. It's a gamble though in case you",
          "You'll have to be here twice, 100% Once is in day time, to visit all the shops, buy some snack or popsicle and wondering in each of them. Second time is at night, from the bridge near by, you'll find the splendid view just like in the movie Spirited Away of Mr. Miyazaki Hayao.",
          "I have been a couple times and let me tell you DO NOT GO on Friday night ... it\u2019s a lot of people and actually I didn\u2019t enjoy it when is too crowded. If you find a place with the view is the bridge the cheapest will be around $8 (\u00a550-60) if you wanna have a beer or something",
          "Located right on the river, the 11 floors of Hongya Cave contain lots and lots of market stalls selling all manner of foods and trinkets. Crowded and cramped, this is not the place to go to get away from it all. It essentially is a shopping mall, Chinese-style, complete with",
          "It is quite scenic at night with the lights on but this place is too crowded. It has 11 floors from the top. All are restaurants and shops selling local products between the floors. To go to the bottom, need to a lift down and be prepared for long queue. It is a must if you",
          "A friend and I visited this over hyped attraction on a Friday evening. What a mob there was with a long wait even to enter. We decided not to enter so walked along to the bridge and took some rather good pictures but were never tempted to join the mob.",
          "Amazing view from the bridge and across the river, spectacular at night with all the city lights up. However, going into the belly of the beast is another experience. Hundreds of little shops and restaurants, selling more or less the same things. Food is good but nothing great",
          "Best time to visit is at dusk, to enjoy the night lights and the hustle and bustle of 100\u2019s of stores, selling anything and everything a tourist or a local may want. Beautiful views of the river and tons of eating places.",
          "Normally, I\u2019m not a big fan of rebuilt \u201ctraditional\u201d houses that got turned into huge touristy markets. But to my surprise, I enjoyed Hongya Cave. The place is huge! A lot bigger than I expected. You can wander for hours. There\u2019s so much to see, so many stalls selling souvenirs",
          "Besides the spectacular view at night, the cave also offers variety of shopping and assortment of food stalls. The premises also has fine dining, which were not too bad for this tourist Mecca in the area.",
          "I went there during daytime, and it was horrible. Super hot, very humid, very \"grey\", dirty water... I went there at night and it was great. Still, super hot, but the view of the old buildings from the bridge is great.",
          "We started at the top and worked our way down. Sampled many treats along the way. Saw a few bars and cafes, we didn't stop, wish we had. It's a popular tourist spot, so it was crowded.",
          "This is a great place to walk around. During July and August it is vacation time for Chinese so a bit crowded.",
          "We had a brief stop off here as part of a recent tour and found it a lively spot, fully of colour - and people having a relaxed time. Fun.",
          "Hongya Cave is a must-go if you visit Chongqing. The night view is spectacular. I must say it can\u2019t be seen elsewhere. Inside this 11 storey building, you can enjoy good food, especially hot pot, buy local snacks and handicrafts, there are pubs, coffee places and massage too.",
          "I definitely would recommend visiting Hongya Cave, but only at night where you can take in the lights. There is no air conditioning, thus it can be quite hot and humid. There are several levels of shops and food vendors in Hongya Cave. I recommend going to the nearby bridge",
          "Packed with people but worth the visit. Night lights are simply splendid. Lots of dining, drink and shopping options.",
          "We visited at night it was very busy and the wait for the lift was about 10 minutes. Lots of shops and food stalls cover most of the floors, at 8am you can see the lazar light show that was amazing and then stand back and gaze at the Cave in all its glory as it gets dark and",
          "Very interesting mix of modern and tradition food and shopping. Ab bit confusing moving from level to level and quite crowded, but a great experience.",
          "Flat walking with elevator to each floor. Great views of the Yangtze and Jailing River. We then walked to the cable car. If the lines are long you may want to take it from the other side of the river as I noticed the lines from that end were not nearly as long.",
          "Hongya-dong or Honya \"Cave\" is a shopping area but there is no cave. (The word \"dong\" means an area rather than a cave, as in S. Korea, eg Insa-dong, Myeong-dong).The shopping area has some 4 levels and many shops sell food stuff and souvenirs. It is not an up-market shopping",
          "As with all of China there is always a crowd. The place is very interesting the way the building, which contains plenty of shops, is built into the cliff.",
          "A piece of history, going as far back as 2,300 years. Military base from ancient China to Ming & Qing Dynasties. I suggest you go after 8pm, the place lights up. It is totally worth walking mid-way in the bridge where the massive crowd dissipates. Awesome views 180 degrees!",
          "spent a very short time here on a Sunday afternoon. The place is basically a large shopping+restaurant complex except for the ancient-looking facade. it was filled with tourists when we visited and we spent the time walking down the floors (from 11th down to 1st) of restaurants",
          "Nice lights, lots of people, interesting food and stuff. Could spend 2 hours here without being bored. We liked it :)",
          "This building itself is spectacular especially when viewed at night. They have about 9 levels where you can find individual stalls selling foods, souvenirs, handicrafts, all kinds of spices and also pubs for the thirsty. When we went there it was very crowded, nevertheless",
          "So called because the ancient houses are on stilts Very pretty but relatively small area. You can take the elevator up to view the bridge as well as the Chongqing Opera House. On ground level there are nice wall murals as well as a cultural street filled with shops selling",
          "The wooden stilted houses was built on a slope overlooking the Jialing River and Yangtze River. In the olden days the poor laborer lived in this area. The building houses many restaurants, food stores selling local delicacies and tea houses. Go to the higher level to have a nice",
          "Touristy but well worth the visit. We had some nice food here and enjoyed the building. A must if in town.",
          "The view needs to be enjoyed from far. Hotpot could be a draw but it very much depend on what you after. Taste or view.",
          "In midst of the high rise dominated city you can find this little market area. It's a bit crowded and the food choices are pretty standard although there is a nice Peking duck place. Make sure to visit at night as everything is lit beautifully. Makes the experience so much",
          "This place remind me of the movie \"spirited away\". Especially at night when the whole place light up it is just so mesmerizing. The food they sell there is nothing special, you can find it all over Chongqing easily. Avoid going due the holiday season, it is super crowded.",
          "In a sea of grey high rise city scape, this was at least a welcome distraction. Although in any other setting it would attract poor reviews, i suspect. It is a man-made traditional Chinese tourist attraction, which is a little tacky. But worth seeing if you have a couple of",
          "This is a market area for tourists but it's a really interesting place to visit. They've got several levels of shops including food places and shops selling goods. There's a waterfall and the architecture is made to look like historical buildings. It gives a beautiful view of",
          "This place has big big Wow factor. Stunningly lit up at night, coupled by the views of the bridges across the JiaLing and Yangtze rivers. A must see , if one visits Chongqing .",
          "This is a place for tourist, you can have almost everything here and all the famous food here. if you are looking for a one stop solution, this is the place. Very beautiful sight seeing around.",
          "the stores are built on the hills, but not in order. Fun places to walk around and take different pictures. Many street foods available. However, be prepared to walk stairs since just too many people are waiting elevators.",
          "If you have to choose between Ci Qi Kou and the Hongya Caves, I would personally recommend the caves!! Not only is it a cute snack and food area with awesome souvenirs, but you are also able to be a part of the beautiful architecture there!! It was really cool, and would",
          "This place although quite interesting in the set up, is full of shops which only attracts curious tourists but nothing much of a character. We ended using it as hop to the river cruise which was highly recommended",
          "This is a very popular, very kitschy spot. It is about 10 floors of restaurants, cafes, snack stalls, arts and craft, tumbling down a cliffside facing the Jialing River. It is brightly lit at night, and attracts crowds of photo-takers. I was quite uneasy inside the building.",
          "The Hongya Cave is my favorite spot in Chongqing! It is so unique that I couldn\u2019t get enough of it! The building itself is a piece of art! It is a replica of an old Chongqing high-stand house. The building has 11 levels in total. People can enter from level 9 or level 1; all",
          "Start at the top and walk down. Lots of shops for selling local food stuff and souvenirs. Did not appeal to me. Waterfall was a not spectacular. Hotpot restaurant, Long Yue on the 2nd floor next door at the top was more interesting.",
          "Very little to say. On a night Honyadong (Honya cave) looks very nicely lit from across the river. But upon closer inspection such a disappointment. On a night full of drunks during the day just a generic tourist spot lacking any real feeling.",
          "This attraction is very busy and lovely at night when everywhere is lit up. We didn't even bother to take the lift down the 11 floors below as it was so crowded as well as it was raining during our visit. There are restaurants, cafes. shops and everything you will need over",
          "This attraction is well worth a visit, not least for the spectacular views from the viewing point up top. Underneath you are shops and cafes if that's your thing, but if you're a keen photographer you can get great shots from this vantage point. Take the lift and see for",
          "Touristy spot with lots of restaurants, pubs and souvenir shops. Went there twice, once in the day and the other time at night. The spot becomes bustling at night, and the extremely ordinary looking place looks so different with the lighting. Tip: walk to the bridge to take a",
          "this place is just next to the river and you should visit it during the day time and the night time as well. It has restaurants and shops in 11 floors. It has also an amazing view to the river. Must see.",
          "One of the places to visit when in Chongqing..can spend an hour or so if you sit in one of the cafe\u2019s.. nice ones on the 4th and 5the level. Lots of street food some different from other parts of china , enjoyed some octopus dumplings Difficult to get a taxi back to the hotel",
          "I always try and explore a new city and this town has plenty of history that is worth seeing and understanding. The walk up in the caves is a must and offers you a good insight to the city and how people lived. You can even have a bite to eat, but be careful it is VERY hot!!",
          "Location is in town, very accesible. Can take nice views of the city from here. Very few elevetors and tend to be packed, Shops are decent, good variety, we didnt spend too much time there.",
          "It is great building if you see from outside. Especially with the night view. However, the arrangement of the shops or management is not so up to standard. For example, toilet management, which is dirty and wet all the time Staircase wall is dirty and no clear direction where",
          "It's a quite nice area to visit at night. We came here for the hot pot (Zhiyanhe hot pot, which is really good and authentic). Afterwards we just wandered around. It's nice to walk around when it's not rainy, and the lights are quite pretty.",
          "Chongqing to appreciate the traditional Bayu architecture, to explore the old streets of the mountain city, to appreciate the Bayu culture, to enjoy the interchange view of the two rivers and to taste the well-known delicious food of the Baiyu area. As it has concentrated all",
          "Usually very crowded with very long waits for the lifts. Not sure what the point of visiting it is, as the main thing Hongyadong offers to me is its look. Which you can't appreciate from the inside. Don't bother visiting it, just look at it at night when its lit up and",
          "The period I went was not so crowded. It is good to take a walk inside the building to have a feel of it. This is really worth a visit especially coming at night. You could have a good view of it at the bridge, \u5343\u53ae\u95e8\u5609\u9675\u6c5f\u5927\u6865 at night.",
          "Apart from having nice photo taking place, this place offer various small little shop selling various kinds of street food. Can be pricey as it is a tourist spot.",
          "Except for nice photos that tourists can take of hongya cave at night, there really isnt much character in this place. Its abt 9 stories high, has not many stairs or escalators, only 3 lifts that are always on full load operating non stop thru out the day. Also a place where u",
          "This is really worth a visit but expect it to be very crowded. The view at night time is really worth coming for even though you are unlikely to get a great photo without dozens of other people in the shot. The food is reasonably priced at most of the shops which was a",

          "Although it is very touristy and overly crowded especially at the night but it is worth a visit. Go before sunset, stay for dinner and see the city lights come on at night. There are many dining options. Try the affordable fast food \"Super Chow\". It has non spicy food items. We",
          "We have hang around this place for 1-2 hours and we have visited one of local restaurants at 4th floor. Prices were cheap, food portions big and really tasty. And service was extremly fast. Everyone on Chongqing should consider having a meal in here.",
          "If you are going to visit (I encourage you too) do so at night it is much more alive and the lighting adds to the atmosphere. A river boat cruise is well worth it and pay a little extra once onboard to sit in the VIP section. The night cruise is much better as the building have",
          "This is a newer complex designed to look old. Lots of restaurants and shops. Great views over the river. If you are in Chongqing you can spend a few hours here. I hear it is good for nightlife but we were here this visit during the day. It is popular with Chinese tourists.",
          "This is a cool spot to visit in the evening after the lights go down. The views across the river are excellent as is the Hongya Cave structure itself. There is plenty of shopping and dining to be had.",
          "Hongya Cave is a tourist hot spot, full of tourists night and day. There are some shops and restaurants, all on different levels as it is build on a slope overlooking the river. The view is very nice, especially at night when everything gets lit up. Also looking from Jianbei or",

          "Deeply impressive and with world unesco status . It's an incredible site and the rock carvings simply stunning . There has been renovation so sometimes not clear what's original and what's not . But well worth a visit a real world cultural treasure.",
          "As other reviewers have accurately pointed out, it's not really a cave but a huge, multi-story shopping complex plastered to the side of the mountain and overlooking the Yangtze River. It's also quite attractive and has a lot of little sights built into it. You can shop, eat",
          "There is 11 levels altogether, lowest level at Jialingjiang Binjiang Rd, and level 1 at Changbai Rd. Accessibility to this location is within walking distance from the CBD area. However, the lifts are crowded and almost impossible to use, especially during peak period. So there",

          "It's always fun to walk around these night markets and get some street food, but its nothing out of the ordinary and about the same as other cities within China. The one thing that is really cool is that it is located on the cliff side so offers some pretty good sights.",
          "Covers a large area and could potentially be very hot during the warmer months. The shops were fairly repetitive.",
          "Good place, but need to know better time and day to go with family! Not good yo go in holidays or weekend in the end of the day!",
          "Accessible from chao tianmen. Interesting building. Nothing much though. I was there during day time. Believe night view will be nicer.",
          "We enjoyed wandering around here, we started at the top and had a beautiful view over the skyline. We made our way to the bottom via stairs and escalators however there doesn't seem to be much order with the placement of these, it can be quite confusing to get around. The",

          "The caves were interesting housed with shops and F&B. Be prepared to have energy to climb up and down the eight storey caves. Even though there are built in lifts but the lifts are always very congested with tourist. After the a few trips zapping in and out , I still get lost in",

          "Too crowded and some pirate themed cave that made no sense in a historical and typical place like this. Apart from that, great views, beautiful details, tottaly worth it",

          "It's just a disguised mall that is nicer to see from the outside (preferably at night) than the inside. Just a bunch of restaurants and shops along several floors stacked up against a hill",
          "A spot built by the city for shopping, eating and enjoy some Chongqing culture along the river. It's built vertically along the caves. It has an equivalent of about 15 floors. So when the elevators are busy, climbing the stairs will be a work out. Trust me, we did that the hard",
          "If you wanna see the city, but don't have much time, then go to Hongya Cave. Chongqing city is all about food, mountain, river, food, high-rise buildings and again food. For 2-3 hours in this place you can feel what is Chongqing",
          "Unlike what the name suggests, it's more like a shopping arcade and market place... but very good at it. Must visit, if you're at Chongqing.",
          "A classic looking building. There are restaurants there. Cant really see the nice view of it when you are in that place. Its better to take a boat trip and the view should be better.",
          "Honya Cave =named Hong ya dong. One side overlooking river, other side the rocks. A lot of foreigners come here to wait for the Yangzhe river cruise. Nearby small local rstaurants with very good food. No tourists come here because of very local character. Only Chinese speaking",

          "Some good bargains to be had and haggling is often possible. Items are often good quality with not so much 'tat'. Good for traditional buys for gifts. Lovely clothes and accessories. Some prices are much more than others so check the exchange rate. Keep belongings to yourself",
          "They call it a cave because the trinket shops are inside a section that has been dug into the hill and completely enclosed by the rock on one side and the food shops on the other, so don't expect to do any spelunking. If taking the monorail to get here, get off at Xiaoshizi",
          "We visited this historic, river front 'cave' without knowing that over the years, the area has been commercialized, complete with highly Westernized bars & restaurants. There is shopping mall & even dotted with little shops on several floors, but one does not need to linger",

          "Rubbish new built tourists attraction, it's nothing to do with historical things at all. It's a place where mainly selling the same stuff you can find anywhere in China, and it's very depressing. If you want to look for a little adventure to walk up the man made fake cave, you",

          "super crowded during dinner time, but a lot of food choices and nice for a relax stroll. Even restaurants are huge, better make a reservation to avoid waiting too long",
          "Here I was able to enjoy local food, and also Western food if I was missing it - decent beer selection and price at the Irish pub on floor 9 as well. Looking forward to returning for shopping for more traditional souvenirs. :)",
          "This cave is not so big but nice with naturalistic view. You can feel the fresh air that surrounds the cave. There is a waterfalls that adds the beauty of this cave.",
          "Unless you plan to eat there (again, tourist trap), there's nothing much to do except taking pictures of the place as its one of the icons in chongqing",
          "The multi-storey place full of stuff to choose. The building itself is preserved from the old day so it quite tempting for me coz I love the oldies. Also, you can find variety of restaurants there. Such a good place to spend the day.",
          "This was actually second time I visited the caves the first was from the street above and took in view of city but I did not know of caves below. The caves and shops surrounding them are interesting I mostly enjoyed walking through antique shops but was too cheap unfortunately",
          "Not an authentic venue, the surrounds have been reconstructed to provide a snapshot into a bygone era. Right in the Yangtze River, the dining options are plentiful - with hotpot dominating, of course. Very touristic, but still very interesting. Best in the evening.",
          "Hong Ya Dong is one of my most favorite place in Chongqing to go around with dear friends for a holiday dinner. There are many restaurants to choose. Most offer specialised Chinese cuisine but there are some Western restaurants too. It's nice to roam around on the numerous",
          "It's alright if you want some peace and quiet in an urban city. But don't expect too much. I went there in the day time. The waterfall/cave wasn't too impressive and there were some shops but I wasn't too interested in them.",
          "An amazing place in the middle of a bustling city. At night the buildings light up and the views over the river are amazing. There is 5/6 levels of craft, souvenir and dining outlets. It is a very crowded venue but it adds to the atmosphere. Be prepared for a bit of push and",
          "Tourist attraction alongside the river, full of local cuisine and restaurants serving Chongqing specialities. The food is excellent and the view of this place from across the river is awesome. Chongqing at night when it is all lit up is one of the sights of the world.",
          "If you haven't been there before, it worth trying. The view is nice but do not expect too much for the rest. Most floors are filled with shops selling souvenirs that you can see everywhere when traveling in China.",
          "This is a very unique building complex. Very beautiful at night. It hosts many bars and restaurants. Good place to take pictures. You can have a coffee at the riverside bar and watch the night views across the river",

The best selling souvenir you'd see on the streets is a twisted crispy biscuit (\u9ebb\u82b1). As this is a touristy area, would",
          "Little peace of old Chongqing right on the river. Very beautiful to visit before sunset. Local market is inside with some souvenirs and traditional food. A unique architecture with a lot of artificial elements. You would need at least one hour to explore the area and make sure",
          "we started at the nearby square and walked to here as it got dark. We walked through for a couple hours. Make sure to go down to street level on the west end of it for some good photos of the caves.",
          "There's a sightseeing balcony with great views of the river and surrounding CBD + bridge. Head down the lift onto the main section of this place and you'll stumble upon a food street! We picked a random food stall, ordered spicy cold noodles and dumplings, they were great!",
          "Come to this place at sunset or night, the view from the viewing balcony is just majestic. It's takes a bit of a walk from the liberation square and it's downhill, but definitely worth it!",
          "This is nice place for visit in Chongqing with many food and good view. Very crowded in evening but still nice to visit there for different experience",
          "This is a tourist area, the prices are higher, but not cut-throat. Nice view of the river from the top floors.",
          "Good food and great views, I enjoyed the unique experience downtown Chongqing. At night the view of the bridge all light up over the river is spectacular",
          "Located in the riverside of Yangtze river, the place is in a walking distance from Jiefangbei CBD. this place is good to visit from afteroon to around 10 PM. You can try variety of local snacks, local arts and even foreign foods over here.",
          "The buildings in this area is very interesting1nd beautiful. The overall city is not very nice. But still worth a visit.",

          "Spent a night walk here for nice neon light view. Cafe, antique, souvenirs, restaurants and hotel. Building built on hillside with few stories and may enter on hill top from jiefangbei direction or ground floor near the river.",
          "In the evening with all the lights ist nice to see from far. For sure you have a wonderful view over the river with one of the new bridges. Shopping? The same like everywhere. Food? average.",
          "Interesting architecture thats nice to just walk about and enjoy your day. Visit the NenLu teashop for a nice quiet afternoon too. There are a couple of nice restaurants here too!",
          "Hongya Cave is uniquely, a flair of Old Chongqing behind the backdrop of Jialing River. It is a cluster of shops , houses and temples built closely on a hill side .The rustic charm of sparodic buildings with ancient facade from dynastic eras is quite nostalgic. Each cluster",
          "There are some nice shops; we didn't try the restaurants. We did enjoy wandering the paths through the park, near the waterfall, and liked the outdoor sculptures. On a weekend, the elevators are seriously inadequate, and you can wait a long time, or walk... On Saturday",
          "Loved every moment in this place. If your looking for some nightlife fun,ancient chinese buildings and a chinese shopping experience you must come here. I recommend coming to this place at night since the whether will be cooler and they will light lanterns which looks really nice",
          "If exploring downtown Chongqing then this is a great spot to go for lunch. We particularly enjoyed the Japanese restaurant. There are shopping options on the various levels, I have been told it's a good place for carpets but haven't looked into it.",

          "If you are first timer, I must say that hongya cave is a good sights to see, there has a small waterfall and a sculpture, nice place to photograph. If you go inside, its actually a messy place of shopping stores, unbelievably pisses smell in any toilet. There also have culinary",
          "Go at night to view the lights and enjoy the atmosphere. I find the prices too expensive and returned to Deyi Building for dinner. Nonetheless, it's worth a visit after taking the cable car ride.",
          "We arrived in Chongqing in the morning and took a cab to the dock, where we read on a blog that you could store your bags for the day. Little that we knew that the place looked like a warzone. The city and the dock! We felt very uncomfortable and we cancelled the plan to go to",
          "Don't be fooled by the street level access. You need to find access (by lift/elevator/stairs) to get to the lowest level so you can marvel at how the buildings cling to the hillside. Shops are not much, but the few traders at river level are good fun.",
          "It's an interesting place to wander around and get a taste of Chongqing if you're visiting. Souveniers are readily available and you can bargain with many of the shop owners. There are a few western restaurants and a Starbucks which makes this a place that expats eventually",
          "This is is a must see place but is best seen at night because everthing is lit up including the boats and bridge.You will get many photo oportunities.When you walk down the road towards the bridge(on the right) you will see Starbucks and the entertainment starts from there and",

          "If it's your first visit to Chongqing, you can choose to spend the first evening here. Chongqing is known in China as 'Shan cheng', or the 'mountainous city'. I would rather say that Chongqing is a city built on slopes or cliffs, as you can often see. Such is Hongya Cave.",
          "A magnificent cluster of buildings- hotels, shopping mall & tea houses that is built on the slope, on slits and facing the river. Spend a couple of hours there to enjoy the great creation of mankind.",

          "Great place with several expat restaurants and bars. Over looks the river. There is a Subway (sandwich), Starbucks, and Dairy Queen on the upper level. Take an escalator down and you will find some fun expat spots that offer imported beer, tex mex, and such.",
          "Hongya Cave consists of many ancient dwellings, which have been restored, and is built on the hillslopes overlooking the area. It is walking distance to Jiefangbei square, the CBD of CQ. There is a tea house for you to savour Chinese tea while taking in the scenery, and many",

          "It's full of restaurant and too commercial. If you are searching for a great place to see the river view at night, it will be a good choice to find a great seat at the coffee shop along the edge. If you are looking for a natural experience, try to find somewhere else.",

          "Hongyadong had been through cycles of being full or nearly empty, in terms of the number of merchants. Lately, it has been pretty well populated. I only recently discovered jewelry vendors on the street at the bottom of the cliff side Hongyadong area. Some very high-end. I",
          "It is worth visiting Hongya Dong as a tourist when in Chongqing. As per others' previous posts, it can get stenchy on a hot day. So better to visit later in the day towards the evening. Actually, it would be best to come before sunset , tour the area and take pictures , have",
          "Hong Ya Dong is a modern, but real Chinese shopping mall, newly build some years ago, but the exterior is totally in the ancient Chinse style. Inside you will find many stores with souvenirs for ver afforable prices, but you can also some find some more sophisticated items. A",

          "It's a magnificent structure steeped in local history. Definitely worth checking out. It's also located close to the river which offers you spectacular night views of yangzi. Plenty of snack stalls for you stomach to maintain your energy to climb up 11 stories. Caution:",
          "It is really quite amazing how they have constructed this multi level building into the side of the cliffs.The views from the top are also stunning, being located very near to major bridges over the Jialing River, also very interesting in itself. The complex is however, a",
          "Be sure to go at night as the view is very unique. Many shops and restaurants there but I think there are mainly for tourist as the price are no cheap at all. Nicely decorated place! Nice View, Nice Walk. Quite crowed at night. Need to wait a bit for your turn to get into",
          "Very unique buildings, with decent hotpot place, souvenir shops and local food stalls, and they are surprisingly good, unlike those terrible food we usually find at other tourist attractions.",
          "Maybe if your into trinket shopping or have kids this might be of interest. No so much a cave as a shopping mall anchored to a mountain with a cave. Very tourist, and a lot of overpriced souvenirs. Decent views of CQ and the rivers.",
          "Plenty of restaurants with working wifi. Starbucks at the top level with nice view of the river. Be careful of pickpockets though",
          "It's basically an old style building full of shops, good if want some souvenir's apart from that I wouldn't recommend in a hurry as a place to see!",

          "We visited this place twice, once in the evening and then during the day. There are all sorts of stores here, from clothing stores, to souvenir shops, snack stalls and full service restaurants. Parts of the shopping center are empty. The most interesting part is the food",
          "This is basically a town by itself, it was almost everything you need, accomodation, restaurants, shops etc. A shopping precinct that looks like it was carved into the side of a mountain. In fact, it probably is.... Not much I did not like about the place, other than the",
          "Good variety of restaurants with views of river. Cave is worth 2 minutes of your time; historic recreated buildings adjacent cave offer good restaurant choices",
          "While it is an important Chongqing tourist location, it's also a little tacky and over commercial and suffers from the fairly typical disney-fying of chinese culture prevalent in many local sights. However it is certainly worth going just to see the view of the river from the",
          "Aka Hongyadong, the project adopts the traditional \"diaojiaolou\", hillside house on stilts. As tourist sites go, I didn't find this at all offensive -- on the contrary, it does an excellent job of recreating a slice of history in a high quality, charming and beautiful way. Ok",

          "Visited last May. Situated close to the river - it looks impressive as you approach it as it seems to go up the rock face. Very much a tourist attraction with some nice views and photo ops but that is it. It has seen better days - full of really tacky tourist stalls. There are",
          "At the bottom, you can walk through a cave with a waterfall. This is aesthetically beautiful but only entertaining for about 5 minutes max. There's a subway, Irish pub, and a Starbucks within the structure which kind of take away from the ambiance of it being an old structure.",
          "Spent a cold and wet hour or so here. Enjoyed the time perusing the 11 levels. Obviously designed for tourists but has an eclectic selection of shops. Has a good view of the river, although in our case could not see the far shore because of the January weather. Certainly worth",
          "Street-like restaurants and shops in 11 floors. Tourist attraction, mostly for Chinese, but also lao wais (foreigners). Starbucks and typical Sichuan hot-pot hand in hand. Nice view to Jialing river, with funny pirate ship (why do they have it there?)",

          "I personally think this is a must visit in ChongQing. The architecture is so quintessentially Chinese, you must see it in person to appreciate. The place is divided in many levels, containing restaurants, markets, shops, and hotels. I recommend visiting late in the afternoon,",

        "wiki": "Baodingshan (Ch. \u5b9d\u9876\u5c71\uff0f \u5bf6\u9802\u5c71 also known as Mount Baoding, Precious Summit Mountain, and Summit of Treasures) is a Buddhist site in Chongqing. The site is located on a limestone outcropping at an elevation of 500 meters, fifteen kilometers north of the city of Dazu, a market town that dates to 758 CE and the city is ringed by religious sites dating from 892 to 1249 CE. Primary construction at Baodingshan took place during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127\u20131279 CE) but it remained largely unknown to the outside world until its reopening to the public in the 1980s, the earliest documented research on the site dating to 1944. The site has since been designated a World Heritage Site since 1999, falling within the collective grouping of Dazu Rock Carvings, a reference to the district in which Baodingshan is located. Dazu County covers 1400 square kilometers northwest of Chongqing on the road to Chengdu. During the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279 CE), this area of the Chengdu plain was considered one of the wealthiest regions in China.Consisting of a mile and a half of carvings, numbering over 6000 total, Baodingshan is an atypical Chinese Buddhist site for a variety of reasons: it includes both large scale iconic works as well as intricate narrative tableaux; it represents a variety of Buddhist schools of thought \u2013 Huayan, Chan, Pure Land, and Esoteric; it has copious amounts of Buddhist texts carved in conjunction with imagery; and it was constructed within 70 years under the supervision of one man, Zhao Zhifeng (\u8d75\u667a\u98ce). Baodingshan consists of two main parts joined by a temple, Shengshousi [Sagacious Longevity Temple \u5723\u624b\u5bfa\uff0f \u8056\u58fd\u5bfa]. Best known to the outside world is Great Buddha Bend [Dafowan\u5927\u4f5b\u5f2f\uff0f\u5927\u4f5b\u5f4e] due to its impressive collection of 31 tableaux featuring imagery such as the parinirvana of the historical Buddha, the hells scenes, the Peacock Queen and numerous other narrative tableaux, the most widely reproduced being the Taming the Wild Ox. Great Buddha Bend also claims some of the biggest Chinese versions of certain Buddhist works \u2013 in particular the Hell tableau and the 1000-Armed 1000-Eyed Avalokitesvara or Guanyin figure. This area of Baodingshan follows the natural contours of the landscape, a rocky semi-circle formed by the nearby river. At Great Buddha Bend, the carved works flow from one tableau into another\u2014large, deeply cut reliefs reaching dimensions as great as 26 feet high by 66 feet wide. Visitors encounter an uninterrupted series of carvings totaling 30 connected tableaux punctuated by two caves, giving the illusion of a handscroll. Several authors have even likened Baodingshan\u2019s Great Buddha Bend to \u201can illustrated storybook.\" The most obvious difference between Great Buddha Bend and other Chinese cave sites is the lack of caves, or even cave-like niches, in which the statues would normally be positioned. Caves at Buddhist sites such as Dunhuang and Yungang were seen as a necessary part of the religious process. They were places where the worshipper entered into a \u201cBuddha-world\u201d and performed rites of circumambulation or made offerings to an icon.\nThe other area of Baodingshan is Little Buddha Bend [Xiaofowan \u5c0f\u4f5b\u5f2f\uff0f\u5c0f\u4f5b\u5f4e], a smaller area situated above and behind the temple where some scholars have argued initiation rituals were carried out. It is within Little Buddha Bend that one finds the Founder\u2019s Pagoda, a carved work on which is seen images of the Tang dynasty local layman Master Liu \u2013 famous for his ten austerities that are depicted at Baodingshan as well as at other sites in Sichuan \u2013 as well as an image of Zhao Zhifeng, the monk credited with Baodingshan\u2019s creation. Equally important is the inclusion of a carved Buddhist scriptural catalogue on the lower levels of the pagoda, with some scholars noting that the catalogue\u2019s presence points to perhaps a different function for the text seen at the site as a whole. Other areas of Baodingshan include the Vimalakirti Hall, situated at the pinnacle of the summit, and the Longevity Pavilion located just above the Oxherding sequence of texts and images in Great Buddha Bend.\nBaodingshan has seen considerable growth in the last decade, with a new highway being built to Dazu from Chongqing to speed up access and new buildings and roads being constructed at Baodingshan itself. Scholarship on the site has also increased, from only minimal treatment of the site by Chinese scholars in the form of archaeological assessment being done up until the 1980s to volumes of essays being published annually. Early Western language work by H. Sorensen, A. Howard and K. Kucera has since been augmented by increasing interest among foreign scholars brought on by Baodingshan\u2019s movement onto the global stage and its subsequent acquisition of World Heritage status. The Dazu Academy of Rock Carvings now holds an international conference every five years to commemorate that landmark bringing together scholars from all over the world, the last of which was held in fall 2014.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Chongqing (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0o\u014b\u02e8\u02e9t\u0255\u02b0in\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u028a\u030c\u014b.t\u0255\u02b0\u00ee\u014b] (listen), UK: , US: ,), alternately romanized as Chungking, is a megacity in southwest China. Administratively, it is one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of central government of the People's Republic of China (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), and the only such municipality located far away from the coast. The municipality of Chongqing, which is around the size of Austria, includes the city of Chongqing and various non-connected cities. As the Chongqing municipality government directly administers the city of Chongqing, as well as rural counties, and other cities not connected to the city of Chongqing, Chongqing municipality can technically claim to be the largest city proper in the world, even though this is due to a classification technicality and not because it is actually the world's largest urban area.\nChongqing was a municipality during the Republic of China (ROC) administration, within the Sichuan Province. It served as its wartime capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), being one of the world's anti-fascist command centers. The current municipality was separated from Sichuan province on 14 March 1997 to help develop the central and western parts of China. The Chongqing administrative municipality has a population of over 30 million. The city of Chongqing, comprising 9 urban and suburban districts, has a population of 8,518,000 as of 2016. According to the 2010 census, Chongqing is the most populous Chinese municipality, and also the largest direct-controlled municipality in China, containing 26 districts, eight counties, and four autonomous counties.\nThe official abbreviation of the city, \"Y\u00fa\" (\u6e1d), was approved by the State Council on 18 April 1997. This abbreviation is derived from the old name of a part of the Jialing River that runs through Chongqing and feeds into the Yangtze River.\nChongqing has a significant history and culture. Being one of China's National Central Cities, it serves as the economic centre of the Sichuan Basin and the upstream Yangtze. It is a major manufacturing centre and transportation hub; a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit described it as one of China's \"13 emerging megalopolises\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nTradition associates Chongqing with the State of Ba.\nThis new capital was first named Jiangzhou (\u6c5f\u5dde).\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\nJiangzhou subsequently remained under Qin Shi Huang's rule during the Qin dynasty, the successor of the Qin State, and under the control of Han dynasty emperors.\nJiangzhou was subsequently renamed during the Northern and Southern dynasties to Chu Prefecture (\u695a\u5dde), then in 581 AD (Sui dynasty) to Yu Prefecture (\u6e1d\u5dde), and later in 1102 during Northern Song to Gong Prefecture (\u606d\u5dde). The name Yu however survives to this day as an abbreviation for Chongqing, and the city centre where the old town stood is also called Yuzhong (\u6e1d\u4e2d, Central Yu). It received its current name in 1189, after Prince Zhao Dun of the Southern Song dynasty described his crowning as king and then Emperor Guangzong as a \"double celebration\" (simplified Chinese: \u53cc\u91cd\u559c\u5e86; traditional Chinese: \u96d9\u91cd\u559c\u6176; pinyin: shu\u0101ngch\u00f3ng x\u01d0q\u00ecng, or chongqing in short). In his honour, Yu Prefecture was therefore converted to Chongqing Fu, marking the occasion of his enthronement.\nIn 1362, (Yuan dynasty), Ming Yuzhen, a peasant rebel leader, established the Daxia Kingdom (\u5927\u590f) at Chongqing for a short time. In 1621 (Ming dynasty), another short-lived kingdom of Daliang (\u5927\u6881) was established by She Chongming (\u5962\u5d07\u660e) with Chongqing as its capital. In 1644, after the fall of the Ming dynasty to a rebel army, Chongqing, together with the rest of Sichuan, was captured by Zhang Xianzhong, who was said to have massacred a large number of people in Sichuan and depopulated the province, in part by causing many people to flee to safety elsewhere. The Manchus later conquered the province, and during the Qing dynasty, immigration to Chongqing and Sichuan took place with the support of the Qing emperor.In 1890, the British Consulate General was opened in Chongqing. The following year, the city became the first inland commerce port open to foreigners. The French, German, US and Japanese consulates were opened in Chongqing in 1896\u20131904.\n\n\n=== Provisional capital of the Republic of China ===\n\nDuring and after the Second Sino-Japanese War, from Nov 1937 to May 1946, it was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's provisional capital. Indeed, after the General and remaining army had lived there for a time following their retreat in 1938 from the previous capital of Wuhan, it was formally declared the second capital city (pei du) on 6 September 1940. After Britain, the United States, and other Allies entered the war in Asia in December 1941, one of the Allies' deputy commanders of operations in South East Asia (South East Asia Command SEAC), Joseph Stilwell, was based in the city. This made it a city of world importance in the fight against Axis powers, together with London, Moscow and Washington, D.C. The city was also visited by Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of SEAC which was itself headquartered in Ceylon, modern day Sri Lanka. Chiang Kai Shek as Supreme Commander in China worked closely with Stilwell. From 1938 to 1943, the city suffered from continuous terror bombing by the Japanese air force. Lives were saved by the air-raid shelters which took the advantage of the mountainous terrain. Chongqing was acclaimed to be the \u201cCity of Heroes\u201d due to the indomitable spirits of its people as well as their contributions and sacrifices during World War II. Many factories and universities were relocated from eastern China to Chongqing during the war, transforming this city from inland port to a heavily industrialized city. In late November 1949, the Nationalist KMT government retreated from the city.\n\n\n=== Municipality status ===\n\nOn 14 March 1997, the Eighth National People's Congress decided to merge the Sub-provincial city with the neighbouring Fuling, Wanxian, and Qianjiang prefectures that it had governed on behalf of the province since September 1996. The resulting single division became Chongqing Municipality, containing 30,020,000 people in forty-three former counties (without intermediate political levels). The municipality became the spearhead of China's effort to develop its western regions and to coordinate the resettlement of residents from the reservoir areas of the Three Gorges Dam project. Its first official ceremony took place on 18 June 1997. On 8 February 2010, Chongqing became one of the four National Central/Core cities, the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. On 18 June 2010, Liangjiang New Area was established in Chongqing, which is the third State-level new areas at the time of its establishment.In August 2020 the city was hit by a large scale flood, the highest water level seen since the Cuntan hydrographic station was opened in 1939. This came after other smaller scale floods during the year. It is estimated the flood killed hundreds of people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Physical geography and topography ===\n\nChongqing is situated at the transitional area between the Tibetan Plateau and the plain on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the sub-tropical climate zone often swept by moist monsoons. It often rains at night in late spring and early summer, and thus the city is famous for its \"night rain in the Ba Mountains\", as described by poems throughout Chinese history including the famous Written on a Rainy Night-A Letter to the North by Li Shangyin. The municipality reaches a maximum width of 470 kilometres (290 mi) from east to west, and a maximum length of 450 km (280 mi) from north to south. It borders the following provinces: Hubei in the east, Hunan in the southeast, Guizhou in the south, Sichuan in the west and northwest, and Shaanxi to the north in its northeast corner.\n\nChongqing covers a large area crisscrossed by rivers and mountains. The Daba Mountains stand in the north, the Wu Mountains in the east, the Wuling Mountains in the southeast, and the Dalou Mountains in the south. The whole area slopes down from north and south towards the Yangtze River valley, with sharp rises and falls. The area is featured by a large geological massif, of mountains and hills, with large sloping areas at different heights. Typical karst landscape is common in this area, and stone forests, numerous collections of peaks, limestone caves and valleys can be found in many places. The Longshuixia Gap (\u9f99\u6c34\u5ce1\u5730\u7f1d), with its natural arch-bridges, has made the region a popular tourist attraction. The Yangtze River runs through the whole area from west to east, covering a course of 665 km (413 mi), cutting through the Wu Mountains at three places and forming the well-known Three Gorges: the Qutang, the Wuxia and the Xiling gorges. Coming from northwest and running through \"the Jialing Lesser Three Gorges\" of Libi, Wentang and Guanyin, the Jialing River joins the Yangtze in Chongqing.\n\nThe central urban area of Chongqing, or Chongqing proper, is a city of unique features. Built on mountains and partially surrounded by the Yangtze and Jialing rivers, it is known as a \"mountain city\" and a \"city on rivers\". The night scene of the city is very illuminated, with millions of lights and their reflection on the rivers. With its special topographical features, Chongqing has the unique scenery of mountains, rivers, forests, springs, waterfalls, gorges, and caves. Li Bai, a famous poet of the Tang dynasty, was inspired by the natural scenery and wrote this epigram.Specifically, the central urban area is located on a huge folding area. Yuzhong District, Nan'an District, Shapingba District and Jiangbei District are located right on a big syncline. And the \"Southern Mountain of Chongqing\" (Tongluo Mountain), along with the Zhongliang Mountain are two anticlines next to the syncline of downtown.Zhongliang Mountains (\u4e2d\u6881\u5c71) and Tongluo Mountains (\u94dc\u9523\u5c71) roughly forms the eastern and western boundaries of Chongqing's urban area. The highest point in downtown is the top of Eling Hill, which is a smaller syncline hill that keeps Yangtze River and Jialing River apart for some more kilometres. The elevation of Eling Hill is 379 metres (1,243 feet). The lowest point is Chaotian Gate, where the two rivers merge with each other. The altitude there is 160 metres (520 feet). The average height of the area is 259 metres (850 feet). However, there are several high mountains outside central Chongqing, such as the Wugong Ling Mountain, with the altitude of 1,709.4 metres (5,608 feet), in Jiangjin.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nChongqing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa), bordering on a monsoonal humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and for most of the year experiences very high relative humidity, with all months above 75%. Known as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" of the Yangtze river, along with Wuhan and Nanjing, its summers are long and among the hottest and most humid in China, with highs of 33 to 34 \u00b0C (91 to 93 \u00b0F) in July and August in the urban area. Winters are short and somewhat mild, but damp and overcast. The city's location in the Sichuan Basin causes it to have one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, at only 1,055 hours, lower than much of Northern Europe; the monthly percent possible sunshine in the city proper ranges from a mere 8% in December and January to 48% in August. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22121.8 \u00b0C (29 \u00b0F) on 15 December 1975 (unofficial record of \u22122.5 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) was set on 8 February 1943) to 43.0 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) on 15 August 2006 (unofficial record of 44.0 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F) was set on 8 and 9 August 1933).Chongqing, with over 100 days of fog per year, is known as the \"Fog City\" (\u96fe\u90fd), like San Francisco, and a thick layer of fog enshrouds it for 68 days per year during the spring and autumn. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, this special weather possibly played a role in protecting the city from being overrun by the Imperial Japanese Army.\nAs exemplified by Youyang County below, conditions are often cooler in the southeast part of the municipality due to the higher elevations there.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nChongqing has been, since 1997, a direct-controlled municipality in the Chinese administrative structure, making it a provincial-level division with commensurate political importance. The municipality's top leader is the secretary of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China (\"party chief\"), which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, the country's second highest governing council. Under the Soviet-inspired nomenklatura system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the Communist Party, and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include He Guoqiang, Wang Yang, Bo Xilai, Zhang Dejiang, and Sun Zhengcai, the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal party standing committee, the de facto top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.\nThe municipal People's Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor, who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.The municipality also has a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (zhengxie) meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The zhengxie is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.\n\n\n=== Military ===\nChongqing was the wartime capital of China during the Second Sino-Japanese war (i.e., World War II), and from 1938 to 1946, the seat of administration for the Republic of China's government before its departure to Nanjing and then Taiwan. After the eventual defeat at the Battle of Wuhan General Chiang-Kai Shek and the army were forced to use it as base of resistance from 1938 onwards. It also contains a military museum named after the Chinese Korean War hero Qiu Shaoyun.Chongqing used to be the headquarters of the 13th Group Army of the People's Liberation Army, one of the two group armies that formerly comprised the Chengdu Military Region, which in 2016 was re-organized into the Western Theater Command.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nChongqing is the largest of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China. The municipality is divided into 38 subdivisions (3 were abolished in 1997, and Wansheng and Shuangqiao districts were abolished in October 2011), consisting of 26 districts, 8 counties, and 4 autonomous counties. The boundaries of Chongqing municipality reach much farther into the city's hinterland than the boundaries of the other three provincial level municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and much of its administrative area, which spans over 80,000 square kilometres (30,900 sq mi), is rural. At the end of year 2017, the total population is 30.75 million.[1]\n\n\n==== Urban areas ====\n\na Indicates with which district the division was associated below prior to the merging of Chongqing, Fuling, Wanxian (now Wanzhou) and Qianjiang in 1997.\n\n\n==== Central Chongqing ====\n\nThe main urban area of Chongqing city (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e3b\u57ce\u533a) spans approximately 5,473 square kilometres (2,113 square miles), and includes the following nine districts:\nYuzhong District (\u6e1d\u4e2d\u533a, or \"Central Chongqing District\"), the central and most densely populated district, where government and international business offices and the city's best shopping are located in the district's Jeifangbei CBD area. Yuzhong is located on the peninsula surrounded by Eling Hill, Yangtze River and Jialing River.\nJiangbei District (\u6c5f\u5317\u533a, or \"River North District\"), located to the north of Jialing River.\nShapingba District (\u6c99\u576a\u575d\u533a), roughly located between Jialing River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nJiulongpo District (\u4e5d\u9f99\u5761\u533a), roughly located between Yangtze River and Zhongliang Mountain.\nNan'an District (\u5357\u5cb8\u533a, or \"Southern Bank District\"), located on the south side of Yangtze River.\nDadukou District (\u5927\u6e21\u53e3\u533a)\nBanan District (\u5df4\u5357\u533a, or \"Southern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Ba County, and changed to the current name in 1994. Its northern area merged into Chongqing, and its capital town Yudong is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nYubei District (\u6e1d\u5317\u533a, or \"Northern Chongqing District\"). Previously called Jiangbei County, and changed into the current name in 1994. Its southern area merged into Chongqing, and the capital town Lianglu Town is a satellite city of Chongqing.\nBeibei District (\u5317\u789a\u533a), a satellite city northwest of Chongqing.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\nAccording to a July 2010 article from the official Xinhua news agency, the municipality has a population of 32.8 million, including 23.3 million farmers. Among them, 8.4 million farmers have become migrant workers, including 3.9 million working and living in urban areas of Chongqing.\nThe metropolitan area encompassing the central urban area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 17 million.This would mean that the locally registered farmers who work in other jurisdictions number 4.5 million, reducing the local, year-round population of Chongqing in 2010 to 28.3 million, plus those who are registered in other jurisdictions but live and work in Chongqing. According to China's 2005 statistical yearbook, of a total population of 30.55 million, those with residence registered in other jurisdictions but residing in the Chongqing enumeration area numbered 1.4 million, including 46,000 who resided in Chongqing \"for less than half-year\". An additional 83,000 had registered in Chongqing, but not yet settled there.The 2005 statistical yearbook also lists 15.22 million (49.82%) males and 15.33 million (50.18%) females.In terms of age distribution in 2004, of the 30.55 million total population, 6.4 million (20.88%) were age 0\u201314, 20.7 million (67.69%) were 15\u201364, and 3.5 million (11.46%) were 65 and over.Of a total 10,470,000 households (2004), 1,360,000 consisted of one person, 2,940,000 two-person, 3,190,000 three-person, 1,790,000 four-person, 783,000 five-person, 270,000 six-person, 89,000 seven-person, 28,000 eight-person, 6,000 nine-person, and 10,000 households of 10 or more persons per household.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe predominant religions in Chongqing are Chinese folk religions, Taoist traditions and Chinese Buddhism. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 26.63% of the population believes and is involved in cults of ancestors, while 1.05% of the population identifies as Christian.The reports didn't give figures for other types of religion; 72.32% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, folk religious sects.\n\n\n== Crime ==\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the city became notorious for organised crime and corruption. Gangsters oversaw businesses involving billions of yuan and the corruption reached into the law-enforcement and justice systems. In 2009, city authorities under the auspices of municipal Communist Party secretary Bo Xilai undertook a large-scale crackdown, arresting 4,893 suspected gangsters, \"outlaws\" and corrupt cadres, leading to optimism that the period of gangsterism was over. However, local media later highlighted the apparent reliance by the authorities on torture to extract confessions upon which convictions were based. In December 2009, one defence lawyer was controversially arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison for \"coaching his client to make false claims of torture\" and in July 2010, another lawyer released videotapes of his client describing the torture in detail. In 2014, four policemen involved in the interrogation were charged with the practice of \"opposed illegal interrogation techniques\", considered by observers to be torture.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nChongqing was separated from Sichuan province and made into a municipality in its own right in 14 March 1997 in order to accelerate its development and subsequently China's relatively poorer western areas (see China Western Development strategy). An important industrial area in western China, Chongqing is also rapidly urbanising. For instance, statistics suggest that new construction added approximately 137,000 square metres (1,470,000 square feet) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. In addition, more than 1,300 people moved into the city daily, adding almost 100 million yuan (US$15 million) to the local economy.\nTraditionally, due to its geographical remoteness, Chongqing and neighbouring Sichuan have been important military bases in weapons research and development. Chongqing's industries have now diversified but unlike eastern China, its export sector is small due to its inland location. Instead, factories producing local-oriented consumer goods such as processed food, cars, chemicals, textiles, machinery, sports equipment and electronics  are common.\nChongqing is China's third largest centre for motor vehicle production and the largest for motorcycles. In 2007, it had an annual output capacity of 1 million cars and 8.6 million motorcycles. Leading makers of cars and motor bikes includes China's fourth biggest automaker; Changan Automotive Corp and Lifan Hongda Enterprise, as well as Ford Motor Company, with the US car giant having 3 plants in Chongqing.  The municipality is also one of the nine largest iron and steel centres in China and one of the three major aluminium producers. Important manufacturers include Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and South West Aluminium which is Asia's largest aluminium plant. Agriculture remains significant. Rice and fruits, especially oranges, are the area's main produce. Natural resources are also abundant with large deposits of coal, natural gas, and more than 40 kinds of minerals such as strontium and manganese. Coal reserves \u2248 4.8 billion tonnes. Chuandong Natural Gas Field is China's largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270 billion m3 \u2013 more than 1/5 of China's total. Has China's largest reserve of strontium (China has the world's 2nd biggest strontium deposit). Manganese is mined in the Xiushan area. although the mining sector has been criticised for being wasteful, heavily polluting and unsafe. Chongqing is also planned to be the site of a 10 million ton capacity refinery operated by CNPC (parent company of PetroChina) to process imported crude oil from the Sino-Burma pipelines. The pipeline itself, though not yet finished, will eventually run from Sittwe (in Myanmar's western coast) through Kunming in Yunnan before reaching Chongqing and it will provide China with fuels sourced from Myanmar, the Middle East and Africa. Recently, there has been a drive to move up the value chain by shifting towards high technology and knowledge intensive industries resulting in new development zones such as the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ). Chongqing's local government is hoping through the promotion of favorable economic policies for the electronics and information technology sectors, that it can create a 400 billion RMB high technology manufacturing hub which will surpass its car industry and account for 25% of its exports.The city has also invested heavily in infrastructure to attract investment. The network of roads and railways connecting Chongqing to the rest of China has been expanded and upgraded reducing logistical costs. Furthermore, the nearby Three Gorges Dam which is the world's largest, supplies Chongqing with power and allows oceangoing ships to reach Chongqing's Yangtze River port. These infrastructure improvements have led to the arrivals of numerous foreign direct investors (FDI) in industries ranging from car to finance and retailing; such as Ford, Mazda, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, ANZ Bank, Scotiabank, Wal-Mart, Metro AG and Carrefour, among other multinational corporations.\nChongqing's nominal GDP in 2011 reached 1001.1 billion yuan (US$158.9 billion) while registering an annual growth of 16.4%. However, its overall economic performance is still lagging behind eastern coastal cities such as Shanghai. For instance, its per capita GDP was 22,909 yuan (US$3,301) which is below the national average. Nevertheless, there is a massive government support to transform Chongqing into the region's economic, trade, and financial centre and use the municipality as a platform to open up the country's western interior to further development.Chongqing has been identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei, Anshan, Maanshan, Pingdingshan and Shenyang), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China.\n\n\n=== Economic and technological development zones ===\nThe city includes a number of economic and technological development zones:\n\nChongqing Chemical Industrial Park\nChongqing Economic & Technological Development Zone\nChongqing Hi-Tech Industry Development Zone\nChongqing New North Zone (CNNZ)\nChongqing Export Processing Zone\nJianqiao Industrial Park (located in Dadukou District)\nLiangjiang New Area\nLiangjiang Cloud Computing Center (the largest of its kind in China)Chongqing itself is part of the West Triangle Economic Zone, along with Chengdu and Xi'an.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nChongqing University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66)\nSouthwest University of Political Science and Law (\u897f\u5357\u653f\u6cd5\u5927\u5b66)\nThird Military Medical University (\u7b2c\u4e09\u519b\u533b\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (\u91cd\u5e86\u90ae\u7535\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing University of Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u7406\u5de5\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Jiaotong University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Medical University (\u91cd\u5e86\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Normal University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e08\u8303\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Technology and Business University (\u91cd\u5e86\u5de5\u5546\u5927\u5b66)\nChongqing Three Gorges University (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e09\u5ce1\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing Telecommunication Institute (\u91cd\u5e86\u901a\u8baf\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Science and Technology (\u91cd\u5e86\u79d1\u6280\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan Fine Arts Institute (\u56db\u5ddd\u7f8e\u672f\u5b66\u9662)\nSichuan International Studies University (\u56db\u5ddd\u5916\u56fd\u8bed\u5927\u5b66)\nUniversity of Logistics (\u540e\u52e4\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Arts and Science (\u91cd\u5e86\u6587\u7406\u5b66\u9662)\nYangtze Normal University (\u957f\u6c5f\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\nChongqing University of Education (\u91cd\u5e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5e08\u8303\u5b66\u9662)\n\n\n=== Notable high schools ===\nFuling Experimental High School (\u6daa\u9675\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.1 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u4e2d)\nChongqing Nankai Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5357\u5f00\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing No.8 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u516b\u4e2d)\nBashu Secondary School (\u5df4\u8700\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Railway High School (\u91cd\u5e86\u94c1\u8def\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Yucai Secondary School (\u80b2\u624d\u4e2d\u5b66)\nChongqing Foreign Language School (The High School Affiliated to Sichuan International Studies University \u91cd\u5e86\u4e00\u5916)\nVerakin High School of Chongqing (The 2nd Chongqing Foreign Language School, \u91cd\u5e86\u4e8c\u5916)\nChongqing Qiujing High School (\u6c42\u7cbe\u4e2d\u5b66)\nHigh School Affiliated to Southwest University (\u897f\u5357\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u4e2d)\nChongqing NO.18 Secondary School (\u91cd\u5e86\u5341\u516b\u4e2d)\n\n\n=== International schools ===\nYew Chung International School of Chongqing (\u91cd\u5e86\u8000\u4e2d\u56fd\u9645\u5b66\u6821)\nKL International School of Chongqing Bashu (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e02\u8bfa\u6797\u5df4\u8700\u5916\u7c4d\u4eba\u5458\u5b50\u5973\u5b66\u6821)\n\n\n== Transport ==\nSince its elevation to national-level municipality in 1997, the city has dramatically expanded its transportation infrastructure. With the construction of railways and expressways to the east and southeast, Chongqing is a major transportation hub in southwestern China.\nAs of October 2014, the municipality had 31 bridges across the Yangtze River including over a dozen in the city's urban core. Aside from the city's first two Yangtze River bridges, which were built, respectively, in 1960 and 1977, all of the other bridges were completed since 1995.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nPublic transport in Chongqing consists of metro, intercity railway, a ubiquitous bus system and the world's largest monorail network.\nAccording to the Chongqing Municipal Government's ambitious plan in May 2007, Chongqing is investing 150 billion RMB over 13 years to finish a system that combines underground metro lines with heavy monorail (called 'light rail' in China).\nAs of 2017, four metro lines, the 14 km (8.7 mi) long CRT Line 1, a conventional subway, and the 19 km (12 mi) long heavy monorail CRT Line 2 (through Phase II), Line 3, a heavy monorail connects the airport and the southern part of downtown., Line 6, runs between Beibei, a commuter city in the far north to the centre. Line 5 opened in late 2017.\nBy 2020 CRT will consist of 6 straight lines and 1 circular line resulting in 363.5 km (225.9 mi) of road and railway to the existing transportation infrastructure and 93 new train stations will be added to the 111 stations that are already in place.By 2050, Chongqing will have as many as 18 lines planned to be in operation.\n\n\n==== Aerial tramway ====\n\nChongqing is the only Chinese city that keeps public aerial tramways. Historically there were three aerial tramways in Chongqing: the Yangtze River Tramway, the Jialing River Tramway and the South Mountain Tramway. Currently, only Yangtze River Tramway is still operating and it is Class 4A Tourist Attractions in China. This tramway is 1,160 metres (3,810 feet) long, connecting the southern and northern banks of Yangtze River. The daily passenger volume is about 10,000.\n\n\n=== River port ===\n\nChongqing is one of the most important inland ports in China. There are numerous luxury cruise ships that terminate at Chongqing, cruising downstream along the Yangtze River to Yichang, Wuhan, Nanjing or even Shanghai. In the recent past, this provided virtually the only transportation option along the river. However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several port handling facilities exist throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nMajor train stations in Chongqing:\n\nChongqing railway station in Yuzhong, accessible via Metro Lines 1 & 3 (Lianglukou Metro station), is the city's oldest railway station and located near the city centre. The station handles mostly long-distance trains. There are plans for a major renovation and overhaul of this station, thus many services have been transferred to Chongqing North Railway Station.\nChongqing North railway station is a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to Chengdu, Beijing and other cities. It was completed in 2006 and is connected to Metro Line.\nChongqing West railway station is in Shapingba, a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to many cities. It is completed in 2018.\nShapingba railway station is in Shapingba, near Shapingba CBD, accessible via Metro Line 1. It handles many local and regional train services. It is completed in 2018.Chongqing is a major freight destination for rail with continued development with improved handling facilities. Due to subsidies and incentives, the relocation and construction of many factories in Chongqing has seen a huge increase in rail traffic.\nChongqing is a major rail hub regionally.\n\nChengdu\u2013Chongqing railway to Chengdu\nSichuan-Guizhou railway to Guiyang\nXiangyang\u2013Chongqing railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Huaihua railway to Hunan\nChongqing-Suining railway (Sichuan province)\nChongqing-Lichuan railway to Hubei\nChongqing\u2013Lanzhou railway (Gansu) railway\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nTraditionally, the road network in Chongqing has been narrow, winding and limited to smaller vehicles because of the natural terrain, large rivers and the huge population demands on the area, especially in the Yuzhong District. In other places, such as Jiangbei, large areas of homes and buildings have recently been cleared to improve the road network and create better urban planning. This has seen many tunnels and large bridges needing to be built across the city. Construction of many expressways have connected Chongqing to neighbouring provinces. Several ring roads have also been constructed. The natural mountainous terrain that Chongqing is built on makes many road projects difficult to construct, including for example some of the world's highest road bridges.Unlike many other Chinese cities, it is rare for motorbikes, electric scooters or bicycles to be seen on Chongqing Roads. This is due to the extremely hilly and mountainous nature of Chongqing's roads and streets. However, despite this, Chongqing is a large manufacturing centre for these types of vehicles.\nChongqing-Chengdu Expressway\nChongqing-Chengdu 2nd Expressway (under construction)\nChongqing-Wanzhou-Yichang Highway (Wanzhou-Yichang section under construction)\nChongqing-Guiyang Highway\nChongqing-Changsha Expressway (Xiushan-Changsha section under construction)\nChongqing-Dazhou-Xi'a Highway (Dazhou-Xi'an section under construction)\nChongqing-Suining Expressway\nChongqing-Nanchong Expressway\nChina National Highway 210\nChina National Highway 212\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nWith so many bridges crossing the Yangtze and Jialing rivers in the urban area, Chongqing is sometimes known as the 'Bridge Capital of China'. The first important bridge in urban Chongqing was the Niujiaotuo Jialing River Bridge, built in 1958. The first bridge over the Yangtze river was the Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge (or Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge) built in 1977.\nAs of 2014, within the area of the 9 districts, there were 20 bridges on the Yangtze river and 28 bridges on the Jialing river. The bridges in Chongqing exhibit a variety of shapes and structures, making Chongqing a showcase for bridge design.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe major airport of Chongqing is Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport (IATA: CKG, ICAO: ZUCK). It is located in Yubei District. The airport offers a growing network of direct flights to China, South East Asia, the Middle East, North America, and Europe. It is located 21 km (13 mi) north of the city-centre of Chongqing and serves as an important aviation hub for south-western China. Jiangbei airport is a hub for China Southern Airlines, Chongqing Airlines, Sichuan Airlines, China Express Airlines, Shandong Airlines and Hainan Airlines's new China West Air. Chongqing also is a focus city of Air China, therefore it is very well connected with Star Alliance and Skyteam's international network. The airport currently has three parallel runways in operation. It serves domestic routes to most other Chinese cities, as well as international routes to Auckland, New York City, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, Doha, Dubai, Seoul, Bangkok, Phuket, Osaka, Singapore, Chiang Mai, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Mal\u00e9, Bali, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Batam, Rome and Helsinki. As of 2018, Jiangbei Airport is the 9th busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic in mainland China.Currently, Jiangbei airport has three terminals. Chongqing Airport has metro access (CRT Line 3 and Line 10) to its central city, and two runways in normal use.There are two other airports in Chongqing Municipality: Qianjiang Wulingshan Airport (IATA: JIQ, ICAO: ZUQJ) and Wanzhou Wuqiao Airport (IATA: WXN, ICAO: ZUWX). They are both class 4C airports and serve passenger flights to some domestic destinations including Beijing, Shanghai and Kunming. Two more airports are being constructed soon: Wulong Xiann\u00fcshan Airport and Wushan Shenn\u00fcfeng Airport.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe language native to Chongqing is Southwestern Mandarin. More precisely, the great majority of the municipality, save for Xiushan, speak Sichuanese, including the primary Chengdu-Chongqing dialect and Minjiang dialect spoken in Jiangjin and Qijiang. There are also a few speakers of Xiang and Hakka in the municipality, due to the great immigration wave to the Sichuan region (\u6e56\u5e7f\u586b\u56db\u5ddd) during the Ming and Qing dynasties. In addition, in parts of southeastern Chongqing, the Miao and Tujia languages are also used by some Miao and Tujia people.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nAs the provisional Capital of China for almost ten years (1937 to 1945), the city was also known as one of the three headquarters of the Allies during World War II, as well as being a strategic center of many other wars throughout China's history. Chongqing has many historic war-time buildings or sites, some of which have since been destroyed. These sites include the People's Liberation Monument, located in the center of Chongqing city. It used to be the highest building in the area, but is now surrounded and dwarfed by numerous shopping centres. Originally named the Monument for the Victory over Axis Armies, it is the only building in China for that purpose. Today, the monument serves as a symbol for the city. The General Joseph W. Stilwell Museum, dedicated to General \"Vinegar Joe\" Stilwell, a World War II general. the air force cemetery in the Nanshan area, in memory of those air force personnel killed during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), and the Red Rock Village Museum, a diplomatic site for the Communist Party in Chongqing led by Zhou Enlai during World War II, and Guiyuan, Cassia Garden, where Mao Zedong signed the \"Double 10 (10 October) Peace Agreement\" with the Kuomintang in 1945.\n\nThe Baiheliang Underwater Museum, China's first underwater museum,\nThe Memorial of Great Tunnel Massacre, a former air-raid shelter where a major massacre occurred during World War II.\nThe Great Hall of the People in Chongqing is based on the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Chongqing is known for its spicy food. Its food is normally considered numbing because of the use of Sichuan pepper, also known as Sichuan peppercorn, containing hydroxy alpha sanshool. Chongqing's city centre has many restaurants and food stalls where meals often cost less than RMB10. Local specialties here include dumplings and pickled vegetables and, different from many other Chinese cuisines, Chongqing dishes are suitable for the solo diner as they are often served in small individual sized portions. Among the delicacies and local specialties are these dishes:\n\nChongqing hot pot (Huoguo) \u2013 Chongqing's local culinary specialty which was originally from Northern China.

          "My boyfriend and I went here to relax during Chinese New Year. It cost us 199 each, which is a bit pricier than previous reviews. It may have been because of the holiday. The price included the locker, slippers, and 3 towels. There are many pools to choose from, so even though",
          "you can find many places with hotspring in chongqing. Ronghui is good with its location within miles to city centre, but service is not good",
          "This is an amazing spa. I ended up staying 6 hours. Lots to do as there are maybe 30 different pools some with traditional Chinese medicine. There is an ice steam room and dry steam room. There are also scrub boxes. One with sand and one with salt. Huge! There is a fish foot spa",
          "I really wanted to give this place a 5-Star rating, but this is not going to happen. The site has huge potential, it contains several sections with different types of services found in traditional spas/hot springs (foot massage, chairs with Thai massages and bubble massages,",
          "Relax, relax, relax! There are a lot of different pool outside and inside one big pool with different stuff. Service is very polite and really worth it! It cost around 150 yuan",
          "It's everything I hoped it would be. It has every kind of pool imaginable, and you can easily spend all day here exploring different pools, saunas, quiet rooms for a nap, massage, and even have food though we didn't take advantage of it. It has clean and modern facilities, and",
          "Great place to relax during your trip through Chongqing. There are plenty of pools to choose, cold to very hot. And there is even a sauna!",
          "Ideal to visit after a tiring walk at Ci Qi Kou which is just 3 train stop away. Take bus 224. Best alight after the bus had passed a school else it is a 5 min walk from the bus terminal. The bus driver wasn't helpful to inform us of that. The hot spring is huge with over 50",
          "I would say this is a must to visit if you are in Chongqing. It has fantastic facilities from many options of hot spring , spa , sleeping area & restuarants. I suggest to spare at least 3 hours for this place or you can spend a day ! To get there is not expensive by Taxi. You",
          "I wouldn't necessarily give this place five stars. I personally thought the amenities once you were done with the hot springs were somewhat lacking compared to other places I've been (massages, food, entertainment, etc etc). Nevertheless, this place has the best hot springs",
          "As guest in Radisson Blu hotel, we were given vouchers for Ronghui Hot Springs. The hot spring is just 100m outside the hotel. We had to show our room card together with the voucher for free entry. As it was week day the resort was not crowded. The changing and locker rooms",
          "This Place is best to go By Metro line nr 1 and stop is Shapingba-station (nr 14) See the Metro-map enclosered. English speaking INFO in the nice train - tells when you are arrived Take a taxi ( about 15 yean) and show the address of Spa ( see my picture of address) You are on",
          "Our visit to this facility can certainly be classified as a highlight of our recent tour of China. But it was a pity that my wife and myself cld spend only half a day here! With so many hot aroma water baths, we were at a loss to choose the best ones! All so very clean with",
          "Great place, plenty of hot pools to enjoy! Most relaxing day spent in Chongqing!! Only downside is the number of taxis available, but walk to the nearby Raddisson Blu hotel and hopefully catch someone who just got off.",
          "Really good place. more than 20 different aroma-therapeutic baths, saunas, hydro massages, massages, pool etc. Just go and relax. It's the best hot springs around Chongqing.",
          "Very beautiful setting with a very impressive selection of baths and treatments. They even have a heated wave pool! The saunas and steam rooms were not that hot but the baths are the real attraction. All kinds of wine, lemon, mint, etc concoctions to steep in and make your skin",
          "Amazing day here. The staff are really helpful as well. So many different pools and choices. It was super quiet as we came in the morning but spent the entire day here. great value for money",
          "I was somewhat dubious prior to my first experience of hot springs, but this was really lovely. A great thing to do after several days walking around the giant construction zone known as Chongqing. Go on a cool and/or rainy day. The facilities are spotlessly clean and the",
          "A taxi from Shapingba was 14RMB. In the summer, price is 119RMB. In the winter, I think it is 189RMB. Went you're finished in the evening, go up the stairs in the central bit outside the changing rooms and you get free fruit and biscuits and can relax in comfy chairs",
          "This was the perfect day of relaxation. Hidden away from the hustle and bustle, the grounds are beautiful and the springs are so relaxing. I also got a massage which I can honestly say was the best I've ever had. On my next visit, I plan to spend all day at the spa. Highly",
          "Ronghui hot springs is and excellent way to spend a day away ftom the noise of CQ but choose your time carefully. Weekdays are easily the best. Easily accessed from Shappingba metro, take bus 224 and it will drop you right outside. 3 towels come with entrance price which is ok,",
          "This was my first hot springs experience in China. It is really more of a hot tub farm and water entertainment kind of place. If you happen to know what the various herbs and infusions are for, there is a wide array of different pools to try. And, the fish ponds were really",
          "This place was awesome, sad I discovered it on my last day in Chongqing. It is difficult to find, but an amazing oasis from the hustle bustle of the city",
          "I got off the metro at Shapingba and took a taxi, which cost about 14RMB. My driver dropped me off in front of the Radisson Blu because he wasn't sure where it was, but it was just a few steps away. They seem to have different discounts every day; on a Thursday in January I paid",
          "Go there if you would like to get a relaxing day from your busy working life. Don't go on weekends though, as there are too many people. Visit on weekdays and after 10am, as the hot springs outside will be available. Price is about RMB150/pax. And oh yeah, this hot spring is",
          "After reading so many good reviews me and my friend decided to visit the place yesterday.... From Jiefang bei taxi charged around 40 rmb. Awesome checkin... no deposit nothing.. Informed 50 rmb discount on entry (not sure why) hence it costed only 119 per person... good access",
          "This place is good for one day visit. For me it was first of its kind of public bath. There are around 30 different pools including doctor fish pools for foot massaging. We got a good deal for RMB119 (full price is RMB169) without showing any hotel card. I think the price is",
          "Clearly the best hot springs in Chongqing. Has it all. Has the greatest variety and more of everything working than at other hot spring resorts. Has many and various water jet beds, chairs, jet spays etc that have more working and more variety than at other Cq hot springs. Our",
          "We went on Christmas, so we only paid 80 yuan (instead of the normal 130 or so) and it was an awesome experience! We took the metro to Shopingba, and then from there it was a 20 yuan taxi ride. I didn't bring a bathing suit to China with me, and nowhere in Chongqing sells",
          "In the middle of the urban sprawl, this is an oasis of peace filled with wonderfully relaxing thermal waters and places where you can while away the hours. Among the attractions are steam and cedar saunas, dipping tubs, massage beds, fountains, and many individual aroma therapy",
          "Was there with family kids for the hot summer holiay,first time only used the indoor pool spa,with the various spa chairs (Thailand style,leg style,foot style...etc.)All DIY,use your hand wave on the swift then it will start the waters...All DIY,It's really convenient!Out door",
          "Went there, my husband and i, on March the 29th. The front desk of our hotel recommended this one when we said we wanted to go to the South hot springs. It was a good 20 min taxi ride from the Hilton Chongqing hotel and the ride cost about 30 yuen. The taxi driver had a hard",
          "I have been there two time.very nice for relaxing.all kind of poor for your relax such as red whine,small fish,massage,milk,hot rock ect",
          "This is a new visitor attraction although there are something like ten hot springs venues in Chongqing; this one, developed by the Ronghui Group alongside their new five star hotel, is run on very professional lines. It seems the staff have been trained in Japan and the high"

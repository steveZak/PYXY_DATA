It is the national zoo of South Africa, and was founded by J. W. B. Gunning in 1899. Pretoria Zoo is one of the eight largest zoos in the world and one of the most highly rated.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe farm Klein Schoemansdal, the property of Z.A.R. president Stephanus Schoeman, was sold to Johannes Francois Celliers who renamed it Rus in Urbe. It was acquired by the state in 1895, and the zoological gardens was established at the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899. It became the official National Zoological Gardens in 1916.\n\n\n== Landscape ==\nHalf of the zoo is situated on relatively flat ground, while the other half is located on the slopes of a hill. The two areas are separated by the Pies River flowing through the zoo. Two bridges provide access over the river.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nAround 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) of pathways are laid out in the zoo. Golf carts are available for rent for those that prefer not to walk; most, but not all of the exhibits are accessible by golf cart.\nA cable car links the top of the hill with a point close to the entrance at the bottom.\nThere are two restaurants located within the zoo and a picnic area on the banks of the Apies River.\nA crafts market is located outside the zoo entrance.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nProceeding from the entrance a visitor encounters a walk-through aviary, enclosures for chimpanzees, waterbirds and lemurs, a bird of prey aviary, further bird enclosures and the baboon and monkey enclosures along the western boundary.\nAt the centre of the zoo large sections are set aside for the African savannah waterhole and a set of large enclosures for smaller carnivores, South African cheetahs and king cheetahs, black rhinoceroses, giraffes, elephants, Przewalski's horses and South American mammals respectively. Amongst these are smaller enclosures for pud\u00fas, ruffed lemurs, red pandas, small primates, marmosets and tamarins, kangaroos and emus, owl aviaries and breeding units for birds.\nAgainst the northern hillside are six large enclosures for dholes, lions, Bengal tigers, Barbary sheep, Nubian ibexes and Hartmann's mountain zebras respectively.\nIn the western section the zoo includes Aquarium 1 and 2, and a reptile park, accessed via a separate entrance.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n360 degree Virtual Tour of the Pretoria Zoo",
        "brit": "National Zoological Gardens of South Africa, also called Pretoria Zoo,  zoo near Pretoria, S.Af., that is noted for its wildlife conservation programs. It was opened in 1899 by the State Museum of the South African Republic on a small stretch of land along the Apies River, which flows through Pretoria. In 1913 the zoo became the Transvaal Zoological Gardens, independent of the state museum; in 1916 it adopted its present name, and in 1933 the state took over management of the institution. Over the years the zoo gradually expanded, and it now occupies both sides of the Apies River, covering a total area of about 32 hectares (80 acres). The zoo\u2019s collection of antelope is one of the largest in the world. On the 4,047-hectare (10,000-acre) game-breeding centre, opened in 1974 near Lichtenburg, the zoo has successfully bred the endangered scimitar-horned oryx and the banteng. It also operates a 40.5-hectare (100-acre) cheetah-breeding area called De Wildt. The Pretoria Zoo was the first to breed the aardwolf, a member of the hyena family.National Zoological Gardens of South AfricaThe Apies River flowing through the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa, near Pretoria, S.Af.NJR ZA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\nYou Name It!\nThe people who live there call it Hellas.

          "This zoo has definitely seen better days. Visitors get to see a range of tired animals behind dirty glass and metal walls. Truculent tigers, lazy lions, pachyderms with a limited range to stomp, a sad bear out of his cooler North American context, flamingoes screeching at each",
          "Lovely Animals and nice atmosphere. Very educational. Loved seeing the White Tiger and other exotic animals as well as our own beautiful African animals. It's a pity about the lack of Funding to help the Zoo maintain some of its enclosures, and to clean up some of the rubbish in",

          "Fun place, one could rent a golf cart, the cable car is also good when you dont have enough time! The hawkers right outside the zoo have decent rates for souviniers!",
          "I was on leave and decided to take my grandson (now 4 years old) to the zoo. We had an absolute blast! He was especially impressed with the flamingos and elephants, but disappointed that he didn't see a whale at the aquarium (lol) - he recently saw a video clip about a whale.",
          "Visited the Zoo earlier this month and felt quite disappointed. Friends of ours waited over 40 mins for hotdogs at the restaurant. Facilities are run down and the complete state of the zoo is dated and not exciting at all. Animals weren't taken too good care of... So much",
          "After 6 years we again visited with the grand kids and were shocked with the filthy state of the zoo. I looks like a dump full of plastic. Also n a saturday the main restaurant was closed and seems to be closed for a long time. Childrens train rides were not functioning but",
          "Kleen well kept animals and a nice cable car ride top view of the enclosures. The staff very professional and helpful, the restaurant and stalls have great food and service was great, this is definitely a great family outing.",
          "Animals in good condition and quite a few things to see. Interesting aquarium house and snake house. It used to be a place where people could get robbed when they had to park their car outside and cross the road to the entrance but it seems to be better now.",
          "the animals are well taken care of. There is a cableway you can take to see the zoo from above and some kiosks. Overall it is great family entertainment. They have a walk once a month which is really worth doing- just ask about Friends of the Zoo.",
          "We go to the zoo every month, and know all the animals well. We watch the babies from birth until they are grown up. Such a priviledge to have such a place in Pretoria",
          "Well laid out, most of the enclosures are spacious and clean, and the animals seem quite content. Well fed and healthy, it's particularly pleasant to observe them and walk throughout the complex. A great place to take children and have picnics! The Friends of the Zoo incentive",
          "Great way to spend the day with family and a day out. Enjoyed the animals on display and the features of the zoo. There were quite a few empty enclosures, but the ones occupied were clean and looked healthy for the animals. Beautiful gardens and space, will definitely visit",
          "The zoo has definitely deteriorated from our last trip couple of years ago.Quite a Few animals looked underfed, especially the lions and tigers. They were skinny.the tiger's sides were in, hip bones sticking out. Can clearly see they haven't eaten in weeks. They look starved and",
          "Went to the zoo and had a lovely day. It's quite big and the children loved it. Lots to see. Childrens favourite was the aquarium.",
          "Even though it can get very busy, it is still a place well worth visiting. We did the Zoo walk and then stayed on after to properly look at all the animals. The restaurant is disappointing and one should take a picnic basket when visiting the zoo. The only coffee available was",
          "A couple of years ago we visited the zoo 2 -3 times a year. It used to be our highlight trips. Our recent visit sadly showed neglect with particular reference to the aquarium where most tank contained different fish to what it indicated. The komodo dragon enclosures were also",
          "This is the most amazing place to view wild animals & reptiles. It is very clean and located out of the main city, thus away from traffic conjestion. The zoological garden has leafy trees that makes it ideal to visit even on very hot days. There are places for eating and",
          "They are doing a good job looking after all the animals and keeping the area clean with good refreshments and safe parking area.",
          "I had heard mixed things about the Pretoria Zoo over the years. It has not been an institution free from controversy in the past and, as an environmentalist, I have always had mixed feelings about zoos. The benchmark for me when it comes to zoos has always been the Sydney Zoo",
          "We visited this place on recommendation from my brother. As far as zoo's go this place far exceeded our expectations. Was clean, lots to see and animals appear well looked after. This place is huge so be prepared to do lots of walking. Lots of variety of species too. Must see.",
          "This is probably one of the best Zoos In Johannesburg and Pretoria, there is a wide variety of animals with proper sign posts. I was totally amazed with the waterfalls and the River- extremely clean...very relaxing. Most of the enclosures resemble the natural home of the animal",
          "The Pretoria Zoo is so interesting and well worth a visit. There are many picnic spots and wonderful walking paths. Be aware of criminal activity around the parking area and on the route to the Zoo.",
          "Parking will help because that is a battle. Picnic spot is great. Like the under roof seating. Child friendly.",
          "Large variety of animals to view as well as a night tour available. Great food at the restaurants with plenty of picnic space. However be aware as there are plenty of bees on site. Golf carts are very affordable and you need on average an hour with one cart just to view the",
          "We had a wonderful day with the children at the zoo. Definitely rent a golf cart, it would be impossible to see everything without it. The animals looks well looked after, the enclosures are big and it feels like the staff tried to mimic their natural environment as closely as",
          "Always a great experience for the kids. The picnic area is a nice touch where we can just sit and enjoy ourselves. You can bring your own meat to braai and drinks and later on take a walk to see the animals.",
          "This zoo has a great variety of animals that kept our children interested for most of the day. A trip in the cable car is a must-do activity and provides an aerial view of the park.",
          "The zoo was very nice with a variety of animals. One thing that was not cool is the fact that it was cold and most of the animals were sleeping so I think in summer time would be ideal. Overall the zoo is well looked after and very big.",
          "For a change we planned a day out in Pretoria and included a visit to the National Zoo. The cable car ride over the zoo certainly adds a different element. The zoo as a whole has a bit of a bit worn out feel, but efforts are being made with some renovations occurring and a few",
          "Well kept Zoo with great variety Animals. Golf carts for hire to limit walking and see more of the zoo. This zoo is big. Cable car will take you up for a great view of the animals from the air. Do not miss the lions feeing times.",
          "Very nice outing with the kids. Enjoyable! Parking a bit of a challange being mostly on the opposite side of the road of the entrance. Zoo is well maintained and well managed. Animals look healthy. Very informative.",
          "The best zoo by far it has the BIG FIVE.The cable car with fantastic views and all the staff are very helpfull and the zoo is very clean.Iwill recommend this highly for a family outting if you are in Pretoria.",
          "Good morning Craig, I just want to say THANK YOU so much for yesterday, the look on our daughter\u2019s face was priceless when she saw the animals ! Her highlight was the cable car, elephants and the Zebra\u2019s. Ours was the White Tiger. It is truly amazing !! All your staff",
          "What a stunning unique venue for a conference. Incredible view from the top of the cablecar. Great place for families.",
          "The Pretoria zoo never disappoints. Very clean.you won't tell that there are animals staying there full time. Well taken care of. Peaceful and kids learn a lot of about different types of animals",
          "Even though I have a moral problem with wild animals being caged in, the zoo was very well managed and clean. Entrance was quick and without problems (apart from trying to keep 3 over excited boys in place). You have the option of walking around and/or driving in a golf cart.",
          "You could see the remnants of a once a great zoological garden. But it is screaming for some up keep. Not all displays correspond to the boards. Too many repetitions. Some of the animals are lonely and sadly show zoochosis tendencies. Many kiosks are closed. The opportunities",
          "Friends of the Zoo is a group of voluntary individuals who raise funds for the upkeep of the Zoo . Every 3rd saturday of the month there is a 5km walk in Zoo for the entire family and in June and September there is a squatters evening where you get opportunity to stay",
          "The worst. The Zoo isn't up to standard and the animals look so \"unhappy\" If there was a petition to shut down the zoo, I'd do it. I have also spoken to a few people about this and they feel the same.",
          "We went to the Zoo with my daughter during the school holidays. There is safe and secure parking right in front of the zoo for R25 Overall the Zoo looks ok but it could be a lot better. The animals look healthy and looked after wishing I was really relieved about. But so areas",
          "Bird courses are presented at the Pretoria Zoo by experts in that field. The theory as well as practical parts can being done on the same site. Very good idea to attend these courses if you decide to make birding a hobby.",
          "Overall the facility needs TLC. Some sections are well cared for but regrettably others are in desperate need for repairs. Animals are well cared for. Information on animals are limited. A large number of enclosures are empty. The experience is average.",
          "Not as good as it was, but still fantastic The cable car is a great way to get to the top of the kopie above the lion enclosure,then walk down the side and amble around all the various animal enclosures. The giant fig mentioned below is certainly a wondrous sight. I do not",
          "Years ago it was one of the great zoos in the world, but the last time I have visited the neglect of the grounds and the animals broke my heart and many empty cages.",
          "The Zoo with all it's different animals are good. Weekends is very busy. Surroundings are not safe. Be very careful when visiting the Zoo.",
          "The Zoo Giant is not a animal, but a tree. My main goal was to see the declared Champion tree at the zoo. This Moreton Bay fig tree is situated just inside the entrance gates. With a height of 27 meters, and a crown of just over 40 meters, it is the second largest of its kind in",
          "nice park with lots of animals, very well taken care of, has quality exhibits and good animal selection, too bad it is located in a terrible part of town, take a cab to get there as it is unsafe to walk there from the downtown area.",
          "Absolutely amazing - for the whole family. Make a big picnic basket. Be at the entrance gate at 08h00 sharp. Pick up a big golf cart. Load up & first do the top part of the Zoo with the golf cart. When top is done ( the bears/Koala bear/Lions/Tigers/some antelope/and more) -",
          "I grew in Pretoria, and starting from a young age my parents instilled the wisdom and experience of revival of holidays in our minds and bodies. One of the things that we would do once a year is to take a trip to the zoo. They would buy new clothes and shoes and take us to the",
          "It's not only the large variety of animals and birds that impress, but also the space available and the effort taken to provide a natural environment to the different species. Small battery-driver cars to move around enhances the chances to see and experience more of this",
          "The Zoo is a nice place just to walk around and see all the animals spend quality time with your family without any rush",
          "I'm not an animal fan but thought I should give it a try. I found the place very interesting and exciting, I had more fun than I thought. I enjoyed the cable cars more than anything.",
          "This zoo is significantly larger than its Joburg counterpart, with more animals to view, including a large aquarium and Australian section. I would recommend getting there early morning to ensure you have sufficient time to view all of the animals the zoo has to offer.",
          "It was a good day but I expact to see some more animals. Not all the animals where there but the nature is beautifull!",
          "We enjoyed walking around out in nature and looking at the animals. A great place to get out to, fresh air, exercise and see a variety of animals and bird life.",
          "I remember many visits to the zoo when I was younger but after visiting after a long time I was much disappointed.along of enclosures were empty and there wasn't much to see.the restaurant was expensive and the food not that great.staff are always helpful though",
          "Pretoria zoo is a wonderful experience for those who cannot get to the KNP. Children just love the place",
          "It was a lovely morning and a wonderful opportunity. Although I am not a great fan of animals in cages I could appreciate fact that they do have a purpose. I remeber visiting many years ago when I was a student and I distinctly remember the neat and tidy surroundings. To be",
          "We loved seeing all the animals but the gorilla was nowhere to be seen and some other animals as well. At least I got to see the rhino's before they go extinct.",
          "Lot of street vendors and people asking for money on entrance to parking. Once you in the zoo it lovely. But Lot of litter , dirty toilets , lack of Maintenance is visible. Food stalls are poorly stocked. Not as good as it used to be. Would not rush back.",
          "The National Zoological Gardens in the city of Pretoria is an ideal destination and reprieve from the hustle and bustle of city life. Situated within five minutes walking distance from the city center, the facility offers brief reprieve from city life within a city. It offers",
          "If you are looking for a fun day out with the kids, you can go to the zoo. We hired a golf cart since two pensioners went along and it was very nice to be able to take them along. We also went on the cable way up to the viewpoint. The kids loved to see all the animals and it was",
          "The Pretoria Zoo is a very neat and well kept zoo. They have done their best to accommodate the animals in very spacious well adapted enclosures. There are very informative notices at all the cages educates the visitors. Fun day surrounded by healthy animals and very neat",
          "Lovely way of supporting the Zoological Gardens. A lot of effort from the Gardens to keep going.... Lovely and well organised fun runs for people who love outdoors and entertaining the children and to teach children to care for animals",
          "my family enjoyed seeing the animals at the zoo and a great time to learn and bond as a family, I would recommend to all animal lovers",
          "Good option to spend the day with friends, your bae or family! Big and with a very nice structure! Must do thing",
          "This Zoo offers a variety of animals. More options than any other Zoo I have ever seen. It is situated on a huge premises and golf cars are available to hire at affordable rates. Food available on site.",
          "My son is in a wheelchair that could not fit into the cable car. Once again a place that don't really care about people with disabilities.",
          "During this visit at the zoo, many area's were marked with a board that the animals were showed off. It was a bit sad but the rest was nice for the children.",
          "Awesomely big zoo with great animals of every kind you can think of, get a golf cart if you have little ones as its a huge place and they will certainly get tired of walking.",
          "Decided to take the family on New Years Eve. From the moment we jumped on the Gautrain to the entry into the zoo the experience was faultless. The zoo was spotless and not so many crowds given the time of year and the animals were on their best behavior. My 7 year old loved the",
          "This is supposed to be one of my national symbols that I want to be proud off. It is totally sad that my own government can spend millions and millions to upgrade the residence of one man we call our president and this same government can allow a national symbol such as this to",
          "I have visited this zoo twice and I will definitely visit it again. The animals are kept neat and healthy, the venue does not smell and there are endless animals to view. The set up and facilities provided is excellent. My only concern was there's no ATM, you can pay by card",
          "Really a must visit for families in the Pretoria area. It's clean and well maintained with healthy looking animals. Go early to avoid long queues for golf carts-this is a must if you have limited time as the trip will take over 4 hours if you have to walk (up some steep hills!)",
          "You have to come early to be able to visit and experience the different sections , the snakes , the aquarium , the monster , the picnic spot , the birds , the gorilla s , beer , lions , tigers , okapi ( only 15 on the planet ), rhino , gahraph , elephants penguins, flamingos",
          "A good venue to keep children occupied during school holidays. there is no boring moment. Plenty annamals to see and open spaces for them to run an around, and to enjoy them self.",
          "The zoo is the zoo. You can't take anything away from the experience, especially not for young children. The \"restaurant\" is a total let down - avoid at all cost. No choice really and that which is on the menu is really not worth the money, the wait or the environment.",
          "It\u00b4s a good ride for children. Fun and educational. The golf cart is useful to know the whole place in one day.",
          "For wild animal lovers and those who can appreciate wild life (even though 'encassed'), this is a visit that you will certainly enjoy and never forget!",
          "An excellent day trip to entertain young and old - for the very young or very old, I suggest you hire a golf car. The grounds of the zoo are extensive! The zoo is kept in a very good condition and the exhibits interesting and educational. The staff we encountered were friendly",
          "Enjoyable outing. Its a large zoo with plenty to see and a lot of walking, so its even more fun if you hire a golf cart and visit the far end of the zoo. we like the glass animal enclosures that allow good viewing. Be sure to visit the reptile section and aquarium, especially",
          "Enjoyed it Very much - suggest you hire a golf car! A lot of walking to do. Enjoyed the elephants! Make sure you try to go on the cable car - will see hippos and much more from above!",
          "Spend the day at the Pretoria Zoo. What a day of fun. The Zoo is well looked after with a big arrangement of animals big and small. From birds to fish and snakes. Great place for big and small. If you don't wanna do the walk you can rent a golf cart. Food and drinks are",
          "We went camping at the zoo. What a great experience, seeing all the animals at night time, with a night hike!",
          "The Zoo is reasonably well maintained. The animals look good. It is easy to get around on foot or by golf cart. The toilet facilities are acceptable. The area that needs to be addressed is the river that runs through the Zoo. It is absolutely filthy. Full of litter. Very",
          "This is one of the top zoos in the world. The directors had a major role in rhino preservation. There is an amazing array of birds including a flock of pink flamingo that is extraordinary. A cable car takes you to see the lions and ungulates. This zoo offers a home for",
          "Impressive size and setting with a good range of animals and even a small but beautiful aquarium. Kids under 10 loved it!",
          "Do'nt expect too much. Being in Africa one would imagine this to be a world class zoo. Far from it. It is really exspencive and although it is nice to see the animals the enclosures are dissapointing and gardens unkept. Visit it for seeing the animals only.",
          "We went early for a cool walk around the zoo. My grandson was awed by the animals. Their pens were clean and well kept. We all loved it.",
          "Good place to go and take photo's. They also have a night tour and you can also book to stay the night in tents in the Zoo. You will see all the night life that you usually miss. Great place to visit with the whole family.",
          "I remember this zoo being the best in SA as a small child so naturally i took took my 5 year old son. To be honest i wasn't too impressed as i think more cold be done to enhance ones experience. Overall it is a nice day out but is lacking that extra punch! Some advice....hire",
          "Wonderful place to visit. Well look after animals. Beautiful gardens, will need one day to see all of it.Golf carts to drive if you dont want to walk. Nice picnic spots.",
          "My first visit to Pretoria Zoo was nothing short of disgusting. Came to Pretoria to take my young kids to the zoo and I will never be back. Animals look sad. Place is dirty. Can't believe that alcohol can be served in a place like that. Run down and I can only think it's mis",
          "I must say I was horribly dissapointed with the Pretoria Zoo! I last went there a couple of years back and loved it!! The potential is there but it looks dirty unkept and really felt sorry for the animals!!! People lounging around drinking !! Rubbish lying every where was a",
          "The zoo is the best in the country with great variety of well looked after animals. It includes an interesting Aquarium and extensive reptile exhibitions. The Kuala in the Australian section is rare opportunity not to be missed. Be ready to walk quite a bit and enjoy the",
          "Always nice to visit the Zoo. Looking a bit tired and needs some work. Aquarium is not a good as it used to be. Restaurant Area also needs some work. Food and Drinks need to improve.",
          "This is a must see for all. The animals are not kept in cages as one would expect, but is beautiful large enclosures and allows the animal and in some cases, groups of animals, to move around freely. You can get really close to the animal without it being threatened by the",
          "A wonderful place to spend a day with the family. A institution in Pretoria spanding from President Paul Kruger to present. Staying up with the times the recent renovations and upgrades has brought it into the 21ste century. There are over 15km of walkway, hire a golfcart for",
          "Like any zoo it is interesting for the kids to learn, but for me it is always a challenge not to feel bad for the poor animals that are contained in such a small space. Especially the larger chaps like the elephants, hippos, etc.",
          "I wouldn't even know where to start! I can write a book of all the things that were disappointing! I'll try keep it short: The animals were sad and lonely. 3 years ago there were at least a partner for every animal. Now most animals are alone in their enclosures and looks",
          "Great day trip for the kids. Good for seeing African wildlife up close. The zoo is very big compared to what we used to so make sure you wear comfy shoes and take lots of water to drink as the kiosks are expensive. They sell food there but mostly just crisps and fried stuff",
          "So it was quite fun to go up the cable car to the top and walk down through....But it was a hot day and non of the kiosks along the way were open... Lots of litter everywhere I don't think I really like zoos so that was half the problem...didn't find any of the animal",
          "1. Pack your own food, almost no good food there 2. Remember sunblock Was not bad, golf car is the way to go! But the Zoo is not clean and no place to eat and almost no nice picnic table that is clean/in a good condition.",
          "There is a nice range of animals, large safe open urban space, golf carts if you don't want to climb the mountain. The cable car gives you a great view of the zoo and the city",
          "I was disappointed and very sad to have seen the elephants who were extremely dirty in extreme weather conditions and without any fresh water at their disposal ! Was also ad to see a bear that was partly submerged in water in extreme weather conditions and looked very sickly",
          "Each month the Pretoria zoo has a fun walk. This is much fun to do with the family and at the end you receive a medallion for your contribution to the fun walk",
          "Awesome time spent with the family checking out all the animals. Friendly staff. highly recommend that you get yourself a golf kart as the zoo is pretty huge otherwise you wont be able to cover the whole zoo. Dont forget the sunblock as there isn't much shade when walking",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the day at the zoo. Some of the animals I saw for the first time include white lions, stripped hyena, black rhino, many deer species, white and orange flamingos. Finished the visit with a cable car ride giving a different perspective of the zoo.",
          "I will never get tired of going here. Field trips as a kid, and relaxing visits as an adult, this place has gone from strength to strength. Unfortunately the surrounding inner city area needs some TLC but I would still highly recommend it",
          "Always love visiting the zoo. It is always clean and the animals are in good condition. Take a picnic with or braai on the grass. Take it slow, the place is big and has a lot of uphill. We love to take the cable car up and then walk back down. The only negative for me is the",
          "The website states it is one of the Top 10 Zoo's in the world, which is a lie, firstly there is 2 \"restaurants\" throughout the zoo and one food-stall which all located near the entrance, the animals are in such small confined spaces and look as though they are under feed, the",
          "Great for the family. Some animals are featured a bit too much, but still love spending the day there",
          "The day was exciting we got there in the morning with the family and we got to learn so much about the animals",
          "As far as Zoo's go, you always wonder on the animals happiness, i can say the animals look happy and look well fed. The place is huge and has some nice attractions like the sky ride to the top by the Lions and an Australia exhibit to name a few.",
          "As far as Zoo's go this was quite a good experience. Rentable Gholf carts makes getting around much easier and most sites are accessible on these. Very wheel chair friendly as well. Good day out for a leisurely picnicking experience or day out with the kids.",
          "Although the ample availability of golf carts, we walked the zoo paths and found the sights more enjoyable. Walked up to cable car and took it down. View was wonderful. Reptile park and aquarium were worthwhile visits. Don't bother with picture at entrance though. It's too",

          "We got there at about 10.00. We met other family there and picnicked soon after arrival. Glad we did as it was packed by lunchtime. Great day out. Would definitely recommend hiring a golf cart for the full 3 hours as it is a big zoo with lots to see and enjoy.",
          "This is a good zoo, very staff and healthy looking animals. All animals are walking around and not just lazy in the corner. I would recommend to get there 30-40 min before the gates open and hire a gold cart to use for the day, this takes the heat off of you compared to walking",
          "Great activity for kids and adults. A must see for tourists. They can definitely work on their food options.",

          "It was fantastic to see the all the animals at the zoo especially the lions. There are golf carts for hire which is useful as the zoo is on the side of a ridge - you book these on a first come, first serve basis. The zoo does have restaurants but none of them offered a full",
          "The zoo has a large variety of animals. From wild to tame, to sea life as well as reptiles. Enclosures are such that u get to c the animals easily. The zoo is very big, u need a full day there and lots of energy for waking. Best not to go on a very hot day. It was the ideal",

          "A big zoo in the dowtown of Pretoria. Several artcraft vendors around, near the entrance. A parking available. You can rent some little electric cars. Many animals from Africa but also Asia. I was sorry seeing the Tiger with behavior troubles, walking all the time from left to",
          "It is an excellent outing, you can do group bookings for childrens parties. it is lovely to take a golf cart and drive around the Zoo. There are animal night viewings and they have a very big lelection of animals. You can have a picnic in one of the picnic spots or have lovely",

          "I'm not the biggest fan of zoos, but because this zoo also doubles as a research institute, the animals seem to be treated very well. A big draw card for locals (that makes it worth the travel from JHB) is the range of animals - there are lots of unusual Australian animals",

          "Very interesting. Possibly the best zoo in africa. They do a lot for keeping an eye on species on the brink of extinsion. Very important to use the zoo parking area as there are all sorts of criminal elements hanging around outside the zoo. That is why one should park inside",
          "Every visit is a great family fun day for old and young. The Pretoria Zoo offers the visitor a wide range of mammals, birds and reptiles to view in a large expanse of park close to the city centre. For those who want a leisurely walk around the numerous enclosures there is",

          "This is a really nice place to come to as a family. Getting there is a bit scary but once inside there are safe parking and facilities. I would suggest getting there early and then renting a gholf cart it make the whole experience more fun for everyone! There are lots of animals",
          "We were pleasantly surprised at how well the facility was maintained, the zoo was clean and there were many dustbins and toilet facilities. In some areas however the toilets were very clean and in other areas (specifically at the Aquarium) they were very dirty, but at least",

          "I really enjoyed my visit to the Zoo. Although situated in a very old part of Pretoria once you are in the Zoo this doesn't matter. All the animals are well looked after and the enclosures are all nice and big. I can recommend this Zoo as a fun day outing for the whole family.",

          "We had never been to a zoo before so it was a great experience and my advice is do not arrive so late like we did because we arrived at 2pm. You'll not be able to do much especially in winter where it gets dark early. The upside was that it was located in the heart of the town",
          "Recently I revisted the zoo with my boyfriend after many many years and was surprised to see that it is still as exciting and amazing as it was when I was a child. We managed to walk around the entire zoo and see everything but next time we will definitely take the cart!",
          "Me and my wife have visited many zoos around the world but we still think that the one in Pretoria is probably the best one. Great variety of animals and large \"natural\" cages which hopefully make it cozier for the animals. You will need to spend a full day here to really enjoy",
          "I visited the zoo a few days ago and I was extremely pleased by the friendliness of the staff, the cleanliness of the grounds and the general maintenance being carried out. However, there were several sights that were shocking to say the least. Firstly, let me start by saying",
          "Went with the family to the zoo,my five year old love and the rest of family enjoyed the walking and seeing most of the animals The cable car was fun,not enough golf carts not enough toilets . In general it is a great days outing ,week ends are busy parking can be a problem so",

          "What a fantastic way to start 2014, the zoo. Ample secure parking for visitors at a minimal fee. The entrace fee was well worth the outing. From google earth the zoo does not look that big but don't be fooled, so wear your most comfortable shoes. Be prepared to walk alot. I",
          "The long drive from Johannesburg South was well worth it, particularly to see such a huge variety of animals, from different parts of the planet including Kangaroos, Komodo dragons and Sharks, not leaving out the beautiful tiger, South Africa's \"Big 5\" and lots of other flora",
          "This is one of the few place in South Africa where you will find so many animals from Africa and around the world on display in one place. With such a huge variety of animals to see and information-boards to observe, you won't have to worry about losing interest. Although",
          "We visited the zoo for a daytrip and had a great time. It is a truly awesome place for families with little kids to experience nature in the middle of a large city. We took our own picnic with us and enjoyed sitting at one of the picnic tables, watching some animals while",

          "The friends of the zoo have a 5km fun walk in the zoo on the third Saturday of each month at 6.30am. It is a different way to see the zoo as it is closed to the general public and it is also considerably cheaper than the normal entry fee.",
          "Definitely one for the family to do together- young and old. Take along your own food and there is a picnic area. If you early enough... Before 9am you can hire a golf cart... Otherwise you\"ll have to do it by foot. Amazing animals and good view of all of them. The parking is",
          "I feel visiting the zoo will be a bad experience. The general upkeep and look of this zoo is bad. Parking and security outside the zoo is also a problem. Most of the staff are unfriendly and seems to have a negative posture/appearance. Please don't expect to see all the animals",
          "The parking was not great but it was close and the car was safe. The cashier we helpful but not overly enthusiastic (no maps given, I had to get one from guest relations). The photographer made up for all that and was jolly and full of jokes. The map was great but the signage",

          "The ZOO is situated in not so fine area of Pretoria. Parking is really close but I think that during the Summer there just can\u00b4t be enough parking spots for all visitors. The entrance fee was OK and the staff was very pleasant. There are some really worth seeing animal species",

          "We missed the entry to the zoo parking as it was not clearly marked once on Boom Str, as did many cars behind us. The location of the zoo isn't in the greatest of areas either. It also blends in with the surrounding area and does not stand out. We chose to use a golf cart to",

          "Great fun for the whole family. Many animals, reptiles and marine life to explore. All very well cared for. Zoo is clean and pretty well maintained. Cable car was not working though. Staff were super friendly. Well worth a visit!",
          "Great place for the whole family to enjoy. Phone get your prices and go prepared. Don't forget to rent their cart to drive around as there is much to see and enjoy. The animals need your support and funding for them to be well taken care of. It's worth the time to go there",
          "This was great day, kids enjoyed themselves. Will definitely make a turn again.",
          "It's a beautiful place to be with family friends and it accomdates all age groups",

          "Easy access to the animals... almost don't need a guide",

          "A gem in the city, in a surreal environment where one can view animals too.\n\nAgain one can't believe these types of breakaways is right on our doorstep. I think we are conditioned to complain and can't see the woods from the trees.\n\nWill \u2026",
          "Staff at the go cart need trading to deal with customers. Notice boards are needed to tell clients that cash is needed to rent go carts. \nStaff from the enterence was very friendly and helpful.",

          "Majority of the things dont work like the aquarium, and most of the animals weren't even out like the main attraction I.e. lions and tigers. I give the zoo  about 3 years max.",

          "Really enjoyed, lots of animals",
          "Love the animals. Nice family outing",
          "Probably the best Zoo in South Africa.  Animals look good and have large spaces. Staff is almost always visible and very helpful when queried. Cable cars are a must if you are not afraid of heights. Reasonable pricing for entrance, extra \u2026",
          "The zoo is very big, take your time when visiting. There a small refreshments stops inside. They have an aquarium, snakes, wild animals and many more. It's best to go early before the animals have their lunch or else you'll find them sleeping.",
          "Nice to see the animals.  They have a wide variety",
          "It was really nice I had alot of fun",
          "The Zoo... Where you let your hair down... Calm down and lift up to nature. Be with animals in there own habitats. The ultimate are the aquarium with beautiful collection of fish and amfibie\u00eb..",
          "Vwry nice to see SA animals. It made me to realised that me need to look after our nature and enjoy the history of of our animals. It was mot nice to see all of tbem in cages but i am sure it was for the BETTER. Live it will go back again.",
          "The PTA zoo boasts a wide variety of animals and even includes an aquarium, reptile section, snakes, spiders, seals and penguins. There is alot of walking to be done! Comfortable shoes, hat, glasses and clothes to be worn. I regretted \u2026",
          "Nice place to hangout\nSelf driven Golf cart is good experience \ud83d\ude04",
          "It was a fantastic adventure. Loads of animals to see, and the animals seem to be well looked after. Only thing that was not nice was the fact that the koala bears were only open to be seen from 10 am - 3 pm, and we only found this out when we arrived at that part of the zoo.",
          "Some unique animals like flamingos, vultures , hyenas, cheetahs, gorillas and elephants kept in this zoo which I haven't seen in kzn zoo's. There is an option to hire a golf cart to go around which is good considering the size of the zoo. \u2026",

          "Went through to take part in the FOTZ (Friends of the Zoo) 5km Fun Night Walk with my children. We thoroughly enjoyed it and there is a decent turn out of people. Gates open at 18h00 to pay and go in (cash is preferred), dress is relaxed and if you want to see any animals, bring a torch. Really worth it for an experience.",
          "I love this zoo. I\u2019ve been coming here since I was a child. The food courts can by upgraded and have more variety.",
          "I've been here before and noticed that some of the animals were not present. It's still a good place to go. There's so many animals to see. I just hope that the animals are cared for. For example, when we were there, the penguins were all under the fan so something should be done to cool them off.",
          "It was good. A lot of empty exhibits though.",
          "Its a beautiful and peaceful place... To see all the animals gives you a experience of a life time, its something you dont see every day... Its a place for family and friends to connect and have a time of their life...",

          "This place is a great place. It needs to be taken a very good care of. Apies river should be kept clean at all times by both visitors and the workers . South Africa we need to love and take care of places like this be passionate about them. \u2026",

          "Absolutely love the aquarium! And the golfcart hire for convenience \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Run down and there are so many displays not even there anymore. It is dirty and little to no park maintenance is being done.",
          "Nothing left of what it once was! Sadly not worth the effort as only a few species of animals left!",
          "Great day especially the gokd cart hire... just needs more food places that sell good food. Ran out of rolls for hitdogs and burgers...",
          "Whole day for whole family - great to take young and old. Golf carts to drive for the elder and people who don't want to walk. Must be fit to walk all the way around the zoo - most cages were under construction on last visit - cable car was \u2026",
          "Still a good family trip, a lot of the cages did not have animals in but there were notices of industrial action posted all over. Still the animals seemed well fed.",
          "A waste of time and money. Its rundown and it seems like no one cares.",
          "Love this place huge.",
          "I enjoy my visits always, though some animals are no longer there",
          "Beautiful place to see. They have many different types of animals to be viewed and they provide you with a map of the zoo so you know where to go. Great experience. Beautiful places to have a nice picnic. I will suggest that the clown fish \u2026",
          "best relaxation place to see wild life,have a good the with FAM and friends",
          "The zoo has a great collection of animals but is in poor condition, they need as many volunteers as possible.",

          "Very nice place to take the whole family, but there are a lot of cages that doesn't have animals in it or even the right animals in them. You can but food and drinks in the Zoo.",
          "Its so much fun. We hired a golf cart, I recommend it. They have entertainment for kids and kiosks every here and there in case you get thirsty. Ample parking. Wonderful day out",
          "So cool. Learning so much about animals n bird's. Snake n \ud83c\udf8f.",
          "Great to spend with loved ones",
          "No maintenance. Poor service. Very dangerous to get to the Zoo and you will be lucky if you can get back to your car alive.",
          "It was OK. Has however deteriorated in the last few months. A year ago it was very clean. This time round the Apies river was filled with junk. We watched as a guy \"cleaned\" by pushing garbage into the river with a rake, in stead of taking it out.",
          "The maintenance is lurking the place does not look as good as it used to, the cable cart has been out of service for days including christmas day very dissapointing experience :(",
          "This is a beautiful place to take your kids. Still the best zoo in the country",
          "The Zoo is located in the not-so nice part of the town. It's not  very easy to get to if you are not at all familiar with this part of town. Any wrong turn can have unintended consequences...\n\nThe zoo itself is usually crowded and noisy - \u2026",
          "Had a nice with kids",
          "Just travelling to and from the zoo is stressful with all the taxis. Cable car out of order. Some enclosures empty. Due to maintenance? If so its the wrong time it being the Christmas holidays.",

          "A very beautiful place with a nice view for beautiful pictures.",
          "My visit to the Zoo was an  unimaginable experience a reflection of what our predecessors lived before us.",
          "Its a very interesting place to visit, enjoyed walking around watching the animals",
          "The Zoo is still the best to visit, although it's not in the same position it was in years ago... It is very neglected. The animal habitats are not all what they are supposed to be. Although seeing the animals was a fun experience... It was a sad one too.",
          "alot of animals are not ther the maintaining of zoo is poor.i would be my last time i ever went to Pretoria zoo.its not the entrance money worth.",
          "the Zoo is amazing and the have rides mostly for kids but there is one adult which is the cable cars and that is what I go for, they should add like a mini gold reef lol\n\nbut good one keep it up Pretoria",
          "Its the zoo its bound to make you smile,the place could do with a bit of fresh paint but otherwise its the zoo...give it a visit to just have some frivolous fun",
          "All types of animals can be found here.",

          "Nice zoo. The animals are still alive so support the zoo",
          "My kids loved it so do i",
          "The animals are in fairly good shape and the facility roads and walkways clean. The toilets however are disease-level dirty and are not fit for public use! Good outings for the kids, walkways are available throughout the zoo sittings unlike the jhb zoo.",
          "Great experience for young and old! Expect to spend at least three hours exploring the different attractions. Take a picnic and you can easily spend a full day at this excellent Zoo. Try to catch the feeding times if possible.",
          "Love it, especially when I want to clear my head.",
          "Animals look good. Some enclosures might be a bit small. But overall good experience. We did the Night Walk hosted every 3rd Saturday of the month, and boy was it fun! You won't be disappointed.",
          "Perfect for family outings \nGreat outdoor fun\nPerfect for dates or picnic. \nThe staff is really friendly and there's a lot to do. Amazing environment for animals. Accessible transport (gautrain bus and taxi's)\nLots of parking. \nCable cars \u2026",
          "Dirty, noisy, drunk rowdy people with no supervisory staff in view. Did not feel safe from thugs. General deterioration.",
          "Theres the occasional empty holding, but this is purely for the wellbeing of the animals and maintenance of the enclosures, its one of the biggest zoos in the world. Golf carts are in hig demand and on an average day you can expect a 1 hour waiting period if they're available. Otherwise a lovely experience",
          "Definitely the best zoo in Gauteng!\nThe animals are well looked after and still as beautiful as always. \nThey have picnic facilities (which is amazing if you're planning on spending the entire day there), food stalls for a quick bite and a restaurant if you feel like enjoying a sit-down meal.",
          "Lots of animals, all in good condition!",
          "There's not enough golf carts for such a big zoo,and we didn't find our family photos",
          "Great experience for the family take a golf cart",
          "GREAT PLACE TO BE. LOVELY ENVIRONMENT TO SPEND TIME WITH KIDS OR Family. 110 for adults and 75 for children. Golf cart is also available at 100/HR. A deposit of 200r us required for the cart and driver's license essential to get one.",
          "Beautiful place to tour with the kids and see different kinds of animals",
          "Was impressed with the look and feel after all these years. Some of the enclosures need some maintenance, and maintenance currently underway in some of the aquarium's tank. A must for all with children. Generally well maintained and clean",
          "Awesome place to visit for the family. Great scenery, plenty of activities. . This place is massive and walking through the entire premises may not be possible for the elderly or young kids. Go early though to secure electric cart vehicles.",

          "#Pretoria zoo. I've been to the zoo maybe about ten or more times in my life. Still the best and biggest zoo in Africa. Always nice to visit. But there's always renovations going on for years...certain animals missing and empty cages...Wish \u2026",
          "Awesome place to spend the day and I'd your into it, chasing down Pokemon",
          "This is a really beautiful place. I am really taken up with the Aquarium and Reptile Park BUT am quite sad to see how dry it is. The animals weren't given much water and a lot of the water bowls were full of algae. I do, however, think that the outing was worth every penny.",
          "This was my first time here and was very impressed. A few enclosures was empty but was a good experience.",
          "Great place to visit, lots of maintenance on the go, recommended!",

          "Animals seem happy, but the buildings don't.",
          "Was a wonderful experience. The bathrooms were not in good condition (dirty and no soap), signs look worn out and there was quite a lot of rubbish lying around. Otherwise, staff were mostly friendly, most animals looked in very good condition and a lot of relevant info about the animals.",
          "We had a great time with the family. Some animal pens were without animals and there was no notification.",
          "Wonderful experience and kids loved it",
          "I saw a lion for the very first time in my lifetime. What a moment!",
          "Amazing place for a 4-5 hours visit. The idea of not a taking a cart is worst, the place is literally very big to walk and visit each place. Otherwise the place is worth the money. Charges R 110 and Parking R25.",
          "Enjoyed my visit! Loved watching the animals more especially the tiger, lion, elephant & the giraffes were super cool...",
          "Great place to bring children. Only thing which drove me crazy was the bees. I suppose it's their home. Bring your own snacks and water. But you can buy them here too if you like. Wear comfy shoes. Lots of walking to be done.",
          "I love going to the zoo. You're never too old :)",
          "The National Zoological gardens is awesome, day well spent with the family. It was unfortunate that not every shop/facility had speed point machines, they required cash.  This forced us to leave the zoo and go to the nearest ATM to withdraw as there are no ATM machines inside. They could definitely improve by adding an ATM machine.",
          "Although i love nature and the time spend walking looking at all the animals. The zoo is not anymore what it used to be. As a National Zoo it need urgent maintenance and care. No kiosk was open not even for cooldrink or chips, the zoo lost \u2026",

          "So much better than the Zoo in Johannesburg. There is such a wide variety of animals to see, land and sea, reptiles and mammals. We had visited the Johannesburg Zoo a few days prior but this was so much better and the layout of the Zoo made it easier to see everything plus the option to hire a golf cart is an added bonus",

          "The Zoo is beautiful but unfortunately we want to see Ghorilla, Zebra, Jakkals and Jaquar",
          "The place is expensive on everything. From entrance to drinks and toddler mini taxi. Only few animals to see. Rhino's don't have horns. \ud83d\ude22",
          "It's always refreshing to be amongst the nature. When it is mixed with wild life it becomes very interesting. The place is refreshing. I liked watching animals from the cable car. It was a beautiful journey upthere. It is also in the city.",
          "I had great time with family... We saw everything there is to see",
          "Terrible and dirty and very noisy. Felt unsafe. Children littering everywhere. I even took photos. River full of junk. Plastic bottles in animal encloses. Chasing the birds etc on the grounds. Feel sorry for the animals. Children screaming \u2026",
          "Relaxing location with nice view , garden, the big 5 animals, braai places, food shops",

          "Great place to bring family and friends to relax and have a great time",
          "The zoo itself is great one to visit - better than the Jhb zoo. However, at the time of the visit, there was a strike, so food and beverages,as well as general services at the zoo was limited.",
          "I visited this place in winter and there wasn't much activity. Personally, it is not the same as in was 5 years ago. It is a bit smelly because of the animals. I would advice ranting the go cart because everything so far. Pack some snacks. They don't have a great selection on site.",

          "I enjoy my woman's day with my children it was a great experience after 10 years",
          "The is the ideal place to go with family. The environment is user friendly and beautiful which is fit for family picnics and other fun activities. My favourite place in the entire garden would be the aquarium and I advice families and friends to visit it everytime they visit the garden. #You will not regret it.",
          "The zoo isn't how I remembered it, when I was 5 there were so many animals I saw bears,koalas,and the zoo was lush nowadays its dry and depressing and the animals look sad what has happened to my zoo I use to love this place",
          "It's a lovely zoo, beautiful enclosures, lovely shade to walk under, but disappointed that some of the toilets were locked, no toilet paper and the restaurant was closed. That made it difficult going with a child",

          "We enjoyed the day. Was surprised. Everyone so friendly. Park is so clean",

          "Great experience for the whole family. The kids totally loved it. The staff is very friendly and the parking allocating across the road is a big improvement from the last time I was there. Totally worth it.",
          "Best zoo in Gauteng",
          "Pathetic, waste of time. Hardly any animals, almost every enclosure is empty or u can never see the animals. Dnt get refunds on golf carts.",

          "It's been the same for over seven years , there's nothing new , some animals are not even there.",
          "Spacious and generally well-designed. Unfortunately every time we visit, the cable car is out of action and the food facilities are poor. Nice picnic spot!",
          "The zoo was a great family experience. It initially appears small and easy to get through in little time, but on further investigation I discovered that it is a really, really large zoo.  A whole day is definitely needed to get through \u2026",

          "It's an amazing place to visit",
          "Its one of the best places to visit with friends and family. My shortcomings however are \n1) the busy street you have to cross if you use the extra parking\n2) there are few karts to cater for the large numbers of people that visit\n3) the \u2026",
          "Poor animals!! The animals are visably not happy, probably the small cages and some being alone in a cage. The water at the hippo inclosure is DIRTY and doesn't even look like water but thick sludge. The wooden walkway is not secure and I \u2026",
          "Not well maintained. Few enclosures are not in use. Still can do better as a zoo. But good place for family outing, with few feeding shows, cable car, etc",
          "I would suggest water drums placed next to bins so that cans van be rinsed before being placed in bins. Bees are a huge problem. \nSome more seating also needed close to food-court, and more taps for drinking.\nBesides that, quite enjoyable \ud83d\udc4d",

          "It was very disappointing there was almost no more animals and the poor animals was without water in the overwhelming heat not the money worth anymore \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21",

          "The overall experience was very good. The only downside was the litter. Rubbish bins were overflowing and the river was filled with plastic bags, bottles, cans and much more. We could see that measures were in place to keep the place clean, \u2026",

          "Lots of exhibits are closed and some have been under construction for years. Staff are very frienfly, though eating places and the odd chips and a tiny coke come at hefty prices and leave lots to be desired but monies go to a good cause and they seem to need all they can get.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Groenkloof Nature Reserve, located adjacent to the Fountains Valley at the southern entrance to Pretoria, was the first game sanctuary in Africa. The reserve of 600 ha is managed by the Department of Nature Conservation. The National Heritage Monument is located within the reserve. It is flanked by Christina de Wit Avenue and Nelson Mandela Drive, that separate it from the Voortrekker Monument and Klapperkop Nature Reserves. In aggregate these reserves conserve some 1,400 ha of bankenveld vegetation which is threatened in Gauteng.  The reserve is open to day visitors from 5:30 to 19:00 in summer, and 7:00 to 18:00 in winter.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis valley on the southern outskirts of Pretoria was proclaimed a game sanctuary by President Paul Kruger on 25 February 1895. Its main purpose was to protect the shy and timid oribi, which occurred there, and other game that were being depleted by hunters. For many years however, the reserve was leased for exotic timber plantation, to supply wood and paper. A memorial wall is to be seen beside traces of the homestead of the early pioneer Lucas Bronkhorst, who settled here around 1839.\nIn April 2015 the head of the reserve, David Boshoff, was suspended and evicted from his council home by the Tshwane metro HR manager. The eviction came in the fifth month of a strike by the majority of the reserve's workers, who reportedly negated their agreement with management to return to work in February.\n\n\n== Wildlife ==\nWhen the reserve was reproclaimed in 1994, the plantations were removed to allow the natural vegetation to regenerate. Open grassland occurs along the Apies valley and the higher plateau. Native trees occur at varying densities on the hillsides and in the lower valley. These include white stinkwood, hook-thorn, mountain karee, velvet bushwillow, wild pear and puzzle bush.Since 1999 the reserve was stocked with various game species. These include zebra, blesbok, impala, kudu, blue wildebeest, red hartebeest (since 2002), giraffe (2002), sable (2003) and ostrich. Jackal, duiker and rock hyrax are also resident.\nOver 120 bird species have been recorded in the reserve and the adjacent Fountains Valley. Game birds include guineafowl, Swainson's spurfowl and crested francolin. The grassy floodplain of the Apies river and its riparian vegetation provide breeding habitat for a number of weaver, bishop and widow species, while the open woodlands on the lower hill slopes provide breeding territories for bushshrike and tchagra species.\nSpecial invertebrates of the reserve include Gunning's rock scorpion, golden-starburst baboon spider, the violin spider L. speluncarum which is endemic to caves of the Pretoria area, and the purse-web spider, Calommata transvaalica, which is severely threatened by urbanization in Gauteng.\n\n\n== Facilities and activities ==\nEntrance fees differ depending on the intended activity, and the number of persons partaking. The reserve is popular with cyclists, and mountain bikers can follow a 20 km route. The three hiking trails are designated as the red (1.3/3.5 km), white (3.7 km) and yellow (10.5 km) trails. Hikers can reserve an overnight hut. Off-road enthusiasts can explore 14 km of 4x4 tracks, while game viewing is possible from a 5 km motor car route. Guided horse rides and pony rides for kids are also offered. There are two picnic areas, named Meriting and Mashupeng, and a lapa may be rented for evening get-togethers.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nNational Heritage Monument\n\n\n== References ==\n\n Media related to Groenkloof Nature Reserve at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Well marked trails, pretty easy but some sections were narrow and rocky. Make sure you take water with you. Nice day hiking, nice accommodations and trails were well maintained.",
          "We've done both options of the 5km hiking routes, as well as the 4x4 route. And it is a 10/10 for all of them! It is beautiful scenery, and there are a lot of animals to be seen. Great outing for families.",
          "My wife loves to hike in nature so when we visited Pretoria we asked a friend about a place to go hiking and he brought us to Groenkloof. We enjoyed our hike up the hill on the yellow trail and then down along the red trail. We were running short on time so we had to cut back",
          "I and my two children aged 10 and 8 did a 10,5km hike and then recovered with a post hike 1 hour horseback tour of the reserve. It was a wonderful experience and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We will be back for sure.",
          "You don't have to travel far to see some wild animals in their natural habitat. You can come here for the day and relax, or just explore for the day. It is only a few minutes from Pretoria CBD.",
          "This is a great place to spend time together as family, hiking, walking, horse back riding, play grounds, having a picnic, lovely trees, nature, animals to see, the animals are well taken care off. At one point you can see the voortrekker monument. The nature reserve looks very",
          "My kids and I love climbing the koppie. It's just the right size for younger kids and sitting at the top for a rest and to take in the view of Pretoria. It's a moment to escape the hustle and bustle.",
          "It is small, quiet but lots of shops nearby, not many variety of animals but plenty of inquisitive bucks, all seem small, I'm not a buck expert! If travelling call in and go get a coffee or meal at the nearby and relax and watch the birds over the dam water and the giant",
          "Of all the hiking trails in and around Gauteng the trail itself is one of my favorites so far. The one big drawback is ofcourse that it is close to two big highways and the almost constant traffic noise can ruin your walk a bit. Other than that the trail was really great. The",
          "Within the heart of Pretoria you will find this lovely Nature Reserve, not even 5km from the City Centre. At the facility you can just walk through the trails, do mountain biking and also do a 4x4 route. If you do not feel like the extreme you can just drive through the normal",
          "Had a meet up with friends for Jozi walks, culture and fun group, a bunch of us did 5km walk or hike, we got to see 6 giraffes and an ostrich ,a bit tough in some spots to pass and single track but really beautiful trail route",
          "that was the easiest 10km hike i ever did, to me its more of taking a walk than hiking..My advice start early as the hot weather was unbearable. was disappointed there was no swimming pool to cool off after that hotness. people i a bit careless as there were bottles and chips",
          "Lovely nature reserve with a lot of trees and herbs, variety of bird species and a lots of wildlife. Great and safe place for day walks, bike rides and jog on the trails. Beautiful scenery and decently laid out trails. We did the white and red trails, saw giraffes, zebras,",
          "Amazing 10,5km hike. Woke up early started the trail at 5:30 and loved every bit of it. A lot of hiking trails start at 7am and that is what makes Groenkloof hiking trail amazing. Great experience seeing the giraffe,the zebra and many more animals in thier natural habitat.",
          "This nature reserve is just outside of Pretoria city center. At first, I was a bit leary because I heard of muggings and other riff-raff on the hiking trails. However, when I arrived with my husband and friends, it was truly lovely. We took the 5km hike, which was just long",
          "The trip started on a rather rough note with me having to queue for a good 40 minutes in order to gain entry at the gate. There was only one cashier!!!! Once done with the bureaucracy, I finally entered the reserve that I had ignored for so many years!!! How could I have driven",

          "A walk with the aninals. Do you like hiking take your family and friends to an awesome venue in the heart of Pretoria. On our last hike there we saw zebra, kudu, sable antelope and many more. Plan your hike for midweek when the animals are more visible and end up with a",

          "With various length hiking trails for everyone, this is a beautiful reserve close to the city but allows you to feel secluded as well. Easily spotted zebra, giraffes and baby giraffes and a lot of other wildlife and birdlife.",
          "This park is full of nature lovers and exercise junkies enjoying the various paths and trails. Go early to avoid the crowds and remember to take money for a snack and drink. You can rent a bicycle or go for horse riding.",
          "We did the 10km hike, was very fun, the trails are challenging and the views are great. Got to see a view of the city from up on top. We also walked a few meters away from giraffes and zebra. Saw ostriches too but they were a bit to shy to come as close as the zebras. I will be",
          "Used to be a nice clean and safe park but lately went downhill a bit. No loud music is allowed which is a good thing. Nice walking and MTB trails.",
          "Have been cycling here for over 15 years. One of the best single trail MTB spots in Gauteng. The routes cater for both novice (stick to Jeep track) and experienced (Single track) riders although the trails aren't marked according to skill level. A really fun ride and plenty of",
          "We went to Groenkloof nature reserve on a Sunday afternoon. It is a popular venue. People were walking and cycling and many were having picnics on the lawn. The picnic area looks very inviting and is in pristine condition. We drove slowly through the reserve and saw many zebras,",
          "We have been hiking twice with smaller kids and every time we are happy we did it- but I must warn you the trails are a bit confusing and we never know which one to do and always end up walking for 4 hours \ud83d\ude02 And secondly, people that live in the area warned us about muggings-",
          "What an awesome place to visit for a day - you can walk, cycle, do horse riding or have a picnic with family or friends. Beautiful and so quiet, you don't even realise you are in the city.",
          "Today we walked the 4.5 trail, which is just very nice. Not too difficult and it takes you through a variety of flora (bush, grass, rocky). Downside: one can hear the noise of traffic in the background.",
          "Groenkloof nature Reserve offers a number of hiking trails that one can do - but be careful - you should never do this alone - always in a group - preferably not less than 3 people together.",
          "This was our first visit to a Safari park. The accomodation was very good, the meals were ok. The afternoon/evening safari tour was a bit dissappointing, 2.5 hours without much wildlife.",
          "Went with friends for a birthday celebration and hosted an outdoor movie..it was beautiful and we had so much fun,nice and quiet peaceful",
          "We stayed over in the hikers huts, enjoyed two days of hiking and a fun evening at the lapa. This venue is suitable for family outings and gatherings. The hiking routes might be a bit too difficult for younger hikers, but are great for the average day hiker. We booked use of the",
          "Fairly close and easily accessible by bike from many neighbourhoods (or many people bring their bicycles by car). Botha Avenue has a nice and wide shoulder for cyclists, as does R21 towards Fountains Circle. George Storrar Drive towards Brooklyn is also safe, in my view. I enjoy",
          "Went there for family pictures and picnic. Although there are clear rules when you enter it seems like this applies only to certain guests. There where groups of people drinking, shouting and playing loud music. They shouted at us when we parked nearby. This was brought under",
          "The reserve is beautiful, especially after the rains. With the safety concerns having been addressed, more and more mountain bikers are returning to the magnificent trails!",
          "Went back here to see how it is doing. Send line it is only going backwards! Very very sad. There is even a sewerage leak running into the nearby stream. Still not fixed in over a year. This is a disgrace for a place that is supposed to support a good environment.",
          "We love going to Groenkloof for the 4x4 trial. The mountain bike trial also nice and fairly well maintained. Staff friendly.",
          "I read a number of reviews on this place before going and none mentioned that you need a 4x4 to drive through the reserve! We were so disappointed. We were allowed to walk through the reserve with our baby (seemed strange!), but not to drive our little rental car. Didn't see",
          "We had guests from overseas and they only had one day in Pretoria and an urge to do a w a l k in nature. What I really liked was the fact that we could choose the longer walks and we indeed did. Saw lovely giraffe, impala and zebra. The walk was a pleasure and so was the picnic",
          "Went for my first hiking here this Saturday, the 15th September with my sister. Did the 10,5 km. It was fun, safe, and fun. My sister was asking where the Zebras so can hitch a hike. And so we came across them. She froze. I took selfies with Zebras. We were lucky saw all the",
          "This use to be a great venue for cycling. Something for the whole family. Unfortunately it is not safe to use this facility anymore. The routes are not maintained anymore. Facilities are dirty. It is very unfortunate.",
          "What a beautiful place for peace of mind and a nice relaxation. It is worth visiting and even ideal for couple's relaxation.",
          "This is the ideal place to spend a Saturday or Sunday, either with your family, or a group of friends. Sufficient braai facilities and acceptable ablutions add to the attraction. But, once there you can hike, ride your mountain bike or attempt to drive the excellent 4x4 track.",
          "The title of my review is my only gripe. The hiking trails map has a \"red, white and yellow\" trail, but how am I supposed to follow the red trail if the map is printed in black and white!!? If possible, ask for a map to be emailed to you and print in colour for yourself. We",
          "Great open spaces within the city. Clear your mind and take a hike. Lots of different trails including different distances, biking, 4x4",
          "I went here with my girlfriend and we were not sure what to expect as it was our first Nature/Game Reserve trip. We went without a car and without a guide but managed to have a great time. After losing track of the Red Trail (4 km), we ended up on the White trail (10.5 km). All",
          "A lovely place with giraffe sable antelope ostrich blesbok impala. Real wild game reserve 2 km from UNISA. Lose yourself on a long strenuous trek or take the kids with their bikes. Or take a book and pack a picnic basket. Or your camera, and spend the day. No restaurant as far",
          "Great place to go and do a 4x4 track, go for a hike or just sit under the trees for a lunch. Safety has been said to be an issue but being addresses by local municipality.",
          "I love mountain biking in this park, it's full of zebra, wildebeest and kudu, but a recent rash of violent crimes have kept me away. I noticed new razor wire being installed on the fence my Nelson Mandela Boulevard, so hopefully it will keep the riff-raff out!",
          "Great nature bike, walk and picnic area in the centre of the greater Pretoria. Very safe and big enough to spend hours on a bike or a hike. Great picnic with the family as well.",
          "The groenkloof nature Reserve lays in the middle of Pretoria. You can watch animals or make tour on the mountain bike. Also horseback riding is possible.",
          "Beautiful hiking trails and biking trails. Nice, clean, shaded braai area. Even a play area for small children. Seeing giraffe on the hike is always a highlight.",
          "Nice trails. However muggings and attacks on people will keep me away along with lack of security. Also no restaurant what so ever! Stay away",
          "Such an awesome experience during the hiking....watching animals while we at it. While the plan was for 10km hiking trail, we ended up doing 15km without even realising it. Fitness and Fun!!",
          "A nice and enjoyable drive, great city views. Wildlife rarely strolls along the road. Saw a wildebeest.",
          "My husband and son were mugged on one of the trails in Groenkloof. It saddens me that we can't enjoy this beautiful reserve and it angers me that the people at the entrance said it was very safe when my husband asked about safety (before paying). The 'rangers' drove around with",
          "We live only 3 minutes drive from here and frequently visit the reserve. It's always lovely to see the animals up close in this peaceful environment",
          "Some nice hikes with quiet areas and good views of the city. We didn't see much wildlife but still enjoyed it. Parking was plentiful and there weren't too many people",
          "We went for a walk with FIVE kids all between the ages of 3 and 7. At first when we started walking i thought the kids would never make it, but they did it! we were proud, something about the freedom of the bush I guess! The \"3.5km \" is more than that- I think it ended up being",
          "For those who love being in the bush that's not too far to travel to ride your bike then this is the perfect place. A place where you in amongst the game, just make sure you have enough liquid because it can get warm.",
          "Always a great place for a leisurely hike as there are various well marked trails. One of my favorite hangouts as its within easy access from the city. Spotting game is a must and very rewarding. Awesome photo opportunities too. Zebra, giraffe, buck, ostrich... and beautiful",
          "I have done 4x4 trail a few years ago and again now. The route has been damaged a lot by amount of traffic. The route needs some work. 4 years ago I did it in a 4x2 now in a 4x4 I skipped various areas due to damage on route. If you want to go on a 4x4 route with your daily car",
          "It was a wonderful experience, not far from home and the view is extraordinary with a variety of activities. It's next to fountains valley",
          "Located near the Fountains area and a cab ride from a Gautrain station, this place a jewel. Nice facilities including play area for kids and bbq/braai facilities. The staff are friendly and there is security. There are no shops, so bring your own refreshments. You can hire",
          "It is so nice to not have to drive for hours to go hiking! This nature reserve is located right in Pretoria. It offers a few trails, ut most importantly, you can see wildlife while walking around the park. It is really cool.",
          "Clean, neat and helpful staff. Facilities are in good shape. Off road trail interesting, can be a challenge in the rainy season. Braai area is well maintained and regularly cleaned. A pleasant outing, will do this again.",
          "Groenkloof Nature Reserve has a lot of activities to keep you busy! From having a picnic or braai next to the river to horseriding, mountain biking and hiking, this is a very good place to spend a Saturday or public holiday with the family or with friends.",
          "Our office decided to visit the reserve for team building activities, thank God for City of Tshwane free WiFi. We enjoyed the spaces and plenty of shade around the picnic area. The hiking trail got boring after we only spotted a single wildlife rodent but was worth the walk",
          "Beautiful, quiet and not far from the city. Great hiking and biking trails with views of animals, as well as picnic spots. We did the 4km hiking option and for someone who is very unfit, it was much easier than expected. Don't need a lot of hiking experience. Just remember lots",
          "This Reserve is a wonderful place for Mountain Bikers and trail runners. The paths are well marked and the trails provide a nice variation. The downside for the bikers is the trail around the reserve is approximately 11 kilometers so requires two or three circuits for a",
          "A half day visit is all you will need. Do not expect the big five but there are Zebra, Antelope, Giraffe on show as well as a mountain bike cycling track",
          "A good place for an afternoon hike but not a big chance of seeing animals. There are different routes of different lengths and it is easy to follow the tracks. We however went to the wrong entrance (do not know why we could not enter there) and had to be redirected but it was",
          "Actually a very nice place, but, yet another woman and her daughter got attacked there this morning on one of the trails. Unbelievable that after all the problems that there was there are still no security in sight. There were 100 's of people there today and yet that didn't",
          "This is a break away from the city, although you are still in it..you pay an entrance fee, Seniors get a discount price.. You park your car and walk through the reserve..you can climb the mountains and take your own time..you will see many animals and make sure you have",
          "Had a 6-year old birthday here. Wide open spaces for the kids to run around, kick a ball & ride their bikes without disturbing anyone else. Big trees provide shade. Braai (BBQ) amenities available. So we made fresh hotdogs outdoors. Tractor ride available, but the 40 minute",
          "Gorenkloof Nature Reserve is a wonderful trip to make when in Pretoria for the, wether it be as a tourist or as a local, it's always nice. The Reserve is great for mountain biking and there are many trails to enjoy. There is also place to eat or you can have a picnic. It ounce",
          "What a lovely way to spend some quiet time in nature. The hikes are well marked and there is plenty to see and enjoy.",
          "My first viewe was a couple of zebras strolling by the fence close to the road. Not something you see everyday - except of course here!",
          "This is a great place to escape the rush of the city while you are still in it. The animals are beautiful and you are free to walk or ride a bike. You can rent bikes at the place and do 4x4",
          "I frequently go on Weekends for 5 or 10km hikes. Have had amazing animal sightings. Seen a family of five giraffe with just born baby still wobbly on its feet with cord still fresh, only to see 2 adolescent giraffe about an hour later. It's great that they have separated the",
          "We went there a few times to ride horses, and it was great. When you live in the city you sometimes forget what fun activities there are to do and this was the best news I heard when they said I can go horseback riding at Groenkloof. Beautiful, feels like you escaped for a few",
          "To start off my exploration I found that most of the staff were borderline useless. Being a tourist I knew very little about the place and what I could do there. All the roads were blocked off so I assumed I had to walk but with no map I decided to ask someone who looked like",
          "Nice park, took the 4x4 trails and saw kudu and zebras. Has nice mountain bike trails. Inexpensive park fees.",
          "Animals at close range, friendly staff, neat and tidy. Pleasant outing for the family. Well taken care of",

          "If you spend a day in Pretoria, You can go and relax here and observe the nature and fresh air in the city, but also out of the city!",
          "Many different walking and cycling routes, short ones and long ones. Some game around but nothing to be scared of just stay away from the giraffes. Only bathrooms available on site. Green lawns for picnics.",

          "Husband , triple by pass later, managed the white walk of 3,7km. It was delightful with a nice little hill, lovely plants and views. Treat of cinnamon pancakes afterwards & noticed one can also hire mountain bikes & ride horses. A great place to start convalescence and slowly",
          "The 10,5km (colour-coded yellow) trail took us 3,5 hours, with my unfit companion setting the pace (and struggling a bit on the last 2km), so it's advisable to set aside a morning to complete it. The map given at the entrance gate is a monchrome photocopy, so a measure of",
          "Did a long hike here in August 2014. Very nice, relatively easy walk. Encountered some game (zebra and giraffe), which gave the hike a special touch. Will certainly re-visit this area.",
          "Car, bike, feet; no matter what you use to get there and tour there, it's catered for. Great place when one considers its only about 5 kms from Pretoria city centre. No big 5, but great bird life. Ideal if you have a couple of hours to spare. Take your own bottled water, as",
          "I was 4x4 with my dad the day we got to groenkloof reserve ! It was so much fun, the obstacles were adventurous and tough , but we got through all of them , everything was clean eventhough it was such a large reserve. The staff was friendly and eager to help.",
          "Our hiking club opened the calendar this year with the 10km yellow hiking trail. it's gorgeous with panoramic views of Pretoria. We saw game! a zebra, some wildebeest and buck (don't know the exact species). We were inspired to try the cycling routes next time. great braai spots",
          "I am a regular visitor of the reserve and it is a great getaway from the city life without having to drive very far where one could bring their mountain bike, go on a hike, drive their 4x4, take a horse ride or even have an early afternoon braai with friends or family. The",
          "Groenkloof is the perfect escape to cycle or hike in an environment where there are no cars. Great for children's parties or a lazy day under the trees. There are facilities to braai. Take the family and friends. Brilliant cycling courses - on and offroad, horseriding, huts to",
          "Groenkloof NR offers great hiking opportunities, just make sure you are informed on where to go before you leave. The wildlife is very relaxed and don't forget to pay attention to all the beautiful smaller things like birds and flowers!",

          "I love this nature reserve for hiking and mountain biking. For the less adventurous mountain biker, like me, it offers a lot of jeep track to ride throughout the reserve with animal sightings. The hiking is also splendid. Safety has been known to be an issue so never hike or",

          "Have a perfect family day , picnic or braai with the family. Place for the children to go biking in a true nature type atmosphere. A lot of animals to see and what is even more amazing is it is in the city and you would not even know it. Entrance amount is fair. The Giraffe's is",
          "I have mountain biked here many times and enjoyed. You can go for gentle hikes or good trail runs - just watch out for the giraffes, kudu, zebra, rhone antelope, wildebeest and and and! Great spot considering you are in the middle of a city",
          "Lovely track for cyclist and joggers alike. Even taking a steady stroll proves to be an excellent way to get your heart pumping. Not advised to do the walks alone, many people around but we found the trail more challanging than expected and were glad for the extra help and water",
          "Take the bikes and see the giraffe's amongst other animals (no predators lol). Remember the cooler box, camping chairs and have a braai underneath the old timer trees.",
          "You can satisfy a couple of requirements at Groenkloof: 1. Picnic / braai outside; 2. Game viewing - the game is really tame and you can experience them up close and personal; 3. 4x4-ing through the reserve; 4. Hiking / mountain biking through the reserve Good place to chill",
          "Groenkloof is a small nature reserve in Pretoria. You can hike on well marked routes, bike or go in with your car or 4x4 on designated routes, or just have a braai or pick nick. A reserve so close to the city is ideal for Sunday morning or afternoon activty. Most of the time you",

          "What an amazing experience, bushveld walk in the middle of Pretoria. The trails are well marked, clean and for all levels of fitness. The entrance to the reserve is clean and the personnel somewhat helpful but you need to figure it out on your own but not difficult at all. The",

          "Went to Groenkloof yesterday with a friend and had a really good time. Lots of animals (see photos) and generally a well laid out area. You can drive around with a normal car, but it is even more fun with a 4x4. There is also bike paths and lots of walking tracks. Make sure to",

      "name": "Voortrekker Monument",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Voortrekker Monument is located just south of Pretoria in South Africa. This massive granite structure is prominently located on a hilltop,  and was raised to commemorate the Voortrekkers who left the Cape Colony between 1835 and 1854.\nOn 8 July 2011 the Voortrekker Monument, designed by the architect Gerard Moerdijk, was declared a National Heritage Site by the South African Heritage Resource Agency.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea to build a monument in honour of God was first discussed on 16 December 1888, when President Paul Kruger of the South African Republic attended the Day of the Covenant celebrations at Danskraal in Natal. However, the movement to actually build such a monument only started in 1931 when the Sentrale Volksmonumentekomitee (SVK) (Central People's Monuments Committee) was formed to bring this idea to fruition.\nConstruction started on 13 July 1937 with a sod-turning ceremony performed by the chairman of the SVK, Advocate Ernest George Jansen, on what later became known as Monument Hill. On 16 December 1938 the cornerstone was laid by three descendants of some of the Voortrekker leaders: Mrs. J.C. Muller (granddaughter of Andries Pretorius), Mrs. K.F. Ackerman (great-granddaughter of Hendrik Potgieter) and Mrs. J.C. Preller (great-granddaughter of Piet Retief).\nThe Monument was inaugurated on 16 December 1949 by the then-prime minister D. F. Malan. The total construction cost of the Monument was about \u00a3 360,000, most of which was contributed by the South African government. The construction contract being awarded to Raubex, after its incorporation.\nA large amphitheatre, which seats approximately 20,000 people, was erected to the north-east of the Monument in 1949.\n\n\n== Main features ==\nThe Voortrekker Monument is 40 metres high, with a base of 40 metres by 40 metres. The building shares architectural resemblance with European monuments such the D\u00f4me des Invalides in France and the V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal in Germany but also contains African influences.  The two main points of interest inside the building are the Historical Frieze and the Cenotaph.\n\n\n=== Historical Frieze ===\nThe main entrance of the building leads into the domed Hall of Heroes. This massive space, flanked by four huge arched windows made from yellow Belgian glass, contains the unique marble Historical Frieze which is an intrinsic part of the design of the monument. It is the biggest marble frieze in the world. The frieze consists of 27 bas-relief panels depicting the history of the Great Trek, but incorporating references to every day life, work methods and religious beliefs of the Voortrekkers. The set of panels illustrates key historical scenes starting from the first voortrekkers of 1835, up to the signing of the Sand River Convention in 1852. In the centre of the floor of the Hall of Heroes is a large circular opening through which the Cenotaph in the Cenotaph Hall can be viewed.\n\n\n=== Cenotaph ===\nThe Cenotaph, situated in the centre of the Cenotaph Hall, is the central focus of the monument. In addition to being viewable from the Hall of Heroes it can also be seen from the dome at the top of the building, from where much of the interior of the monument can be viewed. Through an opening in this dome a ray of sunlight shines at twelve o'clock on 16 December annually, falling onto the centre of the Cenotaph, striking the words 'Ons vir Jou, Suid-Afrika' (Afrikaans for 'We're for you, South Africa'), a line from 'Die Stem van Suid-Afrika'. The ray of light is said to symbolise God's blessing on the lives and endeavours of the Voortrekkers. 16 December 1838 was the date of the Battle of Blood River, commemorated in South Africa before 1994 as the Day of the Vow.\nThe Cenotaph Hall is decorated with the flags of the different Voortrekker Republics and contains wall tapestries depicting the Voortrekkers as well as several display cases with artefacts from the Great Trek. Against the northern wall of the hall is a niche with a lantern in which a flame has been kept burning ever since 1938. It was in that year that the Symbolic Ox Wagon Trek, which started in Cape Town and ended at Monument Hill where the Monument's foundation stone was laid, took place.\n\n\n=== Other features ===\nVisitors to the monument enter through a black wrought iron gate with an assegai (spear) motif.\nAfter passing through the gate one finds oneself inside a big laager consisting of 64 ox-wagons made out of decorative granite. The same number of wagons were used at the Battle of Blood River to form the laager.\n\nAt the foot of the Monument stands Anton van Wouw's bronze sculpture of a Voortrekker woman and her two children, paying homage to the strength and courage of the Voortrekker women. On both sides of this sculpture black wildebeest are chiselled into the walls of the Monument. The wildebeest symbolically depicts the dangers of Africa and their symbolic flight implies that the woman, carrier of Western civilisation, is triumphant.\nOn each outside corner of the Monument there is a statue, respectively representing Piet Retief, Andries Pretorius, Hendrik Potgieter and an \"unknown\" leader (representative of all the other Voortrekker leaders). Each statue weighs approximately 6 tons.At the eastern corner of the monument, on the same level as its entrance, is the foundation stone.\nUnder the foundation stone is buried:\n\nA copy of the Trekker Vow on 16 December 1838.\nA copy of the anthem \"Die Stem\".\nA copy of the land deal between the Trekkers under Piet Retief and the Zulus under king Dingane.\n\n\n=== German links ===\nAccording to Dr Alta Steenkamp, the masonic subtext of the Monument to the Battle of the Nations (V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal) in Leipzig, Germany, is reflected in the Voortrekker Monument because the architect, Gerard Moerdijk, had used the geometric order and spatial proportions of the V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal. This Germanisation of the Voortrekker Monument occurred after Moerdijk's initial design had caused a public outcry in the South African press for its resemblance to an Egyptian temple. In Moerdijk's initial design, the monument consisted of a causeway linking two Egyptian obelisks.Finalising his design of the Voortrekker Monument, Moerdijk visited Egypt in 1936, including the Karnak Temple Complex in Thebes. In Thebes, the pharaoh Akhenaten, Nefertiti's husband, had erected three sun sanctuaries, including the Hwt-benben ('mansion of the Benben').\n\nThe most prominent aspect of Moerdijk's monument is the annual mid noon sun illumination of the Benben stone, the encrypted cenotaph.\nIn the years preceding WWII, several Afrikaner nationalists travelled to Germany for academic, political and cultural studies. In 1928 Moerdijk visited Germany, and viewed the Amarna bust of Nefertiti on public display in Berlin.\nBy 1934 Chancellor Hitler had decided that Germany would not return the Amarna bust of Nefertiti to Egypt. He instead announced the intention to use the Amarna bust as the central show piece of the thousand years Third Reich, in a revitalised Berlin to be renamed Germania.[1]\nLikewise Moerdijk's thousand years monument with Amarna sun symbol at its centre, became Afrikaner nationalists' centre show piece of their capital Pretoria.\n\n\n=== Round floor opening ===\n\nLooking from the sky dome downwards, a chevron pattern on the floor of the Hall of Heroes, radiates outwards like 32 sun rays. In Moerdijk's architecture, the natural sun forms the 33rd ray through the floor opening.\nMoerdijk said the chevron pattern on the floor depicts water, as does the double chevron hieroglyph from the civilization of ancient Egypt.\nMoerdijk stated that all roads on the terrain of building art lead back to ancient Egypt.Based on Moerdijk's reference to the watery floor of the Hall of Heroes, as well as his statements about ancient Egypt, the floor opening may be identified with the watery abyss, as in the creation theology of ancient African civilization. Rising out of this watery abyss, was the primeval mound, the Benben stone, to symbolize a new creation.\n\n\n=== Religious sun ray ===\nGerard Moerdijk was the chief architect of 80 Protestant churches in South Africa. Moerdijk adhered to Reformed church tradition and thus his Renaissance trademark, the Greek-cross floorplan, always focused on the pulpit and preacher. In Protestant theology, the word of God is central. Moerdijk created a similar central focus in the Voortrekker Monument, but in vertical instead of horizontal plane, and in African instead of European style.\nThe monument's huge upper dome features Egyptian backlighting to simulate the sky, the heavenly abode of God. Through the dome a sun ray penetrates downwards, highlighting words on 16 December at noon.\nThe sky oriented words: \"US FOR YOU SOUTH AFRICA\", are Moerdijk's focus point. These words are taken from an anthem, Die Stem: \"We will live, we will die, we for thee South-Africa\". The same anthem ends: \"It will be well, God reigns.\"\nThus the sun ray simulates a connection between the words on the Cenotaph and the heavenly abode above, a communication between God and man.\nThe actual sun ray itself forms a 33rd sun ray shining onto the stone in the midst of floor opening.\n\n\n=== Heavenly vow ===\nIn Moerdijk's biblical theology, God communicates in two ways: through scripture and nature. Moerdijk merges both methods, by using the sun in his simulation.\n\nThe Vow of the Trekkers was commemorated on 16 December as the Day of the Vow. On 16 December, the appearance of an illuminating sun disc on the wording of the Cenotaph stone, transform their meaning as per the Philosophers Stone of the alchemists.\nInstead of man below making an earthly vow, the sun shifts the focus upwards to the trinitarian god of the Trekkers, as it is God who communicates through Moerdijk's sun architecture, making Himself a heavenly vow with the words: WE - as in GOD - FOR THEE SOUTH-AFRICA.\nThus God in the trinitarian tradition of the Trekkers, speaks a vow within the sun disc illuminating the words on the Cenotaph.\nThe Trekker belief that God was for South Africa originates from the 9\u201316 December 1838 vow of Trekker leader Andries Pretorius at Blood river, who at around the same time made military and political alliances with Christian Zulus like prince Mpande.\n\n\n=== Egyptian origin ===\nMoerdijk was an outspoken supporter of ancient Egyptian architecture.Moerdijk referred to Africa's greatness as imparted by ancient Egyptian constructions at the inauguration of the Voortrekker Monument.Before his Voortrekker Monument proposal was accepted, Moerdijk and Anton van Wouw had been working in alliance for many years on their \"dream castle\" project: a modern African-Egyptian Voortrekker Temple in South-Africa. Van Wouw and Frans Soff had earlier employed the Egyptian obelisk, a petrified ray of the African Aten, as central motif for the National Women's Monument in Bloemfontein, South Africa, itself likewise inaugurated on the Day of the Vow, 16 December 1913.\nWhilst finalising the design of the Voortrekker Monument in 1936, Moerdijk went on a research trip to Egypt. There he visited the Karnak Temple Complex at Thebes, where an African Renaissance had flourished under Pharaoh Akhenaten, Nefertiti's husband.\nThe open air temples of Akhenaten to the Aten incorporated the Heliopolitan tradition of employing sun rays in architecture, as well as realistic wall reliefs or friezes.\nMoerdijk also visited the Cairo Museum, where a copy of the Great Hymn to the Aten is on display, some verses of which remind of Psalm 104.\nMoerdijk's wife Sylva related that he was intimately acquainted with ancient Egyptian architecture, and was strongly influenced architecturally by his visit to Egypt.\n\n\n=== Architectural purpose ===\n\nThe architect, Gerard Moerdijk, stated that the purpose of a building had to be clearly visible. The aspect of the sun at mid-noon in Africa, was during Nefertiti's time known as Aten. In Egyptian hieroglyphics, Aten was written as a sun dot enclosed by a circle.\nThe Aten-hieroglyph is depicted in the Voortrekker Monument when the sun shines through an aperture in the top dome.\nLikewise, looking downwards from the top dome walkway, the round floor opening is seen to encircle the sun disc illumination.\nMoerdijk's message as implied by the wall frieze: by exodus out of the British Cape Colony, God created a new civilization inland.\nIn order to give thanks to this new creation of civilization, Moerdijk, recalling Abraham of old, outwardly designed the Voortrekker Monument as an altar.\n\n\n== Monument complex ==\nIn the years following its construction, the monument complex was expanded several times and now includes:\n\nAn indigenous garden that surrounds the monument.\nFort Schanskop, a nearby fort built in 1897 by the government of the South African Republic after the Jameson Raid and now a museum.\nThe Schanskop open-air amphitheatre with seating for 357 people that was officially opened on 30 January 2001.\nA garden of remembrance.\nA nature reserve was declared on 3.41 km\u00b2 around the Monument in 1992. Game found on the reserve include Zebras, Blesbok, Mountain Reedbuck, Springbok, Black Wildebeest and Impala.\nA Wall of Remembrance that was constructed near the Monument in 2009. It was built to commemorate the members of the South African Defence Force who died in service of their country between 1961 and 1994.\nAn Afrikaner heritage centre, which was built in order to preserve the heritage of the Afrikaans-speaking portion of South Africa's population and their contribution to the history of the country.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreat Trek\nV\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Site of the Voortrekker Monument\nBlood river Vow Committee (in Afrikaans) - Official Site\n360 degree Virtual Tour of Voortrekker Monument on Visit Pretoria\nSite by The Voortrekker Monument, at SAHRA",

        "wiki": "The University of Pretoria (Afrikaans: Universiteit van Pretoria, Northern Sotho: Yunibesithi ya Pretoria) is a multi-campus public research university in Pretoria, the administrative and de facto capital of South Africa. The university was established in 1908 as the Pretoria campus of the Johannesburg-based Transvaal University College and is the fourth South African institution in continuous operation to be awarded university status. The university has grown from the original 32 students in a single late Victorian house to approximately 53,000 in 2019. The University was built on 7 suburban campuses on 1,190 hectares (2,900 acres).The University is organised into nine faculties and a business school. Established in 1920, the University of Pretoria Faculty of Veterinary Science is the second oldest veterinary school in Africa and the only veterinary school in South Africa. In 1949, the university launched  the first MBA programme outside North America and the university's Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) has consistently been ranked the top business school in Africa for executive education, as well as being placed in the top 50 in the world. In 2012, the Financial Times ranked the GIBS Executive MBA 1st in Africa and 60th in the world.Since 1997, the university has produced more research outputs every year than any other institution of higher learning in South Africa, as measured by the Department of Education's accreditation benchmark. In 2008, the university awarded 15.8% of all masters and doctorate degrees in South Africa, the highest percentage in the country.The university is commonly referred to as UP, Tuks, or Tukkies and in post-nominals the university is typically abbreviated as Pret or UP, although Pretoria is also used in official publications.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundational years: 1889\u20131929 ===\nThe day might come when the Transvaal University College might mean to the Transvaal what Oxford University has meant to England. A long time might have to pass, and for a hundred years we might have to watch the grass growing on our lawns before that day arrives, but noble beginning has been made.\n\nThe proposal for a university for the capital, first mooted in the Volksraad in 1889, was interrupted by the outbreak of the Anglo Boer War in 1899. In 1896, the South African School of Mines was founded in Kimberley. Eight years later, in 1904, the school was moved to Johannesburg and was renamed the Transvaal Technical Institute. The school's name changed yet again in 1906 to Transvaal University College. In 1902, after the signing of the Peace of Vereeniging, the Normal College for teacher training was established in Groenkloof, Pretoria. On 4 March 1908, when the Transvaal University College (TUC) transferred its arts and science courses to its newly established Pretoria Campus the precursor to the university was established, initially offering courses in languages, sciences, and law.Instruction commenced with 32 students, 4 professors and 3 lecturers in the Kya Rosa, 270 Skinner Street a late Victorian residence purchased from Leo Weinthal the then owner of The Press (forerunner to the Pretoria News Newspaper). The first four professors were Prof H. Th. Reinink (Dutch), J. Purves (Scottish), D.F. du Toit Malherbe (South African) and A.C. Paterson (Scottish), who would also become the first Vice-Chancellor.In 1910, the Colonial Secretary, General Jan Smuts tabled the act constituting the university as a separate entity before the Transvaal Parliament, the \"Transvaalse Universiteits-Inlijvingswet\" Law 1 of 1910. On 17 May 1910, the Johannesburg and Pretoria campuses separated, each becoming an independent institution. The Johannesburg campus being reincorporated as the South African School of Mines and Technology, while the Pretoria campus retained the name of Transvaal University College until 1930. The South African School of Mines and Technology would later go on to become the University of the Witwatersrand in 1922. In 1910, the TUC acquired its own campus in the east of Pretoria, what is now the western part of the university's main campus in Hatfield. On 3 August 1910, Governor-General Herbert John Gladstone, 1st Viscount Gladstone laid the cornerstone of the Old Arts Building, the first building to be built on the newly established Hatfield campus. The building's striking Cape Dutch and Neo-Romanesque architectural style was recognised in 1968 when it was declared a provincial heritage site. During this time the colloquial name for the university, Tukkies or Tuks, was derived from the Afrikaans acronym for the college, i.e. Transvaalse Universiteitskollege (TUK).\nThe late 1910s and early 1920s saw the establishment of several faculties as the academic activities were expanded. Courses in agriculture (1917), theology (1918), economics and political science (1919), veterinary science (1920), and music (1923) were established as the institution grew.\n\n\n=== Establishment and expansion years 1929\u20131982 ===\n\nOn 10 October 1930, the University of Pretoria Private Act, No. 13 of 1930 changed the name of the TUC to the University of Pretoria. The TUC originally established as an English medium institution had evolved into the only fully bilingual university in South Africa and remained as such until the early 1930s. The rapid increase of Afrikaans speaking students brought about an imbalance between the demographics of students and the languages of instruction. By 1931, although 65% of students were Afrikaans speaking, 68% of the classes were conducted in English. In 1932, the University Council addressed the imbalance, deciding that Afrikaans would become the only medium of instruction. An increase in student numbers necessitated the building of new facilities such as the Club Hall and Administration Building (colloquially known as the ship) when the 7th faculty, the Medical Faculty, was established in 1943. This period further saw the establishment of numerous student activities such as the annual Spring Day event and intervarsity. Student publications established include the Trek in 1931, the first Rag Mag in 1936 and the weekly student newspaper, Die Perdeby in 1939. The period of 1948\u20131982 is characterised by the substantial increase in numbers of an almost exclusively white student body and the concomitant physical growth of the university infrastructure. The nearly doubling of student numbers demanded the physical expansion of the Hatfield campus and new buildings were built in quick succession as the campus grew eastward. In the mid-1960s, the university urgently required additional land and acquired the adjacent property of Christian Brothers' College, Saint Gabriel's. This property now forms the eastern section of the Hatfield campus.\nIn 1949, the university founded the Graduate School of Management (GSM),\n\n\n=== Transformation years: 1982 and beyond ===\n\nDuring the period of 1982 to 2008, the university transformed into a bilingual, multiracial and inclusive institution. The comparatively smooth introduction of students from all races formed the initial impetus for transformation and in 1989 the university was declared officially desegregated and opened for all races. In 1993, a policy document was introduced, aiming to position the university in a newly democratic South Africa. In 1994, the university regained its status as a bilingual university when a new language policy was adopted. However, in 2019 a new language policy was adopted which discontinued Afrikaans as a language of instruction in favour of English only.In 1999, the only two veterinary science faculties in the country, those of the University of Pretoria and Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, formerly Medunsa, were amalgamated. The university's Onderstepoort campus once again housed the only veterinary faculty in South Africa. In 2000, the Teachers Training College Pretoria, formerly the Normal College Pretoria founded in 1902, was incorporated into the university's Faculty of Education, which saw the faculty moving to the self-sufficient Groenkloof campus.The university's business school in Illovo, Johannesburg, the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS), was established in January 2000 following a substantial contribution by Sir Donald Gordon, the founder of Liberty Life and Liberty International, and a major investment by the University of Pretoria following discussions which started in 1998. The now defunct Vista University's Mamelodi campus was incorporated on 2 January 2004, as part of the restructuring of South African tertiary institutions. In 2011, GIBS opened a satellite campus on Pritchard Street in the inner city of Johannesburg. The Business school follows on the university's, now defunct Graduate School of Management's, long tradition of MBA tuition as the first business school outside North America and replaced it in January 2008.\n\n\n== Administration and organisation ==\n\n\n=== Governance ===\n\nAs set out in the Higher Education Act No 101 of 1997, the university is governed by the Council with the Vice-Chancellor and Principal, Tawana Kupe, the executive head responsible for the day-to-day administration, and the Chancellor, Wiseman Nkuhlu, being the non-resident titular head of the university. The Registrar is responsible for the academic administration of the university, as well as legal matters, and is secretary to the University Council and Senate.\nThe university's academic activities are divided into nine faculties and one business school. Whilst the faculties comprise 140 departments and 85 institutes, bureaus and centres.\n\n\n== Main Campus ==\n\n\n=== Hatfield ===\n\nThe university's main campus and central administration offices are situated in the suburb of Hatfield, Pretoria and houses six of the nine faculties. The campus, bordered by the suburb of Brooklyn to the south and Hatfield to the north, was built over 24 hectares (59 acres) and has more than 60 buildings of historical value.Adjacent to the Hatfield Campus is the Hillcrest Campus, which contains the High Performance Centre and LC de Villiers Sports Grounds, which were developed on 76 hectares (190 acres). Adjacent to the sport grounds is the university's experimental farm, which is used to conduct field experiments for the Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences. The campus is served by the Hatfield Gautrain station connecting Pretoria and Johannesburg. A university bus shuttle service operates between the Hatfield campus and the Groenkloof and Prinshof campuses, whilst a park-and-ride shuttle service operates between the Hatfield and Hillcrest campus.\n\n\n==== Museums ====\nThe university's art collection consists primarily of paintings, sculptures and graphic works by South African artists including the likes of Jacobus Hendrik Pierneef, Gregoire Boonzaier, William Kentridge and Sam Nhlengethwa. The collection also incorporates artworks by renowned international artists such as Max Pechstein, K\u00e4the Kollwitz, Max Liebermann, George Grosz, Otto Mueller, Rembrandt van Rijn, Thomas Benton and Marc Chagall. The university's sculpture collection, the largest such collection in South Africa, contains sculptures by Sidney Kumalo, Maureen Quinn, Michael Teffo,  Anton Smit and others.\nThe Old Arts Building was proclaimed a provincial heritage site in 1968 and houses the Van Tilburg Collection, Van Gybland-Oosterhoff Collection and Mapungubwe Collection. The Van Tilburg Collection is a permanent museum that exhibits 17th and 18th century furniture, paintings, Delft ceramics and other works of art, and includes the largest South African collection of Chinese ceramic objects, from the Qin (221\u2013206 BC), Han (202 BC \u2013 AD 220), Tang (AD 618\u2013906), Song (AD 960\u20131279), Ming (1368\u20131644) and Qing (1644\u20131912) dynasties.What survives are the almost untouched remains of the palace sites and also the entire settlement area dependent upon them, as well as two earlier capital sites, the whole presenting an unrivalled picture of the development of social and political structures over some 400 years.The university is the custodian of the collection of artefacts found at the Mapungubwe National Park and World Heritage site and such display these artefacts in the Mapungubwe Museum. Gold ornaments, ivory, bone, ceramic-ware, clay figurines, trade beads, iron and copper artefacts are on permanent public display. The Van Gybland-Oosterhoff Collection is a ceramic collection, donated by Dr Horace Hugo Alexander van Gybland Oosterhoff and accepted by the university on 14 March 1939, is the largest collection of objects, publications, memorabilia and photographs of historical interest, relating to Dutch culture outside the Netherlands.The Old Merensky Library houses the Edoardo Villa Museum. The Edoardo Villa Museum currently houses the largest collection of sculptures by the Italian artist Edoardo Villa and one South Africa's most renowned sculptors, who was mentored by Minotti at the Scuola D\u2019Arte Andrea Fontoniby.The Van Wouw Museum is the largest collection of bronze, marble and plaster sculptures by the famous pioneer South African sculptor, Anton van Wouw (1862\u20131945). Van Wouw, who is widely regarded as the founder of traditional sculpture in South Africa, created masterful artworks portraying Boer figures and the indigenous peoples of South Africa. Besides documents, photos, paintings and tools the exhibits are mainly bronze maquettes and casts of Van Wouw's sculptural work. The Van Wouw Museum is housed in Anton Van Wouw's last residence, a Dutch national monument.\nOther minor art collections include the Christo Coetzee collection which was bequeathed to the university by the artist in 2001 and consists of more than 3000 objects,  NPK Ceramics Collection, Hilgard Muller Collection, Mike Edwards Collection, Kruger Collection, Frans Esterhuizen Cartoon Collection, Hansie Visagie Puppet Collection, Friends of the Pretoria Art Association Art Collection, Baldinelli Trust Collection and Mimi Coertse Collection.\n\nThe University's Science, Engineering and Technology (SET) Discovery Centre, Sci-Enza, was officially launched in 1977. The Discovery Centre is an umbrella complex where young children, students and adults can explore the world of science, engineering and technology in a \"play-as-you-learn\" way. Activities at the Centre museum include: a digital planetarium; exploratorium; camera obscura; biological science exhibit; botanical garden and indigenous technology exhibit.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Key places ====\n\nThe main hall and site of ceremonies, the Aula, was designed by Karel Jooste and completed in 1958. The Aula was the first Opera House to be built in the capital and remained the major venue in the city until the State Theatre's completion in the early 1980s. The 1012-seat auditorium has played host to foreign dignitaries, presidents and local and international artists. The main music complex, comprising the 500-seat Musaion and 3000-seat Amphitheatre, was built between 1960\u20131964. The University Chapel, formally the Church of Saint Alfons Maria de Liguori, and the accompanying Monastery, was built in 1925 and was bought from the Catholic Church in 1980. Saint Alfons, who was canonised in 1839, was the founder of the order of Ligournians (or Redemptorists), an order founded in 1732 in Naples, Italy and dedicated to helping underprivileged communities.\n\n\n== Other campuses ==\n\n\n=== Onderstepoort, Pretoria ===\nThe possibility of training veterinarians in South Africa was frequently raised after the first Colonial Veterinary Surgeon in South Africa was appointed in approximately 1874, but it was not until 1920 that the Swiss-born veterinarian, Sir Arnold Theiler, was appointed as Director of Veterinary Education and Research at Onderstepoort under the supervision of the then Transvaal University College. New facilities were inaugurated at the end of 1921 and the first residence was opened in 1924. The first eight South African trained veterinarians qualified in 1924.\nThe Faculty of Veterinary Sciences was developed on the 65 hectares (160 acres) Onderstepoort campus, with buildings covering a total of 55,000 square metres (590,000 sq ft) 30 kilometres (19 mi) north-west of the Hatfield campus and 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) north of the Pretoria city center. The Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital provides clinical services rendered with full student participation as part of the primary teaching mission of the Faculty of Veterinary Science.  It is the only faculty in South Africa educating veterinarians and veterinary nurses.\n\n\n=== Groenkloof, Pretoria ===\n\nDuring the Conference of Teachers in Town and Refugee Camp Schools of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony of 1\u201310 July 1902, a resolution was passed to establish \"Normal Schools\" for the education of teachers in Johannesburg and Pretoria. The Pretoria Normal School, was first established in a house in 126 Rissik Street. In 1903 the Johannesburg Normal School's 40 students were transferred to Pretoria when it was closed and the Pretoria and Johannesburg institutions were merged to form the Transvaal Normal College. When the Transvaal University College was established in 1908 the first students include students from the Transvaal Normal College. In 1909 the school was renamed the Pretoria Normal College when new teacher training facilities were established in Heidelberg and Johannesburg. In 1954 the school was again renamed to the Onderwyskollege van Pretoria (English: Teachers College Pretoria). In 1974 the University of Pretoria took over the sole responsibility for training secondary teacher from the Teachers College Pretoria.\nAlthough the Teachers College Pretoria purchased new college grounds in Groenkloof during 1975, the college only occupied the new grounds in 1988 and was inaugurated in 1989. The Johannesburg Goudstadse Onderwyskollege, 'Gold-city Teachers College', Transvaal College of Education, Laudium and the Transvaal Education College Soshanguve amalgamate and move their operations to the Teachers College Pretoria in 1993 and the latter two in 1998 respectively. In 2000 the Teachers Training College Pretoria was incorporated into the university's Faculty of Education, which saw the faculty moving from the main Hatfield campus to the self-sufficient Groenkloof campus.\n\n\n=== Prinshof, Pretoria ===\n25\u00b043\u203257\u2033S 28\u00b012\u203210\u2033E\nStudents in the Faculty of Health Sciences are taught at the Prinshof Campus, adjoining the Steve Biko Hospital (formerly Pretoria Academic Hospital and HF Verwoerd Hospital), the main healthcare training facility of the university, and the Tshwane District Hospital. Additional healthcare training facilities include the Kalafong Hospital on the western outskirts of Pretoria in the suburb of Atteridgeville, the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital west of the city centre and built on the site of the old Pretoria botanical gardens and Tembisa Hospital south of Pretoria in the East Rand, Johannesburg.\n\n\n=== Illovo, Johannesburg ===\nThe university's business school, the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS), is situated in a greenfield campus in the Illovo Boulevard, mixed-use commercial node between the suburbs of Rosebank and Sandton in Johannesburg, with a satellite Inner City Campus on Pritchard Street. The Illovo campus is served by the Rosebank Gautrain station, with a nearby Gautrain bus stop and the inner city campus by the Johannesburg Park Station. GIBS Europe operates out of London, United Kingdom offering company specific programmes.\n\n\n=== Other sites ===\nThe Witbank and Hammanskraal satellite campuses, were established in 1988 and 1994 respectively and are used as additional practical facilities and for community engagement. The now defunct Vista University's Mamelodi campus was incorporated on 2 January 2004, as part of the restructuring of South African tertiary institutions. The Mamelodi campus hosts the extended BSc degree programme and functions as the community engagement hub for the university.\n\n\n== Academics ==\n\n\n=== Library system ===\n\n\"This country has given me so much that I am only too happy to be allowed to help it to develop and to be able to give back to it a fraction of what it has given to me\".\nIn 1933, the University decided that the library collection necessitated the building of a new library building, the collection which at that time was kept in the Old Arts building. The library was designed by the South African architect Gerard Moerdijk, following a donation of \u00a310,000 (\u00a3697,337 as of 2018) from mining geologist Dr. Hans Merensky and construction started in 1937. Drawing from his inspiration from Persia and Africa, the design of the building incorporates several architectural styles including Art Deco, Neo-Classicism, Arts and Crafts, Cape Dutch and Regency. The Old Merensky Library was proclaimed a provincial heritage site in 1991.Despite expansions to the Old Merensky Library in 1957, the library subsequently became insufficient to meet the growing needs of the institution and in 1975 the Merensky Library II was completed, currently housing 7 of 9 the faculty libraries. Besides the main Merensky Library complex, the university library system also includes the separately administered Jotello F Soga Library (Veterinary Science), Oliver R Tambo Law Library, Education Library, Mamelodi Library, Dentistry Library and Health Sciences Library.The Oliver R Tambo Law Library houses the Faculty of Law's collection of legal materials and the Law of Africa collection in the library is the single most comprehensive and current collection of primary legal materials of African countries.In 1974 the Jotello F Soga Library of the Faculty of Veterinary Science at the Onderstepoort campus was established and is named in honour of the first South African to qualify as a veterinary surgeon, Dr Jotello Festiri Soga.In 2006 the University established UPSpace, its own open access digital research repository. and the university's library has since become one of 27 partners in the World Digital Library project.\n\n\n=== Archives ===\nIn 1978 the first task group responsible for the investigation in creating an archive system for the University of Pretoria was chaired by Prof. A.N. Pelzer (Vice-rector). Due to the death of Prof. Pelzer in 1981 the project stalled, but by 1994 the need for a central archive system was again recognised by the acting Registrar, Prof. C.R. de Beer. The archives were finally established by 13 September 1994 by the Management of the University and this date is considered as the founding date of the archives of the University of Pretoria.\n\n\n=== Research ===\n\nThe university's achievements and performance in research locally and internationally, including its collaboration and cooperation with the private sector, industry, science councils, foundations and NGOs, the large number of graduates that it produces (particularly doctoral and other postgraduate students) as well as scientists and engineers and its focus on innovation, contribute directly towards enhancing the South Africa's competitiveness. A 2010 report by Centre for Higher Education Transformation identified the university as a top research-intensive university in South Africa. The university is member of the CDIO Initiative, an international engineering education collaboration.\n\nIn 1999 a strategic alliance was formed between the University of Pretoria and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). This alliance, which is known as the Southern Education and Research Alliance (SERA), collaborates locally and internationally with universities, NGOs, companies and multinational bodies in various research areas.Notable research includes:\n\nCentre for Human Rights\nForestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute (FABI)\nAfrican Centre for Genome Technologies\n\n\n=== Digital institutional repositories ===\n\n\n==== UPeTD ====\nUPeTD (University of Pretoria electronic theses and dissertations) was launched in July 2000 and forms part of the university's open scholarship programme. In January 2012 the Webometrics World Ranking of Institutional Repositories ranked the UPeTD website, 69th in the world. The records in UPeTD were migrated to the UPSpace institutional repository in August 2014, and UPeTD was subsequently discontinued.\n\n\n==== UPSpace ====\nUPSpace (Institutional research repository of the University of Pretoria) is the name of the open access digital institutional repository of the University of Pretoria, established as a means for the management and dissemination of digital materials created by the institution and its community members. UPSpace contains a collection of the intellectual and research output produced by past and current researchers of the University of Pretoria. The spectrum of material covered includes the following: historical or archival material, research articles, popular research material, unpublished research, inaugural addresses, conference proceedings, technical reports and open lectures.\n\n\n=== Reputation and ranking ===\n\nLeague table rankings\nThe QS World University Rankings ranks the university as follows:\nIn January 2011 Webometrics ranked the university as the 2nd in South Africa and Africa.In January 2015 Webometrics ranked the university as the 3rd in South Africa and 4th Africa.In July 2015 Webometrics ranked the university as the 4th in South Africa and Africa.\n\n\n== Student life ==\n\n\n=== Residential life ===\nResidence is provided to students in 24 undergraduate and postgraduate residences and 3 postgraduate-only residences spread over the University's campuses. The first students of the Transvaal University College resided in the Kya Rosa, a Victorian house in Skinner Street. In 1915, the first male residence, Kollegetehuis, was constructed on the Hatfield campus and the first female residence, Asterhof, in 1925. Students not living in a University residence can join one of four Day Houses (Luminous, Vividus Men, Vividus Ladies and Zeus) which gives them the opportunity to partake in organised student life activities.\n\n\n=== Student organisations ===\nMore than 100 student clubs and organisations operate on the university campus. These include numerous student government, service providers, and service organisations. The most prominent amongst these are the Student Parliament, Student Representative Council, and Constitutional Tribunal (Student Court). The Student Parliament is the plenary body of student governance and determines the wider mandate for student governance. The Student Representative Council (SRC) is the executive body of student governance and subsequently charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. The SRC is the residential student government, specialising in programming, policy, and facilities and services. Societies are registered in the following categories as catering for religious, political, social, cultural, academic and other. The Constitutional Tribunal is the judicial body of student governance and adjudicates disputes primarily between student organisations. Its judges sit on the panel of student disciplinary hearings. The various service providers are the university's primary programming organisations, serving as a centre of social, cultural, intellectual and recreational life.\n\n\n=== Student activities ===\nThe university has a long tradition of student activities and traditions. It is common belief that if a blossom from a Jacaranda tree falls on your head, you will do well in the end-of-year exams. Other traditions and customs vary by residence, day house and faculty.\nThe university started the tradition of Rag (student society) (Afrikaans: Jool), a student-run charitable fundraising organisation, in South Africa in 1925. During Rag, students take to the streets in a parade of floats whilst collecting money for charity.\nThe university's Springday celebrations are a declared university holiday and are held annually on the second Wednesday of September.Students' song and dance competitions include Insync (formerly Ienkmelodienk), Serenade and Serrie.

          "Excellent day out. Loads to see and plenty of animals about. Zebra, Oryx, Rhino, Springbok to name a few. If your going in a normal car you may want to stick to the tarmac roads but I recommend taking a pickup or 4x4 so you can explore more on the dirt tracks.",
          "The facility is just off R21 between Pretoria and Johannesburg which made it a great diversion. Entrance fees were reasonable and the reserve is about 20 square kilometers so we spent a couple of hours on our game search. There are blinds which allowed us to capture some",

        "wiki": "The Wonderboom Nature Reserve (Afrikaans: Wonderboom-natuurreservaat) is a 1 km\u00b2, 200-hectare reserve that incorporates a section of the Magaliesberg range in the northern portion of the Pretoria metropole, South Africa. Its main attractions are the Wonderboom (Afrikaans for \"Marvel tree\") near the reserve entrance in Lavender street and the derelict Fort Wonderboompoort on the crest of the Magaliesberg, that was constructed towards the end of the nineteenth century, during the Second Boer War. The latter is reached by following the steep, paved walkway that leads from the picnic area to the summit. The vicinity of the fort ruins also afford sweeping views of the city, whose council declared the area around the Wonderboom and both banks of the Apies River a reserve on 28 December 1949.\n\n\n== Wonderboom ==\n\nThe well-known 'Wonderboom' (Afrikaans: 'Wonder tree') is a dense grove of parent and daughter trees of the species Ficus salicifolia, that descended from a central bole of about a thousand years old. It is situated at the northern base of the Magaliesberg, and two circular walkways currently protect it from pedestrian traffic around its trunk and roots. As it has grown, its outlying branches have rooted themselves around the parent tree. This has repeated until there are now three layers of daughter trees encircling the mother fig, with 13 distinct trunks, covering a 50m\u00b2 (1.5 ha) area. The mother trunk is 4 m in circumference and 20 m high. Apart from its unusual height for a wild tree of this species, its method of reproduction is a rare natural phenomenon.\nThe tree was so remarkable that the original inhabitants of the Magaliesberge considered it sacred, especially after a chieftain was buried there. In 1836, Hendrik Potgieter and his fellow Voortrekkers passing through and gave the tree its name. Later, other Trekkers pitched their tent there, making it a notable landmark in Afrikaner history. For many years, the Day of the Vow was celebrated in its shade.\nUntil part of the original tree burned in an 1870 fire, a thousand people could sit in the tree's shade. According to records, the tree was also large enough to leave in its shadow 22 ox-wagons with 20 oxen in front of each.\nThe tree was placed under quarantine in 1985 after it was afflicted by a fungal disease, and then fenced to prevent it from spreading. Once the fungus was eradicated, the quarantine was lifted in 2003.\n\n\n== Other features ==\nOther features of the Wonderboom Nature Reserve include a Stone-Age site that has produced the largest single accumulation of Neolithic tools ever found in South Africa and an Iron-Age site. Larger game species such as impala and zebra roam the reserve, as do monkeys, and a breeding pair of black eagles have raised chicks in the reserve since 2010, feeding on the rock hyraxes living in caves on the banks of the Apies.\n\n\n== Hours ==\nThe reserve has picnic areas and can be visited between 7:00 AM and 6:00 PM (exit only after 4:00 PM)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of individual trees\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWonderboom Nature Reserve\nThe Wonderboom",

        "wiki": "Kruger House is the historical Pretoria residence of the Boer leader and President of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger. It was built in 1884 by architect Tom Claridge and builder Charles Clark. Milk was used, instead of water, for mixing the cement from which the house was constructed, as the cement available was of poor quality.\nThe house was also one of the first in Pretoria to be lit by electricity. The house contains either the original furnishings or items from the same historical period, some of the many gifts that were presented to Kruger as well as other memorabilia.\nAnother interesting feature of the house is two stone lions on the verandah that were presented to President Kruger as a birthday gift on 10 October 1896 by the mining magnate Barney Barnato.\nThe Kruger House is now a house museum that tries to recreate the ambience of the period that Kruger lived in.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter President Kruger became a member of the Volksraad (Parliament) in 1863, he bought several plots of land on Church Street. He originally had a house to the east of today's Kruger House Museum, and later had one to the west of it. In July 1884, the Kruger family moved into the house described in this article, which was built by the prominent businessman Alois Hugo Nellmapius. On August 14 of that year, the President hosted 60 guests, among them members of the Volksraad, lawyers, Cabinet members, and pastors at a dinner party in his \"new official residence.\"\nThe Kruger House displays a mix of styles. The cornice-molded gables, the molding on the front door, and the plastered moldings show Late Renaissance touches, while the front and back porches show Asian influence. The house is an elongated, simple, and sturdy building. Two large drawing rooms highlight the front of the house, with four bedrooms behind. The long, broad front porch became famous as a place the President would often sit and would sometimes receive visitors.\nThe President and Mrs. Kruger lived for 15 years and 10 months, more or less, from July 1884 to May 1900, in the Kruger House. Their children - except for Tjaart, the youngest - were already married. On May 29, 1900, shortly before the British took Pretoria, the President left his home for the last time. His wife remained until her death in 1901. Family, friends, and sympathizers came to greet him. A boy named James F. Smith also brought 29,000 signed condolences from American boys.\nShortly before the President's death in 1904, Frederik Christoffel Eloff, son-in-law of the President, purchased the Kruger House from the estate and registered it in the name of his son, Dirk Postma Eloff. In his absence, the house was rented out without his knowledge as a bed-and-breakfast under the name \"The Presidency.\" \nPresident Kruger was buried in Pretoria on December 16, 1904. The funeral service was held on the grounds, between the Kruger House and the Pretoria Reformed Church (GKSA) on the opposite side of the street. Starting in April 1920, the Kruger House was leased to the Bond of Afrikaanse Moeders, a midwives' training school, as a maternity ward. Many Afrikaners can therefore boast of having born in the Kruger House between 1920 and 1932.\nMeanwhile, opinion turned toward making the Kruger House a museum. When several of Kruger's belongings were secured from the Dordrechts Museum in the Netherlands and brought back to Pretoria, this only heightened the impetus; some of these items were originally exhibited in the Old National Cultural History Museum on Boom Street.\nThe house was officially opened as a museum on October 10, 1934, by Mr. Albert Kuit. People connected with the President, including Mrs. LJ Jacobz, Col. Hermanus Christiaan Bredell, Dr. A. Heymans, and Miss J. van Broekhuizen, donated valuable photographs and other personal mementoes. On April 6, 1936, the house was declared a National Heritage Site. A few outbuildings have been built since then to hold the large number of Kruger memorabilia, as well as an apartment and an office. In 1952, the South African Railways and Harbours Administration donated the President's personal train coach, which the Kruger House later exhibited in the garden under a canopy.\nThe Kruger House Museum has been entrusted to the National Cultural History and Open Air Museum (Afrikaans: Nasionale Kultuurhistoriese en Opelugmuseum or NASKO). October 10, 1984, the centennial of the house, was also the 50th anniversary of the house's museum status.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nhome page of the Kruger House Museum",

          "We were so surprised by the quality and information packed into the Kruger Museum (which is just behind his well-appointed home). Here you will learn about the Anglo-Boer War and the support that the Boers had from around the world in their \"stryd.\"",

          "This historic house is a very interesting place to visit, and the life of Pres. Paul Kruger is well reflected here. There are the everyday items he used and his train on display. If you like history, this place will be a good visit for you. It is also a really cheat option for",
          "Really interesting house with lots of memorabilia. Spent a good couple of hours walking round. Very well worth the visit.",
          "Paul Kruger is seen as a hero by many people also abroad. Suprisingly our (black) tour guise was very positive about the man. He had much respect for the way Kruger wanted to fight for the independance of his people. Unless they were the weakest party. That inspired him. Hm.",
          "The building seems to be almost in its original state i.e. it has not been restored for many years. While this gives it an unsurpassed authenticity, it also means it is in a fragile and vulnerable state. My advice would be to visit it sooner, rather than later.",

          "Although we didn't have very long for our visit it was very informative and there was plenty to see. Many of our party enjoyed the railway carriage but the history was of particular interest as few of us knew much about Paul Kruger and his legacy. There is a lot to see and it",

          "We are so used to the trappings of the present day that it is difficult to look at things of 100 years ago and realise that this was relative luxury of the time, although it all looks so \"simple\". Few of the items on display were actually owned by Kruger but they have done a",

          "Paul Kruger was a very interesting person but had the interests of people at heart including those of other races not only Afrikaners. He was perhaps known for the fact that he was raised whilst the Afrikaners were moving through the country and thus had no formal schooling.",

          "If you are very interested in this period of South African domination, you would likely find this interesting.",

          "Don't let the word 'house' mislead you - this house is big and the 'back yard' full of more things to see - including his famous train coach which served as a mobile office. What struck me most, is the contrast between the reception areas and the living areas. The reception",

          "The house tour is self- guided and reflects the down-to-earth character of the man. No evidence of the high life in this awkwardly designed official residence. Don't miss the early telephone ( his telephone number was apparently dial 1) and the icebox in the kitchen made in the",

          "Well, if you love the history of South Africa, you will love the history of Paul Kruger as he played such an important role for the country. A lovely outing. I wasnt busy at all when we visited. Nice things to see and in a very good condition. Worth visiting.",
          "The museum is very well-kept and tells the story of Paul Kruger with a great deal of memorabilia. As he is a direct relative I was excited and the museum didn't disappoint. It really takes you back in time to see how he lived in the day and how he related to other countries -",
          "This house was his residence in the early days of the old Zuid Afrikaanse Republiek. It is undergoing restoration inside, which was overdue. However, the house itself has artefacts and photos of his early and later life as President of the old Transvaal Republic. The two large",

        "wiki": "Melrose House is a stately mansion and museum located on Burgers Park in Pretoria, South Africa.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuilt in 1886 by the prosperous Pretoria businessman George Jesse Heys, it was named after the famous Melrose Abbey in Scotland. Melrose House gained fame during the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902) when Lord Roberts requisitioned it as the headquarters for the British forces after Pretoria was invaded in June 1900. For more than 18 months, instructions for the British forces in the field were issued from here. The use of the house as a military headquarters ended when the Treaty of Vereeniging, which ended the war, was signed there on 31 May 1902.\nThe Pretoria City Council purchased the house and its contents in 1967 for R300,000 for restoration, culminating in State President of South Africa Charles Robberts Swart opening it as a museum and declaring it a national heritage site on May 17, 1971.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nToday the elegant mansion is a historic house museum. It is an example of the transition from Victorian to Edwardian architectural styles and interiors.  The interior is characterised by colourful stained glass windows, paintings by English artists, carpets in rich colours, ornate ceilings and fireplaces, as well as valuable porcelain ornaments. The majority of these items belonged to the Heys family itself. Notably the museum contains the room and the table on which the Treaty of Vereeniging (which ended the Second Boer War) was signed. Annual antique markets are held on the premises.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nW\u00eareldspektrum, 1982, ISBN 0908409591, vol. 18, p. 114\nFisher, Roger C.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Faerie Glen Nature Reserve is a nature reserve at the western limit of the Bronberg in the east of Pretoria, South Africa. It formerly formed a part of the farm Hartbeespoort 304 which belonged to H. W. Struben. On old aerial photographs it is apparent that the flood plain was utilized for crop fields, while the remainder was used for cattle grazing. The reserve constitutes the western part of the Bronberg conservation area, which was declared in 1980. Its highest point is Renosterkop (1,468 m) in the northern part of the reserve.\n\n\n== Animal life ==\nThough the smaller mammals like mongooses, hedgehogs, hares, porcupines, Cape clawless otters, bushbabies and small-spotted genets are difficult to observe, one may find signs of their presence. In the winter of 2014 larger game was introduced, namely 16 impala, 9 red hartebeest and 5 Burchell's zebra. During late 2014 one common duiker was released in the reserve, the first spotted eagle-owl house was installed, and a first sighting of caracal was made. The leaf-feeding thrip Liothrips tractabilis, introduced from Argentina, was released in the reserve's flood plain in 2014 to combat the invasive pompom weed.\n\n\n== Birds ==\nSome 150 bird species have been recorded in the reserve. In terms of breeding habitat the grassy floodplain along the Moreleta spruit is especially important for a number of cisticola and widow species, and the riparian vegetation provides breeding habitat for a number of weaver species. The bushy slopes provide foraging habitat for boubous, tchagras and cuckooshrikes, while nightjars emerge at dusk to forage over the slopes and floodplain.\n\n\n== Moreleta Spruit ==\n\nA December 2014 assessment of the aquatic life in Moreleta Spruit indicated that it was in a critically modified state, and in poor condition with low biodiversity. The spruit now receives larger inflows than in the past, and greywater is diverted to the river from storm water systems, besides runoff from road surfaces and paved areas. The water quality has been negatively affected by oily road surfaces, lawn fertilizers, litter, constant sewage spills and illegal dumping of hazardous substances.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nAndesitic basalt of the Hekpoort formation is found along the Moreleta Spruit. It was formed in the early Proterozoic, more than 2 billion years ago. Open or filled vesicles, caused by dissolved magma gasses that effervesced from the lava, are evident on the surface of these rocks. Repeated mud flows were deposited over the andesite to form mudstone, which was folded by subsequent earth shocks. An intrusive diabase formation is visible half way up the hillside, interbedded in shale and quartzite along the Struben and Daspoort formations' contact zone. The prominent crest of the ridge consists of quartzite of the Daspoort formation. The formation is undisturbed since its formation, some 2.1 billion years ago, and traces left by water flowing over an ancient river bed are still to be seen. The quartzite layer is tilted to the north, towards a very large, ancient magma chamber to the north of the reserve.\n\n\n== Facilities and activities ==\nThe reserve has three trails, namely the Hadeda route of 2,3 km, the Acacia route of 3,2 km and the Kiepersol/Cussonia route of 4,2 km. Dogs are allowed only if kept on a leash, and if a dog permit is completed.\n\n\n== Admission fees and times ==\nVisitors of 13 and older pay an entrance fee of R15 each, and persons 60 years and older pay R6 each. Season tickets valid for 6 months are available at R165 to R200. Visiting hours are from 06:00 to 18:00 throughout the year.\n\n\n== Community ==\nThe Friends of the Faerie Glen Nature Reserve is an organization that coordinates activities that promote the well-being of the reserve. They meet at regular intervals to eradicate some of the invasive plant species, or to remove litter from the reserve.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nFaerie Glen Nature Reserve www.tshwane.gov.za Media related to Faerie Glen Nature Reserve at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "The Austin Roberts (Memorial) Bird Sanctuary is a 11.76 ha (29.1 acres) nature reserve located in the Walkerspruit Open Space System, in the Nieuw Muckleneuk suburb of Pretoria, South Africa. It became the first bird refuge in Pretoria when it was opened by the then mayor of Pretoria, Mr. W. J. Seymore, on 27 October 1956. It was officially proclaimed as a nature reserve on 26 February 1958, and it was fenced in June 1970.The sanctuary is named after South Africa's well-known ornithologist and mammalogist, J. Austin Roberts. He was born in Pretoria in 1883, but grew up in Potchefstroom as a minister's son, where the local amateur ornithologist, Thomas Ayres, was his mentor.\n\n\n== Access ==\nFree access is limited to the bird hide, which is reached from the northern perimeter, where a small exhibition facility is located. It has been declared a provincial heritage site due to its recreational and educational value.\n\n\n== Habitat ==\nA former clay quarry at the confluence of Walker and Argo Spruit was allowed to fill with water, and some exotic trees were planted along its verges. In addition nine small perennial dams or wetland basins have been created, some with artificial islands, to accommodate aquatic birds and animals. The natural veld type of the sanctuary is mixed bushveld.\n\n\n== Bird species ==\nUpwards of 170 native bird species have been recorded, but the presence or breeding of some have been transient, due to urbanization and other factors. Resident or visiting passerine birds include thick-billed weaver, southern red bishop, African reed-warbler, little rush-warbler and lesser swamp-warbler. Various heron species visit the reserve, including black-crowned night-heron, little bittern, green-backed heron, purple heron, black and little egret. Other regular water birds are red-knobbed coot, fulvous duck, Egyptian goose, white-faced duck, Cape teal and southern pochard. Pinioned crowned cranes and blue cranes have been released into the reserve, and some exotic duck species are present.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n Media related to Austin Roberts bird sanctuary at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "The Union Buildings form the official seat of the South African Government and also house the offices of the President of South Africa. The imposing buildings are located in Pretoria, atop Meintjieskop at the northern end of Arcadia, close to historic Church Square and the Voortrekker Monument. The large gardens of the Buildings are nestled between Government Avenue, Vermeulen Street East, Church Street, the R104 and Blackwood Street. Fairview Avenue is a closed road where only officials can enter to the Union Buildings. Though not in the centre of Pretoria, the Union Buildings occupy the highest point of Pretoria, and constitute a South African national heritage site.The Buildings are one of the centres of political life in South Africa; \"The Buildings\" and \"Arcadia\" have become metonyms for the South African government. It has become an iconic landmark of Pretoria and South Africa in general, and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city and an emblem of democracy.\nThe Buildings are the location of presidential inaugurations.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThese buildings, built from light sandstone, were designed by the architect Sir Herbert Baker in the English monumental style and are 285 m long. They have a semi-circular shape, with the two wings at the sides, this serves to represent the union of a formerly divided people. The clock chimes are identical to those of Big Ben in London. The east and west wings, as well as the twin-domed towers, represent two languages, English and Afrikaans, and the inner court was designed and built to symbolise the Union of South Africa. These buildings are considered by many to be the architect's greatest achievement and a South African architectural masterpiece. The Nelson Mandela statue in Sandton City's Nelson Mandela Square was commissioned originally to stand on the spot where Nelson Mandela gave his inaugural address.The building was sited on a disused quarry, which now makes up the amphitheatre. The matching statues on top of the domed towers are Atlas, holding up the world, sculpted by Abraham Broadbent. The statue on the domed rostrum in the amphitheatre between the wings is Mercury, a mythic Roman messenger and a god of trade, sculpted by George Ness. The closest suburb to the Union Buildings is Arcadia, which means \"Playground of Gods\". Pretoria has the second largest number of embassies in the world, after Washington, D.C., most of which are located in or near Arcadia.\n\nThe design of each level differs, and therefore each stone had to be individually cut. The Architectural styles of the building ranges from the lower levels' Edwardian style to the top levels' Cape Dutch design with shutters on the windows. The windows from bottom to top are elongated and become shorter towards the top floor. This is to give the illusion of height.\nThe Union Buildings are the site of presidential inaugurations. The official offices of the president are on the left-hand side of the Union Buildings, and the South African national flag is flown on the left-hand side if the president is in office.The Buildings are divided into three sections; the left offices, amphitheatre, and right offices. All are 95 metres in length. Each offices block contains three inner courtyards providing light and air to the offices. Each block has a basement and three floors above ground. The central curved building behind the colonnade houses the committee rooms, a library and conference rooms while the basement contains the kitchen, dining rooms and lounges.\nThe interior is treated in the Cape Dutch style: carved teak fanlights, heavy doors, dark ceiling beams contrasting with white plaster walls and heavy wood furniture.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Boer Republics of the ZAR and the Orange Free State were united with the Cape Colony and Natal Colony in 1910 to become the Union of South Africa. Pretoria then became the administrative capital of the whole of South Africa, with Cape Town the legislative capital. Between 1860 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of Transvaal, superseding Potchefstroom in that role. The new Union required a governmental building which could signify unity and host the new government.\nMarthinus Wessel Pretorius, later to become first president of the Transvaal Republic, was the original owner of the farm 'Elandsfontein' on which Meintjieskop stands. In 1856 Andries Francois du Toit (1813\u20131883), in exchange for a Basotho pony, acquired part of the farm, which he named 'Arcadia' and on which the Union Buildings were later constructed. He was also Pretoria's first magistrate and was responsible for the layout of the city. During this period he sold his land to Stephanus Jacobus Meintjies (1819\u20131887), after whom the hill is named.\nIn 1909 Herbert Baker was commissioned to design the Government Building of the Union of South Africa (which was formed on 31 May 1910) in Pretoria. Pretoria was to become the administrative centre for the new government. In November 1910 the cornerstone of the Union Building was laid.\nLord Selborne and H.C. Hull, a member of the first Union Cabinet, chose Meintjieskop as the site for Baker's design. The site was that of a disused quarry and the existing excavations were used to create the amphitheatre, which was set about with ornamental pools, fountains, sculptures, balustrades and trees.\n\nThe design consisted of two identical wings, joined by a semicircular colonnade forming the backdrop of the amphitheatre. The colonnade was terminated on either side by a tower. Each wing had a basement and three floors above ground. The interiors were created in the Cape Dutch style with carved teak fanlights, heavy doors, dark ceiling beams contrasting with white plaster walls and heavy wood furniture. Baker used indigenous materials as far as possible. The granite was quarried on site while Buiskop sandstone was used for the courtyards. Stinkwood and Rhodesian teak were used for timber and wood panelling. The roof tiles and quarry tiles for the floors were made in Vereeniging.\nThe cornerstone was laid in November 1910, shortly after the Union of South Africa \u2013 for which the buildings are named \u2013 was formed. Taking 1,265 workers over three years to build, the structure was completed in 1913 at a total cost of \u00a31,310,640 for the building and \u00a3350,000 for the site.\nDesigned by Sir Herbert Baker in 1908, building began in 1909 and was completed in 1913. It took approximately 1265 artisans, workmen and labourers almost three years to construct, using 14 million bricks for the interior office walls, half a million cubic feet of freestone, 74 000 cubic yards of concrete, 40 000 bags of cement and 20 000 cubic feet of granite.\nOriginally built to house the entire Public Service for the Union of South Africa, it was then the largest building in the country and possibly the largest building work undertaken in the Southern Hemisphere at that time.\nSeveral other sites were considered, including Muckleneuk Ridge, on the opposite side of the city, and Pretorius Square, in the centre of Pretoria, where the City Hall now stands. However, Herbert Baker was strongly in favour of Meintjieskop, which was within a mile of the centre of Pretoria and reminded him strongly of some of the acropolises of Greece and Asia Minor, where he had studied Mediterranean architecture.\nThe concept of an acropolis and a building that agreed with renowned British Architect Sir Christopher Wren's theory that a public building should be a national ornament which establishes a nation, draws people and commerce and makes people love their country easily persuaded the then powers that be, who were at the time, preoccupied with the ideal of establishing a new and united nation.\nThe British high commissioner at the time, Lord Selborne, remarked;\n\nPeople will come from all over the world to wonder at the beauty of the site and to admire the forethought and courage of the men who selected it.\n\nThe design of the buildings was largely determined by the nature of the site. Baker envisaged identical wings of rectangular office blocks, each representing one of the two official languages. They were to be linked by a semicircular wing, and the space in-between the two wings was levelled to bring form an amphitheatre as in the Greek fashion for gatherings of national and ceremonial importance.\nBaker wanted the buildings to be built of imported granite, but any idea of using anything but South African stone for the most important government building of the new state was unthinkable to those who commissioned it, as a result, the terraces and retaining walls in the grounds are built predominantly of mountain stone quarried on site, the foundation of the building is of granite, while freestone was used for the exterior walls, the amphitheatre and major courtyards.\nFor the overall design of the building, Baker chose the neo-classic architecture of the Italian Renaissance, and also combined an idiom of the English Renaissance, as well as significant elements of Cape Dutch detail, such as in the carved main doorways and fanlights and in much of the wrought-iron brass work and balustrades of the smaller areas.\n\n\n=== Historical events ===\nOn 9 August 1956, 20,000 women marched to the doors of the Union Buildings, chanting \"Wathint' Abafazi, wathint' imbokodo!\" which means \"strike the women, strike the rock\", to protest against the pass laws of 1950. This historical event is commemorated by the public holiday National Women's Day.\nWilma Cruise and Marcus Holmes were approached to design a memorial to commemorate the Women's March. They made use of the \"imbokodo\". The imbokodo is a grinding stone used by the women to grind maize. Cruise and Holmes, rested the imbokodo, representing nurture and sustenance, on bronze plates, representing the earth and fire. There are two sets of stairs leading to the memorial, and on each step, raised in bronzed letters are the words from 'The Demand of the Women of South Africa for the Withdrawal of Passes for Women and Repeal of the Pass Laws.' On approaching the imbokodo, you will trigger infrared beams, which activates history's \"whispered voices\", echoed in all 11 official languages, the rally cry, repeated softly.In 1986, significant restoration of the Union Buildings was undertaken by Johan de Ridder and T.W. Baker as the appointed architects.On 10 May 1994, the inauguration of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first democratically elected president after the end of Apartheid, and his vice-presidents, heralded the beginning of a new era in South Africa's history.Part of Nelson Mandela's inaugural address:\n\n\"Today, all of us do, by our presence here, and by our celebrations in other parts of our country and the world, confer glory and hope to newborn liberty.\nOut of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a society of which all humanity will be proud.\nOur daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an actual South African reality that will reinforce humanity's belief in justice, strengthen its confidence in the nobility of the human soul and sustain all our hopes for a glorious life for all.\nAll this we owe both to ourselves and to the peoples of the world who are so well represented here today.\n.......\nWe understand it still that there is no easy road to freedom.\nWe know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve success.\nWe must therefore act together as a united people, for national reconciliation, for nation building, for the birth of a new world.\nLet there be justice for all.\nLet there be peace for all.\nLet there be work, bread, water and salt for all.\nLet each know that for each the body, the mind and the soul have been freed to fulfill themselves.\nNever, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world.\nLet freedom reign.\nThe sun shall never set on so glorious a human achievement!\n\nLet us as a Rainbow nation keep this in focus and move forward!\" \nOn 31 December 1999 the South African flagship Millennium celebration was held here. In attendance was the then deputy president Jacob Zuma, and other ministers.\nOn 10 December 2013, the Union Buildings Amphitheatre was renamed the Nelson Mandela Amphitheatre.On 16 December 2013, a 9-metre high bronze statue of Mandela was unveiled at the Union Buildings.\n\n\n== Gardens and grounds ==\n\nThe building is surrounded by beautifully terraced gardens of indigenous plants. Various monuments adorn the expansive lawns, including the Delville Wood War Memorial and a statue of the country's first Prime Minister, General The Rt Hon. Louis Botha.\n\nThe lawn in front of the Union Buildings are often the location for public gatherings, whether they be protest or celebration, such as the presidential inauguration.Notable are the terraced gardens, planted exclusively with indigenous plants, surrounding the buildings as well as the 9,000 seat Nelson Mandela amphitheatre.\n\n\n=== Statues and memorials ===\nWithin the grounds are various monuments, statues and memorials. Starting at the bottom of the gardens, a large statue of General Louis Botha (first prime minister of the Union of South Africa) on horseback dominates the lawn.\n\nAbout halfway up the terraces, the Delville Wood War Memorial is a tribute to South African troops who died during the First World War as well as a plaque in memory of those that died during the Korean War.\nTwo levels above that is a statue of President Nelson Mandela. This replaced the statue of General J.B.M. Hertzog, a former Prime Minister, which can still be found on the grounds.\nThe South African Police Memorial is located at the top right of the gardens.\nThe South African National Film, Video and Sound Archives is also located in the grounds of the Union Buildings, adjacent to the Police Memorial.\n\n\n== Laws governing the buildings ==\nBecause of the significance of the Voortrekker Monument and the Union Buildings in the national consciousness, a law in Pretoria limits the height of any building between the Voortrekker Monument and the Union Buildings such that the view between them remains unobstructed.\n\n\n== Powers and duties ==\nThe Union Buildings share duties with Cape Town as the seat of the South African Government. Pretoria shares duties with Cape Town and Bloemfontein as the capital cities of South Africa.\nThe official seats of the President are the Union Buildings in Pretoria and the Tuynhuys in Cape Town.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPretoria\nSir Herbert Baker\nHouses of Parliament, Cape Town\nSupreme Court of Appeal of South Africa\nRashtrapati Bhavan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOffice of the President of South Africa\n360 degree Virtual Tour of the Union Buildings\n50th Anniversary of the 1956 Woman's March \u2013 with pics of the original event\nSite by The Union Buildings Complex, at SAHRA",

        "wiki": "The University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg (), is a multi-campus South African public research university situated in the northern areas of central Johannesburg. It is more commonly known as Wits University or Wits ( or ). The university has its roots in the mining industry, as do Johannesburg and the Witwatersrand in general. Founded in 1896 as the South African School of Mines in Kimberley, it is the third oldest South African university in continuous operation.\nThe university has an enrolment of 40,259 students as of 2018, of which approximately 20 percent live on campus in the university's 17 residences. 63 percent of the university's total enrolment is for undergraduate study, with 35 percent being postgraduate and the remaining 2 percent being Occasional Students.The 2017 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) places Wits University, with its overall score, as the highest ranked university in Africa. Wits was ranked as the top university in South Africa in the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) in 2016. According to the CWUR rankings, Wits occupies this ranking position since 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years: 1896\u20131922 ===\nThe university was founded in Kimberley in 1896 as the South African School of Mines. It is the third oldest South African university in continuous operation, after the University of Cape Town (founded in 1829), and Stellenbosch University (founded in 1866).. Eight years later, in 1904, the school was moved to Johannesburg and renamed the Transvaal Technical Institute. The school's name changed yet again in 1906 to Transvaal University College. In 1908, a new campus of the Transvaal University College was established in Pretoria. The Johannesburg and Pretoria campuses separated on 17 May 1910, each becoming a separate institution. The Johannesburg campus was reincorporated as the South African School of Mines and Technology, while the Pretoria campus remained the Transvaal University College until 1930 when it became the University of Pretoria. In 1920, the school was renamed the University College, Johannesburg.\n\n\n=== Open years: 1922\u20131959 ===\nFinally, on 1 March 1922, the University College, Johannesburg, was granted full university status after being incorporated as the University of the Witwatersrand. The Johannesburg municipality donated a site in Milner Park, north-west of Braamfontein, to the new institution as its campus and construction began the same year, on 4 October. The first Chancellor of the new university was Prince Arthur of Connaught and the first Principal (a position that would be merged with that of Vice-Chancellor in 1948) was Professor Jan Hofmeyr. Hofmeyr set the tone of the university's subsequent opposition to apartheid when, during his inaugural address as Principal he declared, while discussing the nature of a university and its desired function in a democracy, that universities \"should know no distinctions of class, wealth, race or creed\". True to Hofmeyr's words, from the outset Wits was an open university with a policy of non-discrimination on racial or any other grounds.Initially, there were six faculties\u2014Arts, Science, Medicine, Engineering, Law and Commerce\u201437 departments, 73 academic staff, and approximately 1,000 students. In 1923, the university began moving into the new campus, slowly vacating its former premises on Ellof Street for the first completed building in Milner Park: the Botany and Zoology Block. In 1925, the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII) officially opened Central Block (which includes the Great Hall).The university's first library, housed at the time in what was meant to be a temporary construction, was destroyed in a fire on Christmas Eve in 1931. Following this, an appeal was made to the public for \u20a480,000 to pay for the construction of a new library, and the acquisition of books. This resulted in the fairly rapid construction of the William Cullen Library; opened in 1934. During this period, as the Great Depression hit South Africa, the university was faced with severe financial restrictions. Nonetheless, it continued to grow at an impressive rate. From a total enrolment of 2,544 students in 1939, the university grew to 3,100 in 1945. This growth led to accommodation problems, which were temporarily resolved by the construction of wood and galvanised-iron huts in the centre of the campus (which remained in use until 1972).During World War II, Wits was involved in South Africa's war efforts. The Bernard Price Institute of Geophysical Research was placed under the Union of South Africa's defence ministry, and was involved in important research into the use of radar. Additionally, an elite force of female soldiers was trained on the university's campus.In 1948 the National Party (NP) was voted into power by South Africa's white electorate on a platform of \"apartheid\" (Afrikaans for \"separateness\"). The NP's aim was to create an artificial white majority in most of South Africa by depriving the black majority of their citizenship, making them citizens of the \"homelands\" associated with their ethnic groups instead. These were, in theory, \"self-governing\", and in four cases were later granted \"independence\". But in reality, their lack of economic infrastructure left even the supposedly independent homelands as little more than South African puppet states. This policy of \"grand apartheid\" was accompanied by the extension of racially discriminatory measures within so-called \"white South Africa\", including the segregation of universities. Wits initially managed to remain an open institution, but by 1956 the NP government began to seriously push for the full implementation of university apartheid. In response, in 1957, Wits, the University of Cape Town, Rhodes University and the University of Natal issued a joint statement entitled \"The Open Universities in South Africa\", committing themselves to the principles of university autonomy and academic freedom.In 1959, the apartheid government's Extension of University Education Act forced restricted registrations of black students for most of the apartheid era; despite this, several notable black leaders graduated from the university. Wits protested strongly and continued to maintain a firm and consistent stand in opposition to apartheid. This marked the beginning of a period of conflict with the apartheid regime, which also coincided with a period of massive growth for the university.It was desegregated once again, prior to the abolition of apartheid, in 1990. Several of apartheid's most provocative critics, of either European or African descent, were one-time students and graduates of the university.\n\n\n=== Growth and opposition to apartheid: 1959\u20131994 ===\n\nAs the university continued to grow (from a mere 6,275 students in 1963, to 10,600 in 1975, to over 16,400 by 1985), the expansion of the university's campus became imperative. In 1964, the medical library and administrative offices of the Faculty of Medicine moved to Esselen Street, in the Hillbrow district of Johannesburg. In 1968, the Graduate School of Business was opened in Parktown. A year later, the Ernest Oppenheimer Hall of Residence and Savernake, the new residence of the Vice-Chancellor (replacing Hofmeyr House on the main campus) were both established, also in Parktown. That same year, the Medical School's new clinical departments were opened.During the course of the 1960s, Wits acquired a limestone cave renowned for its archaeological material located at Sterkfontein. A farm next to Sterkfontein named Swartkrans rich in archaeological material was purchased in 1968, and excavation rights were obtained for archaeological and palaeontological purposes at Makapansgat, located in Limpopo Province.The 1960s also witnessed widespread protest against apartheid policies. This resulted in numerous police invasions of campus to break up peaceful protests, as well as the banning, deportation and detention of many students and staff. Government funding for the university was cut, with funds originally meant for Wits often being channelled to the more conservative Afrikaans universities instead. Nonetheless, in the words of Clive Chipkin, the \"university environment was filled with deep contradictions\", and the university community was by no means wholly united in opposition to apartheid. This stemmed from the Wits Council being dominated by \"highly conservative members representing mining and financial interests\", and was compounded by the fact that the mining industry provided major financial support for the university. With a strongly entrenched \"[c]olonial mentality\" at Wits, along with \"high capitalism, the new liberalism and communism of a South African kind, combined with entrenched white settler mores (particularly in the Engineering and Science faculties) ... the university ... was an arena of conflicting positions generally contained within polite academic conventions\".\nThe University of the Witwatersrand is dedicated to the acquisition, advancement and imparting of knowledge through the pursuit of truth in free and open debate, in the undertaking of research, in scholarly discourse and in balanced, dispassionate teaching. We reject any external interference designed to diminish our freedom to attain these ends. We record our solemn protest against the intention of the Government, through the threat of financial sanctions, to force the University to become the agent of Government policy in disciplining its members. We protest against the invasion of the legitimate authority of the University. We protest against the proposed stifling of legitimate dissent. In the interests of all in this land, and in the knowledge of the justice of our cause, we dedicate ourselves to unremitting opposition to these intended restraints and to the restoration of our autonomy.\nThe 1970s saw the construction of Jubilee Hall and the Wartenweiler Library, as well as the opening of the Tandem Accelerator; the first, and to date only, nuclear facility at a South African university. In 1976, Lawson's Corner in Braamfontein was acquired and renamed University Corner. Senate House, the university's main administrative building, was completed in 1977. The university underwent a significant expansion programme in the 1980s. The Medical School was moved to new premises on York Street in Parktown on 30 August 1982. Additionally, in 1984 the University acquired the Milner Park showgrounds from the Witwatersrand Agricultural Society. These became West Campus, with the original campus becoming East Campus. In 1984, the Chamber of Mines building opened. A large walkway named the Amic Deck was constructed across the De Villiers Graaff Motorway which bisects the campus, linking East Campus with West Campus.The 1980s also witnessed a period of heightened opposition to apartheid, as the university struggled to maintain its autonomy in the face of attacks from the apartheid state. Wits looked anew to the \"Open Universities\" statement of 1957, to which the University of the Western Cape now also added its voice. As the apartheid government attempted, through the threat of financial sanctions, to bring Wits under firmer control, protest escalated culminating in the General Assembly of 28 October 1987, at which the university reiterated its commitment to the values underlying the \"Open Universities\" statement.University management itself came under increasing grassroots pressure to implement change within the university. A Wits-initiated research project, Perspectives of Wits (POW), published in 1986, revealed a surprising disconnect between the perceptions disadvantaged communities had of Wits and the image Wits had been attempting to convey of itself as a progressive opponent of apartheid. POW, which had involved interviews with members of organisations among disadvantaged communities in the PWV area, international academics, students and staff at Wits, and even a meeting with the then-banned ANC in Lusaka, revealed that to many in the surrounding disadvantaged communities, there was a perception of Wits as an elitist institution dominated by white interests. A need was identified for further transformation of the university.However, instead of translating POW's proposals into institutional plans for transformation, Wits reacted in a defensive manner and refused to even acknowledge many of the criticisms that had been raised. Within the university community the perception was different\u2014it was felt that Wits was on the right track. The contradiction between internal and external perceptions would increasingly undermine the unity of the university community, as progressive elements on campus began to take more radical positions in opposition to apartheid. Internal debates about, among other things, the international academic boycott of South Africa and the role of academics in the anti-apartheid struggle led to increasing division within the university. University management was increasingly seen as isolated and out of touch, and began to be referred to by the metonym \"the eleventh floor\", referring to the eleventh floor of Senate House where top management at Wits is located.Nonetheless, the university community in general continued to uphold its opposition to apartheid and its commitment to university autonomy and academic freedom. The remainder of the 1980s saw numerous protests on campus, which often ended with police invasions of the university. In 1990, when Nelson Mandela was released, the students of Men's Res, on East Campus, unofficially renamed the lawn outside their residence \"Mandela Square\".\n\n\n=== Post-apartheid: 1994\u2013present ===\nOn 25 February 2000, university management began implementing a policy called \"Wits 2001\" under which work deemed 'non-core' to the functioning of the university (such as cleaning and landscaping) was outsourced to external contractors; the university's academic departments were also restructured: the university's nine faculties were reduced to five, the university's 99 departments were merged into 40 schools, and courses that were deemed redundant following a mass review were cancelled. Wits management did, however, initiate programmes to ameliorate some of the negative effects of Wits 2001. These included the implementation of early retirement and voluntary severance packages to minimise retrenchments. Additionally, many of the affected employees' children were studying at Wits at the time, and received bursaries as part of their parents' employment contracts with Wits. The university therefore continued to offer bursaries to them until the completion of the degrees for which they were then enrolled, as well as offering bursaries to the children of affected employees who matriculated in 2000.Wits 2001 attracted widespread criticism from the workers and staff affected, as well as from students and other staff. The arguments behind the restructuring were criticised as badly reasoned, and the policy itself was criticised as being regressive and neoliberal. The then-vice-chancellor, Professor Colin Bundy, said in defence of Wits 2001 that \"[t]his fundamental reorganisation of both academic activities and support services will equip the university for the challenges of higher education in the 21st Century\". Management issued a statement on 30 May 2000 responding to criticism of Wits 2001 from the National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (NEHAWU), the largest trade union among Wits employees, in which it defended Wits 2001 as constituting the \"outsourcing [of] contracts for certain non-core functions, rather than any shift in ownership relations or governance\" contra NEHAWU's claims that it constituted privatisation. Management further defended the changes as \"improving the financial sustainability of Wits, taking pressure off management and students, and allowing for better academic and support facilities and services\". Along with \"Igoli 2002\" in Johannesburg, Wits 2001 was one of the policies implemented in the early 2000s which resulted in the formation of the Anti-Privatisation Forum (APF).\nIn 2001, the Johannesburg College of Education was incorporated into the university as Wits Education Campus under the national Department of Education's plan to reform tertiary education in South Africa. In 2003, a student mall, called the Matrix, was opened in the Student Union Building on East Campus.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe current coat of arms of the university was designed by Professor G. E. Pearse, and edited by Professor W. D. Howie to correct heraldic inaccuracies, before being accepted by the State Herald of South Africa in 1972. The design of the coat of arms incorporates a gold background in the upper section of the shield to represent the Witwatersrand gold fields \u2013 on which the mining industry that gave rise to the university is based \u2013 along with an open book superimposed upon a cogwheel, representing knowledge and industry. The silver wavy bars on the lower section of the shield represent the Vaal and Limpopo rivers which form the northern and southern borders of the Witwatersrand gold fields. Above the shield is the head of a Kudu, an antelope typical of the Witwatersrand and the university's mascot. The university's motto, \"Scientia et Labore\", meaning \"Through Knowledge and Work\" in Latin, appears just below the shield.\n\nThe university's coat of arms evolved from the badge of the South African School of Mines. This badge consisted of a diamond with a shield superimposed upon it. A prospector's pick and a sledge hammer overlaid with broken ore and a mill appeared on the shield. The South African School of Mine's motto was the same as the university's current one, and surrounded the shield.\n\n\n== Governance and administration ==\n\nAs set out in the Higher Education Act (Act No. 101 of 1997) and in the Statute of the University of the Witwatersrand, the university is governed by Council. The Chancellor of the university is the ceremonial head of the University who, in the name of the university, confers all degrees. The positions of Principal and Vice-Chancellor are merged, with the Vice-Chancellor responsible for the day-to-day running of the university and accountable to Council. Council is responsible for the selection of all Vice-Chancellors, Deputy Vice-Chancellors and Deans of Faculty.The responsibility for regulating all teaching, research and academic functions of the university falls on Senate. Additionally, the interests of the university's students are represented by the Students' Representative Council (SRC), which also selects representatives to Senate and Council.\n\n\n== Campuses ==\n\nThe university is divided into five academic campuses, the main administrative campus is East Campus. Across the De Villiers Graaff Motorway lies West Campus. The two are joined by a brick-paved walkway across the highway called the Amic Deck. East and West Campus effectively form a single campus, bordered by Empire Road to the north, Jan Smuts Avenue to the east, Jorrissen Street and Enoch Sontonga Road to the south and Annet Road to the west. The historic East Campus is primarily the home of the faculties of Science and Humanities, as well as the University Council, Senate and management. West Campus houses the faculties of Engineering and the Built Environment, and Commerce, Law and Management. East Campus is home to four residences, namely Men's Res (male), Sunnyside (female), International House (mixed) and Jubilee Hall (female). West Campus is home to the Barnato and David Webster Halls and West Campus Village (all mixed).Wits has three more academic campuses, all located in Parktown. Wits Education Campus (WEC) houses the school of education, within the Faculty of Humanities. WEC boasts three female residences, forming the Highfield cluster, namely Girton, Medhurst and Reith Hall. East of WEC (across York Road), lies Wits Medical Campus which is the administration and academic centre of the Faculty of Health Sciences. West of WEC (across Victoria Avenue) lies the Wits Management Campus, with the Wits Business School. Within the Wits Management Campus are the Ernest Oppenheimer Hall (male residence) and the mixed Parktown Village.\nThere are centres that are not academic although referred to by the university as campuses. These are Graduate Lodge, Campus Lodge, South Court and Braamfontein Centre; all in the city district of Braamfontein and all mixed gender. Furthermore, there is the Wits Junction (mixed) and the Knockando Halls of Residence (a male residence located on the grounds of a Parktown mansion called Northwards) in Parktown, and the mixed Esselen Street Residence in Hillbrow.\n\n\n== Sites ==\n\n\n=== Provincial heritage sites and heritage objects ===\nThe University of the Witwatersrand houses two provincial heritage sites and two heritage objects. The Great Hall (technically the fa\u00e7ade of the Robert Sobukwe Building, formerly known as Central Block, in which the Great Hall is located), and the Dias Cross housed in the William Cullen Library are both provincial heritage sites. They were formerly national monuments, until 1 April 2000 when the National Monuments Council was replaced by a new system which made former national monuments the responsibility of provincial governments following the passage of the National Heritage Resources Act. The heritage objects are Jan Smuts' study, housed in Jan Smuts House, and the Paul Loewenstein Collection of rock art. All of the university's national heritage sites and objects are located on East Campus.\n\n\n=== Wits Institute of Social and Economic Research (WiSER) ===\nThe University of the Witwatersrand is home to the Wits Institute of Social and Economic Research (WiSER), founded in 2001 by Deborah Posel.\n\n\n=== Cradle of Humankind ===\n\nWits acquired the Sterkfontein and Swartkrans sites in the 1960s, both of which were rich in fossil remains of early hominids. In 1999, the area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as the Cradle of Humankind. As a World Heritage Site, responsibility for the site shifted from the university to the government of Gauteng Province, with the provincial government becoming the designated management authority responsible for developing and protecting the site. It is aided by the South African Heritage Resources Agency, which has also declared the area a national heritage site. The University's archaeology and palaeontology departments, within the School of Geosciences of the Faculty of Science, continue to play a leading part in excavations of the site; and Wits retains ownership of Sterkfontein's intellectual rights. Professor Lee Berger discovered Australopithecus sediba (2010) and Homo naledi (2015) at the site.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe university hosts at least fourteen museums. These include the Adler Museum of Medicine, the Palaeontology Museum and the only Geology Museum in Gauteng Province. The displays include a vast spectra not limited to the Taung skull, various dinosaur fossils and butterflies.\n\n\n=== Rock art ===\nThe Roberts-Pager Collection of Khoisan rock art copies is located in the Van Riet Lowe building on East Campus.\n\n\n=== Johannesburg Planetarium ===\n\nThe Johannesburg Planetarium was the first full-sized planetarium in Africa and the second in the Southern Hemisphere. It was originally bought by the Johannesburg municipality to be set up as part of the celebration of the city's seventieth anniversary. After acquiring an old projector from the Hamburg Planetarium, which was modernised before being shipped to South Africa, the municipality sold the projector to the university for use as both an academic facility for the instruction of students, and as a public amenity. Plans for a new building to house the projector were first drawn up in 1958, and construction began in 1959. The planetarium finally opened on 12 October 1960. The Johannesburg Planetarium is often consulted by the media, and the public, in order to explain unusual occurrences in the skies over South Africa. In 2010, the Johannesburg Planetarium celebrated its golden jubilee.\n\n\n=== Wits Art Museum ===\nThe museum's collection started in the 1950s and has since grown substantially. In 1972 the Gertrude Posel Gallery was established on the ground floor of Senate House on East Campus. It was joined in 1992 by the Studio Gallery which formed the \"lower gallery\" reserved for the display of African art. The galleries' collections grew steadily, with the Studio Gallery becoming renowned for having one of the best collections of African beadwork in the world, and by 2002 it was decided that more space was needed. Thus, the Gertrude Posel Gallery and the Studio Galley were closed. The ground floor of University Corner was selected as the site for the new Wits Art Museum, which now houses the collections after it was completed and launched in 2012.\n\n\n=== Wits Theatre ===\n\nThe Wits Theatre is a performing arts complex within the university, although it also caters for professional companies, dance studios and schools. It is run by the university's Performing Arts Administration (PAA). Prior to the opening of the Wits Theatre, the Wits Schools of Dramatic Art and Music had been staging productions in a building on campus called the Nunnery, a former convent. The Nunnery has been retained as a teaching venue.\n\n\n=== Wits Centre for Diversity Studies (WiCDS) ===\n\nThe Wits Centre for Diversity Studies (WiCDS) was established in 2014 at the University of Witwatersrand. It is based in the Faculty of Humanities and aims to build capacity to meet the challenges of diverse societies, especially in post-apartheid South Africa through interdisciplinary postgraduate education and research.\n\n\n== Academics ==\n\n\n=== Research ===\nWits University is the home to 28 South African Research Initiative (SARChI) Chairs and six DST-NRF Centres of Excellence. There are just more than 423 NRF rated researchers, of which 28 are \u2018international leading scholars\u2019 in their research fields, or so called A-rated researchers. The University also has a wide range of research entities including 10 national Centres of Excellence.\n\n\n=== Faculties ===\nThe university consists of five faculties: Commerce,Law and Management, Engineering and the Built Environment, Health Sciences, Humanities and Science.\n\n\n==== Commerce, Law, and Management ====\nThis Faculty currently offers various undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in accountancy, economics, management, and law. The faculty participates in the WitsPlus programme, a part-time programme for students, and is based in the Commerce, Law and Management Building on West Campus.\n\n\n==== Engineering and the Built Environment ====\n\nThis Faculty is made up of 7 schools being: Architecture & Planning, Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, Civil & Environmental Engineering, Construction Economics & Management, Electrical & Information Engineering, Mechanical, Industrial & Aeronautical Engineering and Mining Engineering. The faculty is based in the Chamber Of Mines Building on West Campus, which houses the faculty office and the Engineering Library. The School of Civil & Environmental Engineering and Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering are located in the Hillman and Richard Ward Buildings on the East Campus respectively.\n\n\n==== Health Sciences ====\nThis Faculty is based on the Wits Medical Campus in Parktown. This Faculty uses the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, the Charlotte Maxeke Hospital, the Helen Joseph Hospital, and the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital as its teaching hospitals. The Dean of the Faculty is Professor Martin Veller. The faculty offers undergraduate degrees in dentistry, medicine, medical and health sciences, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and pharmacy. It also runs a graduate entry medical programme, masters courses (science and medicine) and a PhD programme.\n\n\n==== Humanities ====\n\nThis Faculty is based in the South West Engineering Building on East Campus and consists of the schools of Social Sciences, Literature and Language Studies, Human and Community Development, Arts, and Education.\n\n\n==== Science ====\n\nThe Faculty is based in the Mathematical Sciences Building within the Wits Science Stadium on Braamfontein Campus West and consists of the schools of Animal, Plant and Environmental Sciences; Chemistry; Physics; Molecular and Cell Biology; Geography, Archaeology and Environmental Studies; Geosciences; Mathematics; Statistics and Actuarial Science and School of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThe University of the Witwatersrand Library Service consists of two main libraries, the Warteinweiler and William Cullen libraries on East Campus and twelve branch libraries. The Wartenweiler Library primarily serves the Faculty of Humanities. It also contains the Library Administration, Library Computer Services and Technical Services departments as well as the Short Loan collection, the Reference collection, Inter-library Loans department, the Multimedia Library, and the Education and Training department as well as the Electronic Classroom. The William Cullen Library contains the Africana collection, specialising in social, political and economic history. It also contains the Early and Fine Printed Books collection, which includes the Incunabula (books printed before 1501). Finally, it also contains a collection of Government Publications and journals in the arts, humanities and social sciences.The branch libraries are:\n\nThe Martienssen Library For The Built Environment, which serves the schools of architecture and planning and construction management within the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment. It is located in the John Moffat Building (also known as the Architecture Building) on East Campus.\nThe Biological & Physical Sciences Library which is situated in the Oppenheimer Life Sciences Building on East Campus and serves the Faculty of Science, together with the Geomaths Library.\nThe Commerce Library which, along with the Wits Library of Management, serves the schools of commerce and management. It is located to the west of the Tower of Light on West Campus.\nThe Education Library (also known as the Harold Holmes Library) which is located on Wits Education Campus in Parktown and serves the school of education within the Faculty of Humanities.\nThe Engineering Library, which is located in the Chamber of Mines Building on West Campus and serves the schools of engineering within the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment.\nThe GeoMaths Library, which is situated in the basement of Senate House on East Campus and serves a range of schools within the faculties of Science, Engineering and the Built Environment, and Humanities.\nThe Witwatersrand Health Sciences Library (WHSL) which serves the Faculty of Health Sciences. It is divided into four branches, one of which (formerly at Helen Joseph Hospital) is now a \"virtual library\" available only online. Two of the other branches are at the Wits Medical Campus in Parktown, while the remaining branch is at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto.\nThe Wits Library of Management, which, together with the Commerce Library, serves the schools of commerce and management. It is located in the Donald Gordon Building on the Management Campus in Parktown.\nThe Law Library which serves the school of law within the Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management. It is located in the Oliver Schreiner Law Building on West Campus. Unlike the University's other libraries, the Law Library is governed directly by the school of law, rather than by the University of the Witwatersrand Library.\n\n\n=== Reputation and ranking ===\n\nIn 2019 Wits was ranked 201-300 globally and 2nd nationally in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), commonly known as Shanghai Ranking. In the 2019/2020 Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR) Wits is ranked 254 globally (top 1.3% in the world). In the 2019 US News Best global Universities Rankings, Wits was ranked 2nd in Africa and #197 globally with a Global score of 59.9. Wits ranked #194 globally in the 2020 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.In its capacity as a business school, the University of Witwatersrand was placed as the 6th best business school in Africa and the Middle East in the 2010 QS Global 200 Business Schools Report. As well as being voted the best MBA in South Africa by the Financial Mail 6 years running.\n\n\n== Frankenwald controversy ==\n\nIn 1905 the mining magnate Alfred Beit donated a large piece of land, Frankenwald Estate, north of Johannesburg, to the Transvaal Colony to be used for 'educational purposes' - the land was transferred to Wits in 1922 by an Act of Parliament. According to the Mail & Guardian the University entered into an agreement in 2001 with a private developer, iProp, to build a shopping centre, offices, light industry and medium and high-density housing on the property.\n\n\n== Student demographics ==\nThe removal of the legacy of apartheid is generally considered an important matter in South African socio-political and academic discourse. \nThe University of the Witwatersrand actively advocates the principle of diversity in its student body. It believes that the student body should reflect diversity of race, gender, socio-economic background, urban and rural geographic origin, culture, ethnicity, disability, religion, sexual orientation, national origin [this is not, of course, an exhaustive list]. Consequently, its admissions procedures will try to ensure that diversity in the student body is maintained and further developed, with the eventual goal of mirroring the demographic profile of the wider Gauteng region.\n\n\n=== Racial composition ===\nThe racial composition of the university's student population is as follows:\n\n\n=== Gender composition ===\nThe gender composition of the university's student population is as follows:\n\n\n== Notable alumni and academics ==\n\n\n=== Nobel Prize Laureates ===\nAaron Klug, 1982 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\nNadine Gordimer, 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature\nNelson Mandela, who attended but did not graduate from the university, 1993 Nobel Peace Prize\nSydney Brenner, 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\n\n\n== See also ==\nDawn of Humanity (2015 PBS film)\nWiddringtonia whytei\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nYamashiro, Shin (2014). \"American Sea Literature\u2014on the Sea\".

        "wiki": "Nelson Mandela is a bronze sculpture on the Union Buildings grounds, Pretoria, Gauteng, of former President of South Africa and anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. The statue was unveiled on the Day of Reconciliation (16 December 2013), bringing the official mourning period of ten days to a close, after Mandela had died on 5 December.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe statue is 9m high, making it the tallest statue of Nelson Mandela in the world. It is made in bronze and weighs approximately 3.5 tonnes. The engineering work was carried out by the Knight brothers at Sculpture Casting Services Foundary in Cape Town. The legs and arms were cast in Nottingham road, KwaZulu-Natal.\n\n\n=== Inauguration ===\nThe statue was inaugurated by then President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma who in his speech said:\n\nYou will notice that in all the statues that have been made of Madiba, he is raising his fist and at times stretching it. That derives from the slogan of the ANC. This one is different from many. He is stretching out his hands. He is embracing the whole nation. You shouldn\u2019t say this is not Madiba because we know him with his one [raised] hand.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe statue is located in front of the buildings on a spot that used to belong to the statue of J.B.M. Hertzog who was the Prime Minister of South Africa from 1924-1939.The statue was taken down on 22 November 2013 and moved to a different location in the grounds.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nFree Nelson Mandela (sculpture)\nStatue of Nelson Mandela, Johannesburg\nStatue of Nelson Mandela, Parliament Square\nStatue of Nelson Mandela, Balcony Cape Town City Hall overlooking the Grand Parade\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Pionier Opelug Museum  (Afrikaans for the Pioneer Open-air Museum), is a cultural and \"living\" museum in the eastern suburbs of Pretoria that reflects the lifestyle of early pioneers or \"Voortrekkers\" of the early 19th century. It is housed in the oldest building in Pretoria, the 1848 House, and the museum is operated by Ditsong Museums of South Africa.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe museum is a \"living museum\" so in other words the guides and the visitors are meant to experience the museum as if they lived in the early 19th century and the guides are clad in period dress. Activities include traditional bread making and butter churning and presentations of \"Voorlaaier\", Afrikaans for \"Front-loading\" musket, firing and reloading. The main tour of the museum follows the history of the 1848 House and the people who inhabited the original farm called \"Hartebeestpoort\". The surrounding gardens are stocked with a traditional herb and vegetable garden where one can learn about Voortrekker \"Boereraat\" or \"home-remedies\", an orchard, a furnished period wagon house and a vineyard.\n\n\n=== Events ===\nA New Year's Festival is held on 1 January every year in the museum complex.\nThere is also a farmers' market held at the museum every Saturday from 5h30 to 9h30 called the Pretoria Boeremark.\n\n\n== 1848 House ==\nThe fittingly named 1848 House is the main building of the complex and was built in 1848  by early Voortrekker pioneers using traditional methods, it is the oldest man made structure still standing in the city of Pretoria. According to the website the house's specifications are: \"The house was built of clay and local materials, with a thatched roof and earthen floors, and is furnished in the traditional 19th century rural style.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Cape Colony farmer David Botha, was the first to settle on the farm Hartebeespoort in 1846 and two years later he built the current main house. The property served the purpose of halfway station for many years with several coach-houses and stables catering to the needs of travelers. In 1961 the property was donated to the Municipality of Silverton and in 1975 it was made into a museum and named the \"Pionier Museum\" or \"Pioneer Museum\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "A market, or marketplace, is a location where people regularly gather for the purchase and sale of provisions, livestock, and other goods. In different parts of the world, a market place may be described as a souk (from the Arabic), bazaar (from the Persian), a fixed mercado (Spanish), or itinerant tianguis (Mexico), or palengke (Philippines). Some markets operate daily and are said to be permanent markets while others are held once a week or on less frequent specified days such as festival days and are said to be periodic markets. The form that a market adopts depends on its locality's population, culture, ambient and geographic conditions. The term market covers many types of trading, as market squares, market halls and food halls, and their different varieties. Due to this, marketplaces can be situated both outdoors and indoors.\nMarkets have existed for as long as humans have engaged in trade. The earliest bazaars are believed to have originated in Persia, from where they spread to the rest of the Middle East and Europe.  Documentary sources suggest that zoning policies confined trading to particular parts of cities from around 3,000 BCE, creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of a bazaar. Middle Eastern bazaars were typically long strips with stalls on either side and a covered roof designed to protect traders and purchasers from the fierce sun. In Europe, informal, unregulated markets gradually made way for a system of formal, chartered markets from the 12th century. Throughout the Medieval period, increased regulation of marketplace practices, especially weights and measures, gave consumers confidence in the quality of market goods and the fairness of prices. Around the globe, markets have evolved in different ways depending on local ambient conditions, especially weather, tradition and culture. In the Middle East, markets tend to be covered, to protect traders and shoppers from the sun. In milder climates, markets are often open air. In Asia, a system of morning markets trading in fresh produce and night markets trading in non-perishables is common.\nToday, markets can also be accessed electronically or on the internet through e-commerce platforms. \nIn many countries, shopping at a local market is a standard feature of daily life. Given the market's role in ensuring food supply for a population, markets are often highly regulated by a central authority.  In many places, designated market places have become listed sites of historic and architectural significance and represent part of a town or nation's cultural assets. For these reasons, they are often popular tourist destinations.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term market comes from the Latin mercatus (\"market place\"). The earliest recorded use of the term market in English is in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of 963, a work that was created during the reign of Alfred the Great (r. 871-899) and subsequently distributed, copied throughout English monasteries. The exact phrase was \u201cIc wille \u00fe\u00e6t markete beo in \u00fee selue tun,\u201d which roughly translates as  \u201cI want to be at that market in the good town.\u201d\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== In prehistory ===\nMarkets have existed since ancient times. Some historians have argued that a type of market has existed since humans first began to engage in trade. Open air, public markets were known in ancient Babylonia, Assyria, Phoenecia, Greece, Egypt and on the Arabian peninsula. However, not all societies developed a system of markets.  The Greek historian, Herodotus noted that markets did not evolve in ancient Persia.Across the Mediterranean and Aegean, a network of markets emerged from the early Bronze Age. A vast array of goods were traded including: salt, lapiz-lazuli, dyes, cloth, metals, pots, ceramics, statues, spears and other implements. Archaeological evidence suggests that Bronze Age traders segmented trade routes according to geographical circuits. Both produce and ideas travelled along these trade routes.In the Middle-East, documentary sources suggest that a form of bazaar first developed around 3,000 BCE. Early bazaars occupied a series of alleys along the length of the city, typically stretching from one city gate to a different gate on the other side of the city. The bazaar at Tabriz, for example, stretches along 1.5 kilometres of street and is the longest vaulted bazaar in the world. Moosavi argues that the Middle-Eastern bazaar evolved in a linear pattern, whereas the market places of the West were more centralised. The Greek historian, Herodotus, noted that in Egypt, roles were reversed compared with other cultures and Egyptian women frequented the market and carried on trade, while the men remain at home weaving cloth. He also described The Babylonian Marriage Market.\n\n\n=== In antiquity ===\n\nIn antiquity, markets were typically situated in the town's centre. The market was surrounded by alleyways inhabited by skilled artisans, such as metal-workers, leather workers and carpenters. These artisans may have sold wares directly from their premises, but also prepared goods for sale on market days.\nAcross ancient Greece market places (agorai) were to be found in most city states, where they operated within the agora (open space). Between 550 and 350 BCE, Greek stallholders clustered together according to the type of goods carried - fish-sellers were in one place, clothing in another and sellers of more expensive goods such as perfumes, bottles and jars were located in a separate building. The Greeks organised trade into separate zones, all located near the city centre and known as stoa.  A freestanding colonnade with a covered walkway, the stoa was both a place of commerce and a public promenade, situated within or adjacent to the agora. At the market-place (agorai) in Athens, officials were employed by the government to oversee weights, measures, and coinage to ensure that the people were not cheated in market place transactions. The rocky and mountainous terrain in Greece made it difficult for producers to transport goods or surpluses to local markets, giving rise to the kap\u0113los, a specialised type of retailer who operated as an intermediary purchasing produce from farmers and transporting it over short distances to the city markets.In ancient Rome, trade took place in the forum. Rome had two forums; the Forum Romanum and Trajan's Forum. Trajan's Market at Trajan's forum, built around 100-110CE,  was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with shops on four levels. The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shopfront. In antiquity, exchange involved direct selling via merchants or peddlers and bartering systems were commonplace. In the Roman world, the central market primarily served the local peasantry. Market stall holders were primarily local primary producers who sold small surpluses from their individual farming activities and also artisans who sold leather-goods, metal-ware and pottery. Consumers were made up of several different groups; farmers who purchased minor farm equipment and a few luxuries for their homes and urban dwellers who purchased basic necessities. Major producers such as the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates, obviating the producers' need to attend local markets. The very wealthy landowners managed their own distribution, which may have involved importing and exporting. The nature of export markets in antiquity is well documented in ancient sources and archaeological case studies.\n\nAt Pompeii multiple markets served the population of approximately 12,000. Produce markets were located in the vicinity of the Forum, while livestock markets were situated on the city's perimeter, near the amphitheatre. A long narrow building at the north-west corner of the Forum was some type of market, possibly a cereal market. On the opposite corner stood the macellum, thought to have been a meat and fish market. Market stall-holders paid a market tax for the right to trade on market days. Some archaeological evidence suggests that markets and street vendors were controlled by local government. A graffito on the outside of a large shop documents a seven-day cycle of markets; \"Saturn\u2019s day at Pompeii and Nuceria, Sun\u2019s day at Atella and Nola, Moon\u2019s day at Cumae ... etc.\"  The presence of an official commercial calendar suggests something of the market's importance to community life and trade. Markets were also important centres of social life.\n\n\n=== In medieval Europe ===\n\nIn early Western Europe, markets developed close to monasteries, castles or royal residences. Priories and aristocratic manorial households created considerable demand for goods and services - both luxuries and necessities and also afforded some protection to merchants and traders. These centres of trade attracted sellers which would stimulate the growth of the town. The Domesday Book of 1086 lists 50 markets in England, however, many historians believe this figure underestimates the actual number of markets in operation at the time. In England, some 2,000 new markets were established between 1200 and 1349. By 1516, England had some 2,464 markets and 2,767 fairs while Wales had 138 markets and 166 fairs.From the 12th century, English monarchs awarded a charter to local Lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village. A charter protected the town's trading privileges in return for an annual fee. Once a chartered market was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days. Fairs, which were usually held annually, and almost always associated with a religious festival, traded in high value goods, while regular weekly or bi-weekly markets primarily traded in fresh produce and necessities. Although a fair's primary purpose was trade, it typically included some elements of entertainment, such as dance, music or tournaments. As the number of markets increased, market towns situated themselves sufficiently far apart so as to avoid competition, but close enough to permit local producers a round trip within one day (about 10 km). Some British open-air markets have been operating continuously since the 12th century.\n\nA pattern of market trading using mobile stalls under covered arcades was probably established in Italy with the open loggias of Mercato Nuovo (1547) designed and constructed by Giovanni Battista del Tasso (and funded by the Medici family); Mercato Vecchio, Florence designed by Giorgio Vasari (1567) and Loggia del Grano (1619) by architect, Giulio Parigi.Braudel and Reynold have made a systematic study of European market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century. Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were common in larger cities. Over time, permanent shops began opening daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets, while peddlers or itinerant sellers continued to fill in any gaps in distribution.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the physical market was characterised by transactional exchange. Shops had higher overhead costs, but were able to offer regular trading hours and a relationship with customers and may have offered added value services, such as credit terms to reliable customers. The economy was primarily characterised by local trading in which goods were traded across relatively short distances.\nBeach markets, which were known in north-western Europe, during the Viking period, were primarily associated with the sale of fish. From around the 11th-century, the number and variety of imported goods sold at beach markets began to increase. giving consumers access to a broader range of exotic and luxury goods. Throughout the Medieval period, markets became more international. The historian, Braudel, reports that, in 1600, grain moved just 5\u201310 miles; cattle 40\u201370 miles; wool and wollen cloth 20\u201340 miles. However, following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar - calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.\n\nAcross the boroughs of England, a network of chartered markets sprang up between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise.  A study on the purchasing habits of the monks and other individuals in medieval England, suggests that consumers of the period were relatively discerning. Purchase decisions were based on purchase criteria such as the consumer's perceptions of the range, quality, and price of goods. Such considerations informed decisions about where to make purchases and which markets to patronise.As the number of charters granted increased, competition between market towns also increased. In response to competitive pressures, towns invested in developing a reputation for quality produce, efficient market regulation and good amenities for visitors such as covered accommodation. By the thirteenth century, counties with important textile industries were investing in purpose built halls for the sale of cloth. London's Blackwell Hall became a centre for cloth, Bristol became associated with a particular type of cloth known as Bristol red, Stroud was known for producing fine woollen cloth, the town of Worsted became synonymous with a type of yarn; Banbury and Essex were strongly associated with cheeses.In the market economy, goods are ungraded and unbranded, so that consumers have relatively few opportunities to evaluate quality prior to consumption. Consequently, supervision of weights, measures, food quality and prices was a key consideration. In medieval society, regulations for such matters appeared initially at the local level. The Charter of Worcester, written between 884 and 901 provided for fines for dishonest trading, amongst other things. Such local regulations were codified in 15th century England in what became known as the Statute of Winchester. This document outlines the Assizes for 16 different trades, most of which were associated with markets - miller, baker, fisher, brewer, inn-keeper, tallow-chandler, weaver, cordwainer etc. For each trade, regulations covered such issues as fraud, prices, quality, weights and measures and so on. The assize was a formal codification of prior informal codes which had been practised for many years. The courts of assize were granted the power to enforce these regulations. The process of standardizing quality, prices and measures assisted markets to gain the confidence of buyers and made them more attractive to the public.A sixteenth century commentator, John Leland, described particular markets as \"celebrate,\" \"very good\" and \"quik,\u201d and, conversely, as \u201cpoore,\u201d \u201cmeane,\u201d and \u201cof no price.\"  Over time, some products became associated with particular places, providing customers with valuable information about the types of goods, their quality and their region of origin. In this way, markets helped to provide an early form of product branding. Gradually, certain market towns earned a reputation for providing quality produce. Today, traders and showmen jealously guard the reputation of these historic chartered markets. An 18th century commentator, Daniel Defoe visited Sturbridge fair in 1723 and wrote a lengthy description which paints a picture of a highly organised, vibrant operation which attracted large number of visitors from some distance away. \"As for the people in the fair, they all universally eat, drink and sleep in their booths, and tents; and the said booths are so intermingled with taverns, coffee-houses, drinking-houses, eating-houses, cookshops &c, and all tents too, and so many butchers and higglers from all the neighbouring counties come in to the fair every morning, with beef, mutton, fowls, bread, cheese, eggs and such things; and go with them from tent to tent and from door to door, that there is no want of provision of any kind, either dress'd or undress'd.\"\n\n\n=== In the Middle East ===\n\nIn the Middle East, prior to the 10th century, market places were situated on the perimeter of the city. Along established trade routes, markets were most often associated with the caravanserai typically situated just outside the city walls. However, when the marketplace began to become integrated into city structures, it was transformed into a covered area where traders could buy and sell with some protection from the elements. Markets at Mecca and Medina were known to be significant trade centres in the 3rd century (CE) and the nomadic communities were highly dependent on them for both trade and social interactions.  The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is often cited as the world's oldest continuously-operating, purpose-built market; its construction began in 1455.\n\n\n=== In Mesoamerica ===\nIn Mesoamerica, a tiered system of traders developed independently. Extensive trade networks predated the Aztec empire by at least hundreds of years. Local markets where people purchased their daily necessities were known as tianguis, while a pochteca was a professional merchant who travelled long distances to obtain rare goods or luxury items desired by the nobility. The system supported various levels of pochteca - from very high status through to minor traders who acted as a type of peddler to fill in gaps in the distribution system. Colonial sources also record Mayan market hubs at Acalan, Champot\u00f3n, Chetumal, Bacalar, Cachi, Conil, Pole, Cozumel, Cochuah, Chauaca, Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 as well as markets marking the edges of Yucatecan canoe trade such as Xicalanco and Ulua. The Spanish conquerors commented on the impressive nature of the local markets in the 15th century. The Mexica (Aztec) market of Tlatelolco was the largest in all the Americas and said to be superior to those in Europe.\n\n\n== Types ==\nThere are many different ways to classify markets. One way is to consider the nature of the buyer and the market's place within the distribution system. This leads to two broad classes of market, namely retail market or wholesale markets. The economist, Alfred Marshall classified markets according to time period. In this classification, there are three types of market; the very short period market where the supply of a commodity remains fixed.  Perishables, such as fruit, vegetables, meat and fish fall into this group since goods must be sold within a few days and the quantity supplied is relatively inelastic. The second group is the short period market where the time in which the quantity supplied can be increased by improving the scale of production (adding labor and other inputs but not by adding capital). Many non-perishable goods fall into this category. The third category is the long-period market where the length of time can be improved by capital investment.Other ways to classify markets include its trading area (local, national or international); its physical format or its produce.\nMajor physical formats of markets are:\n\nBazaar: typically a covered market in the Middle East\nCar boot sale - a type of market where people come together to trade household and garden goods; very popular in the United Kingdom\nDry market: a market selling durable goods such as fabric and electronics as distinguished from \"wet markets\"\nE-commerce: an online marketplace for  consumer products which can be sold anywhere in the world\n\nIndoor market of any sort\nMarketplace: an open space where a market is or was formerly held in a town\nMarket square in Europe: open area usually in town centre with stalls selling goods in a public square\nPublic market in the United States: an indoor, fixed market in a building and selling a variety of goods\nStreet market: a public street with stalls along one or more sides of the street\nFloating market: where goods are sold from boats, chiefly found in Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam\nNight market: popular in many countries in Asia, opening at night and featuring much street food and a more leisurely shopping experience. In Indonesia and Malaysia they are known as pasar malam\nWet market (also known as a public market): a market selling fresh meat, fish, produce, and other perishable goods as distinguished from \"dry markets\"Markets may feature a range of merchandise for sale, or they may be one of many specialist markets, such as:\n\nAnimal markets (i.e. livestock markets)\nAntique markets\nFarmers' markets, focusing on fresh produce and gourmet food lines (preserves, chutneys, relishes, cheeses etc.) prepared from farm produce\nFish markets\nFlea markets or swap meets, a type of bazaar that rents space to people who want to sell or barter merchandise. Used goods, low quality items, and high quality items at low prices are commonplace\nFlower markets, such as the Mercado Jamaica in Mexico City and the Bloemenmarkt in Amsterdam\nFood halls, featuring gourmet food to consume on- and off-premises, such as those at Harrods (London) and Galeries Lafayette (Paris) department stores. In North America, these may be also referred to simply as \"markets\" (or \"mercados\" in Spanish), such as the West Side Market in Cleveland, Ponce City Market in Atlanta, and the Mercado Roma in Mexico City.\nGrey market: where second hand or recycled goods are sold (sometimes termed a green market)\nHandicraft markets\nMarkets selling items used in the occult (for magic, by witches, etc.)\nSupermarkets and hypermarkets\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== In literature and art ==\n\nMarkets generally have featured prominently in artworks, especially amongst the Dutch painters of Antwerp from the middle of the 16th century. Pieter Aertsen was known as the \"great painter of the market.\" Both he and his nephew, Joachim Beuckelaer, painted market scenes, street vendors and merchants extensively. Elizabeth Honig argues that painters' interest in markets was in part due to the changing nature of the market system at that time. The public began to distinguish between two types of merchant, the meerseniers which referred to local merchants including bakers, grocers, sellers of dairy products and stall-holders, and the koopman, which described a new, emergent class of trader who dealt in goods or credit on a large scale. With the rise of a European merchant class, this distinction was necessary to separate the daily trade that the general population understood from the rising ranks of traders who operated on a world stage and were seen as quite distant from everyday experience.During the 17th and 18th centuries, as Europeans conquered parts of North Africa and the Levant, European artists began to visit the Orient and painted scenes of everyday life. Europeans sharply divided peoples into two broad groups - the European West and the East or Orient; us and the other.  Europeans often saw Orientals as the photographic negative of Western civilisation; the peoples could be threatening- they were \"despotic, static and irrational whereas Europe was viewed as democratic, dynamic and rational.\" At the same time, the Orient was seen as exotic, mysterious, a place of fables and beauty. This fascination with the other gave rise to a genre of painting known as Orientalism. Artists focussed on the exotic beauty of the land - the markets and bazaars, caravans and snake charmers. Islamic architecture also became favourite subject matter, and the high vaulted market places features in numerous paintings and sketches.Individual markets have also attracted literary attention. Les Halles was known as the \"Belly of Paris\", and was so named by author, \u00c9mile Zola in his novel Le Ventre de Paris, which is set in the busy 19th century marketplace of central Paris. Les Halles, a complex of market pavilions in Paris, features extensively in both literature and painting. Giuseppe Canella (1788 - 1847) painted Les Halles et la rue de la Tonnellerie. Photographer, Henri Lemoine (1848 - 1924), also photographed Les Halles de Paris.\n\n\n== Around the world ==\n\n\n=== Africa ===\nMarkets have been known in parts of Africa for centuries. An 18th century commentator noted the many markets he visited in West Africa. He provided a detailed description of market activities at Sabi, in the Wydah, (now the part of the Republic of Benin): \n\n\"Their fairs and markets are regulated with so much care and prudence, that nothing contrary to law is ever committed. All sorts of merchandise here are collected, and those who have brought goods are permitted to take what time they please to dispose of them, but without fraud or noise. A judge, attended by four officers armed, is appointed by the King for the inspection of goods, to hear and determine all grievances, complaints and disputes... The market place is surrounded by butlers and booths, and places of refreshment for the conveniency of the people. They are only permitted to sell certain sorts of meats, pork, goats, beef and dog flesh. Other booths are kept by women who sell maize, millet, rice and corn bread. Other shops sell Pito, a sort of pleasant and wholesome, and very refreshing beer. Palm wine, acqua vita and spirits which they get from the Europeans, are kept in other shops, with restrictions on sale to prevent drunkenness and riots. Here slaves of both sexes are bought and sold, also oxen, sheep, dogs, hogs, shish and birds of all kind. Woollen cloths, linen, silks and calicoes of European and Indian manufacture, they have it in great abundance, likewise hard-ware, china and glass of all sorts; gold in dust and ingots, iron in bars, lead in sheets and everything of European, Asiatic or African production is here found at reasonable prices.\"In the Republic of Benin, he commented on the exotic foods available for sale at a market there:\n\n\" Besides the dry merchandise of which the markets of Benin abound, they are also well stocked with eatables, a little particular in kind. Here they expose dogs to sale for eating, of which the negroes are very fond. Roasted monkeys, apes and baboons are every where to be seen. Bats, rats and lizards dried in the sun, palm wine and fruit, form the must luxurious entertainments, and stand continually for sale in the streets.\"\n\n\n==== Botswana ====\nThe sale of agricultural produce to the formal market is largely controlled by large corporations. Most small, local farmers sell their produce to the informal market, local communities and street vendors. The main wholesale market is the Horticultural market in Gaborone.  The government made some attempts to build markets in the north of the country, but that was largely unsuccessful and most commercial buyers travel to Johannesburg or Tshwane for supplies.\n\n\n==== Ethiopia ====\nEthiopia is a major producer and exporter of grains and a number of wholesale markets assist with the distribution and export of such products. Important wholesale markets include: Nekempte and Jaji in the Wollega region, Assela and agure in the Arsi region, Bahir Dar and Bure in the Gojjam region, Dessie and Kombolcha in the Wollo region, Mekele in the Tigray region, Dire Dawa and Harar in the Hararghe region, and Addis Ababa. Some of the major retail markets in Ethiopia include: Addis Mercato in Addis Ababa, the largest open air market in the country; Chiromedia and Sholla, both in Addis Ababa; Awasa Lake Fish Market in Awasa, Bahir Dar in Bahar Dar and the Saturday market in Axum.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Ghana ====\n\nGhanaian markets have survived in spite of sometimes brutal measures to eradicate them. In the late 1970s, the Ghanaian government used market traders as a scapegoat for its own policy failures which involved food shortages and high inflation. The government blamed traders for failing to observe pricing guidelines and vilified \"women merchants\". In 1979, the Makola market was dynamited and bulldozed, but within a week the traders were back selling fruit, vegetables and fish, albeit without a roof over their head.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Kenya ====\nKenya's capital, Nairobi, has several major markets. Wakulima market is one of the region's largest markets, situated on Haile Selassie Avenue in Nairobi. Other markets in Nairobi are: Kariakor Market\nGikomba Market and Muthurwa market In Mombasa, Kongowea market is also a very large market with over 1500 stalls and covering 4.5 ha.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Morocco ====\nIn Morocco, markets are known as souks, and are normally found in a city's Medina (old city or old quarter).  Shopping at a produce market is a standard feature of daily life in Morocco. In the larger cities, Medinas are typically made up of a collection of souks built amid a maze of narrow streets and laneways where independent vendors and artisans tend to cluster in sections which subsequently become known for a particular type of produce - such as the silversmith's street or the textile district. In Tangiers, a sprawling market fills the many streets of the medina and this area is divided into two sections, known as the Grand Socco and the Petit Socco. The term 'socco' is a Spanish corruption of the Arabic word for souk, meaning marketplace. These markets sell a large variety of goods; fresh produce, cooking equipment, pottery, silverware, rugs and carpets, leather goods, clothing, accessories, electronics alongside cafes, restaurants and take-away food stalls. The Medina at Fez is the oldest, having been founded in the 9th century. The Medina at Fez has been named a World Heritage site. Today it is the main fresh produce market and is noted for its narrow laneways and for a total ban on motorized traffic. All produce is brought in and out of the marketplace by donkey or hand-cart. In Marrakesh, the main produce markets are also to be found in the Medina and a colourful market is also held daily in the Jemaa el-Fnaa (main square) where roaming performers and musicians entertain the large crowds that gather there. Marrakesh has the largest traditional Berber market in Morocco.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Namibia ====\nNamibia has been almost entirely dependent on South Africa for its fresh produce. Dominated by rolling plains and long sand dunes and an unpredictable rainfall, many parts of Namibia are unsuited to growing fruit and vegetables. Government sponsored initiatives have encouraged producers to grow fresh fruit, vegetables, legumes and grains The Namibian Ministry of Agriculture has recently launched a system of fresh produce hubs to serve as a platform for producers to market and distribute their produce. It is anticipated that these hubs will assist in curbing the number of sellers who take their produce to South Africa where it is placed on cold storage, only to be imported back into the country at a later date.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Nigeria ====\n\n\n==== South Africa ====\nFresh produce markets have traditionally dominated the South African food chain, handling more than half of all fresh produce. Although large, vertically integrated food retailers, such as supermarkets, are beginning to make inroads into the supply chain, traditional hawkers and produce markets have shown remarkable resilience. The main markets in Johannesburg are:  Jozi Real Food Market, Bryanston Organic Market, Pretoria Boeremark specialising in South African delicacies, Hazel Food Market, Panorama Flea Market, Rosebank Sunday Market, Market on Main - a periodic arts market and Neighbourhood Markets.\n\n\n==== The Gambia ====\nThe \"Gambia is Good\" initiative was established in 2004 with a view to encouraging a market for locally grown fresh produce rather than imported ones. The plan was designed to \"stimulate local livelihoods, inspire entrepreneurship and reduce the environmental and social cost of imported produce.\"A great deal of the produce trade is carried out informally on street corners and many shops are little more than market booths. However, dedicated open air and covered markets can be found in the larger towns. Notable markets include: the Serekunda Market in Gambia's largest city, Serekunda, which opens from early morning to late at night 7 days a week and trades in produce, live animals, clothing, accessories, jewellery, crafts, second hand goods and souvenirs; The Albert Market in the capital, Banjul which sells fresh produce, colourful, locally designed fabrics, musical instruments, carved wooden masks and other local products. Other interesting markets include: Bakau Fish Market in Bakau; Tanji Fish Market, Tanji, where brightly-painted fishing boats bring in the fish from where it is immediately preserved using traditional methods and prepared for distribution to other West African countries; The Woodcarvers Market in Brikama which boasts the largest concentration of woodcarvers in the country; the Pottery Market in Basse Santa; the Atlantic Road Craft Market at Bakau and the Senegambia Craft Market at Bakau.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Uganda ====\nNakawa Market\n\n\n=== Asia ===\n\nProduce markets in Asia are undergoing major changes as supermarkets enter the retail scene and the growing middle classes acquire preferences for branded goods. Many supermarkets purchase directly from producers, supplanting the traditional role of both wholesale and retail markets. In order to survive, produce markets have been forced to consider value adding opportunities and many retail markets now focus on ready-to-eat food and take-away food.\n\n\n==== East Asia ====\n\n\n===== China =====\nIn China, the existence of street and wet markets has been known for centuries, however, many of these were restricted in the 1950s and 60s and only permitted to re-open in 1978.  The distinction between wholesale and retail markets is somewhat ambiguous in China, since many markets serve both as distribution centres and retail shopping venues. To assist in the distribution of food, more than 9,000 wholesale produce markets operate in China. Some of these markets operate on a very large scale. For example, Beijing's Xinfadi Wholesale market, currently under renovation, is expected to have a footprint of 112 hectares when complete. The Beijing Zoo Market (retail market) is a collection of 12 different markets, comprising some 20,000 tenant stall-holders, 30,000 employees and more than 100,000 customers daily.China is both a major importer and exporter of fruit and vegetables and is now the world's largest exporter of apples. In addition to produce markets, China has many specialised markets such as a silk market, clothing markets and an antiques market. China's fresh produce market is undergoing major change. In the larger cities, purchasing is gradually moving to online with door-to-door deliveries.\nSome of the more important markets in China include: \n\nWholesale produce market: Xinfadi (wholesale produce market, Beijing)  - with an annual turnover volume of 14 million tonnes of meat, fruit and vegetables, it supplies 70 percent of Beijing's vegetables and Nanzhan (Shenyang, Liaoning) which supplies the northern provinces.Retail produce markets: The Fresh Produce Market at Hutong (Beijing); Xiabu Xiabu (Beijing), Panjiayuan market (Beijing); Dazhongsi Market (Beijing), Tianyi market (Beijing), Beijing Zoo market, Dahongmen market (Fengtai District, Beijing), Sanyuanli Market (Beijing), Shengfu Xiaoguan Morning Market (Beijing), Lishuiqiao Seafood Farmers\u2019 Market (Beijing), Wangjing Zonghe Market (Beijing), Chaowai Market (Beijing), Sanyuanli Market (Beijing), Zhenbai Market (Shanghai's largest produce market)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n====== Hong Kong ======\n\nHong Kong relies heavily imports to meet its fresh produce needs. Importers are consequently an important part of the distribution network, and some importers supply directly to retail consumers. Street markets in Hong Kong are held every day except on a few traditional Chinese holidays like Chinese New Year. Stalls opened at two sides of a street are required to have licenses issued by the Hong Kong Government. The various types of street markets include fresh foods, clothing, cooked foods, flowers and electronics. The earliest form of market was a Gaa si (wet market). Some traditional markets have been replaced by shopping centres, markets in municipal service buildings and supermarkets, while others have become tourist attractions such as Tung Choi Street and Apliu Street. The Central Market, Hong Kong is a grade II listed building.\n\n\n===== Japan =====\nTsukiji fish market\nKochi Sunday Market\nHirome Ichiba\n\n\n===== South Korea =====\n\nAlthough the majority of markets in South Korea are wholesale markets, retail customers are permitted to make purchases in all of them. The Gwangjang Market is the nation's top market and is a popular tourist destination.\n\n\n===== Taiwan =====\nTaiwan meets most of its produce needs through local production. This means that the country has a very active network of wholesale and retail markets. According to the Guardian newspaper, Taiwan has \"the best night market scene in the world and some of the most exciting street food in Asia.\"\n\n\n==== South Asia ====\nIn South Asia, especially Nepal, India and Bangladesh, a Haat (also known as hat) refers to a regular rural produce market, typically held once or twice per week.\n\n\n===== India =====\nThe marketing historian, Petty, has suggested that Indian marketplaces first arose during the Chola Dynasty (approx. 850 -1279CE) during a period of favourable economic conditions. Distinct types of markets were evident; nagaaram (streets of shops, often devoted to specific types of goods; angadi (markets) and perangadi (large markets in the inner city districts).The sub-continent may have borrowed the concept of covered marketplaces from the Middle East around the tenth century with the arrival of Islam. The caravanserai and covered market structures, known as suqs, first began to appear along the silk routes and were located in the area just outside the city perimeter. Following the tradition established on the Arabian peninsula, India also established temporary-seasonal markets in regional districts. In Rajasthan's Pushkar, an annual camel market was first recorded in the 15th century. However, following the foundation of the Mughal Empire in northern India during the 16th century, this arrangement changed. A covered bazaar or market place became integrated into city structures and was to be found in the city centre. Markets and bazaars were well known in the colonial era. Some of these bazaars appear to have specialised in particular types of produce. The Patna district, in the 17th century, was home to 175 weaver villages and the Patna Bazaar enjoyed a reputation as a centre of trade in fine cloth. When the Italian writer and traveller, Niccolao Manucci, visited there in 1863, he found many merchants trading in cotton and silk in Patna's bazaars.In India today, many different types of market serve retail and commercial clients:(1) Wholesale markets\n\nPrimary wholesale markets: held once or twice per week, these sell produce from local villages e.g. Rice Bazaar at Thissur in Kerala\nSecondary wholesale markets (also known as mandis): smaller merchants purchase from primary markets and sell at secondary markets. A small number of primary producers may sell direct to mandis.\nTerminal markets: Markets that sell directly to the end-user, whether it be the consumer, food processor or shipping agent for export to foreign countries e.g. Bombay Terminal Market(2) Retail markets\n\nRetail markets: spread across villages, towns and cities\nFairs: held on religious days and deal in livestock and agricultural produceIn India (and also Bangladesh and Pakistan), a landa bazaar is a type of a bazaar or a marketplace with lowest prices where only secondhand general goods are exchanged or sold. A haat also refers to a bazaar or market in Bangladesh and Pakistan and the term may also be used in India.

Some Asian countries have developed unique distribution systems and highly specialised types of market place. Throughout Asia, a wet market refers to a place where fruit, vegetables, fish, seafood and meat products are sold. Throughout much of Asia, produce markets are known as morning markets due to their hours of operation, while night markets specialise in selling non-perishables including clothing, accessories, local artefacts, souvenirs and a wide assortment of personal goods.\n\n\n===== Cambodia =====\n\n\n====== Phnom Penh ======\n\nCentral Market, Phnom Penh\n\n\n===== Indonesia =====\n\nIn Indonesia, a Pasar pagi is a particular type of wet market, also known as a \"morning market\" which typically operates from early morning to the afternoon. Pasar malam refers to a night market operated in later hours from late afternoon to night, approximately from 17:00 to 22:00, and only on selected days of a week.\nThe types of goods being sold is also quite different. Pasar pagi is where many housewives, domestic help, and local folks appear to shop their daily needs, mostly fresh produce. The things which are on sale are usually fresh produce, including fruits, vegetables, spices, fish, meat, eggs, and all kinds of perishable products. While pasar malam caters to a leisurely shopping and eating-out activity, selling ready-to-eat food, snacks, clothing, and knick-knacks.Major textile, fashion, and clothing markets in Indonesia are Tanah Abang market in central Jakarta and Pasar Baru in Bandung. Notable markets specializing in traditional batik clothing are, Pasar Klewer in Solo and Pasar Beringharjo in Yogyakarta.The major pasar pagi in Jakarta are Pasar Pagi Mangga Dua, Pasar Induk Kramat Jati, Pasar Minggu and Pasar Senen. Pasar Minggu specialized on fruits and vegetables, while Pasar Kue Subuh in Senen specialized on selling kue, as they offer a rich variety of traditional Indonesian snack, open every subuh (dawn).Notable markets in Yogyakarta, include: Pasar Beringharjo, a traditional market;  Kranggan Market, a flea market; Pasar Organik Milas, organic and flea market; Malioboro Road, a street market and Yogyakarta Bird Market.\nNotable markets in Bali include Pasar Badung central market of Denpasar city, Pasar Seni Sukowati art market specializing in artworks and handicrafts, and Pasar Ubud.\nIn several cities and towns in Kalimantan and Sumatra, there are floating markets, which is a collection of vendors selling various produce and product on boats. For example, the Siring floating market in Banjarmasin, and Lok Baintan floating market in Martapura, both in South Kalimantan.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===== Malaysia =====\n\nIn Malaysia the term Pasar malam refers to a night market which operates from around 17:00 through to approximately 23:00. Pasar pagi morning wet market is also familiar in Malaysia.\nIn parts of Malaysia, jungle produce markets trade in indigenous fruits and vegetables, all of which are gaining popularity as consumers switch to pesticide-free food products. Some of the more nutritional indigenous produce includes fruits such as dabai (Canarium odontophyllum), kembayau (Dacryodes rostrata f. cuspidata), durian nyekak (Durio kutejensis) and durian kuning (Durio graveolens), letup (Passiflora foetida), kepayang (Pangium edule) and tubu (Pycnarrhena tumetacta) and vegetables such as tengang  (Gnetum sp.) and riang batu (Begonia chlorosticia), teh kampung  (Leucosyke capitellata and tongkat langit (Musa troglodytarum ).The main markets in Kuala Lumpur include: Pudu market: rated as KL's largest wet market by the Lonely Planet Guide; Central Market, Kuala Lumpur;  Chow Kit Wet Market; Kampong Bahru Pasar Minggu; China Town; Petaling Jaya SS2; Bangsar Baru and Lorong Tuanka Abdul Rahman.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===== Philippines =====\n\nIn the Philippines, the word palengke refers to a group of stalls under a covered roof. Locals use palengkes for daily shopping.  Public markets are the primary trading centres in cities. In rural districts, public markets are in a state of disrepair. Weekend markets are popular for organic and artisanal foods purchases. In addition, a number of farmers' markets have sprung up. The Cubao Farmers Market, in Quezon City gained international attention following a feature spot on the cable network program, No Reservations, with Anthony Bourdain in 2009.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===== Thailand =====\n\n\n====== Bangkok ======\n\nBangkok's markets are popular with both locals and visitors. Bangkok boasts the world's largest weekend market in Chatuchak. Floating markets can be found in Bangkok and elsewhere. Vendors not only sell fresh produce from boats, but will also cook meals and snacks on their vessels for sale to the public. These floating markets are a popular tourist attraction.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== West Asia ====\n\nIn the West Asia, markets are known as bazaars or souks. The earliest bazaars are believed to have originated in Persia, and spread to the rest of the Middle East and Europe from there. Documentary sources suggest that zoning policies confined trading to particular parts of a city from around 3,000 BCE, creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of a bazaar.In the ancient cities of Iran, three types of bazaar have been identified; periodic bazaars, urban bazaars and local bazaars. Periodic bazaars could be organised anywhere and typically took place in open spaces and traded in specialities such as handicrafts, clothing, livestock and foodstuffs. These took place at regular intervals such as monthly or yearly. Urban bazaars were held in covered public walkways with shops or stores on both sides. Its architecture varied according to local conditions including climate, culture and the economic power of the city in which it was situated.  Urban bazaars were places for commercial, social and cultural interactions. Local bazaars, held in specific districts of larger cities, were similar to urban bazaars, but on a smaller scale with fewer shops.In pre-Islamic Arabia, markets took on two forms, permanent urban markets and temporary, seasonal markets often located in regional districts. Gradually, markets or bazaars gradually became central features of urban towns and were relocated to the city centre. Permanent markets are mentioned frequently in ancient literary sources.\n\n\n===== Iran =====\nMarkets with historical or architectural significance include:\n\nGrand Bazaar, Tehran\nBazaar of Kashan in Iran\nBazaar of Isfahan in Iran - historic site which dates to Saljuqid and Safavid era and is the longest roofed market in the world.\nBazaar of Tabriz in Iran - an historic site that originally developed along the ancient silk routes; listed as a World Heritage Site\nVakil Bazaar in Shiraz, Iran\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===== Israel =====\nThe Hebrew word for market is shuk (plural: shvakim), and food markets are found in every major city. Famous markets include the Carmel Market in Tel Aviv and Mahane Yehuda Market in Jerusalem.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===== Turkey =====\nStreet markets are called pazar in Turkish and usually named after the name of the day since they are only installed at around 05:00 on that specific day and ended on same day around 18:00, in every week. Every district in Turkey has its own open market where people can choose and buy from a very wide range of products, from fresh fruits and vegetables to clothing, from traditional white cheese (which some people may consider feta-like) to household items. In Istanbul area Wednesday Pazar of Fatih district, Tuesday Pazar of Kad\u0131k\u00f6y and Friday Pazar of Ortak\u00f6y are the most famous and crowded open markets of the city.\nA market with shops or permanent stalls is called \"\u00e7ar\u015f\u0131\" and may include covered streets that are closed at night. Famous examples include the Kapal\u0131\u00e7ar\u015f\u0131 (Grand Bazaar) and Spice Bazaar in Istanbul.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n\n==== Northern Europe ====\n\n\n===== Denmark =====\nTorvehallerne Market, Copenhagen - specializing in Nordic Foods\n\n\n===== Finland =====\nMarket Square, Helsinki\nMarket Square, Turku\nTammelantori, Tampere\n\n\n===== Netherlands =====\n\nMarkthal Market, Rotterdam\nVismarkt, Groningen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Northeastern Europe (Baltics) ====\n\n\n===== Latvia =====\nRiga Central Market\n\n\n==== Eastern Europe ====\n\n\n===== Romania =====\nChristmas market\n\n\n===== Russia =====\n\n\n===== Ukraine =====\nBesarabsky Market\nPryvoz Market\nSeventh-Kilometer Market\n\n\n==== Central Europe ====\n\n\n===== Austria =====\n\nNaschmarkt, Vienna - a 16th-century market\n\n\n===== Czech Republic =====\n\n\n===== Hungary =====\nCentral Market Hall, Budapest - built in 1897, the largest market in Budapest\n\n\n===== Slovakia =====\n\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Western Europe ====\n\n\n===== Belgium =====\nWith the rise of global trade in the 16th century, Antwerp became the largest market town in Europe.\nGrote Markt (Antwerp)\nGare du Midi, Brusells - Sunday market\n\n\n===== France =====\nParis was one of the first European cities to implement a system of formal, centralised and covered market places. Les Halles, a vast centralised wholesale market, was known to be in existence at least by the 13th century when it was expanded, and was only demolished in 1971 to make way for an underground shopping precinct. The French system of organised, designated central retail markets was extensively studied by architects in London with a view to emulating the system and ultimately eradicating the informal supply of produce via street vendors.\nRaspail Market, Paris\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===== Germany =====\n\nChristkindlesmarkt, Nuremberg, (Christmas market), Germany\nMarkthalle IX, Berlin, Germany  - built in 1891\nStriezelmarkt Dresden, Germany\n\n\n===== United Kingdom =====\n\n\n====== Background and licensing ======\nThe majority of retail markets are operated by the public sector and administered by local governments. A small number are operated by private groups or individuals. Traders can be licensed to trade on a single pitch but not at a national level or when trading on private land. This piecemeal licensing system has contributed to declining public confidence in the reputation of markets. A voluntary scheme has been set up by The Market People, backed by the National Association of British Market Authorities (NABMA) to address this problem. It provides consumers with traceability of traders and goods as well as the ability to rate and contact the traders. A MarketPASS is issued to an operator or trader, once they have provided proof of identity, insurance and, where required, a hygiene certificate.\nA study conducted by the Retail Alliance noted that Britain had 1,124 traditional retail markets, 605 farmers\u2019 markets, 26 wholesale markets and more than 45,700 retail traders and that retail markets had an annual turnover of over \u00a33.5 billion while wholesale markets had turnover of \u00a34.1 billion annually. The data also shows that traditional outdoor street markets continue to dominate the market space, but are in decline. Markets also have significant appeal for tourists and visitors.Some researchers make a distinction between traditional markets and gentrified markets. Traditional markets which are primarily held outdoors on specific days, focus on high volume produce sold with low margins. In the gentrified market, the focus is on specialty produce, notably organic foods, hyper-local produce, artisanal products, vintage clothing or designer brands. Whereas traditional markets are in decline, gentrified markets represent a major growth opportunity.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n====== England's chartered markets and fairs ======\nFrom the 11th century, the English monarchs awarded a charter to local lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village. A charter granted the lords the right to take tolls from vendors and also afforded some protection to a town from rival markets. Once a chartered market was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days. Across the boroughs of England, a network of chartered markets sprang up between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise. Gradually these market towns developed a reputation for quality or for trade in specific types of goods. Today, traders and showmen jealously guard these historic charters.\n\n\n===== County markets =====\nCovered Market, Oxford, Oxfordshire\nCovered Market, Preston\nLeeds Kirkgate Market, Yorkshire\nOld Market, Bristol Gloucestershire\nThe Old Market, Hove\nMarket Harborough Leicestershire\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n====== London ======\n\nBetween the 13th century and the Great Fire of 1666, London's main market was the Stocks Market, \"on the site of the fixed pillory where traders were punished who fell foul of the Assize Courts.\"  The Stocks Market was removed in 1737 as part of Christopher Wren's plans to rebuild the city. New wholesale markets were erected in strategic locations and these prospered until well into the 19th century with some continuing until modern times. The wholesale markets were highly controlled, closed environments that were minutely regulated and meticulously planned. These included Smithfield Meat Market (built in 1866), Billingsgate Fish Market (constructed in 1875) and Leadenhall Market (completed in 1881). The retail trade was largely serviced by itinerant street sellers or costermongers. In central London, costermongers worked along designated routes, selling door-to-door or by trading from some 36 unauthorised, but highly organised markets situated along major thoroughfares or meeting places such as Whitecross Street, Covent Garden and Leather Lane. In an attempt to regulate street trading, a number of authorised retail markets were built during the 19th century with limited success. Examples of retail markets constructed during this period include: St James, St George's (Southwark), Carnaby, Hungerford, Randall's (Poplar, London), Fitzroy, Finsbury, and the People's Market (Whitechapel), Angela Burdett-Coutts\u2019 Market and Columbia Road Market (now a flower market). Retail markets were less successful than their wholesale counterparts and the number of retail markets declined from 24 in 1800 to 17 in 1840. In reality, London's working classes generally preferred the convenience of street trading which continued to thrive until the 20th century.Charles Knight devoted an entire section to markets in his pictorial essay, Pictorial Half-hours of London Topography, (1851) in which he identifies the main wholesale markets as the Corn Market; the Coal Exchange; Billingsgate - the main fish market; Smithfield - a cattle market since at least 1150. Retail meat markets include Newgate;  Whitechapel; Newgate; Newport, Oxford; St George's and Shepherd's Market in Mayfair.  Produce markets included Covent Garden, which Knight considered to be the 'pre-eminent' vegetable market; Farringdon Market between Holborn Hill and Fleet Street; Spitalfields - the largest potato market in London; Portman Market, Hungerford Market and Leadenhall Market- a mixed produce and meat market. In addition, the Skin Market at Bermondsey dealt in leather and hay markets were held at Whitechapel, Cumberland Market, Regent's Park and Smithfield.Some examples of street markets operating today include Berwick Street Market, Broadway Market, Camden Market, East Street Market, Petticoat Lane and Portobello Road Market. The most popular for food is Borough Market which sell most fresh produce as well as having a bakery.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWholesale markets in LondonNew Covent Garden Market\nBorough Market\nOld Billingsgate Market\nLeadenhall Market\nSmithfield Market\nSpitalfields MarketRetail markets in LondonBermondsey Market\nBrick Lane Market\nBroadway Market\nCamden Market\nInverness Street Market\nIslington Farmers' Market\nGreenwich Market\nHungerford Market\nLeadenhall Market\nPetticoat Lane Market\nPiccadilly Market\nPortobello Road\n\n\n==== Southern Europe ====\n\n\n===== Greece =====\n\nStreet markets in Greece are called laikes agores (\u03bb\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c2) in plural, or laiki agora (\u03bb\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03ae \u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac) in singular, meaning \"people's market\". They are very common all over Greece, including the capital, Athens. Regular (weekly) morning markets sell mostly fresh produce from farming cooperatives \u2013 fruit, vegetables, fish and flowers/plants. Some household items and prepared foods are often available.\nAnnual street markets (panigyri(a)) occur around churches on the day of their patron saint. These take place in the evenings and have a more festive character, often involving attractions and food stalls. The goods sold range from clothing and accessories to household items, furniture, toys and trinkets. Athens also has several bazaars/enclosed markets.\n\nNew Market (Nea Agora), Rhodes Island, Greece\nCentral Municipal Market, Athinas Street, Athens - a 19th-century market\n\n\n===== Italy =====\n\nCampo de' Fiori, Rome\nMercato del Vino Chiatia Classico Gallo Nero - seasonal wine fair, Greve, Chianti\nMostra Mercato Internazionale dell'Artigiano - seasonal handicrafts' market, Fortezza da Basso\nMostra Mercato Internazionale dell'Antiquaratio - seasonal antiques' market, Palazzo Shrozzi\nMercato centrale di San Lorenzo, Florence\nTestaccio Market, Rome\n\n\n====== Ancient and historic Italian market places ======\nTrajan's Market, Rome - ruins of ancient market place\nLoggia de Mercato Nuovo, Florence, built between 1547 and 1551 by Giovanni Battista del Tasso and is currently under restoration\nLoggia de Mercado Vecchio,  now demolished\n\n\n===== Spain =====\nIn Spain, two types of retail market can be identified; permanent markets and periodic markets. Permanent markets are typically housed in a building dedicated to the use of stallholders and vendors. Periodic markets appear in the streets and plazas on specific days, such as weekends or festival days and most often sell products made by local artisans including leather goods, fashion accessories, especially scarves and costume jewellery. Vendors at periodic markets typically erect tents or canvas awnings to provide some type of temporary cover for themselves and shoppers.  Produce markets, farmers' markets and flea markets are all commonplace. In addition, street vendors are a relatively common sight across most parts of Spain. Street vendors roam around in search of a suitable venue such as a plaza, entrance to a railway station or beach front where they lay their goods out on mats. Products sold by street vendors are of highly variable quality.\n\n\n====== Barcelona ======\n\nThe first reliable recorded references to markets in Barcelona date to the 10th century. Barcelona, at that time, was a walled city and the first open-air market was held outside the walls, (in the area now known as Pla\u00e7a de l'\u00c0ngel). A merchant district soon grew up around the market. During the 19th century, numerous covered markets were erected, specifically Santa Caterina Market (1844); San Josep (c. 1840), Llibertat (1875), San Antoni (1882), Barceloneta (1884), Concepci\u00f3 and Hostafrancs (1888), Clot and Poblenou (1889) and Abaceria in Gracia (1892).Barcelona residents are well served by the city's 39 produce markets. Every barrio (suburb) has at least one fresh produce market. It is often said that no matter where you find yourself in Barcelona, you are never more than 10 minutes walk from a market. Barcelona's markets attract some 62 million visits yearly, turnover \u20ac950million and employ 7,500 people.Some of the larger produce markets still in operation include: La Boqueria; Mercat del Born - a modernist construction, Mercat de San Antoni located in the barrio, San Antoni; Mercat de San Andreu in San Andreu; Mercat de Santa Caterina in L'Eixample, Mercat de Ninot, in L'Eixample; Mercat de la Concepci\u00f3 also in L'Eixample; Mercat de la Llibertat in Gr\u00e0cia; Mercat de Sants in Sants-Montjuich; Mercat de Galvany in Sarri\u00e0-Sant Gervasi; Mercat de Vall d'Hebron. In addition, Barcelona offers many non-food markets including the street market, La Flor de Las Ramblas, Dominical de Sant Antoni, Encants de Sant Antoni and Encants Barcelona - Fira de Bellcaire.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n====== Bilbao ======\nMercado de la Ribera\n\n\n====== Madrid ======\nThe main markets in central Madrid are San Anton Market, San Miguel Market - a gourmet tapas market, C\u00e1mera Agraria (Madrid Farmers' Market) and El Rastro - the largest open air flea market.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n====== Valencia ======\nThe Mercat or Mercado Central is the main public market in Valencia. Built at the turn of the twentieth century, the building combines Gothic and Art Nouveau architectural features. Popular with both locals and visitors, a distinctive feature is the quality of fresh fish and seafood, which once purchased can be taken to the street stalls around the perimeter of the market who will cook it to order. The Mercado de Col\u00f3n in Eixample, Valencia is also a very popular fresh produce market.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n====== Seville ======\nPopular markets in Seville include the Triana market and the Central market housed within the Metropol Parasol complex. In addition, Seville offers many smaller neighbourhood markets such as Mercado de la Calle Feria and Mercado de la Encarnaci\u00f3n.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Southeastern Europe (Balkans) ====\n\n\n===== Croatia =====\nIn Serbo-Croatian, a farmer's market is formally known as tr\u017enica, and colloquially as pijaca, plac or pazar depending on region and dialect. \n\nDolac, Zagreb\n\n\n===== Serbia =====\nIn Serbo-Croatian, a farmer's market is formally known as tr\u017enica, and colloquially as pijaca, plac or pazar depending on region and dialect.

A public market has a sponsoring entity that has legal and financial responsibility to oversee operations and, sometimes, provides facilities to house the market activity. Public markets may incorporate the traditional market activity \u2013 the sale of fresh food from open stalls \u2013 and may also offer a wide range of different products. Public markets may incorporate elements of specialized markets such as farmers markets, craft markets, and antique markets. Traditionally public markets in the US were owned and operated by city governments, but this is no longer the case.According to the Ford Foundation, what distinguishes public markets from other types of related retail activity are three characteristics. Public markets:\nhave public goals, a defined civic purpose. Typically, these goals include: attracting shoppers to a central business district, providing affordable retailing opportunities to small businesses, preserving farming in the region, and activating or repurposing public space\nare located in and/or create a public space in the community, where a wide range of people mix, and are, or aim to be, a heart of the community\nare made up of locally owned, independent businesses operated by their owners, not franchises. This gives public markets a local flavor and unique experience.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===== List of public markets =====\nAlemany Farmers' Market \u2013 San Francisco, California\nBoston Public Market \u2013 Boston, Massachusetts\nBroad Street Market \u2013 Harrisburg, Pennsylvania\nBrooklyn Flea \u2013 Brooklyn, New York\nChattanooga Market (2001\u2013present) \u2013 Chattanooga, Tennessee\nChicago farmers' markets Chicago, Illinois\nCity Market (Charleston, South Carolina)\nCity Market (Petersburg, Virginia) \u2013 Petersburg, Virginia.

Paddy's Market, near Chinatown, is the produce market and operates Wednesday through to Sunday. Haymarket is one of the main produce markets and is located in Flemington.  The Sydney Fish Market, in Pyrmont opens from 7am Wednesday through Saturday. Paddington Markets on Oxford Street sells a range of goods from fresh produce through to clothing.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===== Perth =====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===== Adelaide =====\nAdelaide Central Market\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===== Hobart =====\nSalamanca Market\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Papua New Guinea ====\nDrawing heavily on the anthropological literature, Benedicktsson argues that a distinct type of Melanesian market  that is substantially different to other Asian markets, can be identified. The key characteristics of the PNG market are that it is dominated by producer-sellers, most of whom are women. Prices are set at the start of the day's trade, and rarely change. Haggling and aggressive selling are rarely practised. At the end of the day's trade, produce is not cleared, but rather is taken away for the seller's private consumption or is distributed among kin and close family.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== South America ===\n\n\n==== Brazil ====\nMercado Municipal \u2013 S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo\nLiberdade street market \u2013 S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo\nMercado P\u00fablico \u2013 Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul\nMercado Municipal \u2013 Uberl\u00e2ndia, Minas Gerais\nMercado Modelo \u2013 Salvador, Bahia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Chile ====\nMercado Central de Santiago, the central market of Santiago de Chile\n\n\n==== Uruguay ====\nMercado Modelo, a central fruit and vegetable wholesale market in Montevideo\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProject for Public Spaces page on public markets",

        "wiki": "The University of Pretoria (Afrikaans: Universiteit van Pretoria, Northern Sotho: Yunibesithi ya Pretoria) is a multi-campus public research university in Pretoria, the administrative and de facto capital of South Africa. The university was established in 1908 as the Pretoria campus of the Johannesburg-based Transvaal University College and is the fourth South African institution in continuous operation to be awarded university status. The university has grown from the original 32 students in a single late Victorian house to approximately 53,000 in 2019. The University was built on 7 suburban campuses on 1,190 hectares (2,900 acres).The University is organised into nine faculties and a business school. Established in 1920, the University of Pretoria Faculty of Veterinary Science is the second oldest veterinary school in Africa and the only veterinary school in South Africa. In 1949, the university launched  the first MBA programme outside North America and the university's Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) has consistently been ranked the top business school in Africa for executive education, as well as being placed in the top 50 in the world. In 2012, the Financial Times ranked the GIBS Executive MBA 1st in Africa and 60th in the world.Since 1997, the university has produced more research outputs every year than any other institution of higher learning in South Africa, as measured by the Department of Education's accreditation benchmark. In 2008, the university awarded 15.8% of all masters and doctorate degrees in South Africa, the highest percentage in the country.The university is commonly referred to as UP, Tuks, or Tukkies and in post-nominals the university is typically abbreviated as Pret or UP, although Pretoria is also used in official publications.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundational years: 1889\u20131929 ===\nThe day might come when the Transvaal University College might mean to the Transvaal what Oxford University has meant to England. A long time might have to pass, and for a hundred years we might have to watch the grass growing on our lawns before that day arrives, but noble beginning has been made.\n\nThe proposal for a university for the capital, first mooted in the Volksraad in 1889, was interrupted by the outbreak of the Anglo Boer War in 1899. In 1896, the South African School of Mines was founded in Kimberley. Eight years later, in 1904, the school was moved to Johannesburg and was renamed the Transvaal Technical Institute. The school's name changed yet again in 1906 to Transvaal University College. In 1902, after the signing of the Peace of Vereeniging, the Normal College for teacher training was established in Groenkloof, Pretoria. On 4 March 1908, when the Transvaal University College (TUC) transferred its arts and science courses to its newly established Pretoria Campus the precursor to the university was established, initially offering courses in languages, sciences, and law.Instruction commenced with 32 students, 4 professors and 3 lecturers in the Kya Rosa, 270 Skinner Street a late Victorian residence purchased from Leo Weinthal the then owner of The Press (forerunner to the Pretoria News Newspaper). The first four professors were Prof H. Th. Reinink (Dutch), J. Purves (Scottish), D.F. du Toit Malherbe (South African) and A.C. Paterson (Scottish), who would also become the first Vice-Chancellor.In 1910, the Colonial Secretary, General Jan Smuts tabled the act constituting the university as a separate entity before the Transvaal Parliament, the \"Transvaalse Universiteits-Inlijvingswet\" Law 1 of 1910. On 17 May 1910, the Johannesburg and Pretoria campuses separated, each becoming an independent institution. The Johannesburg campus being reincorporated as the South African School of Mines and Technology, while the Pretoria campus retained the name of Transvaal University College until 1930. The South African School of Mines and Technology would later go on to become the University of the Witwatersrand in 1922. In 1910, the TUC acquired its own campus in the east of Pretoria, what is now the western part of the university's main campus in Hatfield. On 3 August 1910, Governor-General Herbert John Gladstone, 1st Viscount Gladstone laid the cornerstone of the Old Arts Building, the first building to be built on the newly established Hatfield campus. The building's striking Cape Dutch and Neo-Romanesque architectural style was recognised in 1968 when it was declared a provincial heritage site. During this time the colloquial name for the university, Tukkies or Tuks, was derived from the Afrikaans acronym for the college, i.e. Transvaalse Universiteitskollege (TUK).\nThe late 1910s and early 1920s saw the establishment of several faculties as the academic activities were expanded. Courses in agriculture (1917), theology (1918), economics and political science (1919), veterinary science (1920), and music (1923) were established as the institution grew.\n\n\n=== Establishment and expansion years 1929\u20131982 ===\n\nOn 10 October 1930, the University of Pretoria Private Act, No. 13 of 1930 changed the name of the TUC to the University of Pretoria. The TUC originally established as an English medium institution had evolved into the only fully bilingual university in South Africa and remained as such until the early 1930s. The rapid increase of Afrikaans speaking students brought about an imbalance between the demographics of students and the languages of instruction. By 1931, although 65% of students were Afrikaans speaking, 68% of the classes were conducted in English. In 1932, the University Council addressed the imbalance, deciding that Afrikaans would become the only medium of instruction. An increase in student numbers necessitated the building of new facilities such as the Club Hall and Administration Building (colloquially known as the ship) when the 7th faculty, the Medical Faculty, was established in 1943. This period further saw the establishment of numerous student activities such as the annual Spring Day event and intervarsity. Student publications established include the Trek in 1931, the first Rag Mag in 1936 and the weekly student newspaper, Die Perdeby in 1939. The period of 1948\u20131982 is characterised by the substantial increase in numbers of an almost exclusively white student body and the concomitant physical growth of the university infrastructure. The nearly doubling of student numbers demanded the physical expansion of the Hatfield campus and new buildings were built in quick succession as the campus grew eastward. In the mid-1960s, the university urgently required additional land and acquired the adjacent property of Christian Brothers' College, Saint Gabriel's. This property now forms the eastern section of the Hatfield campus.\nIn 1949, the university founded the Graduate School of Management (GSM),\n\n\n=== Transformation years: 1982 and beyond ===\n\nDuring the period of 1982 to 2008, the university transformed into a bilingual, multiracial and inclusive institution. The comparatively smooth introduction of students from all races formed the initial impetus for transformation and in 1989 the university was declared officially desegregated and opened for all races. In 1993, a policy document was introduced, aiming to position the university in a newly democratic South Africa. In 1994, the university regained its status as a bilingual university when a new language policy was adopted. However, in 2019 a new language policy was adopted which discontinued Afrikaans as a language of instruction in favour of English only.In 1999, the only two veterinary science faculties in the country, those of the University of Pretoria and Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, formerly Medunsa, were amalgamated. The university's Onderstepoort campus once again housed the only veterinary faculty in South Africa. In 2000, the Teachers Training College Pretoria, formerly the Normal College Pretoria founded in 1902, was incorporated into the university's Faculty of Education, which saw the faculty moving to the self-sufficient Groenkloof campus.The university's business school in Illovo, Johannesburg, the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS), was established in January 2000 following a substantial contribution by Sir Donald Gordon, the founder of Liberty Life and Liberty International, and a major investment by the University of Pretoria following discussions which started in 1998. The now defunct Vista University's Mamelodi campus was incorporated on 2 January 2004, as part of the restructuring of South African tertiary institutions. In 2011, GIBS opened a satellite campus on Pritchard Street in the inner city of Johannesburg. The Business school follows on the university's, now defunct Graduate School of Management's, long tradition of MBA tuition as the first business school outside North America and replaced it in January 2008.\n\n\n== Administration and organisation ==\n\n\n=== Governance ===\n\nAs set out in the Higher Education Act No 101 of 1997, the university is governed by the Council with the Vice-Chancellor and Principal, Tawana Kupe, the executive head responsible for the day-to-day administration, and the Chancellor, Wiseman Nkuhlu, being the non-resident titular head of the university. The Registrar is responsible for the academic administration of the university, as well as legal matters, and is secretary to the University Council and Senate.\nThe university's academic activities are divided into nine faculties and one business school. Whilst the faculties comprise 140 departments and 85 institutes, bureaus and centres.\n\n\n== Main Campus ==\n\n\n=== Hatfield ===\n\nThe university's main campus and central administration offices are situated in the suburb of Hatfield, Pretoria and houses six of the nine faculties. The campus, bordered by the suburb of Brooklyn to the south and Hatfield to the north, was built over 24 hectares (59 acres) and has more than 60 buildings of historical value.Adjacent to the Hatfield Campus is the Hillcrest Campus, which contains the High Performance Centre and LC de Villiers Sports Grounds, which were developed on 76 hectares (190 acres). Adjacent to the sport grounds is the university's experimental farm, which is used to conduct field experiments for the Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences. The campus is served by the Hatfield Gautrain station connecting Pretoria and Johannesburg. A university bus shuttle service operates between the Hatfield campus and the Groenkloof and Prinshof campuses, whilst a park-and-ride shuttle service operates between the Hatfield and Hillcrest campus.\n\n\n==== Museums ====\nThe university's art collection consists primarily of paintings, sculptures and graphic works by South African artists including the likes of Jacobus Hendrik Pierneef, Gregoire Boonzaier, William Kentridge and Sam Nhlengethwa. The collection also incorporates artworks by renowned international artists such as Max Pechstein, K\u00e4the Kollwitz, Max Liebermann, George Grosz, Otto Mueller, Rembrandt van Rijn, Thomas Benton and Marc Chagall. The university's sculpture collection, the largest such collection in South Africa, contains sculptures by Sidney Kumalo, Maureen Quinn, Michael Teffo,  Anton Smit and others.\nThe Old Arts Building was proclaimed a provincial heritage site in 1968 and houses the Van Tilburg Collection, Van Gybland-Oosterhoff Collection and Mapungubwe Collection. The Van Tilburg Collection is a permanent museum that exhibits 17th and 18th century furniture, paintings, Delft ceramics and other works of art, and includes the largest South African collection of Chinese ceramic objects, from the Qin (221\u2013206 BC), Han (202 BC \u2013 AD 220), Tang (AD 618\u2013906), Song (AD 960\u20131279), Ming (1368\u20131644) and Qing (1644\u20131912) dynasties.What survives are the almost untouched remains of the palace sites and also the entire settlement area dependent upon them, as well as two earlier capital sites, the whole presenting an unrivalled picture of the development of social and political structures over some 400 years.The university is the custodian of the collection of artefacts found at the Mapungubwe National Park and World Heritage site and such display these artefacts in the Mapungubwe Museum. Gold ornaments, ivory, bone, ceramic-ware, clay figurines, trade beads, iron and copper artefacts are on permanent public display. The Van Gybland-Oosterhoff Collection is a ceramic collection, donated by Dr Horace Hugo Alexander van Gybland Oosterhoff and accepted by the university on 14 March 1939, is the largest collection of objects, publications, memorabilia and photographs of historical interest, relating to Dutch culture outside the Netherlands.The Old Merensky Library houses the Edoardo Villa Museum. The Edoardo Villa Museum currently houses the largest collection of sculptures by the Italian artist Edoardo Villa and one South Africa's most renowned sculptors, who was mentored by Minotti at the Scuola D\u2019Arte Andrea Fontoniby.The Van Wouw Museum is the largest collection of bronze, marble and plaster sculptures by the famous pioneer South African sculptor, Anton van Wouw (1862\u20131945). Van Wouw, who is widely regarded as the founder of traditional sculpture in South Africa, created masterful artworks portraying Boer figures and the indigenous peoples of South Africa. Besides documents, photos, paintings and tools the exhibits are mainly bronze maquettes and casts of Van Wouw's sculptural work. The Van Wouw Museum is housed in Anton Van Wouw's last residence, a Dutch national monument.\nOther minor art collections include the Christo Coetzee collection which was bequeathed to the university by the artist in 2001 and consists of more than 3000 objects,  NPK Ceramics Collection, Hilgard Muller Collection, Mike Edwards Collection, Kruger Collection, Frans Esterhuizen Cartoon Collection, Hansie Visagie Puppet Collection, Friends of the Pretoria Art Association Art Collection, Baldinelli Trust Collection and Mimi Coertse Collection.\n\nThe University's Science, Engineering and Technology (SET) Discovery Centre, Sci-Enza, was officially launched in 1977. The Discovery Centre is an umbrella complex where young children, students and adults can explore the world of science, engineering and technology in a \"play-as-you-learn\" way. Activities at the Centre museum include: a digital planetarium; exploratorium; camera obscura; biological science exhibit; botanical garden and indigenous technology exhibit.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Key places ====\n\nThe main hall and site of ceremonies, the Aula, was designed by Karel Jooste and completed in 1958. The Aula was the first Opera House to be built in the capital and remained the major venue in the city until the State Theatre's completion in the early 1980s. The 1012-seat auditorium has played host to foreign dignitaries, presidents and local and international artists. The main music complex, comprising the 500-seat Musaion and 3000-seat Amphitheatre, was built between 1960\u20131964. The University Chapel, formally the Church of Saint Alfons Maria de Liguori, and the accompanying Monastery, was built in 1925 and was bought from the Catholic Church in 1980. Saint Alfons, who was canonised in 1839, was the founder of the order of Ligournians (or Redemptorists), an order founded in 1732 in Naples, Italy and dedicated to helping underprivileged communities.\n\n\n== Other campuses ==\n\n\n=== Onderstepoort, Pretoria ===\nThe possibility of training veterinarians in South Africa was frequently raised after the first Colonial Veterinary Surgeon in South Africa was appointed in approximately 1874, but it was not until 1920 that the Swiss-born veterinarian, Sir Arnold Theiler, was appointed as Director of Veterinary Education and Research at Onderstepoort under the supervision of the then Transvaal University College. New facilities were inaugurated at the end of 1921 and the first residence was opened in 1924. The first eight South African trained veterinarians qualified in 1924.\nThe Faculty of Veterinary Sciences was developed on the 65 hectares (160 acres) Onderstepoort campus, with buildings covering a total of 55,000 square metres (590,000 sq ft) 30 kilometres (19 mi) north-west of the Hatfield campus and 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) north of the Pretoria city center. The Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital provides clinical services rendered with full student participation as part of the primary teaching mission of the Faculty of Veterinary Science.  It is the only faculty in South Africa educating veterinarians and veterinary nurses.\n\n\n=== Groenkloof, Pretoria ===\n\nDuring the Conference of Teachers in Town and Refugee Camp Schools of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony of 1\u201310 July 1902, a resolution was passed to establish \"Normal Schools\" for the education of teachers in Johannesburg and Pretoria. The Pretoria Normal School, was first established in a house in 126 Rissik Street. In 1903 the Johannesburg Normal School's 40 students were transferred to Pretoria when it was closed and the Pretoria and Johannesburg institutions were merged to form the Transvaal Normal College. When the Transvaal University College was established in 1908 the first students include students from the Transvaal Normal College. In 1909 the school was renamed the Pretoria Normal College when new teacher training facilities were established in Heidelberg and Johannesburg. In 1954 the school was again renamed to the Onderwyskollege van Pretoria (English: Teachers College Pretoria). In 1974 the University of Pretoria took over the sole responsibility for training secondary teacher from the Teachers College Pretoria.\nAlthough the Teachers College Pretoria purchased new college grounds in Groenkloof during 1975, the college only occupied the new grounds in 1988 and was inaugurated in 1989. The Johannesburg Goudstadse Onderwyskollege, 'Gold-city Teachers College', Transvaal College of Education, Laudium and the Transvaal Education College Soshanguve amalgamate and move their operations to the Teachers College Pretoria in 1993 and the latter two in 1998 respectively. In 2000 the Teachers Training College Pretoria was incorporated into the university's Faculty of Education, which saw the faculty moving from the main Hatfield campus to the self-sufficient Groenkloof campus.\n\n\n=== Prinshof, Pretoria ===\n25\u00b043\u203257\u2033S 28\u00b012\u203210\u2033E\nStudents in the Faculty of Health Sciences are taught at the Prinshof Campus, adjoining the Steve Biko Hospital (formerly Pretoria Academic Hospital and HF Verwoerd Hospital), the main healthcare training facility of the university, and the Tshwane District Hospital. Additional healthcare training facilities include the Kalafong Hospital on the western outskirts of Pretoria in the suburb of Atteridgeville, the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital west of the city centre and built on the site of the old Pretoria botanical gardens and Tembisa Hospital south of Pretoria in the East Rand, Johannesburg.\n\n\n=== Illovo, Johannesburg ===\nThe university's business school, the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS), is situated in a greenfield campus in the Illovo Boulevard, mixed-use commercial node between the suburbs of Rosebank and Sandton in Johannesburg, with a satellite Inner City Campus on Pritchard Street. The Illovo campus is served by the Rosebank Gautrain station, with a nearby Gautrain bus stop and the inner city campus by the Johannesburg Park Station. GIBS Europe operates out of London, United Kingdom offering company specific programmes.\n\n\n=== Other sites ===\nThe Witbank and Hammanskraal satellite campuses, were established in 1988 and 1994 respectively and are used as additional practical facilities and for community engagement. The now defunct Vista University's Mamelodi campus was incorporated on 2 January 2004, as part of the restructuring of South African tertiary institutions. The Mamelodi campus hosts the extended BSc degree programme and functions as the community engagement hub for the university.\n\n\n== Academics ==\n\n\n=== Library system ===\n\n\"This country has given me so much that I am only too happy to be allowed to help it to develop and to be able to give back to it a fraction of what it has given to me\".\nIn 1933, the University decided that the library collection necessitated the building of a new library building, the collection which at that time was kept in the Old Arts building. The library was designed by the South African architect Gerard Moerdijk, following a donation of \u00a310,000 (\u00a3697,337 as of 2018) from mining geologist Dr. Hans Merensky and construction started in 1937. Drawing from his inspiration from Persia and Africa, the design of the building incorporates several architectural styles including Art Deco, Neo-Classicism, Arts and Crafts, Cape Dutch and Regency. The Old Merensky Library was proclaimed a provincial heritage site in 1991.Despite expansions to the Old Merensky Library in 1957, the library subsequently became insufficient to meet the growing needs of the institution and in 1975 the Merensky Library II was completed, currently housing 7 of 9 the faculty libraries. Besides the main Merensky Library complex, the university library system also includes the separately administered Jotello F Soga Library (Veterinary Science), Oliver R Tambo Law Library, Education Library, Mamelodi Library, Dentistry Library and Health Sciences Library.The Oliver R Tambo Law Library houses the Faculty of Law's collection of legal materials and the Law of Africa collection in the library is the single most comprehensive and current collection of primary legal materials of African countries.In 1974 the Jotello F Soga Library of the Faculty of Veterinary Science at the Onderstepoort campus was established and is named in honour of the first South African to qualify as a veterinary surgeon, Dr Jotello Festiri Soga.In 2006 the University established UPSpace, its own open access digital research repository. and the university's library has since become one of 27 partners in the World Digital Library project.\n\n\n=== Archives ===\nIn 1978 the first task group responsible for the investigation in creating an archive system for the University of Pretoria was chaired by Prof. A.N. Pelzer (Vice-rector). Due to the death of Prof. Pelzer in 1981 the project stalled, but by 1994 the need for a central archive system was again recognised by the acting Registrar, Prof. C.R. de Beer. The archives were finally established by 13 September 1994 by the Management of the University and this date is considered as the founding date of the archives of the University of Pretoria.\n\n\n=== Research ===\n\nThe university's achievements and performance in research locally and internationally, including its collaboration and cooperation with the private sector, industry, science councils, foundations and NGOs, the large number of graduates that it produces (particularly doctoral and other postgraduate students) as well as scientists and engineers and its focus on innovation, contribute directly towards enhancing the South Africa's competitiveness. A 2010 report by Centre for Higher Education Transformation identified the university as a top research-intensive university in South Africa. The university is member of the CDIO Initiative, an international engineering education collaboration.\n\nIn 1999 a strategic alliance was formed between the University of Pretoria and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). This alliance, which is known as the Southern Education and Research Alliance (SERA), collaborates locally and internationally with universities, NGOs, companies and multinational bodies in various research areas.Notable research includes:\n\nCentre for Human Rights\nForestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute (FABI)\nAfrican Centre for Genome Technologies\n\n\n=== Digital institutional repositories ===\n\n\n==== UPeTD ====\nUPeTD (University of Pretoria electronic theses and dissertations) was launched in July 2000 and forms part of the university's open scholarship programme. In January 2012 the Webometrics World Ranking of Institutional Repositories ranked the UPeTD website, 69th in the world. The records in UPeTD were migrated to the UPSpace institutional repository in August 2014, and UPeTD was subsequently discontinued.\n\n\n==== UPSpace ====\nUPSpace (Institutional research repository of the University of Pretoria) is the name of the open access digital institutional repository of the University of Pretoria, established as a means for the management and dissemination of digital materials created by the institution and its community members. UPSpace contains a collection of the intellectual and research output produced by past and current researchers of the University of Pretoria. The spectrum of material covered includes the following: historical or archival material, research articles, popular research material, unpublished research, inaugural addresses, conference proceedings, technical reports and open lectures.\n\n\n=== Reputation and ranking ===\n\nLeague table rankings\nThe QS World University Rankings ranks the university as follows:\nIn January 2011 Webometrics ranked the university as the 2nd in South Africa and Africa.In January 2015 Webometrics ranked the university as the 3rd in South Africa and 4th Africa.In July 2015 Webometrics ranked the university as the 4th in South Africa and Africa.\n\n\n== Student life ==\n\n\n=== Residential life ===\nResidence is provided to students in 24 undergraduate and postgraduate residences and 3 postgraduate-only residences spread over the University's campuses. The first students of the Transvaal University College resided in the Kya Rosa, a Victorian house in Skinner Street. In 1915, the first male residence, Kollegetehuis, was constructed on the Hatfield campus and the first female residence, Asterhof, in 1925. Students not living in a University residence can join one of four Day Houses (Luminous, Vividus Men, Vividus Ladies and Zeus) which gives them the opportunity to partake in organised student life activities.\n\n\n=== Student organisations ===\nMore than 100 student clubs and organisations operate on the university campus. These include numerous student government, service providers, and service organisations. The most prominent amongst these are the Student Parliament, Student Representative Council, and Constitutional Tribunal (Student Court). The Student Parliament is the plenary body of student governance and determines the wider mandate for student governance. The Student Representative Council (SRC) is the executive body of student governance and subsequently charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. The SRC is the residential student government, specialising in programming, policy, and facilities and services. Societies are registered in the following categories as catering for religious, political, social, cultural, academic and other. The Constitutional Tribunal is the judicial body of student governance and adjudicates disputes primarily between student organisations. Its judges sit on the panel of student disciplinary hearings. The various service providers are the university's primary programming organisations, serving as a centre of social, cultural, intellectual and recreational life.\n\n\n=== Student activities ===\nThe university has a long tradition of student activities and traditions.

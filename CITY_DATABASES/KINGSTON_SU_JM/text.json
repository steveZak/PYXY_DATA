        "wiki": "Emancipation Park is a public park in Kingston, Jamaica.\nThe park is in New Kingston, opened on 31 July 2002, the day before Emancipation Day. Prime Minister P.J. Patterson's address to open the park he acknowledged that the park is a commemoration of the end of slavery.\n\nThe six-acre park includes fountains and public art. The park is known for the large sculpture Redemption Song at the park's main entrance. Redemption Song, which takes its name from Bob Marley's song of the same name,  is an 11 ft. (approximately 3m) high bronze sculpture by Jamaican artist Laura Facey. The sculpture features a male and female figure gazing to the skies \u2013 symbolic of their triumphant rise from the horrors of slavery. The statue was unveiled in July 2003, in time for the park's first anniversary.\nThe Adinkra symbols can be seen at many places in the park as a tribute to honour the ancestors of Jamaicans who were brought as slaves from West Africa. The architect Kamau Kambui has used these symbols in the perimeter fence, the walls at the entrance, the benches and garbage receptacles.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThe park was opened July 10\n\n\n== See also ==\nParque de la Abolici\u00f3n\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

This was Marley\u2019s home until his death from cancer",

          "Decent place to spend an hour. I came to the museum not knowing anything about Bob Marley so the information was interesting. No photo policy inside the museum which is unfortunate. After the tour ends they trap you at the very end to watch a 30 minute video on Bob Marelys life.",
          "This was actually one of Bob Marley\u2019s home. In the yard of this residence is where there was an attempt on his life. Tour guides are very knowledgeable and have ajamaican charm. Worth the time.",

          "I really liked this place as I came there with my Jamaican friend who lives in Kingston and never been in the museum anyway. We had AMAZING guide. She was singing all the time, knew everything about Bob Marley, his life and his family. I paid 2500 J$ entry but worth every penny.",
          "It was amazing to learn more about Bob Marley and his legacy. The tour guides were great and shared more about the historical, personal, and musical aspects of all that represented Bob Marley. It is worth visiting and gaining additional perspectives and appreciation!",

          "The tour guides of this stop are very full of information here you will see all the records produced, even a visit from Bob Marley him self you must come stop by to see what this means. Enjoy listening to the stories of the past. Enjoy taking in all the sights the sounds of",
          "This was an interesting tour. It was a long ride for this short tour. I was also very hot inside.It really showed how modest Bob Marley was. Although it was a long ride for a short tour, I could not image coming to Jamaica and not visiting the museum.",
          "A great tour for an hour if your local to the museum, as we had to drive for 4 hours there & 4 hours back, I was a bit disappointed, great knowledge of a great legend, just not worth an 8 hour drive for 1 hour tour.",

          "So much rich history about Caribbean music. Loved being there in house that musical icons recorded music and lived in. Worth the visit.",
          "As a fan of Bob Marley this was a neat place to visit. If you don\u2019t particularly enjoy him... this could just be out of the way for you. The tour itself is short, but informative. The trip up to Nine Mile shows you a very different part of the Jamaican countryside.",

          "This museum has a special atmosphere. We had a really nice friendly guide, met a drummer that cooperated with Bob himself and he was teaching us how to play some special instruments. It was real fun. Even though it might seem that the entry fee is kind of high, it\u00b4s definitely",

          "Visiting jamaica this was near the top of our to do list. Mmmm...still unsure what i thought about this little money making venture. Great to drive through the mountains ..beautiful part of the world. Driving up to the house and the men outside was a little off putting.... Great",

          "Rather than visiting here as part of a package our hotel reps organised a private tour ( just for our group) to Kingston . Then we got to see what we wanted rather than just taken to a certain destination. We visited uptown/ downtown Kingston as well as visiting here bobs",

          "It's a must do and it's great to hear the different music as you go around. Our guide told us lots about being a rasta and their way of life too and regularly broke into song. He also involved the group and was really interactive. Good shop at the end for higher quality",
          "Commercially indeed, with its souvenir shops on the way to exit. But it\u2018s a thing a Marley fan have to visit being really near him a moment your life",
          "You can feel the spirit from Bob Marley. The guides are doing a superb job and it might be small for a museun, when you visitJamaica you should include this place. Entrance is a bit expensive , but worth it.",
          "Magical place associated with the reggae king. Professionally organized tour. The museum is located in Bob Marley's former home. Visiting the best in the early morning or after 4pm",
          "We took a group of youth to the museum and they loved it. The guided tour was fantastic, We walked in true history and we were all thankful for having the experience.",
          "This place shows you where Bob Marley used to live. The tour guide was very interactive and gave a very good insight on his history. During the tour there is random singing and it's either you hate or you love it. You have the option to pay in US Dollars, Jamaican Dollars and",
          "Really enjoyed this tour which was just over an hour long. A must see when in Kingston. Excellent history, artifacts, etc.. and we had a great tour guide.",
          "My friends and I visited the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston and it was worth the drive and cost! We learned so much about the life of Bob Marley beyond his music. The guides are amazing, friendly, and will entertain you. A must if you visit Kingston.",
          "So as a local you would think I know about Bob Marley right. But nothing could be more eye opening for me than a trip to this museum. I love it. My guide was good Got us singing and chanting I learnt so much about this great man. This is a must for all visitors both local",
          "Bob Marley was an amazing man and an icon in Jamaica. Too bad his museum is over priced for locals and seems to be a lot of hype. It was fun, but not amazing.",
          "Touring this museum is a walk back in time on Bob Marley's journey and accomplishments. To relate some of the memorabilia to his lyrics is awesome too. Highly recommend it.",
          "If you\u2019re in Kingston or anyplace on the island, this is a must stop, whether you\u2019re a Marley fan or not since his music played such a significant role in the life and culture of Jamaicans. We had a very knowledgeable guide names Johjoy who made the visit extremely interesting",
          "Very informative. Amazing tour guide \"Crazy Curtis. The site and mosuleum were simply beautiful. Not recommended for anyone with mobility issues due to the extent of the tour.",
          "Very imformative. All guests must be with a guide throughout the house. This was fine because it was very informative and interesting. No photos are allowed inside the house but you can take photos around the grounds. There's a little cafe on site also. Highly reccomend!",
          "Great tour but was very very busy only got to see the house for a short while. Lots of information but to enjoy its full potential you have to be into smoking.",
          "If you love Bob Marley...you will love this tour! I understand this was the first place President Barack Obama visited when he came to Jamaica .",
          "I was a bit disappointed with this museum. First, it is very expensive in my opinion (25 USD per person). Second, it is only about his music which might be enough for some people but Bob Marley is more than just Reggae Music and this part is not shown in that museum and not",
          "A very good experience abet lasts way to long. You really need to be a avid fan to enjoy the tour to its most. Expensive to say the least. Child is charged $14/(4 year old) which is a rip off. Good day if an avid fan",
          "This is a great place to visit while in Kingston. Learned a lot about Bob Marley.It is a must do while there.",
          "It\u2019s amazing to see what they have done with the place and how they have managed to conserve it the way it is. Do the tour wether you are a Bob Marley fan or not. Guaranteed by the end of it you will find not only a new found appreciation for him but for Jamaica as a whole.",
          "It's interesting if you are into music. Displays of gold discs. Gift shop is a little overpriced and you can get the music more cheaply in UK, but hey you can say you bought your marley in kingston!",
          "Travelled from Negril to Kingston to visit the museum and if your a fan, it\u2019s a must see! Downside is it\u2019s busy and so the tour is alittle rushed and you have one group waiting on another once your in the house. Outside the house you are free to roam and take as many pictures as",
          "Great little tour however a little disappointing the formation of the wailers gets little mention, especially Peter and Bunny. The museum is all about Bob and his music and is highly organized and professional, however, the original wailers need to be implemented as Bob didn\u2019t",
          "Overall I enjoyed the experience of the tour the tour guide was excellent, funny and full of energy with a real passion for bob's history. The downsides were the rooms weren't air conditioned which at times made the tour uncomfortable other than that I really enjoyed the",
          "It was awesome. learned a lot. the tour guide that took our group into the Marley House was amazing. she was entertaining n cud sing too. it really was a great experience. would love to do it again at the other location as well. One Love.",
          "I'm a big fan of Bob Marley. The museum was his house in Kingston. It includes some of this gold records and awards. It requires a docent to take you through the rooms. Our docent was very good and entertaining.",
          "This for me was one of the better value tours lasting 1 hour 40 mins. It was nice to get a history of his life and where he stayed and made his music. Tour guide was nice and sang some songs for us and talked about the Rastafarian religion which was insightful. I\u2019d go again",
          "Visited here as part of the \u2018a splash of reggae\u2019 excursion with Thomson. After a long journey from Negril, I can say it definitely wasn\u2019t worth it. We arrived and went straight up to the bar whilst we waited for our tour guide. You can buy a Bob Marley shot for $10 and other",
          "We went to the Bob Marley Museum because whilst you're in Jamaica, you've gotta go somewhere to do with Bob Marley!! The tour itself was good and our tour guide was very helpful and informative. But the tour only lasted half an hour and it was boiling hot - to the point that a",
          "I didn't come with great expectations, but I was aactually still negatively suprised. You pay 25 USD (or 2500 Jay, if you want to save some) for a tour of about 80 minutes. The tour guide, Ricky, I believe, was actually quite entertaining, but thats already the good part. You go",
          "Yes, it is a must on a trip to Kinston of course. and yes i did like some of his music, but they have tried to do too much to the place I think.",
          "I saw this on the main road as I was passing and thought I must go there. So glad I did. It's a guided tour and you can't go around the house on your own but the thrill for me was that I had no idea that it was the house where he actually lived. The tour guide was knowledgeable",
          "The Legend lived here and recorded all the beautiful songs we still hear and cherish .... this place reminded me of the song No woman No cry and this is the place which still saves the treasure of Bob Marley's unreleased songs which I await to hear some day !!!",
          "This is a good tour. Very professional and gives a great history of Bob Marley and his ride to fame.",
          "The tour guide was wonderful, she had a nice voice and sang a lot of Bob's songs during the tour, encouraging everyone to join in. It was fun and very lively.",
          "It is interesting but prices in gift shop hare high . lots of weed for sale inc weed cake . from Negril it is a long way 3 hrs plus you need to take plenty of water as it is dear to buy. The museum lacks content yes bits are interesting but it is a long way to go on terrible",
          "Interesting tour of Bob Marley former home and studio with fun guide singing all the way through. Would recomended anyone who is visiting Kingston to go.",
          "Working overseas and wanted to fit this in. Our host was Vanessa who was sparky and sharp who made it fun, educational and melancholy at the right time. The man was a genius taken far too early - sad that the concept of one love is farther away then ever Visit this place and",
          "An hour and a bit away from Montego Bay, the Bob Marley tour is hidden in the hills of Nine Mile. It is a bumpy journey in the mountains but was totally worth it. The moment you get of the bus, you have the opportunity to purchase some local herbs to enrich the experience.",
          "What a waste of money and time.A shell of a house with a few rooms of discs and awards,2 cut down pairs of his shorts,a couple of shirts,and denim covered bed.Our guide seemed so content at showing us her vocal range and singing prowess at every opportunity,with a painful",
          "The museum is quite small, we saw 3 or 4 rooms of the house that Bob lived in, listened to the musicians play a few of Bob's songs and then visited Cedella and Bob in their mausoleums. Yes it is possible to buy weed products to smoke, eat or take away with you - if this is",
          "Great tour on the history and a Jamaican icon's life and legacy. The tour is organization and just enough time to get a sense of who Bob was and what he offered as a music icon. Highly recommend this tour.",
          "Our tour guide was amazing she was so lively and made the tour very interesting. It is a shame that I can't remember her name. I think the $25 charge is a bit much and perhaps they need to have a family rate. Also the history of Bob was a bit watered down and focused a lot on",
          "I learned so much about Bob Marley during this tour that I had never heard before. The museum alone which is his actual home converted, brings the legend to life in a powerful way. For example - the bullet hole from the assassination attempt remains. The tour guides are",
          "This is just a tourist grab. They provide no history education not a single thing except ways to get you to spend money there. I see why those who stay in a resort all week want to go. In a resort you don't get a true Jamaican experience. This is sold as just that. It is",
          "This is my 6th time to Jamaica but my first to Kingston.. We visited the museum yesterday, didn't pre book but got there just in time to catch the last tour.. 2 hour tour with a great guide who was entertaining and had a great voice.. sang as we walked around. $25 US to get in",
          "Bob Marley museum is well worth a visit. You get a peak into his life, expertly recounted by Shane our guide. There is lots to see and you have opportunity to ask questions and explore the house and grounds. There is a great film at the end of the tour and a cafe that you can",
          "Definitely a great experience.... our tour guide was very knowledgeable. She made the tour very fun and interactive \"Irie Mon!\" Great souvenirs too! :)",
          "First of all the choice of location is poor.. a house on a busy street and the entrance just off the highway.. u likely to miss it first time.. Then the $25 surcharge.. the security says you cant see anything unless one pays.. and i was already aware there wasnt much to see",
          "After an hour & 20 minute guided tour of this rather quaint museum, the only thing I learned is that Bob, like myself, has a love for blue denim shirts! No pictures are allowed in this home and its certainly understandable why, for there is little to capture. Well, aside from",
          "Definitely a must see on your next trip to Kingston. The tour was very informative. You felt Bob's spirit.",
          "The Bob Marley Museum was a major disappointment. We were charged $95.00 per person, which was too expensive. We were reluctant to pay this amount. However, we wanted to find out more information about this iconic figure. Unfortunately, this experience was not worth $95.00",
          "Pros Highly knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff Cons $25 per person Must be in a tour group No pictures inside the house Things to be noted: A substantial amount of time is watching a video of his performances Some rooms were unavailable when I visited There is a small",
          "As a huge fan of Bob Marley since I was 13 years old it was a highlight of my holiday to visit the museum And it didn't disappoint. Some fabulous memories were revisited here. Our guide was very cool. Young guy. There were only 4 of us on his tour. The other couple were French",
          "The Bob Marley Museum is the site of the home he lived in with his family before his death in 1981. As a longtime fan, and having lived in Jamaica when he died, it was really special to be there. But it was a typical tourist attraction, our host was quite cheesy and didn't",
          "We paid $25 per person. Tiny property and really not much too see. Just an overrated photo op. Unless you are a hard core Bob fan I don\u2019t see how one can justify the cost.",
          "As a huge Bob Marley fan I really enjoyed the museum. It was really interesting to tour his home and learn new things about Bob Marley and his family. Our tour guide was really knowledgeable and funny. I highly recommend the Bob Marley museum.",
          "Sure, if you like Bob Marley, you'll be going regardless of ratings! Is a guided tour of his house, our guide was very enthusiastic which made it enjoyable. Tour lasts around 1.5 hours although 20 mins of that is a film. Nice old relics, would have liked a bit more info about",
          "cool place... bob marley has been an inspiration for me and his music.. very happe to visit an important house. unfortunally is far, it takes 2 hours by a dificult road and almost loose my cruise for that reason, but it was an amazing experience",
          "The tour is about 90 mins and you get to view the inside of Bob Marley's house. This was a nice experience for me. I felt like I got to learn a lot about him that I didn't know before. The house was built in the 1800s but a lot of it is in the original condition in which Mr.",
          "Interesting tour of bob Marley house. Saw his platinum records, Grammy and rooms in the house and the studio where he made music. Saw the shot room where is was attacked by gunmen and survived the shooting. Could be a better experience with more immersive interaction and better",
          "The tour is very informative. A good look into the life and history of the iconic Bob Marley. A bit pricey, bit long...it is the Caribbean so expect it to be a bit warm/hot at times on the outside. The tour guides are very informative and you get to meet a gentleman who played",
          "Loved this place and the tour guide was excellent . We bought tickets and wait around 15 minutes before the tour started. Overall , a good time",
          "I was visiting some friends in Kingston who live there so we were looking for some things to do with our children. We were considering taking our children to the Bob Marley Museum. The website advertised that students of Jamaica would be eligible to pay a rate of $5. Because my",
          "I never really considered myself a Bob Marley fan--but I do like his music and I love the history of music. It seemed a must do thing when in Kingston and I am glad we did. It was interesting to get to know more about him and learn the values he lived by. The tour guide was",
          "You can really feel the presence of all the great people who have spent time in that house! We had Stephan as our guide and he was adorable and great. The tour was very informative and just being in there was so amazing. If you are a Marley fan, YOU MUST DO THIS! We stayed in",
          "At 25.00 USD for the tour of the actual house in which the Legendary Robert Nesta Marley lived, what can I say? It's a bargain. Bear in mind that if you're a local it's pricey and non-English speakers will need an interpreter. Besides the walk-through, one can see and touch",
          "Very interesting for those who love Bob. Worth a visit, you'll learn a lot more about this legend called Bob Marley that left behind a history.",
          "I absolutely loved this Museum. I was so excited going here and I was not disappointed at all. The house is beautiful and it was wonderful to get the opportunity to walk around and get some sort of an idea of Bob Marleys life. Very interesting. I would definitely recommend this",
          "Wow....Great visit, wonderful experience. My eyes were filled with tears learning Bob Marley's story and legacy.... Becky's a great guide and has a beautiful voice!",
          "A bit too commercial, get rid of the car park and really bring it back to the way it was. The guide was enthusiastic, but maybe a little too much. Asking for tips......a big no no! Too many signs get in the way of picture taking.",
          "A must visit for anyone even remotely touched by the music of Bob Marley and the Wailers. As a long time fan - I learnt a lot more about the great man - & my wife became an immediate fan. Our guide was very informative & got the whole group participating in the fun. This is a",
          "It was interesting to see Bob Marley's former house and recording studio, and the tour guides were very knowledgeable and funny. However, you're not allowed to take any pictures inside the museum itself, and it was rather strange seeing him deified, so to speak. A little over",
          "This was my favorite part of the trip. The bus ride up the mountain was long but super beautiful view along the way. Driving through the small towns made me feel like I was seeing the not so tourist part of the island. When we got there people were selling the herb which I",
          "This tour takes about 2 hours, so come prepared to absorb. You aren't walking far, but there is a lot to hear about the Legend. Stay for the movie at the end of the tour to see an interview with Bob.",
          "I enjoyed the visit. After the tour with a very enthusiastic guide, I can say the entrance fee was high. I'm sorry you're not allowed to take pictures. Nice souvenirs but quite expensive for me. Visiting the Bob Marley Museum is a thing to do if you're into him.",
          "I know things in Jamaica are expensive, but this is ridiculously overpriced for what it is. The house and gardens are in good condition, and the guide was very knowledgable about Bob Marley - even claiming to know him from Trenchtown days (however he was probably much too young",
          "Went there to see the museum, and was lucky to have a guided tour - that i can recommend, the tour would not be the same without. Our guide was could tell us a lot about Bob Marley and Jamaicam culture, music - and this was a tour of the Bob Marley history i will always remember.",
          "One of the best museums I've ever visited. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and very amiable! I was riveted from the beginning to the end of the tour. Bob's house is so worth the visit (\u00e7a vaut vraiment le coup)!! I've been twice already and hope to go again this summer!!!",
          "So I was curious about the Bob Marley Museum and what it had to offer me as a local. I thought that as a local, it would take some doing to impress me. The museum is not aesthetically modern, which is fine. There were a lot of souvenirs to be bought, I thought they were",
          "I went with my husband and daughter on May of 2017. When we arrived at the museum, it was a bit scare as the people from the area jump to offer you marijuana. They open the big doors from the museum very quickly. Don't be scare as they smoke marijuana in front of you even the",
          "We went and had the tourist experience. It was very informative and the guides made the tour interactive and fun.",
          "I enjoyed the tour of the museum. I learned a lot about Bob Marley. My grandparents are Jamaican and it was interesting to hear and view the beginning of Reggae music and its influences around the world.",
          "It was a cool activity, completely design for tourist and about \u00a320 the entrance fee. The staff is really friendly and make it all more fun and chilled.",
          "It's definitely worth the price. You get to learn so much about the man, the legend, Robert Nesta Marley.",
          "There was a film which chronicled Bob's experience from the ghetto to stardom. It provided snippet of interviews he has had that unearthed his thinking of inequality and sufferings of the struggling class.",
          "We visited Jamaica for 3 weeks and visited the museum twice in 2 groups. Outside the ticket booth, there's a snack stand & a little hut at the back parking lot for fresh juices and herbal refreshments. A few of our non-herbal friends ate the brownies and were too hot to enjoy",
          "We visited the Bob Marley museum as part of our day off during our time in Kingston and I found it fascinating even though I wouldn't exactly call myself a Bob fan. His life story was told by a very capable female guide who not only showed us round the inside of the property",
          "We all know this legends name we have an idea of what he means to Jamaican people we know his music has reach the corners of the earth but do we actually know his history if you don't then do yourself a favor pay the $25usd and be prepared to learn much . If you are able I would",
          "This was actually much more interesting than I had expected. I love reggae music so enjoyed the tour. The guide was very knowlegable and the movie was great. Too bad the man died so young.",
          "Well, its a great stop, our tour guide knew lots about Bob Marley, i am a fan so naturally its not an objective review... i think its great to hear about a legend who sang songs with meaning, and how his songs still are beautiful even today. Not like todays artists who cant",
          "I love reggae music and although not an avid fan of Bob Marley, I have an appreciation of his music I have to say I loved this tour and found out so much more about how Bob Marley's influence was felt around the world as well as in his local community Great tour guide called",
          "We visited the museum in April 2016, and it was a pleasant experience. Could I live without the experience? Probably. In saying that, there is not a lot to do in Kingston as opposed to some of the other touristy destinations i.e. Negril, Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, so this was a",
          "As a lifelong fan of the great Bob Marley, this trip was high on my list of things to do in Jamaica. Our guide, Jah Fire was awesome. Very interactive and informative and a great singer. The tour starts outside where we were given a brief history of the property and background",
          "The tour cost $25pp. You meet up with your tour guide and about 5-8 others. The tour starts outside and then a walk through of Bob Marley's home. However, if you have difficulty navigating stairs this trip may be difficult as you have to climb stairs inside the home. The tour is",
          "I never thought I'd ever be able to visit Hope Street. One of my top bucketlist items checked off! Now I want to return! XX",
          "We have visited 9 mile and were excited to see and learn about the latter years of Bob's life. The tour guide was very informative, I definitely learned and re-learned some information about the King of Reggae. A must see if you are in this area. It is a considerable ride",
          "If you love Bob Marley this is a must see. The tour was almost 1:45 minutes long. The guides sang too much, had the group shout out too much and tried to interact with the group too much.For example he asked 10 times if we were ready to go and he wouldn't open the door until",
          "Great place of worship and respect for my legend Bob Marley. Been here 3 times now and still love to see the man himself! Legend",
          "The price, worth while. The entry is accommodating and customer friendly. The tour is educational and entertaining. This is the full life story of the iconic Bob Marley, from birth through life to death. After a guided tour you will be entertained and relaxed at the studio",
          "it was amazing to see where Bob Marley created most of his songs...the bed were he slept, his kitchen,the shoot room etc etc..the house is well maintained .. we were so lucky to be at the right time (about closing) and the right spot to witness a friendly soccer game with",
          "Almost every moment in and around the house and museum makes you say \"whoa\". Everything is setup to make you appreciate the worldwide impact of Bob Marley's music. And unfortunately that's the limitation of this attraction. It is a shrine to Bob Marley's music but very light on",
          "Went there on our first day in Kingston and I highly recommend. Visit last abt 1h30 min and is very immersive and informative plus our guide (Stephen) was great too. A must do.",
          "This was well worth the time. Great place to visit to learn about Bob Marley and his impact on the world. It is loaded with awards and personal memorabilia. I learned a lot and would go back.",
          "We couldn't leave without visiting the Bob Marley Museum ... Definitely don't miss it. The guide we had was very friendly and open to answer any questions anyone might have. We actually found out lots of things about Bob that we didn't know before! You get to see and walk",
          "Was so great to see the history behind Bob Marley, the guide was amazing with such a fun way to share Bob's life. The price was excellent and the tour the perfect amount of time.",
          "It was a thrill to visit Bob Marley's home, but the museum as such is lacking. You walk through the empty house with just wall art. Not really much feeling in the house.",
          "Great tour, and rich in culture and history. A must do while in Kingston. Pictures are not allowed inside the house, but it was a wonderful experience.",
          "It was very nice to come back here for a second time \ud83c\udfc3 the vibe was out of this world and the locales was very nice and welcome us with open arms",
          "We really enjoyed touring the house of Bob Marley and the tour guide was informative and funny. I would recommend this for family and singles if you like history, reggae, and a Bob Marley fan.",
          "If you are a reggae fan and particularly a Bob Marley fan, you must visit this museum in Kingston. It was the home in which he and his family lived and is interesting to see. You tour the home with a guide and their photos and documents to see. In the end there's a 10 minute",
          "Don't get me wrong I absolutely love bob Marley. But the tour was absolutely boring, too much talking not enough interesting facts. More music could have been played rather than the guests having to sing.",
          "I had a whistle-stop tour of the museum in the midst of a business meeting. It's a simple place but interesting as a place of calm and kindness in the middle of Trench Town.",
          "Myself and wife enjoyed the museum and the food in the restaurant. We got to see one of Bob Marley's son during our tour that was the highlight of our trip. The experience was good to see an iconic celebrity house and a piece of history in Jamaica. We are grateful of this",
          "This museum certainly satisfies my soul. One Love, if only everyone has this message, the world would be a better place. With thanks to our guide Oshawne, you have our respect, you were amazing. Thank you... Respect.",
          "If your visiting Jamaica this is a must do well worth a visit reggae music and much more you won't be disappointed",
          "Well organised tour. Guides friendly & fun, ensures guest having fun. Attraction being refreshed frequently.",
          "We had such a great time visiting Bob Marley's house in Kingston. The murals around the house are beautiful. Be sure to take plenty of pictures there because you can't take any inside. Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable and entertaining. The tour took about an hour and 20",
          "This is a must visit place when you visit Kingston, Jamaica. I would strongly recommend that you take the structured tour; and ask for Desmond- he made it very memorable and peppered his talks with BMW renditions, with a groovy melodic rustic singing voice. We've been on many",
          "Awesome tour and the tour guides are excellent... ask for tour guide fuzzy he is warm and informative... after the tour I had some brownie and kept flying extra high... very good trip",
          "Excellent vacation stop. Great staff. Great food and beverages at the snack bar. Great murals on the walls in the garden area. A must see on your visit to Kingston.",
          "Boring, If you are old enough to remember when Bob Marley and the Wailers toured in the 70\u2019s there is nothing for you here. You can skip this museum. You know the history.",
          "Very much enjoyed our tour. our guide Nick was very friendly and knowledgeable. It was awesome to see where Bob lived and see all the memorabilia threw out the museum. As a huge Bob Marley fan this was the high light of my trip this year to Jamaica",
          "They have guided tours into the house, you cannot walk inside yourself. But the tour is good and this is a must visit if you are in Kingston.",

          "Bob Marley Museum is a place you don't want to miss on your trip! Filled with memorabilia of the late reggae artiste, one can only reflect on a period gone by and wonder what it must have been like living there. After all, this was his home, now commercialized. My experience has",
          "I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. Primarily because of the vibe from the handsome tour guides. They had jokes and kept things up beat ... without the expertise of the right tour guides its just a house with random marley things.",
          "Definitely worth the money, very informative, our guide Iries Sue made the tour a million times better with her energy and facts. It's a must if your in Kingston!",
          "From setting foot on to the property I felt overwhelmed, this is a place Bob Marley, ate, slept, spent family time, played soccer and wrote and recorded music. It was educational and the guide tried to get everyone in our small and intimate group involved. Don't worry if you",
          "What a great guide. The young lady showing us around made the experience so authentic and real. We as a group joined her in the songs, shared the ups and downs of Bob Marley and our knowledge was so greatly improved. It was as though the man was still there. This is of course",
          "Was really educational and fun.. Enjoyed the tour so much... Only problem was, I couldn't take my phone inside",
          "This was a cool place to visit, not because it was like GraceLand, but because it was a real look into how Bob Marley really lived. Basically it was a \"Stoners Crash Pad\" not in a bad way but that it screamed free spirit. Our tour guide was a \"Rasta\" guy with long dreadlocks",
          "Being an airline employee we have won the prestigious JD Power award twelve years in a row for best low cost airline. We took the trophy to Jamaica and what better way to rep JA than the Bob Marley Museum. Being Jamaican I thought I knew a lot about Bob but this trip proved me",
          "This was the house where Bob Marley lived in his artist days and also used as his record studio, house I well kept and the tour guides do a good job taking you around Bobs life in the house, as well as the stories that happened to him while living there.",

          "A must see if you come to Kingston. All one would expect in a museum celebrating the great legacy of The Legend. Book the tour for the best experience.",
          "If you are a reggae fan you will feel the vibes of the house, visiting the mini studio that Bob used for rehearsals is a mystic experience. Only downside is not being allowed to take pictures.",
          "The Bob Marley Museum is a lot of fun. Take the tour. It's $25 USD per person. They do take credit cards. Get to see his house. Learn a lot about him and his life's ups and downs. Very interesting person. He represents Jamaica well. The tour guides are so nice and sing as well.",
          "This will only be interesting if you a Bob Marley fan and/or a fan of his family's music. I have been wanting to visit this place since I was teenager so I really enjoyed the tour. On the way out we found Julian Marley hanging out in the parking lot, what an exciting surprise!!",

          "I spent two weeks exploring part of Jamaica and my visit to the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston was one of the highlights of the trip. As I waited for the museum tour to begin, I wandered around the grounds admiring and photographing vivid murals that showed aspects of Bob",
          "Well, even not being a luxury house or a fancy neighborhood this nice house now is a museum for the world famous and most influential reggae music icon. The atmosphere there is just something magic",
          "I visited Bob Marley Museum for the first time in 2016. To begin with, the staff there is extremely warm and friendly. The thing that struck me the most though, is how much you can learn on your visit there, and how simple they have laid out the museum for visitors. I will tell",
          "i gotta say i learnt so much on this tour, our guide ricky was fun, knowledgeable constantly making us laugh. walking the halls standing in the rooms, special spots that bob liked was an experience like no other, at the end of the tour we got to watch a little mini movie which",
          "This was a great tour and would be interesting to people who don't really know Bob Marley's music. Our tour guide (all done in small group escorted tours) was fantastic and sang songs along the way. He stayed with us for over two hours even though he could have rushed us",
          "I visited Kingston while on vacation in Montego Bay, Jamaica and took the tour of the Bob Marley Museum. This was his home from 1975 - 1981. I fell in love all over again with Bob Marley and his music! I thought I knew everything about Bob Marley, but I certainly did not! Our",
          "My guide was fantastic! Very informative, fun and enthusiastic! The museum was very interesting. Being a massive fan I already knew a lot, but learnt heaps more than I expected. This is my favourite museum I've been to! A must if you're visiting Kingston!",
          "Visited the Bob Marley Museum while in Jamaica in January 2017. The tour was very enlightening and entertaining. All aspects of Bob Marley's musical life was on display and discussed by the Tour Guide. There was even a short film at the end of the tour with messages from the",
          "this place is mad but in a good way, guides all stoned smoking spliffs , get go in his house and see his tomb can take photographs except for tomb , so much fun music playing , must see if a fan",
          "The museum is great but I wasn't impressed so much by the tour guide as a little OTT and pushed what seemed like their own angle on the contents rather than what was actual, However a trip to Kingston cant be had without this visit.",
          "The museum was pretty cool, however I don't like that it's a guided tour as the entrance is pretty expensive and you don't really get enough time to look at everything because the guide pushes you through to the next room before you have a chance. They also sing during the tour",
          "Visited Bob Marley Museum late January 2017. We were met by a polite lady who ushered us to the office/reception area where we were given information on the tour. We had just missed the timed group tour so had to wait half an hour for the next. A very warm and excited lady",
          "As a huge Bob and Reggae fan, this was a treat for us. Our tour guide, Iris, was so knowledgeable, energetic and passionate. She made our time there what it was. The rooms are full of interesting artifacts from his life. The highlight for us was the recording studio and the",
          "Visited the museum yesterday - on Bob Marley's birthday. What a festival! Lively music pumping from the stage. A lot of people enjoying the atmosphere but not too crowded. My group of friends and I circulated around the outdoor craft booths and stopped into the museum gift shop",
          "You can't go to Kingston without a visit to Hope Road and see where the legendary Robert Nesta Marley lived .... yeah the tour is quite expensive, yeah it's a bit cringe in parts ... but it's so worth it. Interesting, great vibes and I could have just jumped in that hammock and",
          "They were great! Stop by even if you're not going to the museum. The tour guide was great, young light skin guy with dreads..he was great. The juice bar was amazing. The workers were very nice. The smoothies were great! No sugar added, all raw ingredients.",
          "Nice place to visit if you are a Bob Marley fan but be warned, the folks that work there see him as more than a good singer and more even than a national icon, the roots of his Rastafarian beliefs permeates the place and its laborers. Yet the history, music, background info and",
          "I'm not a huge fan but visited here as part of a tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable but our group was large so sometimes we couldn't hear some of the information. The museum is well kept and organised and it was so nice to see Bob's home and many of his original possessions.",
          "Fabiola tour of the Bob Marley Museum ! Loved it and learned so much Well worth the $25 admission fee Our guide was amazing. Very knowledgeable and fun!",
          "Not a Bob Marley fan but I was in Kingston and thought to swing by. The tour lasts about 1h15: it's cool to see his house and hear his story but the house really doesn't have much to see. Many rooms are empty with news articles plastered on the walls. Unless you are in Kingston",
          "My favourite stop of my trip to Jamaica. Oshane (hope I got that right) was a wonderful tour guide, very lively and informative. Adding extra spunk and interest. Left feeling very inspired.",
          "Unfortunately we found our visit to Bob Marley's Museum really disappointing. We booked the trip via Thomson, the bus ride took 3 hours from Lucia and the driver was extremely dangerous. When we arrived we were forced to wait to go to the toilet whilst we waited for people to",

          "We had already been up the mountain to Nine Mile where Bob was born and where he is buried. It was good fun up at Nine Mile but very touristy (i.e. gift shops and money money money). However, we are very happy that this museum was included in our day trip in Kingston. We saw so",
          "I had a great time there. The tour guide Shaun was very knowledgeable and fun. Very authentic and filled with cultural references. When they told us it would take an hour and twenty minutes I thought Id be board halfway through but I was not. It was great to see where Bob",
          "One of the most expensive museums ever on this globe: we were two adults and two small kids and we had to pay more than 50 USD! You are told that the guided tour lasts approximately 1h20. What you are not told is that the last half hour is entirely dedicated to watching YouTube",
          "Visited with the family, the tour lasted about 2 hours in total, we all enjoyed the tour. You get taken round with a guide who is a singer, he got us all singing as we went round Bob Marley's house which was great fun. The guide gave us a detailed biography of Bob's career and",
          "Must be the most authentic Maley experience in his home town, followed by a visit to Trench Town and the Institute to complete a thorough overdose",
          "There aren't really many tourist attractions in Kingston itself, so the Bob Marley Museum is a must see. I'm not a massive fan, but he is such a key figure in Jamaica I wanted to go. You can't just wander the house yourself, it is a guided tour and that actually is the best bit!",
          "You aren't allowed to take pictures inside the house, but you were allowed on the grounds outside which had a lot to photograph. It was a small cute house with tons of items to carry on the memory of Bob Marley and his family. What really made the tour was our guide Shanese.",
          "So, I'm pretty clueless about Bob Marley and it was great education for me. I did not know he was shot. I did not know any of his story. Very neat hearing about a celebrity and his life and rise to the top. If you like history, you may enjoy it. Or if you enjoy reggae and",
          "The museum is jam packed with history and memorabilia of Bob Marley, his family and the Wailers. The tour is guided so it was possible to ask questions and the guide we had was very knowledgeable. In most places it's possible to take photos. There's a cinema where as part of",
          "Very interesting fun place to visit. Lots to learn about the king of reggae in his museum. The tour guide was fun and entertaining. Got lots of great souvenirs. Really fun tour.",
          "This was a nice day trip. We enjoyed the ride. We enjoyed the village. The museum was nice. The only thing we did not like was the people begging for money. Don't give any money. If you give money more people will come.",
          "I admit I don't know much about Bob Marley. But I do appreciate great achievement, vision, and creativity and Marley definitely had all of that. To achieve what he did, coming from the ghetto of a developing country is truly phenomenal. Enjoyed being able to walk through his",
          "Pictures are not allowed to be taken inside. Cameras and cellphones have to given at the entrance. Parking for free but very limited space. Cafe was unorganized. Guides were on duty but no headsets in use. They were screaming all time. We were really disappointed",
          "One of the thing to do in Jamaica is to see this place - Bob Marley's house/Museum. It's a relatively modest house with Bob Marley's award in the bottom floor and almost empty upper level. The museum itself was modest but the guide (forgot her name)made it very interesting.",
          "Visited here on Saturday December 17 2016. My young 4 year old nephew is absolutely obsessed with the Marley's and so had to take him here for his week in Jamaica. Our tour guide Desmond was absolutely amazing and did a great job and he was also friendly with the kids which",

          "I'm a local and have been to the Bob Marley museum at least 4 times. It is constantly evolving and being updated with new items and interactive activities. The tour guides are well informed and interesting. The caf\u00e9 is also lovely and has really cold beers.",
          "I think the best part of this tour was being in the actual sound booth where Bob Marley recorded his greatest hits and seeing the actual stairs in his house that he would run up and down each day for his daily work outs. Its amazing that the kitchen in his house is so tiny. The",

          "Well spend the time and all the money worth it. 25 dollars and the guide was one of the best ever seen. So enthusiastic and know his history of Bob the legend.",
          "Was quite surprised. It was my first experienced being offered drugs. The guide was very informative dispute being high but that actually made it authentic. Not knowing much about Bob Marley except his music it was very interesting to see where he came from and about his life.",
          "It made me cry. See all of the accomplishments made by Bob and his legacy is something that make you feel all right!! The tour was very good and interactive. Great place to see.",
          "Yes it is a tourist trap: overpriced, commercialized and very impersonal. Within 1hr20m you stand outside again and you've been rushed through a very biased small part of the story However, the bob Marley story is very inspiring and a genuine Jamaican hero. The building",

          "Took a last minute tour ($25USD) and was easily able to get a ticket. The tour of the grounds and house offer enough Marley history and some interesting tidbits about his family to educate while still being fun. Highly recommend!",
          "Didn't have any expectations when I decided to visit the Marley museum . Figured I'd see a few gold records and that'd be it. I was pleasantly surprised by what was presented. The tour guide was exceptional. He had an incredible wealth of knowledge and was enthusiastic about",
          "I was living in Jamaica at the time and had been driving past this museum every day on the way to work, from the outside it didn't look much, just another high wall in the middle of a very busy part of Kingston. But I am glad that I paid a visit, and looked behind that bland",
          "The entire faculty, from the grounds to the house, and the theater are beautifully maintained. The tour is incredibly informative and fun. I also liked that on the hot, humid day that I visited, the air conditioning works very well. You can't take photos inside, but there are",
          "I booked the trip through the resort so I don't remember the company it was with. But they were great and the tour was great. We stopped for Jamaican jerk chicken lunch at a local spot and also stopped for shopping. The tour and visit to bob Marleys home was everything we could",
          "Bob Marley's last home is converted into the museum. It has been well preserved down to the location where bullets pierced walls during an attempted assassination of Bob Marley. The tour guide made this tour come alive. He sang and shared lots of details on Bob's life. There is",
          "While I loved his music, the price of admission and the prohibition against photography seemed just too much. Painted pictures in the courtyard and a statue of Bob satisfied me. I left satisfied with just this peek while saving money in the process.",
          "really cool to be shown around bob's house and our guide was very witting and charming. given i had just finished reading marlon james' 'a brief history of seven killings', it was quite something to see the bullet holes. i would definitely recommend this tour, even if it was a",

          "The museum is in Bob Marley's home and you can see that his life comes alive with pictures of his entire family. The tour is comprehensive and you also get to view a video in a beautiful theatre where you can learn more about this legend's life. The shop where you can buy",
          "Really enjoyed the 10 mins clip at the end of the tour, really worth seeing, I appreciated and had the opportunity to learn more about Jamaican culture as well and saw how some of Marley song was inspired, and the life he lived",

          "What can I say time well spent, great guide, it was amazing to walk through the space that this icon inhabited! Hearing the stories seeing the space really put it all together for me. It was truly heavenly, glad I took the time to drive from the North to see this little slice of",
          "The tour was ok but I was expecting more for the price of the tickets. If you are not staying in Kingston I wouldn't recommend driving here just for the museum. No photos or videos can be taken inside of the house. We visited with a child and the tour was not very interesting",

        "wiki": "The National Gallery of Jamaica, in Kingston, Jamaica, is Jamaica's public art museum. It was established in 1974 and is located in the Kingston Mall, a commercial and cultural center on Kingston harbour. The National Gallery of Jamaica also has a branch in Montego Bay, National Gallery West.\nThe gallery houses several important works, mostly by artists from Jamaica, including John Dunkley, Mallica \"Kapo\" Reynolds, Edna Manley, Barrington Watson,  Albert Artwell, Everald Brown,  Cecil Baugh, Albert Huie, Carl Abrahams, Osmond Watson, Judy Ann MacMillan, Omari Ra, Laura Facey, Jasmine Thomas-Girvan, Petrona Morrison, Hope Brooks, Ebony G. Patterson, Philip Thomas and Leasho Johnson .\nThe National Gallery also exhibits works by various international artists and traveling exhibitions. It offers research material on Jamaican art and culture, and coordinates educational programmes.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1972 an Advisory committee was set up, including Sam Hart, Vayden McMorris, Edna Manley, Ralph Thompson, Bernard Lewis, Osmond Watson and Karl \u2018Jerry\u2019 Craig and on 22 November 1974 the National Gallery of Jamaica (NGJ) opened at Devon House, supervised by Liz Milner. Its initial collection comprised 237 paintings and drawings and 25 sculptures that were transferred from the Institute of Jamaica. Maurice Facey was appointed the first Chairman of the NGJ Board of Directors and served in this capacity until 1977 when John Maxwell was appointed as the second Chairman of the Board.  On 2 December 1975 the first appointments were made: David Boxer (Director/Curator), Vera Hyatt (Deputy Director), Roy Case (Director of Development).\nOn 19 July 1976 Five Centuries: Art in Jamaica since the Discovery, the first major survey exhibition on Jamaican art opened, curated by David Boxer. The inaugural Annual National Exhibition opened on 13 October 1977. It superseded the All Island and Self-Taught Artist annual exhibitions previously held at the Institute of Jamaica. In 1978 Boxer curated The Formative Years: Art in Jamaica 1922-1940 which established 1922, the year Edna Manley arrived and started producing art in Jamaica, as the symbolic start date of modern Jamaican art.\nIn 1979 an exhibition called Intuitive Eye, curated by David Boxer, which introduced the concept of \u2018Intuitive art\u2019, opened.\nIn 1981 Maurice Facey was again appointed Chairman of the NGJ Board of Directors and in 1982 the Gallery moved to the Roy West Building, downtown Kingston where Kapo: The Larry Wirth Collection, was established as a permanent gallery. In 1983 the travelling exhibition Art in Jamaica: 1922 to 1982 was launched as a collaboration between the NGJ and the Smithsonian Institution Travelling Exhibition Service (SITES). Curated by David Boxer and Vera Hyatt it was shown at various venues in the US, Canada and Haiti and finally at the NGJ in 1986.\nIn 1985 the Young Talent \u201985 exhibition was held, starting the series, Young Talent. Other Young Talent exhibitions followed in 1989, 1995, 2002 and 2010. In 1986 the first exhibition of installation art in Jamaica, Six Options curated by Rosalie Smith-McCrea was held.  \nThe first Caribbean Invitational exhibition, curated by David Boxer opened in 1988. Participating artists included Francisco Cabral (Trinidad and Tobago), Annalee Davis (Barbados), Brent Malone (Bahamas) and Bernard Sejourne (Haiti). Another Caribbean Invitational was held in 1996.\nSeveral other exhibitions and retrospectives were held in the intervening years (for a complete list see here). In 1992 Aaron Matalon became the third Chairman of the NGJ Board of Directors.\nOn 1 March 2000 the Edna Manley Galleries opened, dedicated to Manley\u2019s life and work, featuring work from the Edna Manley Memorial Collection and other sources.\nIn 2003 Maria Jones became the fourth and thus far only female Chair of the NGJ Board of Directors. In 2006 Trevor Blake became the fifth Chair and in 2008 Wayne Chen was appointed sixth Chairman of the NGJ Board of Directors. In 2009 Veerle Poupeye was appointed the first female Executive Director of the Gallery and in 2012 Peter Reid is appointed seventh Chairman of the NGJ Board of Directors. In January 2014 Charles Campbell began as Chief Curator and continued in this capacity until 31 July. In 2016 Senator Tom Tavares-Finson became the eighth Chairman of the Board of the NGJ.\n\n\n== Developments since 2014 ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nIn Retrospect: 40 Years of the National Gallery of Jamaica.

          "The National Gallery is often forgot because it's out of the way, off the beaten path. But it holds many national treasures ... works done by local artists that are definitely worth the trip. It's a lovely museum, well put together and the staff are willing to answer",
          "The gallery is full of unique history of Jamaica , if your a lover of Jamaican history that the place to go no question ask , you will be proud and , be educated .",
          "Galley was good. In a very sketchy part of town right in front of the police station. I don't think I've ever felt so ill at ease while in the proximity of so much law enforcement in my life. Kingston in general is one of the scariest places ever, a very menacing environment.",
          "The National Gallery is not a large museum compared to other National Art Gallerys around the world but it still has a fine collection. The section with historical paintings gives interesting insights into life in Jamaica in earlier times. However, the real gem for me was the",
          "This is a must see for anyone who is interested in art and culture! Located in Kingston, one can spend hours walking through the different rooms. The variety of artists and mediums of art offer pretty much something for every art enthusiast.",

          "We were really glad we went to the National Gallery. It helped give us a better understanding of the history and culture of Jamaica. As well as insight into the country's politics.",
          "Situated in downtown Kingston on Ocean Boulevard, the gallery contains a collection of art dating from 1000AD to the present time, and basically relates the history of Jamaica in art and sculpture. Well worth a visit, has a small cafe and gift shop on site.",
          "Downtown Kingston is often ignored or feared as a tour site. The National Gallery of Jamaica (NGJ) is worth the trip though...a great collection of art and a lot of effort put into drawing in different people in Jamaica, school children, art festival goers, visitors...and many",
          "I always wanted to see some of Edna Manley's sculpture in person. A visit to the National Gallery fulfilled that desire and much more. I hadn't realized how diverse and engaging Jamaican art is. When we visited the gallery there was a wonderful exhibit on religion and",

          "This museum was originally located at Devon House and moved to its current location in the 1980's. Displays were very well organized and provide an insight to Jamaica's rich history and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. This former hub of Kingston has the potential to become",
          "The National Gallery is a great place to view Jamaican art and is located near the waterfront in Downtown Kingston, which was once the hub of commercial activity in Kingston. While there are plans to revitalise the area, these are slow in the making. Visitng the Gallery",

          "We paid a visit midweek and parked about 50 metres away from the entrance. The gallery was virtually empty and it felt as if it had been opened especially for us. Bags have to be checked in on arrival. The paintings and sculptures were beautiful and really told a story about the",
          "We ventured to the National Gallery downtown and I absolutely loved every minute of it. There is ample parking beside the gallery for $1 an hour, and the entrance into the gallery is $4 for adults. We experienced \"New Roots\" which was on display at the gallery. New Roots",
          "A group of us visitied here with a guide from the Museum. He gave us a great introduction to the art and heart of Jamaica. I wish the gift shop was stocked better. Many of would have spent some cash here on postcards and books on the artwork, but there was nothing here. So",

          "This is an interesting art gallery with a few museum pieces. A good selection of artists old and new. The Edna Manley gallery is of artists influenced by her not her work. The gift shop closes well before the gallery closing time.",
          "Quite a lesson in history and current affairs. the display of local talent is unbeleivable. One would not know that there was so much artistic talent in the island. And the pieces available for sale are quie reasonable in price, even jewelery.",

        "wiki": "Kingston is the capital and largest city of Jamaica, located on the southeastern coast of the island. It faces a natural harbour protected by the Palisadoes, a long sand spit which connects the town of Port Royal and the Norman Manley International Airport to the rest of the island. In the Americas, Kingston is the largest predominantly English-speaking city south of the United States.\nThe local government bodies of the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew were amalgamated by the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation Act of 1923, to form the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC). Greater Kingston, or the \"Corporate Area\" refers to those areas under the KSAC; however, it does not solely refer to Kingston Parish, which only consists of the old downtown and Port Royal. Kingston Parish had a population of 96,052, and St. Andrew Parish had a population of 555,828 in 2001. Kingston is only bordered by Saint Andrew to the east, west and north. The geographical border for the parish of Kingston encompasses the following communities: Tivoli Gardens, Denham Town, Rae Town, Kingston Gardens, National Heroes Park, Bournemouth Gardens, Norman Gardens, Rennock Lodge, Springfield and Port Royal, along with portions of Rollington Town, Franklyn Town and Allman Town.The city proper is bounded by Six Miles to the west, Stony Hill to the north, Papine to the northeast and Harbour View to the east, which are communities in urban and suburban Saint Andrew. Communities in rural St. Andrew such as Gordon Town, Mavis Bank, Lawrence Tavern, Mt. Airy and Bull Bay would not be described as being in Kingston city.\nTwo districts make up the central area of Kingston: the historic Downtown, and New Kingston. Both are served by Norman Manley International Airport and also by the smaller and primarily domestic Tinson Pen Aerodrome.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKingston was founded in July 1693 after the earthquake that devastated Port Royal in 1692, the original section of the city which was situated at the bottom of the Liguanea Plains was laid out to house survivors of the earthquake. Before the earthquake, Kingston's functions were purely agricultural. The earthquake survivors set up a camp on the sea front. Approximately two thousand people died due to mosquito-borne diseases. Initially the people lived in a tented camp on Colonel Barry's Hog Crawle. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by fire in 1703. Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. The new grid system of the town was designed to facilitate commerce, particularly the system of main thoroughfares 66 feet (20 m) across, which allowed transportation between the port and plantations farther inland. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the centre of trade for Jamaica.\nThe government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in Port Royal, and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of Liguanea.\nThe first free school, Wolmers's, was founded in 1729 and there was a theatre, first on Harbour Street and then moved in 1774 to North Parade. Both are still in existence. In 1755 the governor, Sir Charles Knowles, had decided to transfer the government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston.\nBy the end of the 18th century, the city contained more than 3,000 brick buildings. The harbour fostered trade, and played part in several naval wars of the 18th century. Kingston took over the functions of Spanish Town (the capital at the time). These functions included agriculture, commercial, processing and a main transport hub to and from Kingston and other sections of the island. In 1788, Kingston had a population of 25,000, which was about a tenth of the overall population of the island. One in every four people living in Kingston was white, and there was a large population of free people of color there too, meaning that two out of every five people living in Kingston were free. The remaining three-fifths of Kingston's population was made up of black slaves.The government passed an act to transfer the government offices to Kingston from Spanish Town, which occurred in 1872. It kept this status when the island was granted independence in 1962.\n\nIn 1907, 800 people died in another earthquake known as the 1907 Kingston earthquake, destroying nearly all the historical buildings south of Parade in the city. That was when a restriction of no more than 60 feet (18 m) was instituted on buildings in the city centre. These three-story-high buildings were built with reinforced concrete. Construction on King Street in the city was the first area to breach this building code.\nDuring the 1930s, island-wide riots led to the development of trade unions and political parties to represent workers.\nThe city became home to the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies founded in 1948, with 24 medical students.\nNot until the 1960s did major change occur in the development of Kingston's city centre. The international attention of reggae music at that time coincided with the expansion and development of 95 acres (38 ha) of the Kingston city centre waterfront area. These developments led to an influx of shops and offices, and the development of a new financial centre: New Kingston, which replaced the Knutsford Racetrack. Multi-story buildings and boulevards were placed within that section.\nIn 1966 Kingston was the host city to the Commonwealth Games.\nThe western section of the city was not the focus of development, and that area proved to be politically tense. The 1970s saw deteriorating economic conditions that led to recurrent violence and a decline in tourism which later affected the island.\n\nIn the 1980 general elections, the democratic socialist People's National Party (PNP) government was voted out, and subsequent governments have been more market-oriented. Within a global urban era, the 1990s saw that Kingston has made efforts to modernise and develop its city structure and functions. Various organisations such as the Kingston Restoration Company, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), the Port Authority of Jamaica and the Port Royal Development Company, among others sought to develop the urban structure of the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe majority of the population of Kingston is of African descent. Large minority ethnic groups include East Indians and Chinese, who came to the country as indentured servants in the late 19th century. The Chinese occupy important roles in Jamaica's economy especially in the retail markets in Downtown Kingston and the wider metropolitan area. There is also a minority of Europeans, mostly descending from immigrants from Germany and Great Britain. Syrians and Lebanese form one of the most influential ethnic groups in not only Kingston, but the entire island. Though a minority ethnic group, the Lebanese were able to give Jamaica one of its prime ministers, Edward Philip George Seaga. There is a strong undercurrent of bias based on skin color as darker skinned Jamaicans are usually at the very bottom of the socio-economic ladder; a phenomenon evidenced by the disproportionate representation of foreigners and mixed-race individuals in lucrative private sector and government positions. Multi-racial Jamaicans continue to form the second largest racial group, and there is also a small Jewish population in the city.\n79.2% Black\n12.8% Multiracial\n5.2% Asian\n3.4% White\n\n\n== Religion ==\nThere is a wide variety of Christian churches in the city, most of which are Protestant. The chief denominations are Church of God, Baptist, Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal.\nThere is a strong Roman Catholic community, with the Holy Trinity Cathedral which is the seat of metropolitan archbishop and was consecrated in 1911, as well a few Catholic schools and institutions such as the Immaculate Conception High School, St Francis Primary and Infant School, Holy Childhood High School which was founded and is owned by the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of our Lady of Perpetual Help (FMS) in Jamaica.\nAfro-Christian syncretic religions such as the Rastafari movement also have a significant following.\nThe Shaare Shalom Synagogue serves Kingston's Jewish population. The city also has communities of Buddhists and Muslims. The Islamic Council of Jamaica and the Islamic Education and Dawah Centre are both located in Kingston. There are three units of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nKingston plays a central role in Jamaica's economy. The vast majority of economic activity takes place within Kingston, and as most government ministries are located in the city, it is a key force in legislation in regards to Jamaica's finances. The high population density of the capital city means that the majority of monetary transactions occur in Kingston - stimulating much of Jamaica's local economy. The city is also home to the highest number of schools, hospitals and universities anywhere in Jamaica. Kingston is also the island's main transportation hub and its largest seaport.Many multinational conglomerates and financial institutions are headquartered in and around the Kingston Metropolitan Area. Air Jamaica was headquartered in Kingston. The idea of making Jamaica an International Financial Centre has also been proposed as a way to boost the city's financial sector and create more jobs, especially for professionals such as accountants and lawyers.The city's major industries include tourism, apparel manufacturing, and shipping. Many international exports are traded through the city's seaport, with major exports including bauxite, sugar and coffee. The city is also a major tourist destination, and tourism is one of its largest sources of economic activity. The city has suffered economic troubles recently, however, along with the rest of the country of Jamaica. Plans to help the city's economy have made downtown Kingston the subject of numerous redevelopment plans. There have also been attempts to grow the manufacturing industry in the area and to attract call centres to the city.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nKingston is surrounded by the Blue Mountains, Red Hills, Long Mountain and the Kingston Harbour. The city is on the Liguanea plain, an alluvial plain alongside the Hope River. Kingston experiences frequent earthquakes, including the 1907 earthquake.\nKingston has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical wet-and-dry climate (Aw), that borders on a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). characterised by a wet season from May to November, which coincides with the hurricane season, and a dry season from December to April. During the dry season, there is not much rainfall, however, cold and stationary fronts occur at this time, and often bring heavy showers, especially in March. Kingston is in the rain shadow of the Blue Mountains; therefore, little to none of the moisture carried by the Northeast Trade Winds falls over Kingston, causing Kingston to be very dry in comparison to Portland and Saint Mary on the windward side of the Blue Mountains. Kingston is on a coastal location, hence it comes under the influence of the sea, though dense urban development can negate this effect. In the 21st century, Kingston has experienced temperatures as high as 38.8 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) and as low as 13.4 \u00b0C (56 \u00b0F). Between 1895 and 1990, the total average rainfall was recorded at 813 mm (32.0 in), the highest monthly average rainfall recorded in October at 177 mm (7.0 in), and the lowest monthly average rainfall recorded in March at 18 mm (0.71 in). Fog, hail, thunder and tornadoes are all extremely rare.\n\n\n== Housing ==\nIn 1848 the Jamaican government expanded Kingston by constructing new homes in the west, north and east of the city. This housing became highly segregated in terms of race and class and by 1860 the majority of white elites lived on the outskirts of the city.As Kingston's population grew, existing settlements became so densely occupied that marshes in the southwest were filled in to allow the development of new housing. By 1935, continued population growth and poverty resulted in the emergence of slums in the east and west of the city. Later these areas were demolished by the government and residents were rehoused in Denham Town. This development accommodated 3,000 people, leaving more than one sixth of displaced resident homeless. Consequently, overcrowding persisted throughout the city and cramped living condition resulted in public health issues.Suburbanization also became significant and by the 1960s this residential area spread to the foothills of the Blue Mountains. Subsequently, the lack of space and continued consumerism meant this area then expanded to the east of the mountains.In Kingston, 20% of the population now live in squatter settlements. Contrastingly, Kingston is also home to Red Hills, Norbrook, Cherry Gardens, Stony Hill, Jack's Hill, suburbs that hold some of the most expensive houses in all of Jamaica.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThe city of Kingston is home to a number of urban parks which are frequently transformed to accommodate various events and festivities on the Jamaican calendar. The most popular parks include: Emancipation Park, Hope Gardens, Devon House, National Heroes' Park, St William Grant Park and Mandela Park.\n\n\n=== Emancipation Park ===\n\nThe Liguanea Club, a recreational and social club for the upper class in society, located on Knutsford Boulevard, owned over 35 acres (14 ha) of land including the former Liguanea Park now the site of Emancipation Park. The club gave the land measuring seven acres as a gift to the Jamaican Government.\nSeveral government members argued that the land should be converted into a business district, while others felt a multi-functional entertainment complex should be built on the site. The large financial input needed for either venture, was not forthcoming. In 2002 Cabinet granted approval for the transfer of the land to the National Housing Trust on the condition that a park was built and maintained at that location. The land was transferred for one Jamaican dollar.The park is well known for the 11 ft. (approximately 3m) high bronze sculpture done by Jamaican artist Laura Facey, situated at the park's main entrance. This prominent sculpture comprises two naked black male and female statues gazing to the skies \u2013 symbolic of their triumphant rise from the horrors of slavery. The statue was unveiled in July 2003, in time for the park's first anniversary which caused an out cry from the Jamaican populace who believed that the blatant nudity and generous bodily proportions of the figures were very inappropriate to depict the freedom of black people.\n\n\n=== Hope Gardens ===\nThe Royal Botanical Gardens at Hope, popularly called Hope Gardens serves as a national attraction. The Hope Gardens is a part of the 2,000 acres (809 ha) of land making it the largest botanical garden in the English-speaking Caribbean. The land situated by the foothills of the Blue Mountains was originally owned by Major Richard Hope from whom it got its name. Two hundred acres of this land was obtained by the Government of Jamaica in 1880 and was originally established as a plant introduction and crop-testing facility for plants such as pineapple, cocoa, coffee and tobacco. The formal Botanical Gardens were laid out on approximately 60 acres (24 ha) of this land with the assistance of personnel from the Kew Gardens in England.\nIn the 1950s, the Queen, after visiting the island and being pleased with the state of the gardens, gave permission for it to be called the Royal Botanical Gardens, Hope. The Gardens have many exotic species along with some endemic trees of Jamaica. Over the years, the ravages of hurricanes and other disasters have resulted in the loss of a significant number of species. However, there are still some prominent trees and popular sites to be viewed in the Gardens. At Hope Gardens, visitors can view a number of other features including the Coconut Museum, the Sunken Gardens, the Orchid House, the Lily Pond, the Maze and Palm Avenue.The Hope Gardens has an adjoining zoo referred to as Hope Gardens Zoo. The gardens and zoo are undergoing redevelopment to improve the physical landscape and the animal inventory as a part of Bring Back The Hope campaign.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe St William Grant Park (Parade) in the heart of downtown Kingston is the starting point for three of Jamaica's four A roads, namely the A1 (Kingston to Lucea), the A3 (Kingston to Saint Ann's Bay) and the A4 (Kingston to Annotto Bay), while the city itself is provided with a dense network of trunk, main, secondary and minor roads. It also consists of the Highway 2000, Jamaica which runs through Portmore, Ocho Rios and Mandeville. A new section of Highway 2000, Jamaica (called \"T3\") was recently opened to the public. It has greatly reduced the travel time between Kingston and Montego Bay from 4 hours to a mere 2 1/2 hours.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, mini buses and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.Private car ownership levels are high, and like many major urban conurbations Kingston suffers from frequent traffic jams and pollution.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nIn June 1898, the existing mule car service was phased out and a transition to electric trams, initially operated by the West India Electric Company and later by the Jamaica Public Service Company, was undertaken. This transition to the electric tram was completed on 31 March 1899. This service continued to operate, but the inflexibility of a tram service could not keep pace with a growing city, and the tram service ceased to operate on 7 August 1948.Between 1948 and 1953 a motor bus service was operated by a company called Jamaica Utilities. The government revoked its franchise in 1953.\nFrom 1953 to 1983 the Jamaica Omnibus Service operated a service, which at its peak consisted of over 600 buses and served an area spanning Spanish Town, Border, Mt. James, Bull Bay and Port Royal. It was wound up by the government in 1983 after being nationalised in 1974.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, the Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC), mini buses, and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe now disused Kingston railway station served the Kingston to Montego Bay main line with branches from Spanish Town to Ewarton, Bog Walk to Port Antonio, Linstead to New Works and May pen to Frankfield.\nThe railway station opened in 1845 and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica's railways abruptly ceased.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nKingston's international airport is Norman Manley International Airport while Tinson Pen Aerodrome provides domestic services.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\nHistorically, the Kingston waterfront was Jamaica's main port with many finger piers at which freighters and passenger liners could dock. More recently, with the containerisation of freight, the port has moved to Newport West.\n\n\n== Law enforcement ==\nJamaica's police force, the Jamaica Constabulary Force, is based on Old Hope Road near Liguanea. Smaller police stations, such as Hunt's Bay, Matilda's Corner and Half-Way-Tree, are dispersed across the Corporate Area. The Supreme Court of Jamaica is also located in Kingston. Other courts, such as the Half-Way-Tree Resident Magistrate's Court, Gun Court, Traffic Court and Family Court, make Kingston their home. The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) has its headquarters at Up Park Camp near New Kingston and Cross Roads. The JDF also operates a major naval base at Port Royal.\n\n\n=== Fire service ===\nFire response in Kingston is provided by the Jamaica Fire Brigade, the national fire service. The service operates from fire stations spread throughout the Corporate Area. Fire stations are located at \nYork Park (HQ)\nHalf-Way-Tree\nRollington Town\nPort Royal\nNorman Manley International Airport\nStony Hill\nTrench Town\nKingston Harbour (Fire Boat)\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe Gleaner Company, the Jamaica Observer and the Sunday Herald, three of Jamaica's large newspaper companies, make their home in Kingston. Several television and radio stations including Television Jamaica (TVJ), CVM TV, RJR 94 FM, TBC Radio 88.5 FM, Hitz 92 FM, FAME 95 FM, LOVE TV, ZIP 103, Kool 97 FM and LOVE FM, are all based in Kingston.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe capital is home to five association football teams who play in the Jamaican Premier League. The teams are Arnett Gardens, Boy's Town, Harbour View, Maverley Hughenden and Waterhouse F.C..\n\n\n== Telecommunications ==\n\n\n=== Fixed voice and broadband ===\nFixed voice and broadband services in Kingston are provided by either FLOW and Digicel (via their new Digicel Play service which is exclusive to the Kingston Metropolitan Area). FLOW uses a Hybrid Fibre and Coaxial network to provide IPTV, VoIP & POTS and broadband capable of speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. FLOW also uses a Copper network to provide POTS and ADSL capable of speeds up to 12 Mbit/s. Digicel uses a GPON fibre-optic network, providing IPTV, VoIP and broadband speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s. Digicel's Fibre-optic network boasts capacity of up to 10 Gbit/s.\n\n\n=== Mobile voice and broadband ===\nMobile voice and broadband services in Kingston are dominated by incumbents, FLOW & Digicel. Both carriers provide GSM, EDGE, HSPA, HSPA+ and LTE connectivity in and around the city.\nFLOW offers HSPA+ of up to 21 Mbit/s on 850 MHz and 1900 MHz. FLOW also offers DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 1900 MHz spectrum.\nDigicel also offers 21 Mbit/s HSPA+ however, they also offer DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 850 MHz spectrum. Digicel was also first to market with LTE in Jamaica. Their network covers all of Kingston Parish and most of the populous areas in the Kingston Metropolitan Area, capable of speeds of up to 75 Mbit/s on 10 MHz of Band 17 spectrum.\nFLOW also offers LTE in Kingston. FLOW's LTE network is accessible on Band 4 or AWS spectrum.

        "wiki": "Trench Town (also Trenchtown) is a neighbourhood located in the parish of St. Andrew which shares  municipality with Kingston, the capital and largest city of Jamaica. In the 1960s Trench Town was known as the Hollywood of Jamaica. Today Trench Town is the location of the Trench Town Culture Yard Museum, a National Heritage Site presenting the unique history and contribution of Trench Town to Jamaica.\nTrench Town is the birthplace of rocksteady and reggae music, as well as the home of reggae and Rastafari ambassador Bob Marley. The neighborhood gets its name from its previous designation as Trench Pen, 400 acres (162 hectares) of land once used for livestock by Daniel Power Trench, an Irish immigrant of the 18th century (descendants of the Earls of Clancarty). The Trench family abandoned the land in the late 19th century. Trench Town is home to the communities of Wilton Gardens [Rema], Federal Gardens, Arnett Gardens [Jungle], Havana, Buckers and others. Trench Town today is also the home of two of Jamaica's top Premier League football club teams, Arnett Gardens and Boys' Town.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the colonial period, Trenchtown was part of the Greenwich Park estate of Daniel Power Trench (1813-1884), son of a wealthy plantation owner and slave-holder. Christopher Whyms-Stone asserts the settlement's name derives from Daniel Trench (rather than, for instance, taking its name from gulleys and trenches observable in its landscape).During the 1930s, Trench Pen, in southern St. Andrew (neighboring western Kingston), was a growing squatter settlement for the rural to urban migrants.  Trench Pen was developed into Trench Town when the colonial government's Central Housing Authority (CHA) initiated a model township project which included owner occupied housing, rental social housing, schools, a theatre (The Ambassador), a park (Vin Lawrence Park), YMCA & YWCA, health clinic and fire station. Approximately 200 acres (81 hectares) of Trench Pen was used to create Trench Town while the remaining land became known as Rose Town, a residential community. Many who came from rural Jamaica to find work settled in the western side of Kingston as there were available \"idle\" lands and also the area  was a desirable location being close to downtown and the market district.\nThe new residences consisted of one- and two-storey 'knog' buildings, built in clusters or around a central courtyard with communal cooking and bathroom facilities. These residences became the famous Government Yards of Trench Town. Knog construction refers to a labor-intensive traditional method of construction where a timber frame structure is in-filled with brick or rubble then covered with a wire mesh and plastered. The architecture used was that of a rural Caribbean vernacular with hip roofs and wide verandas. Trench Town was a planned community with a hierarchical grid of streets and central sewage and garbage disposal systems.\nTrench Town became famous for the talent which emerged from the project. In the 1950s and 60s bread and milk were delivered door to door, each month the CHA would inspect the residences to ensure compliance and tenants paid their twelve shillings per month on time. Trench Town is mainly known for the vast number of musicians it produced. The community has also produced some of Jamaica's top professional, business and political leaders as well as famous sports and religious personalities. This small area contributed widely to global awareness of the impoverished and politically corrupt conditions in Jamaica.Like the rest of Jamaica, Trench Town became unstable and dangerous in the early 1970s when politics became violent. The two major Jamaican political parties \u2014 the People's National Party and the Jamaica Labour Party \u2013 had emerged in Kingston and violently enforced code that ensured only their party's supporters had access to jobs and services. The lower part of Trench Town below Seventh Street was sympathetic to the JLP, which in the 70s put it at war with its northern neighbor Arnette Gardens, a PNP stronghold. The road connecting the two, Seventh Street, became the front-line in an all-out war which saw the entire two blocks of Government Yards between Fifth Street and Seventh Streets being destroyed. The community's and Jamaica's greatest challenge today is poverty.\nTraditional community organizations such as Boys Town [YMCA] and Joy Town [YWCA] continue to contribute to the welfare of the residents. New organizations such as AIR (Agency for Inner-city Renewal), the Trenchtown Reading Centre [FACE Jamaica], and the Trench Town Development Association, were formed to increase positive social attitudes, increase literacy  and encourage government spending and development in the area. Crime in the neighbourhood has declined; the murder rate in western Kingston has dropped since the mid-1990s.  The Prince of Wales has funded a regeneration project in Rose Town through his Foundation for Building Community.\n\n\n=== Birthplace of reggae ===\nTrench Town is known in popular culture due to numerous ska, rocksteady, and reggae musicians who grew up there, most notably Bob Marley, who spent much of his youth in a \"government yard\" on First Street. His songs \"Trenchtown\", \"Natty Dread\", \"Trenchtown Rock\" and \"No Woman, No Cry\" make reference to it. It was also home to Rastafari elder Mortimo \"Kumi\" Planno, and the following artists and groups:\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nTrench Town Culture Yard Museum\nTrenchtown Reading Centre\nVin Lawrence Park (locally called simply 'the park')\nTrench Town Peace and Justice Centre\n\n\n== Education ==\nTrench Town Primary School\nTrench Town Polytechnic College, Formerly Trench Town High School\nIris Gelly Primary\nCharlie Smith High School\nJones Town Primary\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nDJ Kool Herc (Clive Campbell), DJ and rapper\nAlton Ellis, rocksteady singer and recording artist\nDean Fraser, saxophonist and recording artist\nJoe Higgs, reggae musician and recording artist\nKnowledge (band) (Anthony Doyley, Michael Smith, Delroy Fawlin, Michael Samuels, Earl MacFarlane, Paul Freeman)\nBob Marley reggae singer, songwriter, guitarist and recording artist\nMassive Dread (Dennis James), reggae deejay\nMortimer Planno, Rastafari elder\nErnest Ranglin, composer, guitarist, and recording artist\nCollie Smith, West Indian cricketer\nPeter Tosh (Winston Hubert McIntosh) OM, reggae singer, guitarist, percussionist, recording artist\nBunny Wailer (Neville O'Riley Livingston), reggae singer, songwriter, percussionist, and recording artist\nDelroy Wilson, ska, rocksteady, and reggae singer and recording artist\nAngela Todd, Doctor, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Private Practitioner for over 25 years\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTrenchTown Reading Centre\nVisitJamaica.com \u2013 Trench Town\nAerial view\nBorn In Trench Town documentary",

          "Seems all the earlier visitors were pretty stoned. The tour (you can't even call it a tour) is a fckn joke! In the beginning the management is making you paying more. Then there was no tour guide around so the management functioned as guide, more than obviously not interested in",
          "I read all the reviews and made a decision to venture into Trench Town Culture Yard. There were 3 tours available Tour 1 (45+ mins) j$1,500, Tour 2 (90+ mins) j$2,500 and Tour 3 (j$3,500). I opted for the Tour 1 but 5 minutes into my tour an unfortunate incident occurred.",

          "Culture Yard was a great experience! I recommend that if you go ask for Stone Man to be your tour guide. He is rich in knowledge and love for the community. You will learn a lot and if you tour the community you will get a real experience of the realities of Jamaica. There is so",

          "Best part of our trip, really got the feel of how different musicians would have got together & inspired one another. Visited Bob Marley's house too, which was also good but this place was less commercial & really gave an authentic feel. Very interesting history of housing",
          "I was really happy to be going to Trenchtown as I really wanted to see the old VW splitscreen camper van that Bob used to drive. It's there in the yard all fallen to bits but probably worth a lot of money! A girl who lived in trenchtown took us round. Before we went in our tour",
          "boy, when i booked my trip to jamaica, trench town was one of my ABSOLUTELY MUST STEP FOOT IN places to visit and i am so glad i went. the culture yard offers a variety of tours of differing lengths and costs. we went for the shorter one because we had limited cash on us (it's",
          "Have you ever wondered how Trench Town got it's name? Have you wondered what it was like for Bob Marley as a child growing up? Are you curious as to how people live in Trench Town? This is the tour for you. We learned so much about the life, the legacy, the world of Bob",
          "Visited the Culture Yard with Mr Eugene Nugent of Gadgepro Tours. Eugene was a fabulous guide , knew the Trenchtown area well and was able to drive us around telling us about the area and his experiences as a child. The actual Culture Yard Tour is separate and you can choose to",

          "We did the 45 minute tour this year but next year we plan on going back and doing the longer tour. To be able to see where Bob Marley spent part of life was very interesting. To see where people still live, it is eye opening. The history the guide provide is something you",
          "Travelling to the Culture Yard was an experience in itself. To see the area the museum is in is an emotional journey that you can't describe or imagine without visiting. Nature was our guide, he was very informative and tour was not rushed. There are a few different tours",
          "This was fantastic. Stone man took us around and gave us a great insight into Trench Town, the music and the community. He was so lovely with my Mum and made sure she was looked after at all times. Listening to Livin Kulcha sing live was the icing on the cake. A great tour and",

          "We visited the TTCY a couple of days ago, and were pleased we went but found it a bit surreal. We opted for the middle tour, $2000 each. It was supposed to last 90 mins + but we seemed to be all done in less than an hour. The museum was a few rooms with pictures. Highlight was",
          "While the house Bob Marley ended up in is interesting if you're a fan, and especially if you want to see lots of gold and platinum disks etc. the Culture yard feels a lot more important and authentic. Here you really get a sense of the early life of Bob, and for many other poor",
          "This is a must for Bob Marley fans but a lot more than that too. See the birthplace of reggae music and so many greats. Of all the tours and museums on Bob this is the real thing see where he lived before he got famous and where him and Tata Ford wrote some of his classics. You",
          "This was a big part of our Jamaican holiday. Sophia met us just inside the gate and gave us a warm, friendly welcome. We were given a very informative tour. We were introduced to Ziggy Soul, who along with his other band members of Livynkulcha sang about 4 songs as we danced",
          "Nuff respect to our tour guide \"Stoneman\" for a very informative tour of Trench Town, Bob Marley's rise to stardom and the overall history of Jamaica. Will definitely be sending all of my friends to Trench Town.",
          "Though not nearly as slick as 56 Hope Road, Culture Yard gives you a better sense of the origins of Bob Marley and his contemporaries. The tour guides come from the community and show you what life in the tenement yard was like through the 50s and 60s.",
          "I decided to do the longest tour available, and I really, really enjoyed it. Sophia met me at the reception and introduced me to my guide, Stoneman, who showed me around the different streets and the recording studio. It was very informative. I came back to the cultural centre",

          "Trenchtown has created more music stars than any other community in the world. The Culture Yard is home base for Bob Marley fans, but more importantly the visitor gets a sense of the past pressure that created diamonds in the rough. It's a rough neighbourhood with a violent",
          "We chose to visit over the Bob Marley museum and I'm so pleased we did. This community effort is doing more for the Trenchtown ghetto than any government programme. Yes they want tourists to go because it makes them money but that's not surprising given they are visitor and",
          "I was taken to the Trench Town Culture Centre whilst on a day trip through Kingston which was included in the price of my tour so I cannot comment on the cost. The tour was short but I found interesting, they had the first vehicle (what was left) of Marley as well as his first",
          "This is a living, breathing museum giving not only some history of Bob Marley, his fellow musicians (Vincent Ford's bedroom e.g.) and of Trench Town and it inhabitants over the years, but a flavour of life as it is now in Trench Town. Stoneman showed us round and his passion",
          "More a tribute to Trench Town roots than to Bob. I was told by a very well educated local to go here instead of the commercialized and very expensive official Bob M mueseum. I'm glad I did but they need to get some more things going on there - like a picture of Bob in his VW",
          "I did not know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised by this oasis in the city. The galleries outline the history of Trench Town, a history I would never have imagined\u2026truly awesome. The tour Guide Sophia was knowledgeable and friendly. After the tour it was just great to",
          "The culture yard is actually really expensive, they have several options for tours that begin with the yard itself. There is no photography allowed inside the rooms which were Bob Marley's bedroom, his mentors bedroom and a few other rooms. There are a few photos, newspaper",
          "If you are a fan of Bob Marley then I suggest you get on a tour to take you to Trench Town. It is government run museum and you will never see another government run museum like it! I don't think much has changed since Marley lived there & if you get a tour by 'Stoneman' you",

          "I visited Culture Yard with friends who were visiting from overseas. I found it to be a very informative tour, telling about Bob Marley's early life and his introduction to his musical passion. Our tour guide was funny, engaging and informative and the environment felt fairly",
          "A small fee to get in gets you so much more. A wonderful & informative tour giving you a real insight into the history of music & culture in Trench Town",
          "We were lost in Kingston trying to find the Bob Marley Museum and that's the place where people led us but not where we wanted to go... It's expensive for what it is and not Worth it to pay that much to see that. We had a guide to see the neighborhood who was nice but the woman",
          "Me and my girlfriend were really tempted to discover Trenchtown neighborhood to see with our eyes the reality of so many songs. Having local guides seemed an obvious and interesting choice. Once at the the Cultural yard we realized the place is not so very organized, we realized",
          "Trench Town is special. In many ways it's a symbol of Jamaica's urban problems, poverty, unemployment, drugs and crime, and in a city almost without normal sights, this is one place you shouldn't miss. The tour itself isn't really a tour, more a walk around the neighbourhood,",
          "We visited the Trenchtown area because so many songs are written about it from some of the greatest reggae stars. However, we did not tour it. We believe it is an invasion of people's privacy to have it on display. I hope the money collected goes to help the individuals living",
          "This is not for the faint hearted. Trench town is a very poor part of the already poor kingston. This tour goes through where bob marley lived in trench town. Its a different kind of tour and it does seem to suit people who want to see the true colours of jamaica and its",
          "You have to visit. While we were there. They unveiled a new statue of Bob. Had food entertainment, and speakers. Bobs room is there and his Volkswagen van. The people are great",
          "We walked around several streets, played football with the boys, held a small class lesson the street with the children & shared stories with the women having their hair done. An unforgetable experience.",
          "The place is basically a set of (almost empty) rooms. Some of them describing the history of Trench Town and others left as they were in the past. The yard is nice, but all the rest can be missed without any problem. Even if you're a Bob Marley's fan. And the place is really",

        "wiki": "National Heroes Park is a botanical garden in Kingston, Jamaica.  The largest open space in Kingston at 50 acres in size, National Heroes Park features numerous monuments, and is the burial site of many of Jamaica's National Heroes, Prime Ministers, and cultural leaders. The neighborhood around the park is also known as National Heroes Park.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 1783, the park was originally a race track called \"Kingston Race Course\", which featured a one-mile track used for horse races, with a typical purse of 100 pounds sterling.  In 1905, a new track was constructed at Knutsford Park, and the old track was later renamed \"George VI Memorial Park\" in honour of King George VI of the United Kingdom and converted into a public park.  After Jamaica gained independence in 1962, the park's name was changed again to the name it currently bears.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Administration ===\nNational Heroes Park is currently maintained by the Parks Division of Jamaica's National Solid Waste Management Authority.  Security is provided by a formal honour guard from the Jamaican Defence Force, with a Changing of the Guard taking place every hour.  Jamaica's Ministry of Local Government, Community Development and Sport is responsible for the renovations currently taking place at the park.\n\n\n=== Monuments ===\nThe Jamaica War Memorial, a cenotaph honoring the Jamaicans killed in combat during World War I and World War II, is a prominent feature of the park.  The memorial, which was constructed in 1922, was initially located on Church Street in downtown Kingston, but in 1953 it was moved to its present location.  It is topped by a cross weighing one and a half tons.One of the park's first original monuments was constructed to house the remains of Marcus Garvey.  Garvey died on 10 June 1940 in London, but transporting the remains from England was unfeasible at that time due to World War II.  As a result, his body was buried in England until 1964, when the government of Jamaica paid to have it transported to the park for a ceremony honoring Garvey as a national hero.  Garvey's monument consists of a tomb at the center of a raised platform in the shape of a black star, a symbol often used by Garvey. Behind it, a peaked and angled wall houses a bust of Garvey,  which had been added to the park in 1956 and relocated after the construction of the monument. The monument was designed by G. C. Hodges, while the bust was the work of Alvin T. Marriot.After Donald Sangster died in 1967, Mostyn F. Campbell designed a monument in his honor.  The monument consists of an opposed pair of curved members, turning inward and wider at the top than at the novel base.  The expansion of the members symbolizes Sangster's development from humble origins, while their separation is meant to suggest the unfinished nature of his life's work.Another monument was constructed to honor Norman Manley.  Designed by H. D. Repole, it was dedicated on 16 September 1972.  The monument contains twelve pillars, arranged in two concentric circles, with the inner pillars taller than the outer ones.  Each inner pillar is connected to its corresponding outer pillar by a horizontal member, and the inner pillars are also connected partway up by a ring.  Manley's tomb is located at the center, topped by a six-pointed star.  Each pair of pillars represents an aspect of Manley's life, and Repole's original design called for plaques describing these aspects to be affixed to each pillar assemblage.  This plan was not completed, however, due to financial constraints.  Instead, sculptures of two human figures were incorporated into the design in 1974.  Designed by Christopher Gonzalez, these sculptures depict a male and a female, which are meant to symbolize the birth of a unified nation.Sir Alexander Bustamante is honored with a memorial completed in October 1979.  Designer Errol Alberga created an arch, narrow at the top and widening toward the base, which stands above Bustamante's tomb, finished with marble from the region.  Seats are incorporated into the base of the arch, which spans a gap of thirty feet.Two monuments to historical figures were dedicated on 14 October 1999.  The first of these honors Nanny of the Maroons, a female warrior of Asante descent who waged a guerrilla campaign against the British during the First Maroon War.  Nanny's monument reproduces the sound of the abeng, a traditional instrument used by the fighters.  The second is dedicated to Samuel Sharpe, the leader of the Christmas Uprising (a.k.a. the Baptist War), a slave revolt that took place in 1831.  Sharp's monument is shaped like a Greek cross, to honor his Baptist faith, and its corners are left open as a representation of freedom.  Both of these monuments were designed by Compass Workshop Limited.A monument to Michael Manley was dedicated on 15 March 2002.  Designed by Mark and Susan Taylor, the monument resembles a graph of exponential growth when viewed from the side.  Its surface is covered with slabs of black Jamaican marble, some of which are engraved with quotes by Manley on the subject of equality.A bust of General Antonio Maceo was added as a donation from the people of Cuba, in recognition of Jamaica having offered him asylum.The park is also the burial site for 140 elderly women killed in a fire at the Myers Ward of the Eventide Home for the Aged in 1980.  A monument marks the mass grave containing the women's remains.\n\n\n== Burial sites ==\n\nThe remains of the following notable people are interred at National Heroes Park:\n\nDennis Brown\nSir Alexander Bustamante\nMarcus Garvey\nMichael Manley\nNorman Manley\nGeorge William Gordon\nEdna Manley\nDonald Sangster\nHugh Shearer\nRanny Williams\nPaul Bogle\nSamuel Sharpe\nLady Bustamante\nHerb McKenley\nLouise Bennett-Coverley\nMallica \"Kapo\" Reynolds\nHoward and Ivy Cooke\nEdward Seaga\n\n\n== Culture venue ==\nThe National Heroes Park was the venue of the Smile Jamaica Concert on 5 December 1976, performed by reggae superstars Bob Marley & The Wailers. The second Smile Jamaica Concert was held 10 February 2007.\n\n\n== Redevelopment ==\nNational Heroes Park is currently undergoing a series of major renovations.  Plans for alterations to the park had been discussed as far back as 1998, but it was not until 2001 that a plan was formally announced.  The initial plan called for four phases of construction and a total project cost of $25 million, but delays in work have increased the estimated final cost has to $259 million.  The plan calls for the division of the park into four zones: an amphitheatre for formal and cultural activities, a nature area with shade trees, an outdoor activity and recreation area with tracks and playgrounds, and a combined administrative and sports complex.As of 2009, only the first phase of construction has been completed, with most work to this point focusing on irrigation, parking, and lighting, with some additional work on the gardens and the Eventide memorial.  The project's slow pace has been attributed to financial difficulties, as well as administrative changes in the government personnel overseeing the renovations.  Funding was to be provided by the government, the Environmental Foundation of Jamaica, and private donors, but private donations have been scarce due to the park's close proximity to several depressed neighborhoods and high-crime areas.The Jamaica National Heritage Trust announced plans for a monument to Hugh Shearer in 2009.  The monument will be located near those of Michael Manley and Donald Sangster, and its design will be determined by an open competition.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAerial view",

          "Camped at Holywell and Clydesdale as a teen and since my family (husband and 2 kids) and I are avid campers wanted to have them experience camping in Jamaica. Our flight got in on a Friday night and so we could not pay or reserve then and the office was closed on the Saturday.",
          "The drive here from Kingston is spectacular, although a bit nail-biting for first timers. Drive with care, make regular use of your horn going around sharp corners, and be prepared to stop to let big trucks go by. I find the best time to make the drive up is after 9am when most",
          "This place is so serene, you can hear your own thoughts. We loved it, its so peaceful and cool. Aside from your thoughts you hear birds and other insects. It has an amazing view of the city when the clouds are not present. Great for out door fun with the family, they have areas",

          "I have no problems with Holywell itself, infact it's great. The road TO GO to holywell is long, windy and in very bad shape, but even cars can make it. Once you get into holywell, it's a different story. These are dirt roads that ungulate, like mini mountains. Cars will find",

        "wiki": "Fort Charles was built between 1650 and 1660, the first fort constructed in Port Royal, Jamaica.\n\n\n== Location ==\nFort Charles is located in the small town of Port Royal in Jamaica. The town was founded on a natural harbor in which Fort Charles stands at the entrance to. According to Donny L. Hamilton, the fort was situated at the tip of the sand spit separating the Kingston Harbor for the Caribbean. The fort is almost completely surrounded by water.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1654, Jamaica was under Spanish control and Spain was at war with England. Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England, sent an expedition to invade the Spanish island Hispaniola. When the expedition failed, its leaders did not want to return home in shame. They turned their attention to capturing Jamaica, which was poorly defended. The buccaneer Henry Morgan was a member of the invading force led by Penn and Venables. By May 1655, the English gained control of the island, and began construction of Fort Cromwell to defend their new acquisition. Fort Charles was built in 1655 and was originally called \"Fort Cromwell\" but subsequently renamed.By 1667 it had 36 guns while in 1765 it had 104 guns and a garrison of 500 men. It was damaged by both the 1692 Jamaica earthquake and the 1907 Kingston earthquake, which later resulted in the tilting of the Giddy House, now a minor tourist attraction.\n\n\n== Scenery ==\nFort Charles was built in the shape of a ship. According to Don Philpott, the fort is very well preserved with its rows of semi-circular gun ports.\nInside of every other row on the outer wall of the fort are cannons lined adjacently. According to Amitabh Sharma, \u201cThe red-bricked asymmetrical fortification once stood guard, warding off intruders and intimidating them with a battery of high caliber guns that were strategically mounted in the periphery\u201d (page 2).\n\n\n== Names ==\nFort Charles was said to have a few names. Passage Fort and Fort Cromwell were among those few. Fort Charles was the first of six forts to be built manned by a garrison in Jamaica. Fort Charles was the last name the fort received in honor of the restoration of the British Monarchy in King Charles II to the English throne.\n\n\n== The Fort today ==\n\nToday, Fort Charles is still standing tall. After the numerous hurricanes and earthquakes, the fort did undergo some natural changes. The set up of the lined cannons on the outside wall is fairly the same. The only thing that differs from before the earthquake in 1692 is that there is now a museum located inside of the fort.\n\n\n== References ==",

In the Americas, Kingston is the largest predominantly English-speaking city south of the United States.\nThe local government bodies of the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew were amalgamated by the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation Act of 1923, to form the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC). Greater Kingston, or the \"Corporate Area\" refers to those areas under the KSAC; however, it does not solely refer to Kingston Parish, which only consists of the old downtown and Port Royal. Kingston Parish had a population of 96,052, and St. Andrew Parish had a population of 555,828 in 2001. Kingston is only bordered by Saint Andrew to the east, west and north. The geographical border for the parish of Kingston encompasses the following communities: Tivoli Gardens, Denham Town, Rae Town, Kingston Gardens, National Heroes Park, Bournemouth Gardens, Norman Gardens, Rennock Lodge, Springfield and Port Royal, along with portions of Rollington Town, Franklyn Town and Allman Town.The city proper is bounded by Six Miles to the west, Stony Hill to the north, Papine to the northeast and Harbour View to the east, which are communities in urban and suburban Saint Andrew. Communities in rural St. Andrew such as Gordon Town, Mavis Bank, Lawrence Tavern, Mt. Airy and Bull Bay would not be described as being in Kingston city.\nTwo districts make up the central area of Kingston: the historic Downtown, and New Kingston. Both are served by Norman Manley International Airport and also by the smaller and primarily domestic Tinson Pen Aerodrome.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKingston was founded in July 1693 after the earthquake that devastated Port Royal in 1692, the original section of the city which was situated at the bottom of the Liguanea Plains was laid out to house survivors of the earthquake. Before the earthquake, Kingston's functions were purely agricultural. The earthquake survivors set up a camp on the sea front. Approximately two thousand people died due to mosquito-borne diseases. Initially the people lived in a tented camp on Colonel Barry's Hog Crawle. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by fire in 1703. Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. The new grid system of the town was designed to facilitate commerce, particularly the system of main thoroughfares 66 feet (20 m) across, which allowed transportation between the port and plantations farther inland. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the centre of trade for Jamaica.\nThe government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in Port Royal, and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of Liguanea.\nThe first free school, Wolmers's, was founded in 1729 and there was a theatre, first on Harbour Street and then moved in 1774 to North Parade. Both are still in existence. In 1755 the governor, Sir Charles Knowles, had decided to transfer the government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston.\nBy the end of the 18th century, the city contained more than 3,000 brick buildings. The harbour fostered trade, and played part in several naval wars of the 18th century. Kingston took over the functions of Spanish Town (the capital at the time). These functions included agriculture, commercial, processing and a main transport hub to and from Kingston and other sections of the island. In 1788, Kingston had a population of 25,000, which was about a tenth of the overall population of the island. One in every four people living in Kingston was white, and there was a large population of free people of color there too, meaning that two out of every five people living in Kingston were free. The remaining three-fifths of Kingston's population was made up of black slaves.The government passed an act to transfer the government offices to Kingston from Spanish Town, which occurred in 1872. It kept this status when the island was granted independence in 1962.\n\nIn 1907, 800 people died in another earthquake known as the 1907 Kingston earthquake, destroying nearly all the historical buildings south of Parade in the city. That was when a restriction of no more than 60 feet (18 m) was instituted on buildings in the city centre. These three-story-high buildings were built with reinforced concrete. Construction on King Street in the city was the first area to breach this building code.\nDuring the 1930s, island-wide riots led to the development of trade unions and political parties to represent workers.\nThe city became home to the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies founded in 1948, with 24 medical students.\nNot until the 1960s did major change occur in the development of Kingston's city centre. The international attention of reggae music at that time coincided with the expansion and development of 95 acres (38 ha) of the Kingston city centre waterfront area. These developments led to an influx of shops and offices, and the development of a new financial centre: New Kingston, which replaced the Knutsford Racetrack. Multi-story buildings and boulevards were placed within that section.\nIn 1966 Kingston was the host city to the Commonwealth Games.\nThe western section of the city was not the focus of development, and that area proved to be politically tense. The 1970s saw deteriorating economic conditions that led to recurrent violence and a decline in tourism which later affected the island.\n\nIn the 1980 general elections, the democratic socialist People's National Party (PNP) government was voted out, and subsequent governments have been more market-oriented. Within a global urban era, the 1990s saw that Kingston has made efforts to modernise and develop its city structure and functions. Various organisations such as the Kingston Restoration Company, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), the Port Authority of Jamaica and the Port Royal Development Company, among others sought to develop the urban structure of the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe majority of the population of Kingston is of African descent. Large minority ethnic groups include East Indians and Chinese, who came to the country as indentured servants in the late 19th century. The Chinese occupy important roles in Jamaica's economy especially in the retail markets in Downtown Kingston and the wider metropolitan area. There is also a minority of Europeans, mostly descending from immigrants from Germany and Great Britain. Syrians and Lebanese form one of the most influential ethnic groups in not only Kingston, but the entire island. Though a minority ethnic group, the Lebanese were able to give Jamaica one of its prime ministers, Edward Philip George Seaga. There is a strong undercurrent of bias based on skin color as darker skinned Jamaicans are usually at the very bottom of the socio-economic ladder; a phenomenon evidenced by the disproportionate representation of foreigners and mixed-race individuals in lucrative private sector and government positions. Multi-racial Jamaicans continue to form the second largest racial group, and there is also a small Jewish population in the city.\n79.2% Black\n12.8% Multiracial\n5.2% Asian\n3.4% White\n\n\n== Religion ==\nThere is a wide variety of Christian churches in the city, most of which are Protestant. The chief denominations are Church of God, Baptist, Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal.\nThere is a strong Roman Catholic community, with the Holy Trinity Cathedral which is the seat of metropolitan archbishop and was consecrated in 1911, as well a few Catholic schools and institutions such as the Immaculate Conception High School, St Francis Primary and Infant School, Holy Childhood High School which was founded and is owned by the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of our Lady of Perpetual Help (FMS) in Jamaica.\nAfro-Christian syncretic religions such as the Rastafari movement also have a significant following.\nThe Shaare Shalom Synagogue serves Kingston's Jewish population. The city also has communities of Buddhists and Muslims. The Islamic Council of Jamaica and the Islamic Education and Dawah Centre are both located in Kingston. There are three units of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nKingston plays a central role in Jamaica's economy. The vast majority of economic activity takes place within Kingston, and as most government ministries are located in the city, it is a key force in legislation in regards to Jamaica's finances. The high population density of the capital city means that the majority of monetary transactions occur in Kingston - stimulating much of Jamaica's local economy. The city is also home to the highest number of schools, hospitals and universities anywhere in Jamaica. Kingston is also the island's main transportation hub and its largest seaport.Many multinational conglomerates and financial institutions are headquartered in and around the Kingston Metropolitan Area. Air Jamaica was headquartered in Kingston. The idea of making Jamaica an International Financial Centre has also been proposed as a way to boost the city's financial sector and create more jobs, especially for professionals such as accountants and lawyers.The city's major industries include tourism, apparel manufacturing, and shipping. Many international exports are traded through the city's seaport, with major exports including bauxite, sugar and coffee. The city is also a major tourist destination, and tourism is one of its largest sources of economic activity. The city has suffered economic troubles recently, however, along with the rest of the country of Jamaica. Plans to help the city's economy have made downtown Kingston the subject of numerous redevelopment plans. There have also been attempts to grow the manufacturing industry in the area and to attract call centres to the city.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nKingston is surrounded by the Blue Mountains, Red Hills, Long Mountain and the Kingston Harbour. The city is on the Liguanea plain, an alluvial plain alongside the Hope River. Kingston experiences frequent earthquakes, including the 1907 earthquake.\nKingston has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical wet-and-dry climate (Aw), that borders on a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). characterised by a wet season from May to November, which coincides with the hurricane season, and a dry season from December to April. During the dry season, there is not much rainfall, however, cold and stationary fronts occur at this time, and often bring heavy showers, especially in March. Kingston is in the rain shadow of the Blue Mountains; therefore, little to none of the moisture carried by the Northeast Trade Winds falls over Kingston, causing Kingston to be very dry in comparison to Portland and Saint Mary on the windward side of the Blue Mountains. Kingston is on a coastal location, hence it comes under the influence of the sea, though dense urban development can negate this effect. In the 21st century, Kingston has experienced temperatures as high as 38.8 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) and as low as 13.4 \u00b0C (56 \u00b0F). Between 1895 and 1990, the total average rainfall was recorded at 813 mm (32.0 in), the highest monthly average rainfall recorded in October at 177 mm (7.0 in), and the lowest monthly average rainfall recorded in March at 18 mm (0.71 in). Fog, hail, thunder and tornadoes are all extremely rare.\n\n\n== Housing ==\nIn 1848 the Jamaican government expanded Kingston by constructing new homes in the west, north and east of the city. This housing became highly segregated in terms of race and class and by 1860 the majority of white elites lived on the outskirts of the city.As Kingston's population grew, existing settlements became so densely occupied that marshes in the southwest were filled in to allow the development of new housing. By 1935, continued population growth and poverty resulted in the emergence of slums in the east and west of the city. Later these areas were demolished by the government and residents were rehoused in Denham Town. This development accommodated 3,000 people, leaving more than one sixth of displaced resident homeless. Consequently, overcrowding persisted throughout the city and cramped living condition resulted in public health issues.Suburbanization also became significant and by the 1960s this residential area spread to the foothills of the Blue Mountains. Subsequently, the lack of space and continued consumerism meant this area then expanded to the east of the mountains.In Kingston, 20% of the population now live in squatter settlements. Contrastingly, Kingston is also home to Red Hills, Norbrook, Cherry Gardens, Stony Hill, Jack's Hill, suburbs that hold some of the most expensive houses in all of Jamaica.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThe city of Kingston is home to a number of urban parks which are frequently transformed to accommodate various events and festivities on the Jamaican calendar. The most popular parks include: Emancipation Park, Hope Gardens, Devon House, National Heroes' Park, St William Grant Park and Mandela Park.\n\n\n=== Emancipation Park ===\n\nThe Liguanea Club, a recreational and social club for the upper class in society, located on Knutsford Boulevard, owned over 35 acres (14 ha) of land including the former Liguanea Park now the site of Emancipation Park. The club gave the land measuring seven acres as a gift to the Jamaican Government.\nSeveral government members argued that the land should be converted into a business district, while others felt a multi-functional entertainment complex should be built on the site. The large financial input needed for either venture, was not forthcoming. In 2002 Cabinet granted approval for the transfer of the land to the National Housing Trust on the condition that a park was built and maintained at that location. The land was transferred for one Jamaican dollar.The park is well known for the 11 ft. (approximately 3m) high bronze sculpture done by Jamaican artist Laura Facey, situated at the park's main entrance. This prominent sculpture comprises two naked black male and female statues gazing to the skies \u2013 symbolic of their triumphant rise from the horrors of slavery. The statue was unveiled in July 2003, in time for the park's first anniversary which caused an out cry from the Jamaican populace who believed that the blatant nudity and generous bodily proportions of the figures were very inappropriate to depict the freedom of black people.\n\n\n=== Hope Gardens ===\nThe Royal Botanical Gardens at Hope, popularly called Hope Gardens serves as a national attraction. The Hope Gardens is a part of the 2,000 acres (809 ha) of land making it the largest botanical garden in the English-speaking Caribbean. The land situated by the foothills of the Blue Mountains was originally owned by Major Richard Hope from whom it got its name. Two hundred acres of this land was obtained by the Government of Jamaica in 1880 and was originally established as a plant introduction and crop-testing facility for plants such as pineapple, cocoa, coffee and tobacco. The formal Botanical Gardens were laid out on approximately 60 acres (24 ha) of this land with the assistance of personnel from the Kew Gardens in England.\nIn the 1950s, the Queen, after visiting the island and being pleased with the state of the gardens, gave permission for it to be called the Royal Botanical Gardens, Hope. The Gardens have many exotic species along with some endemic trees of Jamaica. Over the years, the ravages of hurricanes and other disasters have resulted in the loss of a significant number of species. However, there are still some prominent trees and popular sites to be viewed in the Gardens. At Hope Gardens, visitors can view a number of other features including the Coconut Museum, the Sunken Gardens, the Orchid House, the Lily Pond, the Maze and Palm Avenue.The Hope Gardens has an adjoining zoo referred to as Hope Gardens Zoo. The gardens and zoo are undergoing redevelopment to improve the physical landscape and the animal inventory as a part of Bring Back The Hope campaign.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe St William Grant Park (Parade) in the heart of downtown Kingston is the starting point for three of Jamaica's four A roads, namely the A1 (Kingston to Lucea), the A3 (Kingston to Saint Ann's Bay) and the A4 (Kingston to Annotto Bay), while the city itself is provided with a dense network of trunk, main, secondary and minor roads. It also consists of the Highway 2000, Jamaica which runs through Portmore, Ocho Rios and Mandeville. A new section of Highway 2000, Jamaica (called \"T3\") was recently opened to the public. It has greatly reduced the travel time between Kingston and Montego Bay from 4 hours to a mere 2 1/2 hours.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, mini buses and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.Private car ownership levels are high, and like many major urban conurbations Kingston suffers from frequent traffic jams and pollution.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nIn June 1898, the existing mule car service was phased out and a transition to electric trams, initially operated by the West India Electric Company and later by the Jamaica Public Service Company, was undertaken. This transition to the electric tram was completed on 31 March 1899. This service continued to operate, but the inflexibility of a tram service could not keep pace with a growing city, and the tram service ceased to operate on 7 August 1948.Between 1948 and 1953 a motor bus service was operated by a company called Jamaica Utilities. The government revoked its franchise in 1953.\nFrom 1953 to 1983 the Jamaica Omnibus Service operated a service, which at its peak consisted of over 600 buses and served an area spanning Spanish Town, Border, Mt. James, Bull Bay and Port Royal. It was wound up by the government in 1983 after being nationalised in 1974.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, the Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC), mini buses, and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe now disused Kingston railway station served the Kingston to Montego Bay main line with branches from Spanish Town to Ewarton, Bog Walk to Port Antonio, Linstead to New Works and May pen to Frankfield.\nThe railway station opened in 1845 and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica's railways abruptly ceased.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nKingston's international airport is Norman Manley International Airport while Tinson Pen Aerodrome provides domestic services.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\nHistorically, the Kingston waterfront was Jamaica's main port with many finger piers at which freighters and passenger liners could dock. More recently, with the containerisation of freight, the port has moved to Newport West.\n\n\n== Law enforcement ==\nJamaica's police force, the Jamaica Constabulary Force, is based on Old Hope Road near Liguanea. Smaller police stations, such as Hunt's Bay, Matilda's Corner and Half-Way-Tree, are dispersed across the Corporate Area. The Supreme Court of Jamaica is also located in Kingston. Other courts, such as the Half-Way-Tree Resident Magistrate's Court, Gun Court, Traffic Court and Family Court, make Kingston their home. The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) has its headquarters at Up Park Camp near New Kingston and Cross Roads. The JDF also operates a major naval base at Port Royal.\n\n\n=== Fire service ===\nFire response in Kingston is provided by the Jamaica Fire Brigade, the national fire service. The service operates from fire stations spread throughout the Corporate Area. Fire stations are located at \nYork Park (HQ)\nHalf-Way-Tree\nRollington Town\nPort Royal\nNorman Manley International Airport\nStony Hill\nTrench Town\nKingston Harbour (Fire Boat)\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe Gleaner Company, the Jamaica Observer and the Sunday Herald, three of Jamaica's large newspaper companies, make their home in Kingston. Several television and radio stations including Television Jamaica (TVJ), CVM TV, RJR 94 FM, TBC Radio 88.5 FM, Hitz 92 FM, FAME 95 FM, LOVE TV, ZIP 103, Kool 97 FM and LOVE FM, are all based in Kingston.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe capital is home to five association football teams who play in the Jamaican Premier League. The teams are Arnett Gardens, Boy's Town, Harbour View, Maverley Hughenden and Waterhouse F.C..\n\n\n== Telecommunications ==\n\n\n=== Fixed voice and broadband ===\nFixed voice and broadband services in Kingston are provided by either FLOW and Digicel (via their new Digicel Play service which is exclusive to the Kingston Metropolitan Area). FLOW uses a Hybrid Fibre and Coaxial network to provide IPTV, VoIP & POTS and broadband capable of speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. FLOW also uses a Copper network to provide POTS and ADSL capable of speeds up to 12 Mbit/s. Digicel uses a GPON fibre-optic network, providing IPTV, VoIP and broadband speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s. Digicel's Fibre-optic network boasts capacity of up to 10 Gbit/s.\n\n\n=== Mobile voice and broadband ===\nMobile voice and broadband services in Kingston are dominated by incumbents, FLOW & Digicel. Both carriers provide GSM, EDGE, HSPA, HSPA+ and LTE connectivity in and around the city.\nFLOW offers HSPA+ of up to 21 Mbit/s on 850 MHz and 1900 MHz. FLOW also offers DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 1900 MHz spectrum.\nDigicel also offers 21 Mbit/s HSPA+ however, they also offer DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 850 MHz spectrum. Digicel was also first to market with LTE in Jamaica. Their network covers all of Kingston Parish and most of the populous areas in the Kingston Metropolitan Area, capable of speeds of up to 75 Mbit/s on 10 MHz of Band 17 spectrum.\nFLOW also offers LTE in Kingston. FLOW's LTE network is accessible on Band 4 or AWS spectrum. Due to the network delaying its rollout to acquire more spectrum, its network is theoretically faster than both Digicel and Caricel, to the tune of 150 Mbit/s (20 MHz of Bandwidth) with further plans to add low band spectrum, possibly increasing theoretical speeds up to 225 Mbit/s.\nKingston is also home to Caricel, Jamaica's newest telecoms operator, which deployed its LTE network first to the Kingston Metropolitan Area.\nIn addition, both carriers have their Jamaican head offices in the city (with the exception of Digicel, which has its company headquarters in Kingston rather than a regional office there as is the case with FLOW, which is based in Miami).\n\n\n== Postal service ==\nPostal services in Kingston and throughout the island are provided by the Postal Corporation of Jamaica, the national post office of Jamaica. Services include domestic and international mail delivery, post office boxes, registered mail, priority mail (local courier), parcel delivery, express mail service (international courier), advertising mail and provision of post office boxes.\nKingston is divided in several postal zones enumerated as follows;\n\n\n== Institutions ==\nKingston, as the capital, is the financial, cultural, economic and industrial centre of Jamaica. Many financial institutions are based in Kingston, and the city boasts the largest number of hospitals, schools, universities and cultural attractions of any urban area on the island. Notable Kingston landmarks include the University of the West Indies, Jamaica Defence Force Museum, and Bob Marley Museum. A United Nations agency, the International Seabed Authority is headquartered in Kingston.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\nKingston is twinned with:\n\n Miami, Florida, United States\n Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States\n Topeka, Kansas, United States\n Gibraltar, Gibraltar, United Kingdom\n Coventry, England, United Kingdom\n Guadalajara, Mexico\n Shenzhen, People's Republic of China:\n Panev\u0117\u017eys, Lithuania\n Windhoek, Namibia\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of metropolitan areas in the West Indies\nRoy Anthony Bridge\nTrenchtown\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKingston & St Andrew Corporation website",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr. ONH (17 August 1887 \u2013 10 June 1940) was a Jamaican political activist, publisher, journalist, entrepreneur, and orator. He was the founder and first President-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL, commonly known as UNIA), through which he declared himself Provisional President of Africa. Ideologically a black nationalist and Pan-Africanist, his ideas came to be known as Garveyism.\nGarvey was born to a moderately prosperous Afro-Jamaican family in Saint Ann's Bay, Colony of Jamaica and apprenticed into the print trade as a teenager. Working in Kingston, he became involved in trade unionism before living briefly in Costa Rica, Panama, and England. Returning to Jamaica, he founded UNIA in 1914. In 1916, he moved to the United States and established a UNIA branch in New York City's Harlem district. Emphasising unity between Africans and the African diaspora, he campaigned for an end to European colonial rule across Africa and the political unification of the continent. He envisioned a unified Africa as a one-party state, governed by himself, that would enact laws to ensure black racial purity. Although he never visited the continent, he was committed to the Back-to-Africa movement, arguing that many African-Americans should migrate there. Garveyist ideas became increasingly popular and UNIA grew in membership. However, his black separatist views\u2014and his collaboration with white racists such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) to advance their shared interest in racial separatism\u2014divided Garvey from other prominent African-American civil rights activists such as W. E. B. Du Bois who promoted racial integration.\nCommitted to the belief that African-Americans needed to secure financial independence from white-dominant society, Garvey launched various businesses in the U.S., including the Negro Factories Corporation and Negro World newspaper. In 1919, he became President of the Black Star Line shipping and passenger company, designed to forge a link between North America and Africa and facilitate African-American migration to Liberia. In 1923 Garvey was convicted of mail fraud for selling the company's stock and imprisoned in the United States Penitentiary Atlanta for nearly two years. Many commentators have argued that the trial was politically motivated; Garvey blamed Jewish people, claiming that they were prejudiced against him because of his links to the KKK. Deported to Jamaica in 1927, where he settled in Kingston with his wife Amy Jacques, Garvey continued his activism and established the People's Political Party in 1929, briefly serving as a city councillor. With UNIA in increasing financial difficulty, in 1935 he relocated to London, where his anti-socialist stance distanced him from many of the city's black activists. He died there in 1940, although in 1964 his body was returned to Jamaica for reburial in Kingston's National Heroes Park.\nGarvey was a controversial figure. Some in the African diasporic community regarded him as a pretentious demagogue and were highly critical of his collaboration with white supremacists, his violent rhetoric, and his prejudice against mixed-race people and Jews. He nevertheless received praise for encouraging a sense of pride and self-worth among Africans and the African diaspora amid widespread poverty, discrimination, and colonialism. He is seen as a national hero in Jamaica, and his ideas exerted a considerable influence on such movements as Rastafari, the Nation of Islam, and the Black Power Movement.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Childhood: 1887\u20131904 ===\n\nMarcus Mosiah Garvey was born on 17 August 1887 in Saint Ann's Bay, a town in the Colony of Jamaica. In the context of colonial Jamaican society, which had a colourist social hierarchy, Garvey was considered at the lowest end, being a black child who believed he was of full African ancestry; later genetic research nevertheless revealed that he had some Iberian ancestors. Garvey's paternal great-grandfather had been born into slavery prior to its abolition in the British Empire. His surname, which was of Irish origin, had been inherited from his family's former owners.His father, Malchus Garvey, was a stonemason; his mother, Sarah Richards, was a domestic servant and the daughter of peasant farmers. Malchus had had two previous partners before Sarah, having six children between them. Sarah bore him four additional children, of whom Marcus was the youngest, although two died in infancy. Because of his profession, Malchus' family were wealthier than many of their peasant neighbours; they were petty bourgeoise. Malchus was however reckless with his money and over the course of his life lost most of the land he owned to meet payments. Malchus had a book collection and was self-educated; he also served as an occasional layman at a local Wesleyan church. Malchus was an intolerant and punitive father and husband; he never had a close relationship with his son.Up to the age of 14, Garvey attended a local church school; further education was unaffordable for the family. When not in school, Garvey worked on his maternal uncle's tenant farm. He had friends, with whom he once broke the windows of a church, resulting in his arrest. Some of his friends were white, although he found that as they grew older they distanced themselves from him; he later recalled that a close childhood friend was a white girl: \"We were two innocent fools who never dreamed of a race feeling and problem.\" In 1901, Marcus was apprenticed to his godfather, a local printer. In 1904, the printer opened another branch at Port Maria, where Garvey began to work, traveling from Saint Ann's Bay each morning.\n\n\n=== Early career in Kingston: 1905\u20131909 ===\nIn 1905 he moved to Kingston, where he boarded in Smith Village, a working-class neighbourhood. In the city, he secured work with the printing division of the P.A. Benjamin Manufacturing Company. He rose quickly through the company ranks, becoming their first Afro-Jamaican foreman. His sister and mother, by this point estranged from his father, moved to join him in the city. In January 1907, Kingston was hit by an earthquake that reduced much of the city to rubble. He, his mother, and his sister were left to sleep in the open for several months. In March 1908, his mother died. While in Kingston, Garvey converted to Roman Catholicism.Garvey became a trade unionist and took a leading role in the November 1908 print workers' strike. The strike was broken several weeks later and Garvey was sacked. Henceforth branded a troublemaker, Garvey was unable to find work in the private sector. He then found temporary employment with a government printer. As a result of these experiences, Garvey became increasingly angry at the inequalities present in Jamaican society.Garvey involved himself with the National Club, Jamaica's first nationalist organization, becoming its first assistant secretary in April 1910. The group campaigned to remove the British Governor of Jamaica, Sydney Olivier, from office, and to end the migration of Indian \"coolies\", or indentured workers, to Jamaica, as they were seen as a source of economic competition by the established population. With fellow Club member Wilfred Domingo he published a pamphlet expressing the group's ideas, The Struggling Mass. In early 1910, Garvey began publishing a magazine, Garvey's Watchman\u2014its name a reference to George William Gordon's The Watchman\u2014although it only lasted three issues. He claimed it had a circulation of 3000, although this was likely an exaggeration. Garvey also enrolled in elocution lessons with the radical journalist Joseph Robert Love, whom Garvey came to regard as a mentor. With his enhanced skill at speaking in a Standard English manner, he entered several public speaking competitions.\n\n\n=== Travels abroad: 1910\u20131914 ===\nEconomic hardship in Jamaica led to growing emigration from the island. In mid-1910, Garvey travelled to Costa Rica, where an uncle had secured him employment as a timekeeper on a large banana plantation in the Lim\u00f3n Province owned by the United Fruit Company (UFC). Shortly after his arrival, the area experienced strikes and unrest in opposition to the UFC's attempts to cut its workers' wages. Although as a timekeeper he was responsible for overseeing the manual workers, he became increasingly angered at how they were treated. In the spring of 1911 be launched a bilingual newspaper, Nation/La Naci\u00f3n, which criticised the actions of the UFC and upset many of the dominant strata of Costa Rican society in Lim\u00f3n. His coverage of a local fire, in which he questioned the motives of the fire brigade, resulted in him being brought in for police questioning. After his printing press broke, he was unable to replace the faulty part and terminated the newspaper.\n\nGarvey then travelled through Central America, undertaking casual work as he made his way through Honduras, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. While in the port of Col\u00f3n in Panama, he set up a new newspaper, La Prensa (\"The Press\"). In 1911, he became seriously ill with a bacterial infection and decided to return to Kingston. He then decided to travel to London, the administrative centre of the British Empire, in the hope of advancing his informal education. In the spring of 1912 he sailed to England. Renting a room along Borough High Street in South London, he visited the House of Commons, where he was impressed by the politician David Lloyd George. He also visited Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park and began speaking there. There were only a few thousand black people in London at the time, and they were often viewed as exotic; most worked as labourers. Garvey initially gained piecemeal work labouring in the city's docks. In August 1912, his sister Indiana joined him in London, where she worked as a domestic servant.In early 1913 he was employed as a messenger and handyman for the African Times and Orient Review, a magazine based in Fleet Street that was edited by Dus\u00e9 Mohamed Ali. The magazine advocated Ethiopianism and home rule for British-occupied Egypt. In 1914, Mohamed Ali began employing Garvey's services as a writer for the magazine. He also took several evening classes in law at Birkbeck College in Bloomsbury. Garvey planned a tour of Europe, spending time in Glasgow, Paris, Monte Carlo, Boulogne, and Madrid. During the trip, he was briefly engaged to a Spanish-Irish heiress. Back in London, he wrote an article on Jamaica for the Tourist magazine, and spent time reading in the library of the British Museum. There he discovered Up from Slavery, a book by the African-American entrepreneur and activist Booker T. Washington. Washington's book heavily influenced him. Now almost financially destitute and deciding to return to Jamaica, he unsuccessfully asked both the Colonial Office and the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines' Protection Society to pay for his journey. After managing to save the funds for a fare, he boarded the SS Trent in June 1914 for a three-week journey across the Atlantic. En route home, Garvey talked with an Afro-Caribbean missionary who had spent time in Basutoland and taken a Basuto wife. Discovering more about colonial Africa from this man, Garvey began to envision a movement that would politically unify black people of African descent across the world.\n\n\n== Organization of UNIA ==\n\n\n=== Forming UNIA: 1914\u20131916 ===\n\nGarvey arrived back in Jamaica in July 1914. There, he saw his article for Tourist republished in The Gleaner. He began earning money selling greeting and condolence cards which he had imported from Britain, before later switching to selling tombstones.Also in July 1914, Garvey launched the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League, commonly abbreviated as UNIA. Adopting the motto of \"One Aim. One God. One Destiny\", it declared its commitment to \"establish a brotherhood among the black race, to promote a spirit of race pride, to reclaim the fallen and to assist in civilising the backward tribes of Africa.\" Initially, it had only few members. Many Jamaicans were critical of the group's prominent use of the term \"Negro\", a term which was often employed as an insult: Garvey, however, embraced the term in reference to black people of African descent.Garvey became UNIA's president and travelling commissioner; it was initially based out of his hotel room in Orange Street, Kingston. It portrayed itself not as a political organization but as a charitable club, focused on work to help the poor and to ultimately establish a vocational training college modelled on Washington's Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Garvey wrote to Washington and received a brief, if encouraging reply; Washington died shortly after. UNIA officially expressed its loyalty to the British Empire, King George V, and the British effort in the ongoing First World War. In April 1915 Brigadier General L. S. Blackden lectured to the group on the war effort; Garvey endorsed Blackden's calls for more Jamaicans to sign up to fight for the Empire on the Western Front. The group also sponsored musical and literary evenings as well as a February 1915 elocution contest, at which Garvey took first prize.In August 1914, Garvey attended a meeting of the Queen Street Baptist Literary and Debating Society, where he met Amy Ashwood, recently graduated from the Westwood Training College for Women. She joined UNIA and rented a better premises for them to use as their headquarters, secured using her father's credit. She and Garvey embarked on a relationship, which was opposed by her parents. In 1915 they secretly became engaged. When she suspended the engagement, he threatened to commit suicide, at which she resumed it.\n\nGarvey attracted financial contributions from many prominent patrons, including the Mayor of Kingston and the Governor of Jamaica, William Manning. By appealing directly to Jamaica's white elite, Garvey had skipped the brown middle-classes, comprising those who were classified as mulattos, quadroons, and octoroons. They were generally hostile to Garvey, regarding him as a pretentious social climber and being annoyed at his claim to be part of the \"cultured class\" of Jamaican society. Many also felt that he was unnecessarily derogatory when describing black Jamaicans, with letters of complaint being sent into the Daily Chronicle after it published one of Garvey's speeches in which he referred to many of his people as \"uncouth and vulgar\". One complainant, a Dr Leo Pink, related that \"the Jamaican Negro can not be reformed by abuse\". After unsubstantiated allegations began circling that Garvey was diverting UNIA funds to pay for his own personal expenses, the group's support began to decline. He became increasingly aware of how UNIA had failed to thrive in Jamaica and decided to migrate to the United States, sailing there aboard the SS Tallac in March 1916.\n\n\n=== To the United States: 1916\u20131918 ===\n\nArriving in the United States, Garvey initially lodged with a Jamaican expatriate family living in Harlem, a largely black area of New York City. He began lecturing in the city, hoping to make a career as a public speaker, although at his first public speech was heckled and fell off the stage. From New York City, he embarked on a U.S. speaking tour, crossing 38 states. At stopovers on his journey he listened to preachers from the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the Black Baptist churches. While in Alabama, he visited the Tuskegee Institute and met with its new leader, Robert Russa Moton. After six months traveling across the U.S. lecturing, he returned to New York City.In May 1917, Garvey launched a New York branch of UNIA. He declared membership open to anyone \"of Negro blood and African ancestry\" who could pay the 25 cents a month membership fee. He joined many other speakers who spoke on the street, standing on step-ladders; he often did so at Speakers' Corner on 135th Street. In his speeches, he sought to reach across to both Afro-Caribbean migrants like himself and native African-Americans. Through this, he began to associate with Hubert Harrison, who was promoting ideas of black self-reliance and racial separatism. In June, Garvey shared a stage with Harrison at the inaugural meeting of the latter's Liberty League of Negro-Americans. Through his appearance here and at other events organised by Harrison, Garvey attracted growing public attention.After the U.S. entered the First World War in April 1917, Garvey initially signed up to fight but was ruled physically unfit to do so. He later became an opponent of African-American involvement in the conflict, following Harrison in accusing it of being a \"white man's war\". In the wake of the East St. Louis Race Riots in May to July 1917, in which white mobs targeted black people, Garvey began calling for armed self-defense. He produced a pamphlet, \"The Conspiracy of the East St Louis Riots\", which was widely distributed; proceeds from its sale went to victims of the riots. The Bureau of Investigation began monitoring him, noting that in speeches he employed more militant language than that used in print; it for instance reported him expressing the view that \"for every Negro lynched by whites in the South, Negroes should lynch a white in the North.\"By the end of 1917, Garvey had attracted many of Harrison's key associates in his Liberty League to join UNIA. Garvey also secured the support of the journalist John Edward Bruce, agreeing to step down from the group's presidency in favor of Bruce. Bruce then wrote to Dus\u00e9 Mohamed Ali to learn more about Garvey's past. Mohamed Ali responded with a negative assessment of Garvey, suggesting that he simply used UNIA as a money-making scheme. Bruce read this letter to a UNIA meeting and put pressure on Garvey's position. Garvey then resigned from UNIA, establishing a rival group that met at Old Fellows Temple. He also launched legal proceedings against Bruce and other senior UNIA members, with the court ruling that UNIA's name and membership\u2014now estimated at around 600\u2014belonged to Garvey, who resumed control over the organization.\n\n\n=== The growth of UNIA: 1918\u20131921 ===\nUNIA membership grew rapidly in 1918. In June that year it was incorporated, and in July a commercial arm, the African Communities' League, filed for incorporation. Garvey envisioned UNIA establishing an import-and-export business, a restaurant, and a launderette. He also proposed raising the funds to secure a permanent building as a base for the group. In April, Garvey launched a weekly newspaper, the Negro World, which Cronon later noted remained \"the personal propaganda organ of its founder\". Financially, the Negro World was backed by philanthropists like Madam C. J. Walker, but six months after its launch was pursuing a special appeal for donations to keep it afloat. Various journalists took Garvey to court for his failure to pay them for their contributions, a fact much publicised by rival publications; at the time, there were over 400 black-run newspapers and magazines in the U.S. Unlike many of these, Garvey refused to feature adverts for skin-lightening and hair-straightening products, urging black people to \"take the kinks out of your mind, instead of out of your hair\". By the end of its first year, the circulation of Negro World was nearing 10,000; copies circulated not only in the U.S., but also in the Caribbean, Central, and South America. Several British colonies in the Caribbean banned the publication.\n\nGarvey appointed his old friend Domingo, who had also arrived in New York City, as the newspaper's editor. However, Domingo's socialist views alarmed Garvey, who feared that they would imperil UNIA. Garvey had Domingo brought before UNIA's nine-person executive committee, where the latter was accused of writing editorials professing ideas at odds with UNIA's message. Domingo resigned several months later; he and Garvey henceforth became enemies. In September 1918, Amy Ashwood sailed from Panama to be with Garvey, arriving in New York City in October. In November, she became General Secretary of UNIA. At UNIA gatherings, she was responsible for reciting black-authored poetry, as was the actor Henrietta Vinton Davis, who had also joined the movement.After the First World War ended, President Woodrow Wilson declared his intention to present a 14-point plan for world peace at the forthcoming Paris Peace Conference. Garvey joined various African-Americans in forming the International League for Darker People, a group which sought to lobby Wilson and the conference to give greater respect to the wishes of people of colour; their delegates nevertheless were unable to secure the travel documentation. At Garvey's prompting, UNIA sent a young Haitian, Eliezer Cadet, as its delegate to the conference. Despite these efforts, the political leaders who met in Paris largely ignored the perspectives of non-European peoples, instead reaffirming their support for European colonialism.In the U.S., many African-Americans who had served in the military refused to return to their more subservient role in society and throughout 1919 there were various racial clashes throughout the country. The government feared that African-Americans would be encouraged toward revolutionary behavior following the October Revolution in Russia, and in this context, military intelligence ordered Major Walter Loving to investigate Garvey. Loving's report concluded that Garvey was a \"very able young man\" who was disseminating \"clever propaganda\". The BOI's J. Edgar Hoover decided that Garvey was politically subversive and should be deported from the U.S., adding his name to the list of those to be targeted in the forthcoming Palmer Raids. To ratify the deportation, the BOI presented Garvey's name to the Labor Department under Louis F. Post, however Post's department refused to do so, stating that the case against Garvey was not proven.\n\n\n==== Success and obstacles ====\n\nUNIA grew rapidly and in just over 18 months it had branches in 25 U.S. states, as well as divisions in the West Indies, Central America, and West Africa. The exact membership is not known, although Garvey\u2014who often exaggerated numbers\u2014claimed that by June 1919 it had two million members. It remained smaller than the better established National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), although there was some crossover in membership of the two groups. The NAACP and UNIA differed in their approach; while the NAACP was a multi-racial organization which promoted racial integration, UNIA had a black-only membership policy. The NAACP focused its attention on what it termed the \"talented tenth\" of the African-American population, such as doctors, lawyers, and teachers, whereas UNIA included many poorer people and Afro-Caribbean migrants in its ranks, seeking to project an image of itself as a mass organization. To promote his views to a wide audience, Garvey took to shouting slogans from a megaphone as he was driven through Harlem in a Cadillac.There were tensions between UNIA and the NAACP and the latter's supporters accused Garvey of stymieing their efforts at bringing about racial integration in the U.S. Garvey was dismissive of the NAACP leader W. E. B. Du Bois, and in one issue of the Negro World called him a \"reactionary under [the] pay of white men\". Du Bois generally tried to ignore Garvey, regarding him as a demagogue, but at the same time wanted to learn all he could about Garvey's movement. In 1921, Garvey twice reached out to DuBois, asking him to contribute to UNIA publications, but the offer was rebuffed. Their relationship became acrimonious; in 1923, DuBois described Garvey as \"a little fat black man, ugly but with intelligent eyes and big head\". By 1924, Grant suggested, the two hated each other.UNIA established a restaurant and ice cream parlour at 56 West 135th Street, and also launched a millinery store selling hats. With an increased income coming in through UNIA, Garvey moved to a new residence at 238 West 131st Street; in 1919, a young middle-class Jamaican migrant, Amy Jacques, became his personal secretary. UNIA also obtained a partially-constructed church building at  114 West 138 Street in  Harlem, which Garvey named \"Liberty Hall\" after its namesake in Dublin, Ireland, which had been established during the Easter Rising of 1916. The adoption of this name reflected Garvey's fascination for the Irish independence movement. Liberty Hall's dedication ceremony was held in July 1919. Garvey also organised the African Legion, a group of uniformed men who would attend UNIA parades; a secret service was formed from Legion members, providing Garvey with intelligence about group members. The formation of the Legion further concerned the BOI, who sent their first full-time black agent, James Wormley Jones, to infiltrate UNIA.\nIn January 1920, Garvey incorporated the Negro Factories League, through which he opened a string of grocery stores, a restaurant, a steam laundry, and publishing house.\nAccording to Grant, a personality cult had grown up around Garvey within the UNIA movement; life-size portraits of him hung in the UNIA headquarters and phonographs of his speeches were sold to the membership.\n\nIn August 1920, UNIA organized the First International Conference of the Negro Peoples in Harlem. This parade was attended by Gabriel Johnson, the Mayor of Monrovia in Liberia. As part of it, an estimated 25,000 people assembled in Madison Square Gardens. At the conference, UNIA delegates declared Garvey to be the Provisional President of Africa, charged with heading a government-in-exile that could take power in the continent when European colonial occupation ended. Some of the West Africans attending the event were angered by this, believing it wrong that an Afro-Jamaican, rather than a native African, was taking this role. Many outside the movement ridiculed Garvey for giving himself this title. The conference then elected other members of the African government-in-exile, resulting in the production of a \"Declaration of the Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World\" which condemned colonial rule across Africa. In August 1921, UNIA held a banquet in Liberty Hall, at which Garvey gave out honors to various supporters, including such titles as the Order of the Nile and the Order of Ethiopia.UNIA established growing links with the Liberian government, hoping to secure land in the West African nation onto which it could settle African-American migrants. Liberia was in heavy debt, with UNIA launching a fundraising campaign to raise $2 million towards a Liberian Construction Loan. In 1921, Garvey sent a UNIA team to assess the prospects of mass African-American settlement in Liberia.\nInternally, UNIA experienced various feuds. Garvey pushed out Cyril Briggs and other members of the African Blood Brotherhood from UNIA, wanting to place growing distance between himself and black socialist groups. In the Negro World, Garvey then accused Briggs\u2014who was of mixed heritage\u2014of being a white man posing as a black man. Briggs successfully sued Garvey for criminal libel. This was not the only time he faced this charge; in July 1919 Garvey had been arrested for comments made about Edwin Kilroe in the Negro World. When this case eventually came to court, the court ordered Garvey to provide a printed retraction.\n\n\n==== Assassination attempts, marriage, and divorce ====\nIn October 1919, George Tyler, a part-time vendor of the Negro World, entered the UNIA office and tried to assassinate Garvey. The latter received two bullets in his legs but survived. Tyler was soon apprehended but died in an escape attempt from jail; it was never revealed why he tried to kill Garvey. Garvey soon recovered from his wounds; five days later he gave a public speech in Philadelphia. After the assassination attempt, Garvey hired a bodyguard, Marcellus Strong. Shortly after the incident, Garvey proposed marriage to Amy Ashwood and she accepted. On Christmas Day, they had a private Roman Catholic church wedding, followed by a major ceremonial celebration in Liberty Hall, attended by 3000 UNIA members. Jacques was Ashwood's maid of honour. After the wedding, Garvey moved into Ashwood's apartment.\nThe newlyweds embarked on a two-week honeymoon in Canada, accompanied by a small UNIA retinue, including Jacques. There, Garvey spoke at two mass meetings in Montreal and three in Toronto. Returning to Harlem, the couple's marriage was soon strained. Ashwood complained of Garvey's growing closeness with Jacques. Garvey was upset by his inability to control his wife, particularly her drinking and her socialising with other men. She was pregnant, although the child was possibly not his; she did not inform him of this, and the pregnancy ended in miscarriage.Three months into the marriage, Garvey sought an annulment, on the basis of Ashwood's alleged adultery and the claim that she had used \"fraud and concealment\" to induce the marriage. She launched a counter-claim for desertion, requesting $75 a week alimony. The court rejected this sum, instead ordering Garvey to pay her $12 a week. It refused to grant him the divorce. The court proceedings continued for two years. Now separated, Garvey moved into a 129th Street apartment with Jacques and Henrietta Vinton Davis, an arrangement that at the time could have caused some social controversy. He was later joined there by his sister Indiana and her husband, Alfred Peart. Ashwood, meanwhile, went on to become a lyricist and musical director for musicals amid the Harlem Renaissance.\n\n\n==== The Black Star Line ====\nFrom 56 West 135th, UNIA also began selling shares for a new business, the Black Star Line.\nThe Black Star Line based its name on the White Star Line. Garvey envisioned a shipping and passenger line travelling between Africa and the Americas, which would be black-owned, black-staffed, and utilised by black patrons. He thought that the project could be launched by raising $2 million from African-American donors, publicly declaring that any black person who did not buy stock in the company \"will be worse than a traitor to the cause of struggling Ethiopia\". He incorporated the company and then sought about trying to purchase a ship. Many African-Americans took great pride in buying company stock, seeing it as an investment in their community's future; Garvey also promised that when the company began turning a profit they would receive significant financial returns on their investment. To advertise this stock, he travelled to Virginia, and then in September 1919 to Chicago, where he was accompanied by seven other UNIA members. In Chicago, he was arrested and fined for violating the Blue Sky Laws which banned the sale of stock in the city without a license.\n\nWith growing quantities of money coming in, a three-man auditing committee was established, which found that UNIA's funds were poorly recorded and that the company's books were not balanced. This was followed by a breakdown in trust between the directors of the Black Star Line, with Garvey discharging two of them, Richard E. Warner and Edgar M. Grey, and publicly humiliating them at the next UNIA meeting. People continued buying stock regardless and by September 1919, the Black Star Line company had accumulated $50,000 by selling stock. It could thus afford a thirty-year old tramp ship, the SS Yarmouth. The ship was formally launched in a ceremony on the Hudson River on 31 October. The company had been unable to find enough trained black seamen to staff the ship, so its initial chief engineer and chief officer were white.The ship's first assignment was to sail to Cuba and then to Jamaica, before returning to New York. After that first voyage, the Yarmouth was found to contain many problems and the Black Star Line had to pay $11,000 for repairs. On its second voyage, again to the Caribbean, it hit bad weather shortly after departure and had to be towed back to New York by the coastguard for further repairs.\nGarvey planned to obtain and launch a second ship by February 1920, with the Black Star Line putting down a $10,000 down payment on a paddle ship called the SS Shadyside. In July 1920, Garvey sacked both the Black Star Line's secretary, Edward D. Smith-Green, and its captain, Joshua Cockburn; the latter was accused of corruption. In early 1922, the Yarmouth was sold for scrap metal.In 1921, Garvey travelled to the Caribbean aboard a new BSL ship, the Antonio Maceo, which they had renamed the Kanawha. While in Jamaica, he criticised its inhabitants as being backward and claimed that \"Negroes are the most lazy, the most careless and indifferent people in the world\". His comments in Jamaica earned many enemies who criticised him on multiple fronts, including the fact he had left his destitute father to die in an almshouse. Attacks back-and-forth between Garvey and his critics appeared in the letters published by The Gleaner. From Jamaica, Garvey travelled to Costa Rica, where the United Fruit Company assisted his transportation around the country, hoping to gain his favour. There, he met with President Julio Acosta. Arriving in Panama, at one of his first speeches, in Almirante, he was booed after doubling the advertised entry price; his response was to call the crowd \"a bunch of ignorant and impertinent Negroes. No wonder you are where you are and for my part you can stay where you are.\" He received a far warmer reception at Panama City, after which he sailed to Kingston. From there he sought a return to the U.S., but was repeatedly denied an entry visa. This was only granted after he wrote directly to the State Department.\n\n\n=== Criminal charges: 1922\u20131923 ===\n\nIn January 1922, Garvey was arrested and charged with mail fraud for having advertised the sale of stocks in a ship, the Orion, which the Black Star Line did not yet own. He was bailed for $2,500. Hoover and the BOI were committed to securing a conviction; they had also received complaints from a small number of the Black Star Line's stock owners, who wanted them to pursue the matter further. Garvey spoke out against the charges he faced, but focused on blaming not the state, but rival African-American groups, for them. As well as accusing disgruntled former members of UNIA, in a Liberty Hall speech, he implied that the NAACP were behind the conspiracy to imprison him. The mainstream press picked up on the charge, largely presenting Garvey as a con artist who had swindled African-American people.After his arrest, he made plans for a tour of the western and southern states. This included a parade in Los Angeles, partly to woo back members of UNIA's California branch, which had recently splintered off to become independent.\nIn June 1922, Garvey met with Edward Young Clarke, the Imperial Wizard pro tempore of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) at the Klan's offices in Atlanta. Garvey made a number of incendiary speeches in the months leading up to that meeting; in some, he thanked the whites for Jim Crow.  Garvey once stated:\n\nI regard the Klan, the Anglo-Saxon clubs and White American societies, as far as the Negro is concerned, as better friends of the race than all other groups of hypocritical whites put together. I like honesty and fair play. You may call me a Klansman if you will, but, potentially, every white man is a Klansman as far as the Negro in competition with whites socially, economically and politically is concerned, and there is no use lying.\nNews of Garvey's meeting with the KKK soon spread and it was covered on the front page of many African-American newspapers, causing widespread upset. When news of the meeting was revealed, it generated much surprise and anger among African-Americans; Grant noted that it marked \"the most significant turning point in his popularity\". Several prominent black Americans\u2014Chandler Owen, A. Philip Randolph, William Pickens, and Robert Bagnall\u2014launched the \"Garvey Must Go\" campaign in the wake of the revelation. Many of these critics played to nativist ideas by emphasising Garvey's Jamaican identity and sometimes calling for his deportation. Pickens and several other of Garvey's critics claimed to have been threatened, and sometimes physically attacked, by Garveyites. Randolph reported receiving a severed hand in the post, accompanied by a letter from the KKK threatening him to stop criticising Garvey and to join UNIA.\n\n1922 also brought some successes for Garvey. He attracted the country's first black pilot, Hubert Fauntleroy Julian, to join UNIA and to perform aerial stunts to raise its profile. The group also launched its Booker T. Washington University from the UNIA-run Phyllis Wheatley Hotel on West 136th Street. He also finally succeeded in securing a UNIA delegation to the League of Nations, sending five members to represent the group to Geneva. Garvey also proposed marriage to his secretary, Jacques. She accepted, although later stated: \"I did not marry for love. I did not love Garvey. I married him because I thought it was the right thing to do.\" They married in Baltimore in July 1922. She proposed that a book of his speeches be published; it appeared as The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey, although the speeches were edited to remove more inflammatory material. That year, UNIA also launched a new newspaper, the Daily Negro Times.At UNIA's August 1922 convention, Garvey called for the impeachment of several senior UNIA figures, including Adrian Johnson and J. D. Gibson, and declared that the UNIA cabinet should not be elected by the organization's members, but appointed directly by him. When they refused to step down, he resigned both as head of UNIA and as Provisional President of Africa, probably in an act designed to compel their own resignations. He then began openly criticising another senior member, Reverend James Eason, and succeeded in getting him expelled from UNIA. With Eason gone, Garvey asked the rest of the cabinet to resign; they did so, at which he resumed his role as head of the organization. In September, Eason launched a rival group to UNIA, the Universal Negro Alliance. In January 1923, Eason was assassinated by Garveyites while in New Orleans. Hoover suspected that the killing had been ordered by senior UNIA members, although Garvey publicly denied any involvement; he nevertheless launched a defense fund campaign for Eason's killers.Following the murder, eight prominent African-Americans signed a public letter calling Garvey \"an unscrupulous demagogue who has ceaselessly and assiduously sought to spread among Negroes distrust and hatred of all white people\". They urged the Attorney-General to bring forth the criminal case against Garvey and disband UNIA. Garvey was furious, publicly accusing them of \"the greatest bit of treachery and wickedness that any group of Negroes could be capable of.\" In a pamphlet attacking them he focused on their racial heritage, lambasting the eight for the reason that \"nearly all [are] Octoroons and Quadroons\". DuBois\u2014who was not among the eight\u2014then wrote an article critical of Garvey's activities in the U.S. Garvey responded by calling DuBois \"a Hater of Dark People\", an \"unfortunate mulatto who bewails every drop of Negro blood in his veins\".\n\n\n=== Trial: 1923 ===\n\nHaving been postponed at least three times, in May 1923, the trial finally came to court, with Garvey and three other defendants accused of mail fraud.\nThe judge overseeing the proceedings was Julian Mack, although Garvey disliked his selection on the grounds that he thought Mack an NAACP sympathiser. At the start of the trial, Garvey's attorney, Cornelius McDougald, urged him to plead guilty to secure a minimum sentence, but Garvey refused, dismissing McDougald and deciding to represent himself in court. The trial proceeded for over a month. Throughout, Garvey struggled due to his lack of legal training. In his three-hour closing address he presented himself as a selfless leader who was beset by incompetent and thieving staff who caused all the problems for UNIA and the Black Star Line. On 18 June, the jurors retired to deliberate on the verdict, returning after ten hours. They found Garvey himself guilty, but his three co-defendants not guilty.Garvey was furious with the verdict, shouting abuse in the courtroom and calling both the judge and district attorney \"damned dirty Jews\". Imprisoned in The Tombs jail while awaiting sentencing, he continued to blame a Jewish cabal for the verdict; in contrast, prior to this he had never expressed anti-semitic sentiment and was supportive of Zionism. When it came to sentencing, Mack sentenced Garvey to five years' imprisonment and a $1000 fine. The severity of the sentence\u2014which was harsher than those given to similar crimes at the time\u2014may have been a response to Garvey's anti-Semitic outburst. He felt that they had been biased because of their political objections to his meeting with the acting imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan the year before. In 1928, Garvey told a journalist: \"When they wanted to get me they had a Jewish judge try me, and a Jewish prosecutor. I would have been freed but two Jews on the jury held out against me ten hours and succeeded in convicting me, whereupon the Jewish judge gave me the maximum penalty.\"A week after the sentence, 2000 Garveyite protesters met at Liberty Hall to denounce Garvey's conviction as a miscarriage of justice. However, with Garvey imprisoned, UNIA's membership began to decline, and there was a growing schism between its Caribbean and African-American members. From jail, Garvey continued to write letters and articles lashing out at those he blamed for the conviction, focusing much of his criticism on the NAACP.\n\n\n==== Out on bail: 1923\u20131925 ====\nIn September, Judge Martin Manton awarded Garvey bail for $15,000\u2014which was duly raised by UNIA\u2014while he appealed his conviction. Again a free man, he toured the U.S., giving a lecture at the Tuskegee Institute. In speeches given during this tour he further emphasised the need for racial segregation through migration to Africa, calling the United States \"a white man's country\". He continued to defend his meeting with the KKK, describing them as having more \"honesty of purpose towards the Negro\" than the NAACP. Although he previously avoided involvement with party politics, for the first time he encouraged UNIA to propose candidates in elections, often setting them against NAACP-backed candidates in areas with high black populations.\n\nIn February 1924, UNIA put forward its plans to bring 3000 African-American migrants to Liberia. The latter's President, Charles D. B. King, assured them that he would grant them area for three colonies. In June, a team of UNIA technicians was sent to start work in preparing for these colonies. When they arrived in Liberia, they were arrested and immediately deported. At the same time, Liberia's government issued a press release declaring that it would refuse permission for any Americans to settle in their country. Garvey blamed DuBois for this apparent change in the Liberian government's attitude, for the latter had spent time in the country and had links with its ruling elite; DuBois denied the accusation. Later examination suggested that, despite King's assurances to the UNIA team, the Liberian government had never seriously intended to allow African-American colonization, aware that it would harm relations with the British and French colonies on their borders, who feared the political radicalism it could bring with it.UNIA faced further setbacks when Bruce died; the group organised a funeral procession ending in a ceremony at Liberty Hall. In need of additional finances, Negro World dropped its longstanding ban on advertising skin lightening and hair straightening products. The additional revenues allowed the Black Star Line to purchase a new ship, the SS General G W Goethals, in October 1924. It was then renamed the SS Booker T. Washington.\n\n\n=== Imprisonment: 1925\u20131927 ===\n\nIn early 1925, the U.S. Court of Appeal upheld the original court decision. Garvey was in Detroit at the time and was arrested while aboard a train back to New York City. In February he was taken to the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary and incarcerated there. Imprisoned, he was made to carry out cleaning tasks. On one occasion he was reprimanded for insolence towards the white prison officers. There, he became increasingly ill with chronic bronchitis and lung infections; two years into his imprisonment he would be hospitalized with influenza. He received regular letters from UNIA members and from his wife; she also visited him every three weeks. With his support, she assembled another book of his collected speeches, Philosophy and Opinions; these had often been edited to remove inflammatory comments about wielding violence against white people. He also wrote The Meditations of Marcus Garvey, its name an allusion to The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. From prison, Garvey continued corresponding with far-right white separatist activists like Earnest Sevier Cox of the White American Society and John Powell of the Anglo-Saxon Clubs of America; the latter visited Garvey in prison.While Garvey was imprisoned, Ashwood launched a legal challenge against his divorce from her; had the divorce been found void then his marriage to Jacques would have been invalid. The court nevertheless ruled in favor of Garvey, recognising the legality of his divorce. With Garvey absent, William Sherrill became acting head of UNIA. To deal with the organization's financial problems, he re-mortgaged Liberty Hall to pay off debts and ended up selling off the SS Brooker T Washington at a quarter of what UNIA had paid for it. Garvey was angry and in February 1926 wrote to the Negro World expressing his dissatisfaction with Sherrill's leadership. From prison, he organized an emergency UNIA convention in Detroit, where delegates voted to depose Sherrill. The latter's supporters then held a rival convention in Liberty Hall, reflecting the growing schism in the organization. A subsequent court ruling determined that it was UNIA's New York branch, then controlled by Sherrill, rather than the central UNIA leadership itself, that owned Liberty Hall. The financial problems continued, resulting in Liberty Hall being repeatedly re-mortgaged and then sold.The Attorney General, John Sargent, received a petition with 70,000 signatures urging for Garvey's release. Sargeant warned President Calvin Coolidge that African-Americans were regarding Garvey's imprisonment not as a form of justice against a man who had swindled them but as \"an act of oppression of the race in their efforts in the direction of race progress\". Eventually, Coolidge agreed to commute the sentence so that it would expire immediately, on 18 November 1927. He stipulated, however, that Garvey should be deported straight after release. On being released, Garvey was taken by train to New Orleans, where around a thousand supporters saw him onto the SS Saramaca on 3 December. The ship then stopped at Crist\u00f3bal in Panama, where supporters again greeted him, but where the authorities refused his request to disembark. He then transferred to the SS Santa Maria, which took him to Kingston.\n\n\n== Later years ==\n\n\n=== Back to Jamaica: 1927\u20131935 ===\nIn Kingston, Garvey was greeted by supporters. UNIA members had raised $10,000 to help him settle in Jamaica, with which he bought a large house in an elite neighbourhood, which he called the \"Somali Court\". His wife shipped over his belongings\u2014which included 18,000 books and hundreds of antiques\u2014before joining him. In Jamaica, he continued giving speeches, including at a building in Kingston he had also named \"Liberty Hall\". He urged Afro-Jamaicans to raise their standards of living and rally against Chinese and Syrian migrants who had moved to the island. Meanwhile, the U.S. UNIA had been taken over by E. B. Knox; the latter was summoned to Jamaica for a meeting with Garvey after Laura Kofey, the leader of a group that had broken from UNIA, was killed, bringing the organization into further disrepute.\n\nGarvey attempted to travel across Central America but found his hopes blocked by the region's various administrations, who regarded him as disruptive. Instead, he travelled to England in April, where he rented a house in London's West Kensington area for four months. In May, he spoke at the Royal Albert Hall. Later that year, he and his wife visited Paris, where he spoke at the Club du Fauborg, before traveling to Switzerland. They then travelled to Canada, where Garvey was detained for one night before being barred from making speeches.Back in Kingston, UNIA obtained Edelweiss Park in Cross Roads, which it established as its new headquarters. They held a conference there, opened by a parade through the city which attracted tens of thousands of onlookers. At Edelweiss Park, UNIA also began putting on plays. One of these, Coronation of an African King, was written by Garvey and performed in August 1930. Its plot revolved around the crowning of Prince Cudjoe of Sudan, although it anticipated the crowning of Haile Selassie of Ethiopia later that year. In Jamaica, Garvey became a de facto surrogate father to his niece, Ruth, whose father had recently died. In September 1930, his first son, Marcus Garvey III, was born; three years later a second son, Julius, followed.In Kingston, Garvey was elected a city councillor and established the country's first political party, the People's Political Party (PPP), through which he intended to contest the forthcoming legislative council election. In September 1929 he addressed a crowd of 1,500 supporters, launching the PPP's manifesto, which included land reform to benefit tenant farmers, the addition of a minimum wage to the constitution, pledges to build Jamaica's first university and opera house, and a proposed law to impeach and imprison corrupt judges. The latter policy led to Garvey being charged with demeaning the judiciary and undermining public confidence in it. He pled guilty, and was sentenced to three months in a Spanish Town prison and a \u00a3100 fine. While imprisoned, Garvey was removed from the Kingston council by other councillors. Garvey was furious and wrote an editorial against them, published in the Blackman journal. This resulted in his being charged with seditious libel, for which he was convicted and sentences to six months in prison. His conviction was then overturned on appeal. He then campaigned as the PPP's candidate for the legislative assembly in Saint Andrew Parish, in which he secured 915 votes, being defeated by George Seymour-Jones.In increasingly strained finances amid the Great Depression, Garvey began working as an auctioneer, and by 1935 was supplementing this with his wife's savings. He re-mortgaged his house and personal properties and in 1934 Edelweiss Park was foreclosed and auctioned off. Dissatisfied with life in Jamaica, Garvey decided to move to London, sailing aboard the SS Tilapa in March 1935.\nOnce in London, he told his friend Amy Bailey that he had \"left Jamaica a broken man, broken in spirit, broken in health and broken in pocket... and I will never, never, never go back.\"\n\n\n=== Life in London: 1935\u20131940 ===\n\nIn London, Garvey sought to rebuild UNIA, although found there was much competition in the city from other black activist groups. He established a new UNIA headquarters in Beaumont Gardens, West Kensington and launched a new monthly journal, Black Man. Garvey returned to speaking at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park. When he spoke in public, he was increasingly harangued by socialists for his conservative stances. He also had hopes of becoming a Member of Parliament, although this amounted to nothing.In 1935, the Second Italo-Ethiopian War broke out as Italy invaded Ethiopia. Garvey spoke out against the Italians and praised the government of Haile Selassie. By October, however, he was becoming increasingly critical of Selassie, blaming his lack of preparedness for Ethiopia's failures in the war. When Selassie fled his homeland and arrived in Britain, Garvey was among the black delegates who arranged to meet him at Waterloo railway station, but was rebuffed. From that point he became more openly hostile to Selassie, describing him as a \"feudal monarch who looks down upon his slaves and serfs with contempt\" and \"a great coward who ran away from his country to save his skin\". Garvey's vocal criticisms of Selassie further ostracised him from the broader black activist community\u2014including many Garveyites\u2014most of whom were rallying around Selassie as a symbol of Ethiopia's struggle against colonialism.In June 1937, Garvey's wife and children arrived in England, where the latter were sent to a school in Kensington Gardens. Shortly after, Garvey embarked on a lecture and fundraising tour of Canada and the Caribbean, in which he attended the annual UNIA convention in Toronto. In Trinidad, he openly criticised a recent oil workers' strike; this probably exacerbated tensions between him and two prominent Trinidadian Marxists then living in London, C. L. R. James and George Padmore. Once he had returned to London, Garvey took up a new family home in Talgarth Road, not far from UNIA's headquarters. In public debates, Garvey repeatedly clashed with Padmore, who was chair of the International African Service Bureau. In the summer of 1938, Garvey returned to Toronto for the next UNIA conference.While Garvey was gone, his wife and sons returned to Jamaica. Doctors had recommended that Marcus Garvey III be moved to a warm climate to aid with his severe rheumatism; Jacques had not informed her husband of the decision. When Garvey returned to London, he was furious with his wife's decision. Garvey was increasingly isolated, while UNIA was running out of funds as its international membership dwindled. For the first time in many years, he met up with Ashwood, who was also living in London.\n\n\n=== Death and burial: 1940 ===\nIn January 1940, Garvey suffered a stroke which left him largely paralysed. His secretary, Daisy Whyte, took on responsibility for his care. At this point, Padmore spread rumours of Garvey's death; this led to many newspapers publishing premature obituaries, many of which he read. Garvey then suffered a second stroke and died at the age of 52 on 10 June 1940. His body was interred in a vault in the catacombs of St Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Kensal Green Cemetery, West London.Various wakes and memorials were held for Garvey, especially in New York City and Kingston. In Harlem, a procession of mourners paraded to his memorial service. Some Garveyites refused to believe Garvey had died, even when confronted with photographs of his body in its coffin, insisting that this was part of a conspiracy to undermine his movement. Both Ashwood and Jacques presented themselves as the \"widow of Marcus Garvey\" and Ashwood launched legal action against Jacques in an attempt to secure control over his body.The writer Richard Hart later noted that within a decade of his death \"a veritable cult\" had begun to grow around Garvey's memory in Jamaica. By the 1950s, Jamaican politicians of varied ideological backgrounds were invoking his name. Leslie Alexander, a Kingston real estate agent, proposed the removal of Garvey's body and its return to Jamaica. Alexander's campaign was successful and in 1964 Garvey's remains were dug up and returned to Jamaica. The body lay in state at the Roman Catholic Cathedral in Kingston while thousands of visitors came to see it. It was then reburied in King George VI Memorial Park on 22 November 1964 with pomp and ceremony befitting a national hero; numerous foreign diplomats attended. The monument, designed by G. C. Hodges, consists of a tomb at the center of a raised platform in the shape of a black star, a symbol often used by Garvey. Behind it, a peaked and angled wall houses a bust, by Alvin T. Marriot,  of Garvey, which was added to the park in 1956 (before his reinterment) and relocated after the construction of the monument.\n\n\n== Ideology ==\n\nIdeologically, Garvey was a black nationalist. Generally referring to dark-skinned peoples of African descent as \"Negroes\", he and UNIA insisted that that term be capitalised, thus according dignity and respect to those whom it described. His ideas were influenced by a range of sources. According to Grant, while in London Garvey displayed \"an amazing capacity to absorb political tracts, theories of social engineering, African history and Western Enlightenment.\" Garvey was exposed to the ideas about race that were prevalent at the time; his ideas on race were also heavily informed by the writings of Edward Wilmot Blyden.During the late 1910s and 1920s, Garvey was also influenced by the ideas of the Irish independence movement, to which he was sympathetic. He saw strong parallels between the British subjugation of Ireland and the broader subjugation of black people, and identified strongly with the Irish independence leader \u00c9amon de Valera. In 1922, he sent a message to Valera stating that \"We believe Ireland should be free even as Africa shall be free for the Negroes of the world. Keep up the fight for a free Ireland.\" For Garvey, Ireland's Sinn F\u00e9in and the Irish independence movement served as a blueprint for his own black nationalist cause. In July 1919 he stated that \"the time has come for the Negro race to offer up its martyrs upon the altar of liberty even as the Irish [had] given a long list from Robert Emmet to Roger Casement.\"  He also admired the Indian independence movement then seeking freedom from the British Empire, describing Mahatma Gandhi as \"one of the noblest characters of the day\".\n\n\n=== Racial separatism ===\nWhile in the U.S., ideas about the need for black racial purity became central to Garvey's thought. He promoted racial separatism, but did not stress the idea of racial superiority. He argued that mixed-race people would be bred out of existence; this hostility to black people not deemed of \"pure\" African blood was an idea that Garvey shared with Blyden. Cronon believed that Garvey exhibited \"antipathy and distrust for any but the darkest-skinned Negroes\". He also rallied against Eurocentric beauty standards among blacks, seeing it as an impediment to black self-respect.Garvey vehemently denounced miscegenation. He accused Du Bois and NAACP of promoting \"amalgamation or general miscegenation\". He rallied against what he called the \"race destroying doctrine\" of those African-Americans calling for racial integration in the U.S., instead maintaining that his UNIA stood for \"the pride and purity of race. We believe that the white race should uphold its racial pride and perpetuate itself, and that the black race should do likewise. We believe that there is room enough in the world for the various race groups to grow and develop by themselves without seeking to destroy the Creator's plan by the constant introduction of mongrel types.\"He argued that the European-American population of the U.S. would never tolerate the social integration proposed by activists like DuBois and that campaigns for such integration would only encourage anti-black riots and lynchings. He openly conceded that the U.S. was a white man's country and thus did not think African-Americans could expect equality within it. He thus opposed attempts at social and economic integration of the races within the country.Garvey's belief in racial separatism, the migration of African-Americans to Africa, and opposition to miscegenation all endeared him to the KKK, who supported many of the same policies. He was willing to collaborate with U.S. white supremacists to achieve his aims. They were willing to work with him because his approach effectively acknowledged the idea that the U.S. should be a country exclusively for white people and would abandon campaigns for advanced rights for African-Americans within the U.S. Garvey called for black collaboration with the white separatist Anglo-Saxon Clubs, stating that they shared the same ideals: \"the purification of the races, their autonomous separation and the unbridled freedom of self-development and self-expression. Those who are against this are enemies of both races, and rebels against morality, nature and God.\"\n\n\n=== Pan-Africanism ===\n\nGarvey adopted a Pan-Africanist view. In Jamaica, he and his supporters were heavily influenced by the pan-Africanist teachings of Dr Love and Alexander Bedward. In the wake of the First World War, Garvey called for the formation of \"a United Africa for the Africans of the World\". UNIA promoted the view that Africa was the natural homeland of the African diaspora. While imprisoned, he penned an editorial for the Negro World entitled \"African Fundamentalism\", in which he called for \"the founding of a racial empire whose only natural, spiritual and political aims shall be God and Africa, at home and abroad.\"Garvey supported the Back-to-Africa movement, which had been influenced by Edward Wilmot Blyden, who migrated to Liberia in 1850. However, Garvey did not believe that all African-Americans should migrate to Africa. Instead, he thought that only an elite selection, namely those African-Americans of the purest African blood, should do so. The rest of the African-American population, he believed, should remain in the United States, where they would be extinct within fifty years. A proponent of the Back-to-Africa movement, Garvey called for a vanguard of educated and skilled African-Americans to travel to West Africa, a journey facilitated by his Black Star Line. Garvey stated that \"The majority of us may remain here, but we must send our scientists, our mechanics and our artisans and let them build railroads, let them build the great educational and other institutions necessary\", after which other members of the African diaspora could join them. He was aware that the majority of African-Americans would not want to move to Africa until it had the more modern comforts that they had become accustomed to in the U.S.\n\nIn the 1920s, Garvey referred to his desire for a \"big black republic\" in Africa. Garvey's envisioned Africa was to be a one-party state in which the president could have \"absolute authority\" to appoint \"all his lieutenants from cabinet ministers, governors of States and Territories, administrators and judges to minor offices\". According to the scholar of African-American studies Wilson S. Moses, the future African state which Garvey envisioned was \"authoritarian, elitist, collectivist, racist, and capitalistic\", suggesting that it would have resembled the later Haitian government of Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier. Garvey told the historian J. A. Rogers that he and his followers were \"the first fascists\", adding that \"Mussolini copied Fascism from me, but the Negro reactionaries sabotaged it\".In 1920, Garvey began discussions through his emissary Ellie Garcia with the president of Liberia, Charles D.B. King, to relocated the UNIA headquarters to that West African country. Further visits to Liberia took place in 1921 and 1923, but by 1924 the relationship between Garvey and King had soured, and the Liberian government confiscated their property, proscribed the UNIA, and deported the UNIA representatives.Garvey never visited Africa himself, and did not speak any African languages. He knew very little about the continent's varied customs, languages, and religions, or of its traditional social structures, with his critics often thinking that his views of the continent were romanticised and ignorant. It has been speculated that the Western colonial authorities would not have given permission to Garvey to visit colonies where he would be calling for decolonisation. The Jamaican writer and poet Claude McKay for instance noted that Garvey \"talks of Africa as if it were a little island in the Caribbean Sea.\" Garvey shared negative stereotypes about Africa as a backwards continent that was in need of the civilizing influence of Western, Christian states. Among his stated aims were \"to assist in civilising the backward tribes of Africa\" and \"to promote a conscientious Christian worship among\" them. His idea that Africans would ultimately be liberated by the efforts of the African diaspora living outside the continent has been considered condescending.Moses stated that rather than respecting indigenous African cultures, Garvey's views of an ideal united Africa were based on \"the imperial model of Victorian England\". When extolling the glories of Africa, Garvey cited the ancient Egyptians and Ethiopians who had built empires and monumental architecture, which he saw as evidence of civilization, rather than the smaller-scale societies of other parts of the continent. Moses thought that Garvey \"had more affinity for the pomp and tinsel of European imperialism than he did for black African tribal life\". The writer Richard Hart similarly noted that Garvey was \"much attracted by the glamour of the British nobility\", as reflected in the way he gave prominent supporters such British-derived titles as \"Lords\", \"Ladies\", and \"Knights\".\n\n\n=== Economic views ===\nEconomically, Garvey supported capitalism, stating that \"capitalism is necessary to the progress of the world, and those who unreasonably and wantonly oppose or fight against it are enemies to human advancement.\" He proposed that no individual should be allowed to control more than one million dollars and no company more than five million. Under Garvey, UNIA's focus was on achieving economic independence for the African diaspora. In Garvey's opinion, \"without commerce and industry, a people perish economically. The Negro is perishing because he has no economic system\".In the U.S., Garvey promoted a capitalistic ethos for the economic development of the African-American community. He wanted to achieve greater financial independence for the African-American community, believing that this would ensure greater protection from discrimination. In his view, European-American employers would always favor European-American employees, and thus to gain more security, African-Americans needed their own businesses. He admired Booker T. Washington's economic endeavours although was critical of his individualistic focus: Garvey believed African-American interests would best be advanced if businesses included collective decision making and group profit sharing. While in Harlem, he envisioned the formation of a global network of black people trading amongst themselves, believing that his Black Star Line would contribute to this aim. His emphasis on capitalist ventures meant, according to Grant, that Garvey \"was making a straight pitch to the petit-bourgeois capitalist instinct of the majority of black folk.\"There is no evidence that Garvey was ever sympathetic to socialism. While in the U.S., he strongly opposed attempts by socialist and communist groups to recruit African-Americans into the trade union movement, and urged African-Americans not to support the Communist Party. He viewed the communist movement as a white person's creation that was not in the interests of African-Americans. He stated that communism was \"a dangerous theory of economic or political reformation because it seeks to put government in the hands of an ignorant white mass who have not been able to destroy their natural prejudices towards Negroes and other non-white people. While it may be a good thing for them, it will be a bad thing for the Negroes who will fall under the government of the most ignorant, prejudiced class of the white race.\" In response, the Communist International characterised Garveyism as a reactionary bourgeoise philosophy.\n\n\n=== Black Christianity ===\n\nGrant noted that \"Garveyism would always remain a secular movement with a strong under-tow of religion\". Garvey envisioned a unified religion for black African people, one that was a variant of Christianity. Reflecting his own Catholicism, he wanted this black-centric Christianity to be as close to Roman Catholicism as possible. Garvey sought to create a black religion, with Cronon suggesting that Garvey promoted \"racist ideas about religion\".Garvey emphasised the idea of black people worshipping a God who was also depicted as black. He called for black people to worship images of Jesus of Nazareth and the Virgin Mary that depicted these figures as black Africans.\nIn doing so, he did not make use of pre-existing forms of black-dominant religion. Garvey had little experience with these, having attended a white-run Wesleyan congregation as a child and later converting to Roman Catholicism.\n\n\n== Personality and personal life ==\n\nPhysically, Garvey was short and stocky. He suffered from asthma, and was prone to lung infections; throughout his adult life he was affected by bouts of pneumonia. \nTony Martin called Garvey a \"restless young man\", while Grant thought that in his early years Garvey had a \"na\u00efve but determined personality\". Grant noted that Garvey \"possessed a single-mindedness of purpose that left no room for the kind of spectacular failure that was always a possibility\".He was eloquent and a good orator, with Cronon suggesting that his \"peculiar gift of oratory\" stemmed from \"a combination of bombast and stirring heroics\". Grant described Garvey's public speeches as \"strange and eclectic - part evangelical [\u2026] partly formal King's English, and part lilting Caribbean speechifying\".\nGarvey enjoyed arguing with people, and wanted to be seen as a learned man; he read widely, particularly in history. Cronon suggested that \"Garvey's florid style of writing and speaking, his fondness for appearing in a richly colored cap and gown, and his use of the initials \"D.C.L.\" after his name were but crude attempts to compensate\" for his lack of formal academic qualifications. Grant thought Garvey was an \"extraordinary salesman who'd developed a philosophy where punters weren't just buying into a business but were placing a down payment on future black redemption.\" Even his enemies acknowledged that he was a skilled organiser and promoter.For Grant, Garvey was \"a man of grand, purposeful gestures\". He thought that the black nationalist leader was an \"ascetic\" who had \"conservative tastes\". Garvey was a teetotaller who regarded alcohol consumption as morally reprehensible. He placed value on courtesy and respect, discouraging loutishness among his supporters.\nHe enjoyed dressing up in military costumes, and adored regal pomp and ceremony; he believed that pageantry would stir the black masses out of their apathy, despite the accusations of buffoonery made by the African-American intelligentsia.\nGrant noted that Garvey had a \"tendency to overstate his achievements\".\nIn 1947, the Jamaican historian J. A. Rogers included Garvey in his book, the World's Great Men of Colour, where he noted that \"had [Garvey] ever come to power, he would have been another Robespierre\", resorting to violence and terror to enforce his ideas.In 1919, he married Amy Ashwood in a Roman Catholic ceremony, although they separated after three months. The New York court would not grant Garvey a divorce, but he later obtained one in Jackson County, Missouri. Ashwood contested the legitimacy of this divorce and for the rest of her life maintained that she was Garvey's legitimate spouse.Garvey was a Roman Catholic.\nGarvey collected antique ceramics and enjoyed going around antique shops and flea markets searching for items to add to his collection.His second son, Dr. Julius Garvey, (born 1933) became a vascular surgeon based in Flushing, New York.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\nGarvey was a polarizing figure, an individual both revered and reviled. Grant noted that views on him divided largely between two camps, one portraying him as a charlatan and the other as a saint; similarly, Cronon noted that Garvey was varyingly perceived as \"strident demagogue or dedicated prophet, martyred visionary or fabulous con man\". Martin noted that by the time Garvey returned to Jamaica in the 1920s, he was \"just about the best known Black man in the whole world\". The size and scope of UNIA has also attracted attention; Mark Christian described Garvey as the leader of \"the largest Black mass movement in modern history,\" while John Henrik Clarke termed it \"the first Black mass protest crusade in the history of the United States\". His ideas influenced many black people who never became paying members of UNIA.\n\nIn Jamaica, Garvey is often regarded as a national hero. The scholar of African-American studies Molefi Kete Asante included Garvey on his 2002 list of 100 Greatest African Americans, while in 2008, the American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates described Garvey as the \"patron saint\" of the black nationalist movement. Grant thought that Garvey, along with Du Bois, deserved to be seen as the \"father of Pan-Africanism\", while the Nigerian historian B. Steiner Ifekwe called Garvey \"one of the greatest Pan-African leaders of the time\". Garvey has received praise from those who see him as a \"race patriot\", and many African-Americans see him as having encouraged a sense of self-respect and pride among black people. While living in the U.S., Garvey was often referred to\u2014sometimes sarcastically\u2014as the \"Negro Moses\", implying that like the eponymous Old Testament figure, he would lead his people out of the oppressive situation they lived in.In 1955, Cronon stated that while Garvey \"achieved little in the way of permanent improvement\" for black people, he \"awakened fires of Negro nationalism that have yet to be extinguished\". In Cronon's view, Garvey's importance was in giving African-descended peoples a new feeling of collective pride and a sense of individual worth. Hart believed that Garvey's importance lay in stirring millions of people who were otherwise apathetic into action. In this way, Hart thought, Garvey had helped lay the groundwork for the U.S. civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s, even if that movement's calls for racial integration and equality within the U.S. ran contrary to Garvey's own beliefs in racial separation and migration to Africa.Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana, wrote in his autobiography that of all the literature he had studied, the book that did more than any other to inspire him was the \"Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey, or Africa for the Africans\". Nkrumah  went on to name Ghana's national shipping line the \"Black Star Line\", while there's a Black Star Square in Accra, and a black star in the Ghanaian flag. The national football team is also nicknamed the Black Stars.While in the U.S., Garvey faced strong opposition from many prominent figures in the African-American community as well as from leading progressive and left-wing organisations. Critics regarded him as an idealist. Garvey obtained a reputation for failing to pay his debts, and his detractors accused him of dishonesty. Critics like Du Bois often mocked Garvey for his outfits and the grandiose titles he gave to himself; in their view, he was embarrassingly pretentious. According to Grant, much of the established African-American middle-class were \"perplexed and embarrassed\" by Garvey, who thought that the African-American working classes should turn to their leadership rather than his. Concerns were also raised that his violent language was inflaming many Garveyites to carry out violent acts against his critics. Grant noted that in the years following Garvey's death, his life was primarily presented by his political opponents.Writing for The Black Scholar in 1972, the scholar of African-American studies Wilson S. Moses expressed concern about the \"uncritical adulation\" of Garvey within African-American political circles. In Moses' opinion, this adulation led to \"red baiting\" and \"divisive rhetoric\" about being \"Blacker-than-thou\". Moses argued that it was wrong for people to regard Garvey as a \"man of the people\" because the latter came from a petty bourgeoise background and had \"enjoyed cultural, economic, and educational advantages few of his black contemporaries\" had enjoyed.\n\n\n=== Influence on political movements ===\n\nIn Jamaica, Garvey was largely forgotten in the years after his death, but interest in him was revived by the Rastafari religious movement. Jacques wrote a book about her late husband, Garvey and Garveyism, and after finding that no publishers were interested in it she self-published the volume in 1963. In 1975 the reggae artist Burning Spear released the album Marcus Garvey.Interest in Garvey's ideas would also be revived in the 1960s through the growth of independent states across Africa and the emergence of the Black Power movement in the United States. Mark Christian suggested that Garveyism gave an important psychological boost to African leaders campaigning for independence from European colonial rule, while Claudius Fergus proposed that it played an important role in encouraging Africans to see the African diaspora as an \"integral constituent of their own political destiny.\" In his autobiography, Kwame Nkrumah, the prominent Pan-Africanist activist who became Ghana's first president, acknowledged having been influenced by Garvey. The flag that Ghana adopted when it became independent adopted the colours of UNIA. In November 1964, Garvey's body was removed from West Kensal Green Cemetery and taken to Jamaica. There, it lay in state in Kingston's Roman Catholic Cathedral before a motorcade took it to King George VI Memorial Park, where it was re-buried.During a trip to Jamaica, Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife Coretta Scott King visited Garvey's shrine on 20 June 1965 and laid a wreath. In a speech he told the audience that Garvey \"was the first man of color to lead and develop a mass movement. He was the first man on a mass scale and level to give millions of Negroes a sense of dignity and destiny. And make the Negro feel he was somebody.\"\nVietnamese Communist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh said Garvey and Korean nationalists shaped his political outlook during his stay in America. Thandeka K. Chapman believed that Garveyism contributed to the formation of the multicultural education movement during the 1960s. Chapman believed that both \"Garveyism and multicultural education share the desire to see students of color learning and achieving academic success\", and both allotted significant attention to generating racial pride.\n\n\n=== Influence on religious movements ===\nGarvey never regarded himself as a religious visionary although was perceived as such by some of his followers. Various Bedwardites for example regarded him as the reincarnation of Moses. The Moorish Science Temple of America regarded Garvey as a prophet akin to John the Baptist in relation to their prophet Noble Drew Ali, who they regarded as a Jesus figure.  Garvey's ideas were a significant influence on the Nation of Islam, a religious group for African-Americans established in the U.S. in 1930.Garvey and Garveyism was a key influence on Rastafari, a new religious movement that appeared in 1930 Jamaica.\nAccording to the scholar of religion Maboula Soumahoro, Rastafari \"emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey\", while for the sociologist Ernest Cashmore, Garvey was the \"most important\" precursor of the Rastafari movement. Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, but nevertheless shares many of the same perspectives. Garvey knew of the Rastas from his time in Jamaica during the 1930s but his view of them, according to the scholar Barry Chevannes, \"bordered on scorn\". According to Chevannes, Garvey would have regarded the Rastas' belief in the divinity of Haile Selassie as blasphemy. Many Rastas regarding Garvey as a prophet, believing that he prophesied the crowning of Haile Selassie in a similar manner to how John the Baptist prophesied the coming of Jesus Christ. Many legends and tales are told about him within Jamaica's Rasta community. Many attribute him with supernatural attributes, for instance there is a tale told about him\u2014and also independently told about the pioneering Rasta Leonard Howell\u2014that Garvey miraculously knew that his bath had been poisoned and refused to get into it. Other stories among Jamaica's Rastas hold that Garvey never really died and remained alive, perhaps living in Africa. Some Rastas also organise meetings, known as Nyabinghi Issemblies, to mark Garvey's birthday.\n\n\n=== Memorials ===\n\nGarvey's birthplace, 32 Market Street, St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica, has a marker signifying it as a site of importance in the nation's history. His likeness was on the 20-dollar coin and 25-cent coin of the Jamaican dollar. In 2012 the Jamaican government declared August 17 as Marcus Garvey Day. The Governor General's proclamation stated \"from here on every year this time, all of us here in Jamaica will be called to mind to remember this outstanding National Hero and what he has done for us as a people, and our children will call this to mind also on this day\" and went on to say \"to proclaim and make known that the 17th Day of August in each year shall be designated as Marcus Garvey Day and shall so be observed.\"The Brownsville neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City, is home to Marcus Garvey Village, whose construction was completed in 1976. This building complex is home to the first energy storage microgrid at an affordable housing property in the country. It will use the energy storage system to cut electricity costs, improve grid reliability, and provide backup power during extended outages.In the 1980s, Garvey's two sons launched a campaign requesting that the U.S. government issue a pardon for their father. In this they had the support of Harlem Congressman Charles Rangel. In 2006, Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller tasked various Jamaican lawyers with investigating how they could assist this campaign. The Obama Administration declined to pardon Garvey in 2011, writing that its policy is not to consider requests for posthumous pardons.There have been several proposals to make a biopic of Garvey's life. Those mentioned in connection with the role of Garvey have included the Jamaican-born actor Kevin Navayne and the British-born actor of Jamaican descent Delroy Lindo.Marcus Garvey appears in Jason Overstreet's The Strivers' Row Spy, a historical fiction novel about of the Harlem Renaissance. The novel also includes W. E. B Du Bois, James Weldon Johnson, Adam Clayton Powell, among other historically significant figures.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGarveyism\nAfrican-American literature\nThe Black King (film)\nDouble-duty dollar\nMarcus Garvey: Look for me in the Whirlwind\nRight of return\nMarcus Garvey Prize for Human Rights\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n=== Works by Garvey ===\nThe Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey.

        "wiki": "Martello towers, sometimes known simply as Martellos, are small defensive forts that were built across the British Empire during the 19th century, from the time of the French Revolutionary Wars onwards. Most were coastal forts.\nThey stand up to 40 feet (12 m) high (with two floors) and typically had a garrison of one officer and 15\u201325 men. Their round structure and thick walls of solid masonry made them resistant to cannon fire, while their height made them an ideal platform for a single heavy artillery piece, mounted on the flat roof and able to traverse, and hence fire, over a complete 360\u00b0 circle. A few towers had moats or other batteries and works attached for extra defence.\nThe Martello towers were used during the first half of the 19th century, but became obsolete with the introduction of powerful rifled artillery. Many have survived to the present day, often preserved as historic monuments.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, during the premiership of Lord Palmerston, there was another spate of tower and fort building. The Palmerston Forts are also circular in design and resemble Martello towers.\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\nMartello towers were inspired by a round fortress, part of a larger Genoese defence system, at Mortella (Myrtle) Point in Corsica. The designer was Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino (el Fratin), and the tower was completed in 1565.\nSince the 15th century, the Corsicans had built similar towers at strategic points around the island to protect coastal villages and shipping from North African pirates. The towers stood one or two storeys high and measured 12\u201315 m (39\u201349 ft) in diameter, with a single doorway five metres off the ground that one could access only via a ladder that the occupants could remove.Local villagers paid for the towers and watchmen, known as torregiani, who would signal the approach of unexpected ships by lighting a beacon fire on the tower's roof. The fire would alert the local defence forces to the threat. Although the pirate threat subsequently dwindled, the Genovese built a newer generation of circular towers (the Genoese towers), that warded off later foreign raids.\n\nOn 7 February 1794 as part of the siege of Saint-Florent, two British warships, HMS Fortitude (74 guns) and Juno (32 guns), unsuccessfully attacked the tower at Mortella Point; the tower eventually fell to land-based forces under Sir John Moore after two days of heavy fighting. What helped the British was that the tower's two 18-pounder guns fired seaward, while only the one 6-pounder could fire land-ward.\nVice-Admiral Lord Hood reported:\n\n...The Fortitude and Juno were ordered against it, without making the least impression by a continued cannonade of two hours and a half; and the former ship being very much damaged by red-hot shot, both hauled off. The walls of the Tower were of a prodigious thickness, and the parapet, where there were two eighteen-pounders, was lined with bass junk, five feet from the walls, and filled up with sand; and although it was cannonaded from the Height for two days, within 150 yards, and appeared in a very shattered state, the enemy still held out; but a few hot shot setting fire to the bass, made them call for quarter. The number of men in the Tower were 33; only two were wounded, and those mortally.\nLate in the previous year, the tower's French defenders had abandoned it after HMS Lowestoffe (32 guns) had fired two broadsides at it. The British removed the guns to arm a small vessel; consequently, the French were easily able to dislodge the garrison of Corsican patriots that had replaced them.  Still, the British were impressed by the effectiveness of the tower when properly supplied and defended, and copied the design. But, they got the name wrong, misspelling \"Mortella\" as \"Martello\" (which means \"hammer\" in Italian). When the British withdrew from Corsica in 1803, with great difficulty they blew up the tower, leaving it in an unusable state.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\n\nThe towers were about 40 feet (12 m) high with walls about 8 feet (2.4 m) thick. In some towers the rooms were not built in the centre, but more to the landside, leaving the walls thicker on seaside. These were cases where an attack with a cannon from the landside was thought very unlikely. Entry was by ladder to a door about 10 feet (3.0 m) from the base above which was a machicolated (slotted) platform which allowed for downward fire on attackers. The flat roof or terreplein had a high parapet and a raised platform in the centre with a pivot (sometimes a converted cannon) for a cannon that would traverse a 360\u00b0 arc. (Some towers were designed to carry more than one gun, with each having a more limited arc of fire.) The walls had narrow slits for defensive musket fire.\n\nThe interior of a classic British Martello tower consisted of two storeys (sometimes with an additional basement). The ground floor served as the magazine and storerooms, where ammunition, water, stores and provisions were kept. The garrison of 24 men and one officer lived in a casemate on the first floor, which was divided into several rooms and had fireplaces built into the walls for cooking and heating. The officer and men lived in separate rooms of almost equal size. A well or cistern within the fort supplied the garrison with water. An internal drainage system linked to the roof enabled rainwater to refill the cistern.\n\n\n== Martello towers around the world ==\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the British government embarked on a large-scale programme of building Martello towers to guard the British and Irish coastlines. Around 140 were built, mostly along the south coast of England. Governments in Australia, Canada, Menorca, South Africa and Sri Lanka also constructed towers. The construction of Martello towers abroad continued until as late as the 1870s but was discontinued after it became clear that they could not withstand the new generation of rifled artillery weapons.\nThe French built similar towers along their own coastline that they used as platforms for communication by optical telegraphs (using the Chappe Telegraph). The United States government also built a number of Martello towers along the east coast of the US that copied the British design with some modifications.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ===\n\nGreat Britain and Ireland were united as a single political entity, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, from 1801 to 1922, spanning the time during which most Martello towers were erected (the initial scheme started under the previous entities of the Kingdom of Great Britain and Kingdom of Ireland). Consequently, the Martello towers of Great Britain and Ireland can be considered to have been part of a single defensive system, designed to protect the coastlines of the two main islands of the British Isles as a whole.This is most clearly visible on the south and east coasts of England and the east coast of Ireland, where chains of Martello towers were built. Elsewhere in the world, individual Martello towers were erected to provide point defence of strategic locations.\n\n\n==== England ====\n\nBetween 1804 and 1812 the British authorities built a chain of towers based on the original Mortella tower to defend the south and east coast of England, Ireland, Jersey and Guernsey to guard against possible invasion from France, then under the rule of the Emperor Napoleon. A total of 103 Martello towers were built in England, set at regular intervals along the coast from Seaford, Sussex, to Aldeburgh, Suffolk. Most were constructed under the direction of General William Twiss (1745\u20131827) and a Captain Ford.  The northern-most tower at Aldeburgh is of quatrefoil design, i.e. four in one.Included in the scheme were three much larger circular forts or redoubts that were constructed at Harwich, Dymchurch and Eastbourne; they acted as supply depots for the smaller towers as well as being powerful fortifications in their own right.The effectiveness of Britain's Martello towers was never actually tested in combat against a Napoleonic invasion fleet. They were, however, effective in hindering smuggling. After the threat had passed, the Martello towers in England met a variety of fates. The Coastguard took over many to aid in the fight against smuggling.\n\nFifteen towers were demolished to enable the re-use of their masonry. The sea washed thirty away and the military destroyed four in experiments to test the effectiveness of the new rifled artillery. During the Second World War, some Martello towers returned to military service as observation platforms and firing platforms for anti-aircraft artillery.\nForty-seven Martello towers have survived in England, a few of which have been restored and transformed into museums (e.g., the towers at St Osyth and Seaford) visitor centres, and galleries (such as Jaywick Martello Tower). Some are privately owned or are private residences, The remainder are derelict. A survey of the East Coast towers in 2007 found of the 17 remaining, most were in a reasonable condition.Many remaining Martello Towers are now Listed Buildings.A fuller list of British towers, with photographs, is available.\n\n\n==== Scotland ====\n\nThree Martello towers were built in Scotland, the first on offshore rocks facing the Firth of Forth in 1807\u201309 to defend Leith Harbour. The Tally Toor now lies land-locked within the eastern breakwater.Two towers were then built at Hackness and Crockness, near Longhope in Orkney. They were constructed between 1813 and 1815 to guard against the threat of French and American raiders attacking convoys assembling offshore. Historic Scotland now operates the Hackness tower as a museum.\n\n\n==== Wales ====\nA small number of Martello towers were also built in Wales, of which few survive. The most notable surviving towers are the two located in Pembroke Dock, which were built between 1848 and 1857 to protect the naval base there. Today, one of the towers is privately owned. The other is located on the town's riverfront, next to the old entrance of the naval base. It was converted into a small museum that focused on the local history of the dock and its defences. The museum has now shut down because of water influx. Recently Pembrokeshire County Council has decided to put the tower up for sale.\n\n\n==== Ireland ====\n\nAbout fifty Martello towers were built around the Irish coastline, especially along the east coast, from Millmount (Drogheda), to Bray, around Dublin Bay (29 installations) but also around Cork Harbour on the south coast. On the east coast, concentrated mainly around Dublin Bay, twenty-six towers were in line of sight of each other, providing the ability to communicate with one another, or warn of any incoming attacks.\nPossibly the most famous is the Martello tower in Sandycove, near D\u00fan Laoghaire, in which James Joyce lived for a few days. Joyce shared the tower with Oliver St. John Gogarty, then a medical student but later to become famous in Irish history as a surgeon, politician and writer. In Ulysses, the fictional character Stephen Dedalus lives in the tower with a medical student, Malachi \"Buck\" Mulligan, whom Joyce based on Gogarty. The James Joyce Tower, as the tower is now known, houses a museum dedicated to Joyce.\nA number of other Martello towers are extant nearby at Bullock Harbour, Dalkey Island, Williamstown, Seapoint and Sandymount and Martello towers feature in many literary works set in Dublin. During the 1980s, Bono owned the Martello tower in Bray, County Wicklow.\n\nMartello Tower South No.7, on Tara Hill, Killiney Bay, is unique, as is its location as an enfilading tower. The Tower is privately owned and has been fully restored, to include a proofed, working King George 3rd Blomefield 18-pounder cannon mounted on a traversing carriage on the crown of the Tower. There is a three-gun battery below the tower, with a glacis. There is also a coach house, artillery store, tool shed, and gunner's cottage, with resident gunner and gunpowder store. The battery, while restored, remains to be armed and the coach house and artillery store still require some restoration.On the north side of Dublin, one can find Martello towers in Balbriggan, Shenick Island and Red Island at Skerries, Drumanagh Fort, Rush, Tower Bay in Portrane, Donabate, Malahide (Hicks tower), Portmarnock, Ireland's Eye, Howth, and Sutton.\nThere were seven Martello towers in the vicinity of Cork Harbour of which five are extant. During the 19th century Fenian uprising, the famous Captain Mackey briefly captured and held the Monning Martello tower near Fota Island in Cork Harbour; this tower is believed to have been the only Martello tower ever captured, other than the original. The other Cork Harbour towers are at Ringaskiddy, Haulbowline Island (now part of the Irish Naval Service HQ) and at Belvelly and Rossleague on the Great Island (near Cobh). There are also Martello towers at Little Island and Rostellan, though these are no longer intact.\nThe British built two Martello towers on the Hook Peninsula to protect the fort near Duncannon, Co. Wexford and the entrance to Waterford Harbour. There is a third tower on the headland at Baginbun Bay in Co. Wexford.\nOne of the most interesting Martello towers is Meelick Martello Tower at Clonahenoge, County Offaly, guarding the Shannon river crossing to Meelick, County Galway. As this tower supports three guns (unlike the normal Martello tower which is circular on plan and carries only one gun), it is cam shaped on plan. Currently a rampant growth of ivy covers the tower.The tower at Seapoint, County Dublin, which was the  property of Blackrock Urban District Council was formerly the clubhouse of the Seapoint Boat Club from 1916 to 1931, and was subsequently the headquarters of the Genealogical Society of Ireland (GSI).  The GSI vacated the tower when it found that the atmosphere was not conducive to the preservation of records.\nThe restored tower at Ilnacullin is a feature of an island garden in Glengarriff, County Cork. Several other towers are still extant, including one at Rathmullan in County Donegal and two in County Clare on the south coast of Galway Bay in the townlands of Finavarra and Aughinish. There is also an extant Martello tower located near the settlement of Magilligan Point in County Londonderry, built between 1812 and 1871 to defend against a possible French invasion during the Napoleonic Wars; it is now a visitor attraction.A Martello-like tower was built on Achill Island, according to local memory during the Napoleonic Wars. It is square rather than round, unlike the traditional Martello tower. This tower is known locally as the Gabhla Fhranca (\"French Tower\") or the Napoleonic Tower. It is marked on an 1838 Ordnance Survey chart and denoted \"Signal Tower,\" suggesting it was used with a series of other stations for communication. The tower's position offers a view of the sea both to the north and south of the island and is therefore well-suited for that purpose. By the 1830s the tower was described as a \"watch-house of the coast-guard.\"\n\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n\n\n==== Antigua and Barbuda ====\n\nThe British originally constructed River Fort Martello Tower in the early 19th century, on the site of a previous fort (presumed to have been built by the Spanish) to guard nearby River Landing, which was Barbuda's original quay. Confusion with the previous fort presumably explains the claims made in Barbudan tourism publications that this was the World's first, and is its oldest, Martello tower, built in 1745.  The tower is located on the south coast of the island, a mile or so from River Landing and some seven miles south of the island's main village of Codrington. The tower is 56 feet high, has a raised gun platform and extremely thick walls, but is missing the floors. It the first such tower constructed in the Caribbean, was built in 1745 by Sir William Codrington, and was designed by Commodore Charles Knowles RN, later Admiral Sir Charles Knowles Bt, who was then commanding the Leeward Islands station.It is attached to what remains of the pre-existing fort. The tower mounted three cannon, and in all the fort mounted ten cannons, none of which remain. The tower is the highest building on Barbuda and serves as a daymark from land or sea. Today the fort is a popular location for weddings.\n\n\n==== Australia ====\n\nThe last Martello tower built in the British Empire is said to be that which composes a part of the larger Fort Denison, built on a small island, Pinchgut Island, in Sydney Harbour, New South Wales. It is the only Martello tower to have been built in Australia.\nFortification of the island began in 1841 but was not completed. The construction had begun following an 1839 night-time incursion into Sydney Harbour by two American warships. Concern with the threat of foreign attack had caused the government to review the harbour's inner defences, which were found to be inadequate, and the establishment of a fort was recommended to help protect Sydney Harbour from attack by foreign vessels. Construction resumed in 1855 to provide Sydney with protection against the threat of a naval attack by the Russians during the Crimean War of the 1850s. However, construction was completed only in 1857, well after the war had ended. Fort Denison is well preserved and is now a popular tourist attraction.\n\n\n==== Bermuda ====\n\nThere is a Martello tower located at Ferry Reach in St George's Parish. The tower is the third fortification on the site. Major Thomas Blanshard built it of Bermuda limestone between 1822\u20131823. The tower shows the effect of thirty years of evolution on the design of coastal fortifications, between the 1790s and 1822. The earlier Ferry Island Fort nearby had multiple guns arrayed to cover the water westward, while the Martello tower used a single gun with 360\u00b0 traverse to cover all of the surrounding area.\nLike its predecessors in the UK, it has an ovoid footprint with the thickness of its walls ranging from nine to 11 feet. It is surrounded by a dry moat. The tower's purpose was to defend the Ferry Reach Channel and so impede any attack on St. George's Island from the main island of Bermuda, and attacking vessels from slipping through Castle Harbour and the channel between Ferry Reach and Coney Island. The main channel by which vessels reach most parts of Bermuda west of St. George's, including the Royal Naval Dockyard, on Ireland, the Great Sound, Hamilton Harbour, The Flatts, Murray's Anchorage, and other important sites, carries them around the east ends of St. David's and St. George's Islands, where the coastal artillery was always most heavily concentrated. Two more Martello towers to protect the Dockyard were planned, but never built.\nThe tower was restored in 2008 and an 18-pounder cannon brought from Fort St. Catherine was mounted on top. The site is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday to Friday in the summer and in the winter by appointment only, by calling the Parks Department. It is part of the Bermuda Railway Trail.\n\n\n==== British Virgin Islands ====\n\nWhen the British rebuilt Fort Recovery on the west end of Tortola they added a Martello tower.\n\n\n==== Canada ====\nNine of the fourteen Martello towers built in Canada still survive. (In addition, the existing fortifications at Fort Henry received two thin towers between 1845 and 1848. However, these are dry ditch defence towers, rather than true Martello towers.) A common characteristic of Canadian Martello towers was removable cone-shaped roofs to protect against snow. Today, many of the restored towers have permanent roof additions \u2013 for ease of upkeep, not historical accuracy.\n\nQuebec City originally had four Martello towers. Tower No. 1 stands on the Plains of Abraham, overlooking the St Lawrence River. It has been restored as a museum and can be visited during the summer months. Tower no. 2 stands close nearby and currently hosts an 1812 Murder Mystery Dinner. Tower No. 3 was demolished in the 20th century after being used as a residence. The fourth surviving Martello Tower in Quebec, No. 4, is located in a residential area on the north side of the Upper City overlooking Lower Town.\nHalifax, Nova Scotia, had five towers, the oldest of which, the Prince of Wales Tower located in Point Pleasant Park, is the oldest Martello-style tower in North America. It was built in 1796 and was used as a redoubt and a powder magazine. Restored, it is now a National Heritage site. The Duke of York Martello Tower  was built in 1798 at York Redoubt. Its lower level still stands, though it has been boarded up for conservation purposes. The Duke of Clarence Martello Tower  stood on the Dartmouth shore. Sherbrooke Martello Tower  stood opposite York Redoubt on McNabs Island; it was demolished in 1944 and replaced by a concrete lighthouse at Maughers Beach. Another Martello tower stood on Georges Island.\nFour Martello towers were built at Kingston, Ontario to defend its harbour and naval shipyards in response to the Oregon Crisis. Their builders intended for the towers to serve as redoubts against marine attacks. Murney Tower and the tower at Point Frederick (at the Royal Military College of Canada) are now museums that are open during the summer.\n\nFort Frederick has the most elaborate defences as it includes earthen ramparts and a limestone curtain wall. The Shoal Tower, the only tower completely surrounded by water, stands in Kingston's Confederation Basin. Since 2005, it is open to the public as part of Doors Open Ontario for one day only in June each year. Cathcart Tower, the fourth tower, stands unused on Cedar Island near Point Henry.\nCarleton Martello Tower, overlooking the harbour of Saint John, New Brunswick, is now a museum and a National Historic Site.\nThe Canadian Press reported on April 16, 2006 that the Canadian military has named a Forward Operating Base (FOB) in Afghanistan FOB Martello. The logo of the International Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum in Kingston, Ontario, features a Martello tower. Since the amalgamation of the Township of Kingston in 2000, the city's flag has also borne a Martello tower.\n\n\n==== Guernsey ====\nThere are three similar Martello towers in Guernsey, all built in 1804: Fort Grey, Fort Hommet and Fort Saumarez.In addition, there are a number of earlier towers in Guernsey (the Guernsey loophole towers), that many people refer to as Martello towers, though they are not Martellos. They were built in the late 18th century, i.e., before the Martellos, and differ from them in a number of ways. One may think of them as precursors, like the Genoese towers they resemble.\nLastly, Br\u00e9hon Tower, built in 1856, is an oval tower that represents the final evolution of the Martello tower.\n\n\n==== India ====\n\nAlthough European in origin, a primitive form of Martello tower had existed in Punjab by the time it was conquered by the East India Company. There is a Martello Tower that the Portuguese built at the southern tip of the island where the Arnala fort stands. The Portuguese are said to have built many of these towers, but Arnala's is the best surviving specimen. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British erected Martello towers at the British Residency in Hyderabad, which were demolished in 1954. An earlier example of such is the one found in Pakur, a town in the state of Jharakhand. This tower was built in 1856 by Sir Martin with view to protect the British Raj from the Santhals. It was an important position for the British forces watching fighting the rebellion of the Santhals. This example is reported to still be in good condition, but decaying due to a lack of maintenance.\n\n\n==== Indonesia ====\nThe 1883 eruption of Krakatoa caused a tsunami that damaged Menara Martello, which the Dutch East India Company built in 1850 on Bidadari Island (Pulau Bidadari), one of the Thousand Islands (Kepulauan Seribu), as part of a set of fortifications that protected the approaches to Batavia. Photos suggest that Martello Menara was not a true Martello, but rather a circular fort. The tower was operational until 1878, when it became a storage site, and was abandoned in 1908. Bidadari Island was also known as Pulau Sakit (Sick Island) as it housed a leper colony during the 17th century. More recently, the island came to be called \"Angel Island\", to honour the leprosarium that had been there.\n\n\n==== Italy ====\n\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, during the British \"Protectorate\" of Sicily after the escape of the Bourbons from Naples, Sicily began to build towers to resist an invasion by Napoleon's armies led by Joachim Murat. The new higher rate of fire of ships' guns led to the choice of the Martello tower as the model.\nThe Sicilian Martello towers were built around 1810. The estimate rests on the historical context and on the descriptions of the topographer W.H. Smyth, who carried out his research in 1814 and 1815.\nOf the seven towers built in Sicily, only four remain. One is the Mazzone Tower (or the British Fort) at Faro Point, Messina. The second is the Magnisi tower at Priolo Gargallo, Syracuse. The Italian Navy used this tower as an observation post during the Second World War. Third is the Cariddi tower at Ganzirri in Messina. Lastly, the fourth tower is situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the sea from where it can defend the Castello Maniace in Syracuse.\n\n\n==== Jamaica ====\nThere is a Martello tower located at what was Fort Nugent. In 1709, the Spanish slave agent in Jamaica, James Castillo, built a fort in Harbour View, to guard his home against attack. An English Governor, George Nugent, later strengthened the fort to guard the eastern entrance of the city of Kingston Harbour. The tower was probably built between 1808 and 1811, at a reported cost of \u00a312,000.\n\n\n==== Jersey ====\n\nThe British built eight true Martello towers in Jersey, three between 1808 and 1814, and five between 1834 and 1837, one of which, L'Etacq, the German occupation forces destroyed during World War II. The three original towers are:\nIcho Tower (1811)\nPortelet Tower (1808)\nLa Tour de Vinde (AKA Noirmont; 1808\u20131814)The four surviving, later towers are:\nLewis Tower (AKA St Ouen 1; 1835)\nKempt Tower (AKA St Ouen 2; 1834)\nLa Collette Tower \u2013 Absorbed into the 19th-century artificers' barracks and workshops\nVictoria Tower (1837)In addition, there are a number of towers in Jersey (the Jersey Round Towers), that are frequently referred to as Martello towers, though they are not Martellos. They were built in the late 18th century, i.e., before the Martellos, and differ from them in a number of ways. One may think of them as precursors, like the Genoese towers they resemble.\n\n\n==== Malta ====\n\nThe British never built any true Martello Towers in Malta. However, Madliena Tower, which was one of thirteen De Redin towers built in Malta in 1658\u20131659, began to be used as if it was a Martello Tower and it is sometimes considered as such. Various modifications were made, including mounting a 64-pound rifled muzzle loading (RML) gun on the roof for coastal defence. From the late 19th century onwards it defended part of the Victoria Lines. The tower remained in use until World War II. It still stands today, despite having some minor modifications to its original structure, and it was recently restored.\n\n\n==== Mauritius ====\nThe British built five Martello Towers between 1832 and 1835 at Grand River North West (2), Black River (2), and Port Louis (1), of which three survive. \nOne tower, named Cunningham Tower after Lieutenant-Colonel Cunningham, the commanding Royal Engineer, was constructed as part of Fort George at the northern side of the entrance to Port Louis harbour. Two towers were built at Grand River North West; on the south-west side of the river bay the tower was built at Pointe aux Sables whilst Fort Victoria was built covering the north-eastern flank. The remaining two were built to support existing batteries, which were also improved, at the mouth of the Black River; one to the north at La Preneuse and the other south of Grande-Rivi\u00e8re-Noire at Batterie de l'Harmonie. Cunningham Tower disappeared after 1914. The Tower at Fort Victoria was last mentioned in 1880. In 1865, the Mauritius Almanac and Civil Service Register listed \"Two Artillery Men, at 1s each per diem\", for the towers at Fort George and Grand River.  The Friends of the Environment have restored one Martello tower near the La Preneuse public beach, in the Rive Noire/Black River district. The Friends operate it as a museum for visitors. The original entrance to the tower is raised above ground but a new entrance has been constructed at ground level. The other tower in Rive Noire/Black River district [L\u2019Harmonie] still exists but has remained neglected for many years. The other existing tower is at Pointe aux Sables, Grand River North West.\n\n\n==== Sierra Leone ====\nA Martello tower was built on Tower Hill at Freetown, Sierra Leone in 1805 to defend the port from attacks by the Temne people. It was significantly modified in 1870 when it was truncated to allow the installation of a water tank to supply Government House (Fort Thornton) with water. The tower has now been incorporated into Sierra Leone's Parliament Buildings.\n\n\n==== South Africa ====\n\nThe British built three Martello towers in South Africa, one at Simon's Town Naval base near Cape Town, one at Cape Town, and the third at Fort Beaufort. The tower at Simon\u2019s Town and Cape Town were both built in 1795. The tower at Cape Town was demolished over 100 years ago, but the tower at Simon's Town now is sometimes claimed as the oldest Martello in the world. It is arguable as to whether one should properly call it a Martello Tower.That said, Vice Admiral George Elphinstone, who commanded the force that captured the colony and then served briefly as its governor, had served with the Mediterranean fleet off Corsica in 1794. The British built the tower at Fort Beaufort in 1837, and it is probably the only example of an inland Martello tower.\n\n\n==== Spain ====\nDuring the last period of British occupation (1798\u20131802) of Menorca, Sir Charles Stuart, the then British governor, ordered Engineer Captain Robert D\u00b4Arcy to build some 12 Martello towers along the coast. These, when added to the three Spanish towers already in place, gave Menorca 15 towers.The British built five towers to protect Mah\u00f3n: Phillipet on Lazareto Island, Cala Taulera (St. Clair) and Los Freus (Erskine) on the peninsula of La Mola, Stuart's Tower, and a tower on the Punta de Sant Carlos, which the Spanish destroyed when they took regained possession of Menorca. To the northwest of Mah\u00f3n the British built two more towers, Sa Torreta and Sa Mezquita.\nOne tower, the Princess Tower, or the Erskine Tower, was incorporated into the Fortress of Isabel II, built between 1850 and 1875. The tower was converted to a powder magazine, which led to its destruction in 1958, when lightning struck the tower. The explosion destroyed the tower, blowing out large sections of its walls.\n\nThe British erected Stuart's Tower in 1798 on Turks Hill or Hangman's Hill to the south of the port of Mah\u00f3n at San Esteban or Saint Stephen's bay on the southern side of the Fortress of San Felipe. In 1756 and again in 1781, batteries on the hill had supported successful attacks on the Fortress. The tower was built both to secure the hill and protect the entrance to the bay. The tower's name was later changed to Torre d\u00b4en Penjat, or Hangman's Tower.\nTo protect the harbor of Fornells, the British built a tower on the rocky headland overlooking the harbor's mouth, and a small tower on the island of Sargantana. They complemented these two towers with two more small towers nearby, one at Sa Nitsa and one at Addaya.\nLastly, the British built one tower at Santandria to protect the old capital of Ciutadella.\nIn addition to the 12 towers that they built, the British made use of three towers that the Spanish had built earlier.  In 1781, Captain Francisco Fernandez de Angulo had built towers south of Port Mahon at Punta Prima and Alcufar, based on the design of those that the Spanish had built in Gando, Gran Canaria, in 1740. At Ciutadella the British used the St. Nicholas's Tower, built in 1690. The Treaty of Amiens returned Menorca to Spain in 1802. Around 1804, the Spanish built a tower at Punta Na Radona to protect the beach at Son Bou, Menorca. In 1808, Captain Lord Cochrane, commanding the 38-gun fifth-rate frigate HMS Imperieuse, sent ashore a landing party that destroyed the unarmed tower. (Frederick Marryat, later a naval captain and author, was serving as a midshipman aboard Imperieuse at the time.)\n(This fort has 17 walls)\nThere are also four towers on the island of Formentera, and one on the nearby island of S'Empalmador (38\u00b047\u20325.28\u2033N 1\u00b025\u20325.01\u2033E).\n\nAnother tower was erected by English troops stationed in the fortress of Cartagena, during the Peninsular War. The tower was erected in the center of 1799 fort, in mount St. Julian, dominating port and mouth. In the summer of 1812 English engineers destroyed the fort and erected a tower.\n... the British are working on opening a path from the east coast to the post on Mount St. Julian, where they try to build a six-piece battery held in a tower 24 feet in diameter. \u2014Report of the Subtenant Navarro, March 10, 1813.\nIs reduced to a well-built coast tower, but only mounts and is capable of a rotating gun... The tower contains two floors and the platform. The ground floor is for the warehouse and spare part. The main one for accommodation, and in this one is the door for ladder of hand, and two spans that, besides serving for ventilation, are arranged to receive small caliber guns... The platform mounts a rotating gun and has a small bench for the fire of rifle. Under the lower floor there is a cistern. \u2014Plano de la plaza de Cartagena, Tebar, Echevarria, Pajares, 1855\nThe later constructions that gave rise to the present fortress of San Juli\u00e1n, totally respected English tower, that still is conserved in good condition  used like base of aerials of telephony and visitable to the outside. Interior, only accessible to technician, is supposed to be well preserved.\n\n\n==== Saint Helena ====\nThere is a Martello tower at Saint Helena that was incorporated into High Knoll Fort. The tower was very similar in design to the tower at Simon's Town, with a diameter of about 45 ft (14 m) and a height of approximately 20 ft (6.1 m).\n\n\n==== Sri Lanka ====\nSri Lanka has one Martello tower, located at Hambantota on the south coast, which was restored in 1999. This tower may have been involved in repelling a French attack though there is nothing more than circumstantial support for the notion. British engineers commenced work on three towers to protect Trincomalee but never completed them.\n\n\n==== United States ====\n\nThe United States government built several Martello towers at locations along the eastern seaboard. Two are at Key West, Florida; others were built at the harbours of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Charleston, South Carolina and New York City. Two more Martello towers stood at Tybee Island, Georgia and Bayou Dupre, Louisiana.\n\nAlthough the Americans copied the design from the towers the British erected in Canada, the American Martello towers differed in some significant respects from the British. The Martello tower built at Tybee Island, Georgia was constructed around 1815 utilizing wood and tabby, a common local building material at the time, instead of the brick or stone that the British towers used. Also unlike the British towers, the Tybee tower featured gun loops on the garrison floor that enabled muskets to be fired through the walls. It was never tested in battle and by the time of the American Civil War was in a state of disrepair. Its unfamiliar design confused local writers, who often said that the Spanish had built the tower when Georgia was Spain's colony.The Key West towers, though the locals refer to them as Martellos, were square instead of round and had thin walls with long gun loops. In addition, a curtain wall of heavy guns encircled the Key West towers making them, effectively, keeps instead of standalone towers.\nA Martello tower figures in the arms of the 41st Infantry Regiment of the United States Army.\n\n\n=== List of Martello towers outside Great Britain ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nBlockhouse\nEastbourne Redoubt\nPalmerston Forts\nFortified tower\nScottish BrochLists:\n\nList of castles\nList of fortifications\nList of forts\n\n\n== Notes, citations, and references ==\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\nAbram, David (2003) The Rough Guide to Corsica Rough Guides.\nBolton, J., Carey, T., Goodbody, R. & Clabby, G.

          "Way too many seeweed in the water and it's right close to the shore line where kids and who doesn't want to go out far are. Everything else was ok. There was music playing- neither loud nor vulgar. Bathroom and shower facilities available. A minimum entrance fee, clean environment, and you can take your food.",
          "Great beach... the grounds men are abusive to the stray animals though",
          "Great beach, I'm sure after the upgrade it will be much more welcoming.",
          "It very is to locate with little or no traffic the fees charged for entrance is very reasonable with adequate parking space. The food is great and is prepared in a reasonable amount of time and reasonable priced. The beach has clear white \u2026",
          "This beach is mostly for hanging out. Cost to get in is 250 for adults and 100 for children. Most of the time the beach is line with sea weed and the water is rough and dirty",
          "Great place to chill out any day. Lots of shade. Bathroom facilities and food places available. Very affordable to enter.",
          "Need something more to it",
          "As far as public beaches in Kingston go, this is probably the best, safest, and most well maintained... but the seaweed on the sand and in the water is horrendous. There's also usually a high wind, so you can get sand slapped if you're not \u2026",
          "It's amazing very cool and the water is just the right temperature although u should really fix the restrooms for changing and make it more bright",
          "Great potential, needs better upkeep.",
          "Getting better... sea weed restriction",
          "It was a nice place to chill out. I Like that it had plenty of trees to sit under and have a picnic. My only faults were the seaweed, there was waay too many, and the swings on the property had very rusty chains. Other than that it was very nice.",
          "It's chilled and relaxing, love their festivals and fried fish... If you don't mind a bit of seaweed then enjoy the water.",
          "Hanged there with some friends pretty clean. Has showers and a hut to order fish and festival. There is also restrooms. You can carry your own food in. Down side they won't allow any inflatable objects in the water. The cost to enter is $250. There are jelly fish when it's not crowded by people.  Drop a like if this review helped."

        "wiki": "Peter M. Tosh, OM (born Winston Hubert McIntosh; 19 October\u200a 1944 \u2013 11 September 1987) was a Jamaican reggae musician. Along with Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer, he was one of the core members of the band the Wailers (1963\u20131976), after which he established himself as a successful solo artist and a promoter of Rastafari. He was murdered in 1987 during a home invasion.\n\n\n== Early music and with the Wailers ==\nTosh was born in Westmoreland, the westernmost parish of Jamaica. He was abandoned by his parents and \"shuffled among relatives.\" When McIntosh was fifteen, his aunt died and he moved to Trenchtown in Kingston, Jamaica. He first learned guitar after watching a man in the country play a song that captivated him. He watched the man play the same song for half a day, memorizing everything his fingers were doing. He then picked up the guitar and played the song back to the man. The man then asked McIntosh who had taught him to play; McIntosh told him that he had. During the early 1960s, as an aspiring musician, Tosh went to vocal teacher Joe Higgs, who gave free music lessons to young people. Through his contact with Higgs, Tosh met Robert Nesta Marley (Bob Marley) and Neville O'Reilly Livingston (Bunny Wailer). He then changed his name to Peter Tosh and the trio started singing together in 1962. Higgs taught the trio to harmonize and while developing their music, they would often play on the street corners of Trenchtown.In 1964 Tosh helped organize the band the Wailing Wailers, with Junior Braithwaite, a falsetto singer, and backup singers Beverley Kelso and Cherry Smith. Initially, Tosh was the only one in the group who could play musical instruments. According to Bunny Wailer, Tosh was critical to the band because he was a self-taught guitarist and keyboardist, and thus became an inspiration for the other band members to learn to play. The Wailing Wailers had a major ska hit with their first single, \"Simmer Down\", and recorded several more successful singles before Braithwaite, Kelso and Smith left the band in late 1965. Marley spent much of 1966 in Delaware in the United States with his mother, Cedella (Malcolm) Marley-Booker, and for a brief time was working at a nearby Chrysler factory. He then returned to Jamaica in early 1967 with a renewed interest in music and a new spirituality. Tosh and Bunny were already Rastafarians when Marley returned from the US, and the three became very involved with the Rastafari faith. Soon afterwards, they renamed the musical group the Wailers. Tosh would explain later that they chose the name Wailers because to \"wail\" means to mourn or to, as he put it, \"...express one's feelings vocally\". He also claims that he was the beginning of the group, and that it was he who first taught Bob Marley the guitar. The latter claim may very well be true, for according to Bunny Wailer, the early Wailers learned to play instruments from Tosh.During the mid 1960s Peter Tosh along with Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer where introduced to Danny Sims and Johnny Nash who signed the three artists to an exclusive recording contract on Sims and Nash's JAD Records label alongside an exclusive publishing agreement via Sims' music publishing company Cayman Music. Rejecting the up-tempo dance of ska, the band slowed their music to a rocksteady pace, and infused their lyrics with political and social messages inspired by their new-found faith. The Wailers composed several songs for the American-born singer Johnny Nash before teaming with producer Lee Perry to record some of the earliest well-known reggae songs, including \"Soul Rebel\", \"Duppy Conqueror\", and \"Small Axe\". The collaboration had given birth to reggae music and later, bassist Aston \"Family Man\" Barrett and his brother, drummer Carlton Barrett would join the group in 1970. They recorded The Best of the Wailers album, which was produced by Leslie Kong and released in 1971.\nIn 1972, Danny Sims assigned the balance of the JAD Records recording contract with The band to Chris Blackwell and Island Records company  and released their debut, Catch a Fire, in 1973, following it with Burnin' and Natty Dread the same year. The Wailers had moved from many producers after 1970 and there were instances where producers would record rehearsal sessions that Tosh did and release them in England under the name \"Peter Touch\".\nIn 1973, Tosh was driving home with his girlfriend Evonne when his car was hit by another car driving on the wrong side of the road. The accident killed Evonne and severely fractured Tosh's skull. After Island Records president Chris Blackwell refused to issue his solo album in 1974, Tosh and Bunny Wailer left the Wailers, citing the unfair treatment they received from Blackwell, to whom Tosh often referred with a derogatory play on Blackwell's surname, 'Whiteworst'. Tosh had written many of the Wailers' hit songs such as \"Get Up, Stand Up\", \"400 Years\", and \"No Sympathy\". Tosh began recording and released his solo debut, Legalize It, in 1976 with CBS Records company, and Island Records. The title track soon became popular among endorsers of cannabis legalization, reggae music lovers and Rastafari all over the world, and was a favourite at Tosh's concerts. That was his last album from the Wailers, Island Records. In 2013, a book co-written by French scholar Dr Jeremie Kroubo Dagnini and American Lee Jaffe, his former associate, says Tosh was part of a smuggling operation that raised money to fund this groundbreaking album.\n\n\n== Solo career ==\nTosh started to make his own albums with Rolling Stones Records and CBS Records Equal Rights followed in 1977, featuring his recording of a song co-written with Marley, \"Get Up, Stand Up,\" and a cover of \"Stepping Razor\" that would also appear on the soundtrack to the film Rockers.\nTosh organized a backing band, Word, Sound and Power, who were to accompany him on tour for the next few years, and many of whom performed on his albums of this period. In 1978 the Rolling Stones record label Rolling Stones Records contracted with Tosh, on which the album Bush Doctor was released, introducing Tosh to a larger audience. The album featured Rolling Stones frontmen Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, and the lead single \u2013 a cover version of The Temptations song \"Don't Look Back\" \u2013 was performed as a duet with Jagger. It made Tosh one of the best-known reggae artists.\n\nDuring Bob Marley's free One Love Peace Concert of 1978, Tosh lit a marijuana spliff and lectured about legalizing cannabis, lambasting attending dignitaries Michael Manley and Edward Seaga for their failure to enact such legislation. Several months later he was apprehended by police as he left Skateland dance hall in Kingston and was beaten severely while in police custody.\nMystic Man (1979), and Wanted Dread and Alive (1981) followed, both released on Rolling Stones Records. Tosh tried to gain some mainstream success while keeping his militant views, but was only moderately successful, especially when compared to Marley's achievements. That same year, Tosh appeared in the Rolling Stones' video Waiting on a Friend.\nIn 1984, after the release of 1983's album Mama Africa, Tosh went into self-imposed exile, seeking the spiritual advice of traditional medicine men in Africa, and trying to free himself from recording agreements that distributed his records in South Africa. Tosh had been at odds for several years with his label, EMI, over a perceived lack of promotion for his music.Tosh also participated in the international opposition to South African apartheid by appearing at Anti-Apartheid concerts and by conveying his opinion in various songs like \"Apartheid\" (1977, re-recorded 1987), \"Equal Rights\" (1977), \"Fight On\" (1979), and \"Not Gonna Give It Up\" (1983). In 1987, Peter Tosh seemed to be having a career revival. He was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Performance in 1987 for No Nuclear War, his last record.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn 11 September 1987, just after Tosh had returned to his home in Jamaica, a three-man gang came to his house on motorcycles demanding money. Tosh replied that he did not have any with him but the gang did not believe him. They stayed at his residence for several hours and tortured Tosh in an attempt to extort money from him. Over the hours, as various associates of Tosh arrived to visit him, they were also taken hostage by the gunmen. The gunmen became more and more frustrated, especially the chief thug, Dennis \"Leppo\" Lobban, a man whom Tosh had previously befriended and tried to help find work after a long jail sentence. Tosh said he did not have any money in the house, after which Lobban and the fellow gunmen began opening fire in a reckless manner. Tosh was shot twice in the head and killed. Herbalist Wilton \"Doc\" Brown and disc jockey Jeff 'Free I' Dixon also died as a result of wounds sustained during the robbery. Several others in the house were wounded, including Tosh's common law wife Andrea Marlene Brown, Free I's wife Yvonne (\"Joy\"); Tosh's drummer Carlton \"Santa\" Davis, and musician Michael Robinson.According to Police Commissioner Herman Ricketts, Dennis \"Leppo\" Lobban surrendered and two other men were interrogated but not publicly named. Lobban went on to plead innocent during his trial, telling the court he had been drinking with friends. The trial was held in a closed court due to the involvement of illegal firearms. Lobban was ultimately found guilty by a jury of eight women and four men and sentenced to death by hanging. His sentence was commuted in 1995 and Lobban remains in jail. Another suspect was acquitted due to insufficient evidence. The other two gunmen were never identified by name.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 1993 Stepping Razor - Red X was released, a documentary film chronicling Peter Tosh's life, music and untimely death. It was directed by Canadian filmmaker Nicholas Campbell, produced by Wayne Jobson and based upon a series of spoken-word recordings made by Tosh himself. The film was released on DVD in 2002.A monument to Peter Tosh is maintained by his family near Negril, Jamaica and is open to the public. His birthday is celebrated there annually with live reggae music.In October 2012 Tosh was posthumously awarded Jamaica's fourth highest honour, the Order of Merit.A square on Trafalgar Road in Kingston was renamed Peter Tosh Square. The square is home to the Peter Tosh Museum, which opened in October 2016. Among the artifacts on display will be Tosh's M16 guitar.\nIn 2015, Tosh's daughter \u2013 the administrator of the Peter Tosh Estate \u2013 deemed that April 20 should be celebrated as International Peter Tosh Day, in honour of his \"philosophy of responsible cannabis consumption for medicinal and spiritual health benefits\".The annual Peter Tosh Gala Awards event was inaugurated in 2017.\n\n\n=== M16 guitar ===\nIn 1983, at the Los Angeles stop on Tosh's Mama Africa tour, a local musician named Bruno Coon went to the hotel at which Tosh was staying, claiming to have a gift for him. The gift was a custom-built guitar in the shape of an M16 rifle. Tosh accepted the gift personally. The guitar was subsequently lost by the airlines when the tour went to Europe but was recovered when Tosh's public relations agent placed an article about its loss in Der Spiegel. Tosh went on to perform on stage with the guitar.In 2006, it was announced by the promoters of the Flashpoint Film Festival that the guitar would be auctioned on eBay by Tosh's common-law wife Andrea \"Marlene\" Brown. Tosh's sons, Andrew Tosh, and Jawara McIntosh, prevented the sale, claiming ownership of the guitar. In 2011, Andrew Tosh, said that the guitar was in the custody of a close friend, awaiting the opening of a museum dedicated to Peter Tosh.The Peter Tosh Museum was opened on Peter Tosh's 72nd Birthday on 19 October 2016 in Kingston, Jamaica.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nAlong with Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer during the late 1960s, Peter Tosh became a devotee of Rastafari.  One of the beliefs of the Rastas is that Haile Selassie, the Emperor of Ethiopia, was either an embodiment of God or a messenger of God, leading the three friends to be baptized by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.\n\n\n=== Unicycling ===\nAt some point after his departure from the Wailers, Tosh developed an interest in unicycles; he became a unicycle rider, being able to ride forwards and backwards and hop. He often amused his audiences by riding onto the stage on his unicycle for his shows.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nCaptured Live (1984)\nLive at the One Love Peace Concert (JAD) (2000) \nLive & Dangerous: Boston 1976 (2001)\nLive at the Jamaica World Music Festival 1982 (JAD) (2002) \nComplete Captured Live (2002)\nLive at My Father's Place 1978 (2014)\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\nListed are compilations containing material previously unreleased outside of Jamaica.\n\nThe Toughest (Heartbeat) (1996)\nHonorary Citizen (1997)\nScrolls of the Prophet: The Best of Peter Tosh (1999)\nArise Black Man  (1999)\nBlack Dignity (Early Works of the Stepping Razor) (2001)\nI Am That I Am (JAD) (2001) \nThe Best of Peter Tosh 1977\u20131987 (2003)\nCan't Blame the Youth (JAD) (2004) \nBlack Dignity (2004)\nTalking Revolution (2005)\nThe Ultimate Peter Tosh Experience (2009)\n\n\n=== Appears on ===\nNegril (Eric Gale, 1975)\nRastafari Dub (Ras Michael & The Sons of Negus, 1975)\nBlackheart Man (Bunny Wailer, 1976)\nWord Sound and Power (Chris Hinze, 1980)\n\n\n== See also ==\nBob Marley and the Wailers\nList of Rastafari\nList of reggae musicians\nList of vegetarians\nReggae\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPeter Tosh on AllMusic\nDiscography\nPeter Tosh \u2013 Jamaicapage.com Feature\nThe Wailers News\nPeter Tosh [Discography, Biography & Lyrics @ www.MusicGonnaTeach.com]",

          "We visited the Peter Tosh museum after we visited the Bob Marley museum. That was not a good idea. Small place with only a few things to see. No guided tours (the place is too small anyway). Not worth the entrance fee",
          "We visited this Museum as an alternative to the Bob Marley Museum, which was closed for renovations while we were in Kingston. I'm sorry to say it wasn't worth it. We payed J$ 2500 per person and the exhibition basically consisted of excerpts from Tosh's Wikipedia article stuck",
          "I got there late missed my appointment with the tour person/curator. However i was allowed in to view the exhibits, which consisted of some heavy reading by me and my party... I was also offered some non-expert guidance by 'none' curator person that gave us access... overall",
          "The Peter Tosh Museum is relatively new. I haven\u2019t visited the actual museum but attended a musical concert celebrating Tosh\u2019s birthday. This man has influenced many artists world wide. he is finally receiving the recognition he diserves.",
          "Learn about the legend, Peter Tosh. View memorabilia and significant pieces from his career. Museum is small, but powerful. Take the trip!",
          "This was one of the three stops on a Wailers tour. There was some interesting things to look at and you could listen to some of his music but it it didn't feel as intimate as our other stops. Certainly spoke to Peter Tosh as an artist and person. If you are a fan I would",
          "Personally I think that Peter Tosh was a genius and one of the top reggae artists of all time. Bob\u2019s museum has had money thrown at it and this one hasn\u2019t so you probably need to be a fan. In reality, it is a reasonably big room with some iconic items displayed within. The usual",
          "Great place to go if you are a fan of Peter Tosh. Famous Ak-47 guitar, unicycle and mostly self guided tour are present, and a guide is there if you have any questions. Where the Bob Marley museum was all about Bob, the Peter Tosh museum focuses on the roots of the early wailers",
          "The Peter Tosh museum is a one of a kind experience. It is self guided for the most part, but there is a guide there if you have questions. There is so much information and history about Peter Tosh with amazing artifacts such as his custom made M16 gun and his well known"

        "wiki": "Kingston is the capital and largest city of Jamaica, located on the southeastern coast of the island. It faces a natural harbour protected by the Palisadoes, a long sand spit which connects the town of Port Royal and the Norman Manley International Airport to the rest of the island. In the Americas, Kingston is the largest predominantly English-speaking city south of the United States.\nThe local government bodies of the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew were amalgamated by the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation Act of 1923, to form the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC). Greater Kingston, or the \"Corporate Area\" refers to those areas under the KSAC; however, it does not solely refer to Kingston Parish, which only consists of the old downtown and Port Royal. Kingston Parish had a population of 96,052, and St. Andrew Parish had a population of 555,828 in 2001. Kingston is only bordered by Saint Andrew to the east, west and north. The geographical border for the parish of Kingston encompasses the following communities: Tivoli Gardens, Denham Town, Rae Town, Kingston Gardens, National Heroes Park, Bournemouth Gardens, Norman Gardens, Rennock Lodge, Springfield and Port Royal, along with portions of Rollington Town, Franklyn Town and Allman Town.The city proper is bounded by Six Miles to the west, Stony Hill to the north, Papine to the northeast and Harbour View to the east, which are communities in urban and suburban Saint Andrew. Communities in rural St. Andrew such as Gordon Town, Mavis Bank, Lawrence Tavern, Mt. Airy and Bull Bay would not be described as being in Kingston city.\nTwo districts make up the central area of Kingston: the historic Downtown, and New Kingston. Both are served by Norman Manley International Airport and also by the smaller and primarily domestic Tinson Pen Aerodrome.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKingston was founded in July 1693 after the earthquake that devastated Port Royal in 1692, the original section of the city which was situated at the bottom of the Liguanea Plains was laid out to house survivors of the earthquake. Before the earthquake, Kingston's functions were purely agricultural. The earthquake survivors set up a camp on the sea front. Approximately two thousand people died due to mosquito-borne diseases. Initially the people lived in a tented camp on Colonel Barry's Hog Crawle. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by fire in 1703. Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. The new grid system of the town was designed to facilitate commerce, particularly the system of main thoroughfares 66 feet (20 m) across, which allowed transportation between the port and plantations farther inland. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the centre of trade for Jamaica.\nThe government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in Port Royal, and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of Liguanea.\nThe first free school, Wolmers's, was founded in 1729 and there was a theatre, first on Harbour Street and then moved in 1774 to North Parade. Both are still in existence. In 1755 the governor, Sir Charles Knowles, had decided to transfer the government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston.\nBy the end of the 18th century, the city contained more than 3,000 brick buildings. The harbour fostered trade, and played part in several naval wars of the 18th century. Kingston took over the functions of Spanish Town (the capital at the time). These functions included agriculture, commercial, processing and a main transport hub to and from Kingston and other sections of the island. In 1788, Kingston had a population of 25,000, which was about a tenth of the overall population of the island. One in every four people living in Kingston was white, and there was a large population of free people of color there too, meaning that two out of every five people living in Kingston were free. The remaining three-fifths of Kingston's population was made up of black slaves.The government passed an act to transfer the government offices to Kingston from Spanish Town, which occurred in 1872. It kept this status when the island was granted independence in 1962.\n\nIn 1907, 800 people died in another earthquake known as the 1907 Kingston earthquake, destroying nearly all the historical buildings south of Parade in the city. That was when a restriction of no more than 60 feet (18 m) was instituted on buildings in the city centre. These three-story-high buildings were built with reinforced concrete. Construction on King Street in the city was the first area to breach this building code.\nDuring the 1930s, island-wide riots led to the development of trade unions and political parties to represent workers.\nThe city became home to the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies founded in 1948, with 24 medical students.\nNot until the 1960s did major change occur in the development of Kingston's city centre. The international attention of reggae music at that time coincided with the expansion and development of 95 acres (38 ha) of the Kingston city centre waterfront area. These developments led to an influx of shops and offices, and the development of a new financial centre: New Kingston, which replaced the Knutsford Racetrack. Multi-story buildings and boulevards were placed within that section.\nIn 1966 Kingston was the host city to the Commonwealth Games.\nThe western section of the city was not the focus of development, and that area proved to be politically tense. The 1970s saw deteriorating economic conditions that led to recurrent violence and a decline in tourism which later affected the island.\n\nIn the 1980 general elections, the democratic socialist People's National Party (PNP) government was voted out, and subsequent governments have been more market-oriented. Within a global urban era, the 1990s saw that Kingston has made efforts to modernise and develop its city structure and functions. Various organisations such as the Kingston Restoration Company, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), the Port Authority of Jamaica and the Port Royal Development Company, among others sought to develop the urban structure of the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe majority of the population of Kingston is of African descent. Large minority ethnic groups include East Indians and Chinese, who came to the country as indentured servants in the late 19th century. The Chinese occupy important roles in Jamaica's economy especially in the retail markets in Downtown Kingston and the wider metropolitan area. There is also a minority of Europeans, mostly descending from immigrants from Germany and Great Britain. Syrians and Lebanese form one of the most influential ethnic groups in not only Kingston, but the entire island. Though a minority ethnic group, the Lebanese were able to give Jamaica one of its prime ministers, Edward Philip George Seaga. There is a strong undercurrent of bias based on skin color as darker skinned Jamaicans are usually at the very bottom of the socio-economic ladder; a phenomenon evidenced by the disproportionate representation of foreigners and mixed-race individuals in lucrative private sector and government positions. Multi-racial Jamaicans continue to form the second largest racial group, and there is also a small Jewish population in the city.\n79.2% Black\n12.8% Multiracial\n5.2% Asian\n3.4% White\n\n\n== Religion ==\nThere is a wide variety of Christian churches in the city, most of which are Protestant. The chief denominations are Church of God, Baptist, Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal.\nThere is a strong Roman Catholic community, with the Holy Trinity Cathedral which is the seat of metropolitan archbishop and was consecrated in 1911, as well a few Catholic schools and institutions such as the Immaculate Conception High School, St Francis Primary and Infant School, Holy Childhood High School which was founded and is owned by the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of our Lady of Perpetual Help (FMS) in Jamaica.\nAfro-Christian syncretic religions such as the Rastafari movement also have a significant following.\nThe Shaare Shalom Synagogue serves Kingston's Jewish population. The city also has communities of Buddhists and Muslims. The Islamic Council of Jamaica and the Islamic Education and Dawah Centre are both located in Kingston. There are three units of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nKingston plays a central role in Jamaica's economy. The vast majority of economic activity takes place within Kingston, and as most government ministries are located in the city, it is a key force in legislation in regards to Jamaica's finances. The high population density of the capital city means that the majority of monetary transactions occur in Kingston - stimulating much of Jamaica's local economy. The city is also home to the highest number of schools, hospitals and universities anywhere in Jamaica. Kingston is also the island's main transportation hub and its largest seaport.Many multinational conglomerates and financial institutions are headquartered in and around the Kingston Metropolitan Area. Air Jamaica was headquartered in Kingston. The idea of making Jamaica an International Financial Centre has also been proposed as a way to boost the city's financial sector and create more jobs, especially for professionals such as accountants and lawyers.The city's major industries include tourism, apparel manufacturing, and shipping. Many international exports are traded through the city's seaport, with major exports including bauxite, sugar and coffee. The city is also a major tourist destination, and tourism is one of its largest sources of economic activity. The city has suffered economic troubles recently, however, along with the rest of the country of Jamaica. Plans to help the city's economy have made downtown Kingston the subject of numerous redevelopment plans. There have also been attempts to grow the manufacturing industry in the area and to attract call centres to the city.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nKingston is surrounded by the Blue Mountains, Red Hills, Long Mountain and the Kingston Harbour. The city is on the Liguanea plain, an alluvial plain alongside the Hope River. Kingston experiences frequent earthquakes, including the 1907 earthquake.\nKingston has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical wet-and-dry climate (Aw), that borders on a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). characterised by a wet season from May to November, which coincides with the hurricane season, and a dry season from December to April. During the dry season, there is not much rainfall, however, cold and stationary fronts occur at this time, and often bring heavy showers, especially in March. Kingston is in the rain shadow of the Blue Mountains; therefore, little to none of the moisture carried by the Northeast Trade Winds falls over Kingston, causing Kingston to be very dry in comparison to Portland and Saint Mary on the windward side of the Blue Mountains. Kingston is on a coastal location, hence it comes under the influence of the sea, though dense urban development can negate this effect. In the 21st century, Kingston has experienced temperatures as high as 38.8 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) and as low as 13.4 \u00b0C (56 \u00b0F). Between 1895 and 1990, the total average rainfall was recorded at 813 mm (32.0 in), the highest monthly average rainfall recorded in October at 177 mm (7.0 in), and the lowest monthly average rainfall recorded in March at 18 mm (0.71 in). Fog, hail, thunder and tornadoes are all extremely rare.\n\n\n== Housing ==\nIn 1848 the Jamaican government expanded Kingston by constructing new homes in the west, north and east of the city. This housing became highly segregated in terms of race and class and by 1860 the majority of white elites lived on the outskirts of the city.As Kingston's population grew, existing settlements became so densely occupied that marshes in the southwest were filled in to allow the development of new housing. By 1935, continued population growth and poverty resulted in the emergence of slums in the east and west of the city. Later these areas were demolished by the government and residents were rehoused in Denham Town. This development accommodated 3,000 people, leaving more than one sixth of displaced resident homeless. Consequently, overcrowding persisted throughout the city and cramped living condition resulted in public health issues.Suburbanization also became significant and by the 1960s this residential area spread to the foothills of the Blue Mountains. Subsequently, the lack of space and continued consumerism meant this area then expanded to the east of the mountains.In Kingston, 20% of the population now live in squatter settlements. Contrastingly, Kingston is also home to Red Hills, Norbrook, Cherry Gardens, Stony Hill, Jack's Hill, suburbs that hold some of the most expensive houses in all of Jamaica.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThe city of Kingston is home to a number of urban parks which are frequently transformed to accommodate various events and festivities on the Jamaican calendar. The most popular parks include: Emancipation Park, Hope Gardens, Devon House, National Heroes' Park, St William Grant Park and Mandela Park.\n\n\n=== Emancipation Park ===\n\nThe Liguanea Club, a recreational and social club for the upper class in society, located on Knutsford Boulevard, owned over 35 acres (14 ha) of land including the former Liguanea Park now the site of Emancipation Park. The club gave the land measuring seven acres as a gift to the Jamaican Government.\nSeveral government members argued that the land should be converted into a business district, while others felt a multi-functional entertainment complex should be built on the site. The large financial input needed for either venture, was not forthcoming. In 2002 Cabinet granted approval for the transfer of the land to the National Housing Trust on the condition that a park was built and maintained at that location. The land was transferred for one Jamaican dollar.The park is well known for the 11 ft. (approximately 3m) high bronze sculpture done by Jamaican artist Laura Facey, situated at the park's main entrance. This prominent sculpture comprises two naked black male and female statues gazing to the skies \u2013 symbolic of their triumphant rise from the horrors of slavery. The statue was unveiled in July 2003, in time for the park's first anniversary which caused an out cry from the Jamaican populace who believed that the blatant nudity and generous bodily proportions of the figures were very inappropriate to depict the freedom of black people.\n\n\n=== Hope Gardens ===\nThe Royal Botanical Gardens at Hope, popularly called Hope Gardens serves as a national attraction. The Hope Gardens is a part of the 2,000 acres (809 ha) of land making it the largest botanical garden in the English-speaking Caribbean. The land situated by the foothills of the Blue Mountains was originally owned by Major Richard Hope from whom it got its name. Two hundred acres of this land was obtained by the Government of Jamaica in 1880 and was originally established as a plant introduction and crop-testing facility for plants such as pineapple, cocoa, coffee and tobacco. The formal Botanical Gardens were laid out on approximately 60 acres (24 ha) of this land with the assistance of personnel from the Kew Gardens in England.\nIn the 1950s, the Queen, after visiting the island and being pleased with the state of the gardens, gave permission for it to be called the Royal Botanical Gardens, Hope. The Gardens have many exotic species along with some endemic trees of Jamaica. Over the years, the ravages of hurricanes and other disasters have resulted in the loss of a significant number of species. However, there are still some prominent trees and popular sites to be viewed in the Gardens. At Hope Gardens, visitors can view a number of other features including the Coconut Museum, the Sunken Gardens, the Orchid House, the Lily Pond, the Maze and Palm Avenue.The Hope Gardens has an adjoining zoo referred to as Hope Gardens Zoo. The gardens and zoo are undergoing redevelopment to improve the physical landscape and the animal inventory as a part of Bring Back The Hope campaign.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe St William Grant Park (Parade) in the heart of downtown Kingston is the starting point for three of Jamaica's four A roads, namely the A1 (Kingston to Lucea), the A3 (Kingston to Saint Ann's Bay) and the A4 (Kingston to Annotto Bay), while the city itself is provided with a dense network of trunk, main, secondary and minor roads. It also consists of the Highway 2000, Jamaica which runs through Portmore, Ocho Rios and Mandeville. A new section of Highway 2000, Jamaica (called \"T3\") was recently opened to the public. It has greatly reduced the travel time between Kingston and Montego Bay from 4 hours to a mere 2 1/2 hours.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, mini buses and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.Private car ownership levels are high, and like many major urban conurbations Kingston suffers from frequent traffic jams and pollution.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nIn June 1898, the existing mule car service was phased out and a transition to electric trams, initially operated by the West India Electric Company and later by the Jamaica Public Service Company, was undertaken. This transition to the electric tram was completed on 31 March 1899. This service continued to operate, but the inflexibility of a tram service could not keep pace with a growing city, and the tram service ceased to operate on 7 August 1948.Between 1948 and 1953 a motor bus service was operated by a company called Jamaica Utilities. The government revoked its franchise in 1953.\nFrom 1953 to 1983 the Jamaica Omnibus Service operated a service, which at its peak consisted of over 600 buses and served an area spanning Spanish Town, Border, Mt. James, Bull Bay and Port Royal. It was wound up by the government in 1983 after being nationalised in 1974.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, the Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC), mini buses, and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe now disused Kingston railway station served the Kingston to Montego Bay main line with branches from Spanish Town to Ewarton, Bog Walk to Port Antonio, Linstead to New Works and May pen to Frankfield.\nThe railway station opened in 1845 and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica's railways abruptly ceased.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nKingston's international airport is Norman Manley International Airport while Tinson Pen Aerodrome provides domestic services.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\nHistorically, the Kingston waterfront was Jamaica's main port with many finger piers at which freighters and passenger liners could dock. More recently, with the containerisation of freight, the port has moved to Newport West.\n\n\n== Law enforcement ==\nJamaica's police force, the Jamaica Constabulary Force, is based on Old Hope Road near Liguanea. Smaller police stations, such as Hunt's Bay, Matilda's Corner and Half-Way-Tree, are dispersed across the Corporate Area. The Supreme Court of Jamaica is also located in Kingston. Other courts, such as the Half-Way-Tree Resident Magistrate's Court, Gun Court, Traffic Court and Family Court, make Kingston their home. The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) has its headquarters at Up Park Camp near New Kingston and Cross Roads. The JDF also operates a major naval base at Port Royal.\n\n\n=== Fire service ===\nFire response in Kingston is provided by the Jamaica Fire Brigade, the national fire service. The service operates from fire stations spread throughout the Corporate Area. Fire stations are located at \nYork Park (HQ)\nHalf-Way-Tree\nRollington Town\nPort Royal\nNorman Manley International Airport\nStony Hill\nTrench Town\nKingston Harbour (Fire Boat)\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe Gleaner Company, the Jamaica Observer and the Sunday Herald, three of Jamaica's large newspaper companies, make their home in Kingston. Several television and radio stations including Television Jamaica (TVJ), CVM TV, RJR 94 FM, TBC Radio 88.5 FM, Hitz 92 FM, FAME 95 FM, LOVE TV, ZIP 103, Kool 97 FM and LOVE FM, are all based in Kingston.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe capital is home to five association football teams who play in the Jamaican Premier League. The teams are Arnett Gardens, Boy's Town, Harbour View, Maverley Hughenden and Waterhouse F.C..\n\n\n== Telecommunications ==\n\n\n=== Fixed voice and broadband ===\nFixed voice and broadband services in Kingston are provided by either FLOW and Digicel (via their new Digicel Play service which is exclusive to the Kingston Metropolitan Area). FLOW uses a Hybrid Fibre and Coaxial network to provide IPTV, VoIP & POTS and broadband capable of speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. FLOW also uses a Copper network to provide POTS and ADSL capable of speeds up to 12 Mbit/s. Digicel uses a GPON fibre-optic network, providing IPTV, VoIP and broadband speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s. Digicel's Fibre-optic network boasts capacity of up to 10 Gbit/s.\n\n\n=== Mobile voice and broadband ===\nMobile voice and broadband services in Kingston are dominated by incumbents, FLOW & Digicel. Both carriers provide GSM, EDGE, HSPA, HSPA+ and LTE connectivity in and around the city.\nFLOW offers HSPA+ of up to 21 Mbit/s on 850 MHz and 1900 MHz. FLOW also offers DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 1900 MHz spectrum.\nDigicel also offers 21 Mbit/s HSPA+ however, they also offer DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 850 MHz spectrum. Digicel was also first to market with LTE in Jamaica. Their network covers all of Kingston Parish and most of the populous areas in the Kingston Metropolitan Area, capable of speeds of up to 75 Mbit/s on 10 MHz of Band 17 spectrum.\nFLOW also offers LTE in Kingston. FLOW's LTE network is accessible on Band 4 or AWS spectrum. Due to the network delaying its rollout to acquire more spectrum, its network is theoretically faster than both Digicel and Caricel, to the tune of 150 Mbit/s (20 MHz of Bandwidth) with further plans to add low band spectrum, possibly increasing theoretical speeds up to 225 Mbit/s.\nKingston is also home to Caricel, Jamaica's newest telecoms operator, which deployed its LTE network first to the Kingston Metropolitan Area.\nIn addition, both carriers have their Jamaican head offices in the city (with the exception of Digicel, which has its company headquarters in Kingston rather than a regional office there as is the case with FLOW, which is based in Miami).\n\n\n== Postal service ==\nPostal services in Kingston and throughout the island are provided by the Postal Corporation of Jamaica, the national post office of Jamaica. Services include domestic and international mail delivery, post office boxes, registered mail, priority mail (local courier), parcel delivery, express mail service (international courier), advertising mail and provision of post office boxes.\nKingston is divided in several postal zones enumerated as follows;\n\n\n== Institutions ==\nKingston, as the capital, is the financial, cultural, economic and industrial centre of Jamaica. Many financial institutions are based in Kingston, and the city boasts the largest number of hospitals, schools, universities and cultural attractions of any urban area on the island. Notable Kingston landmarks include the University of the West Indies, Jamaica Defence Force Museum, and Bob Marley Museum. A United Nations agency, the International Seabed Authority is headquartered in Kingston.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\nKingston is twinned with:\n\n Miami, Florida, United States\n Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States\n Topeka, Kansas, United States\n Gibraltar, Gibraltar, United Kingdom\n Coventry, England, United Kingdom\n Guadalajara, Mexico\n Shenzhen, People's Republic of China:\n Panev\u0117\u017eys, Lithuania\n Windhoek, Namibia\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of metropolitan areas in the West Indies\nRoy Anthony Bridge\nTrenchtown\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKingston & St Andrew Corporation website",

          "Incredibly informative, stimulating adventure through the Island\u2019s rich artistic history! It helped me see how our great artistic traditions extend beyond the medium of music",
          "Date of visit: December 2017 Today we went to the Jamaican Nataional Gallery. This art museum is out of the \u201ctourist\u201d area but well worth a short drive or cab ride for the visit. There is a car park for the museum for a mere $2 or J$200. Admission is just J$400 (a little",

          "I've been to the National Gallery twice and it was definitely more than I expected. The first time I was just passing by and decided to take a look. I had a student ID and was able to enter free. The second time was when they were having an art show. Some very incredible pieces",
          "Last week I took a group to tour the National Gallery. I had'nt been for a few months. The guests were art lovers- & they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. There was so much to enjoy, the hour we planned turned into hlour & a half. The gift shop, although small had some nice gifts",

          "really, really, really recommend a visit here. the collection is absolutely brilliant and my personal favourites were kapo's sculptures. jamaica is known as a cultural heavyweight for its music, but this collection (and it's almost entirely post-independece work) shows that",
          "I have family in Jamaica but I rarely do any tourist stuff. Due to being in Kingston I popped in not knowing what I would find. Have to say I was shocked and proud of the heritage of Jamaica. I learnt a bit and would recommend to anyone to visit it.",

          "I went with friends to the \"Last Sunday\" event in August - the last Sunday of every month admission is free and there was live music. The gallery isn't enormous but it gives and unexpected and interesting insight into the art , culture and history of Jamaica. Should be on the",

          "Spent a few hours visiting the National Gallery which is in a somewhat nice and safe location by the Harbor. It is the oldest and largest art gallery in the English speaking Caribbean. Entrance fee was fairly cheap at less than $5US and there were only about 5 other visitors",
          "This is a superb collection of the exceptional art work of Jamaica in a well appointed gallery. THere are special exhibitions from time to time and a nice little shop. It is sadly undervisited for such a fine place, perhaps it down-town location works against it but a visit",
          "We lived in Kingston for two years and have just returned to Canada this month. The National Gallery is a national treasure waiting to be discovered. The Final Sunday of every month of has a bit added to the exhibits that are fantastic. Permenant exhibits are lovely and new",

          "The National Gallery deserves more credit and more attention as an attraction in Kingston and the island of Jamaica. This gallery is especially good for Jamaican/Caribbean students and should be part of the school curriculum. The permanent collection is always worth a walk",
          "This is for that artsy group. You will appreciate it if that is your think. Located in the city getting there and finding a parking is not touristy so once you are into art the check it out",

          "The National Gallery of Jamaica is located on the Waterfront in Downtown Kingston and is well worth a visit. The entrance is located on Orange Street, where a large statue sits outside the entrance. Internally the layout of the Gallery is light and airy with an open plan area",

          "I enjoyed walking through the National Gallery and looking at the local artwork. A nice insight into the Jamaican culture. The art is spread over two floors. Walking slowly through each of the rooms takes roughly 45 mins. It's a very secure place, so I didnt feel unsafe at all.",

          "Galley was good. In a very sketchy part of town right in front of the police station. I don't think I've ever felt so ill at ease while in the proximity of so much law enforcement in my life. Kingston in general is one of the scariest places ever, a very menacing environment.",
          "The National Gallery is not a large museum compared to other National Art Gallerys around the world but it still has a fine collection. The section with historical paintings gives interesting insights into life in Jamaica in earlier times. However, the real gem for me was the",

          "I always wanted to see some of Edna Manley's sculpture in person. A visit to the National Gallery fulfilled that desire and much more. I hadn't realized how diverse and engaging Jamaican art is. When we visited the gallery there was a wonderful exhibit on religion and",
          "What a treasure the National Gallery is! Our guide Karen Hutchinson (Jamaica Cultural Enterprises) led us to the museum right after Port Royal, which was perfect timing as we really got a sense of the progression of the country and its emergence as an independent nation,",
          "This museum was originally located at Devon House and moved to its current location in the 1980's. Displays were very well organized and provide an insight to Jamaica's rich history and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. This former hub of Kingston has the potential to become",
          "The National Gallery is a great place to view Jamaican art and is located near the waterfront in Downtown Kingston, which was once the hub of commercial activity in Kingston. While there are plans to revitalise the area, these are slow in the making. Visitng the Gallery",

          "When I was there there was this great Jamaican contemporary art exhibit going on. They have nothing to envy to US or Europe, I was stunned by some of the unique artworks from young multimedia artists I got to discover. The second floor is for permanent exhibits on Jamaican and",
          "We paid a visit midweek and parked about 50 metres away from the entrance. The gallery was virtually empty and it felt as if it had been opened especially for us. Bags have to be checked in on arrival. The paintings and sculptures were beautiful and really told a story about the",
          "We ventured to the National Gallery downtown and I absolutely loved every minute of it. There is ample parking beside the gallery for $1 an hour, and the entrance into the gallery is $4 for adults. We experienced \"New Roots\" which was on display at the gallery. New Roots",
          "A group of us visitied here with a guide from the Museum. He gave us a great introduction to the art and heart of Jamaica. I wish the gift shop was stocked better. Many of would have spent some cash here on postcards and books on the artwork, but there was nothing here. So",

          "This is an interesting art gallery with a few museum pieces. A good selection of artists old and new. The Edna Manley gallery is of artists influenced by her not her work. The gift shop closes well before the gallery closing time.",
          "Quite a lesson in history and current affairs. the display of local talent is unbeleivable. One would not know that there was so much artistic talent in the island. And the pieces available for sale are quie reasonable in price, even jewelery.",
          "Very impressed the breadth and depth of the collections. It was like walking through a museum of Jamaican history from the colonial to the present day. Sections are divided according to different time periods in Jamaica's history. It was definitely interesting to see the",
          "It's hard to think of a National Gallery without comparing it to your own, which is very unfair. The gallery is on two floors with the ground floor being dedicated to a photography exhibition with work from children and adults. I'm not sure how long that will be there. Upstairs",
          "Not only does Jamaica have wonderful artists whose works are carefully exhibited in the National Gallery, but the Gallery itself is well laid out and provides a pleasant afternoon's experience. The Gallery is well-curated, and the special shows are always worth seeing. The",

          "Just went to the exhibit...and it is a must see for everyone..great works over the past 50 years. They also have other great rooms to see...but I was blown away with the particular one. Go to Moby Dick for lunch after!",
          "Very well presented and professionally done. Beautiful displays of Jamaican art through history. Small gift shop which has prints and small items for sale, there's also a coffee shop. The facility is in the heart of downtown Kingston by the waterfront. It is safe to visit during",

          "We spent a pleasant couple of hours here. The art ranges from a few pre-Columbian Taino Native American pieces to modern Jamaican art. Much of the art is not surprisingly very colorful. The museum includes an extensive collection of Edna Manley's paintings and sculptures,",
          "I visited the National Art Gallery several years ago and enjoyed it....so this year (May 2011), I wanted to go back again. I did just that, and to my surprise they have made this place even nicer than it was before. There's now a little coffee shop on the premises, as well as a",

It is located between North Street and George Headley Drive.\nThe church is the seat of metropolitan archbishop and was consecrated in 1911. The Byzantine Revival design was by the American architect Raymond F. Admiral. The Pope John Paul II paid a visit on 10 August 1993.\nIt was built after the destruction, in the earthquake of 1907, of the Church of the Holy Trinity in the Duke and Sutton streets. It is located on a site adjacent to Winchester Park, the works beginning in 1908.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoman Catholicism in Jamaica\nHoly Trinity Cathedral (disambiguation)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Kingston is the capital and largest city of Jamaica, located on the southeastern coast of the island. It faces a natural harbour protected by the Palisadoes, a long sand spit which connects the town of Port Royal and the Norman Manley International Airport to the rest of the island. In the Americas, Kingston is the largest predominantly English-speaking city south of the United States.\nThe local government bodies of the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew were amalgamated by the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation Act of 1923, to form the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC). Greater Kingston, or the \"Corporate Area\" refers to those areas under the KSAC; however, it does not solely refer to Kingston Parish, which only consists of the old downtown and Port Royal. Kingston Parish had a population of 96,052, and St. Andrew Parish had a population of 555,828 in 2001. Kingston is only bordered by Saint Andrew to the east, west and north. The geographical border for the parish of Kingston encompasses the following communities: Tivoli Gardens, Denham Town, Rae Town, Kingston Gardens, National Heroes Park, Bournemouth Gardens, Norman Gardens, Rennock Lodge, Springfield and Port Royal, along with portions of Rollington Town, Franklyn Town and Allman Town.The city proper is bounded by Six Miles to the west, Stony Hill to the north, Papine to the northeast and Harbour View to the east, which are communities in urban and suburban Saint Andrew. Communities in rural St. Andrew such as Gordon Town, Mavis Bank, Lawrence Tavern, Mt. Airy and Bull Bay would not be described as being in Kingston city.\nTwo districts make up the central area of Kingston: the historic Downtown, and New Kingston. Both are served by Norman Manley International Airport and also by the smaller and primarily domestic Tinson Pen Aerodrome.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKingston was founded in July 1693 after the earthquake that devastated Port Royal in 1692, the original section of the city which was situated at the bottom of the Liguanea Plains was laid out to house survivors of the earthquake. Before the earthquake, Kingston's functions were purely agricultural. The earthquake survivors set up a camp on the sea front. Approximately two thousand people died due to mosquito-borne diseases. Initially the people lived in a tented camp on Colonel Barry's Hog Crawle. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by fire in 1703. Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. The new grid system of the town was designed to facilitate commerce, particularly the system of main thoroughfares 66 feet (20 m) across, which allowed transportation between the port and plantations farther inland. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the centre of trade for Jamaica.\nThe government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in Port Royal, and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of Liguanea.\nThe first free school, Wolmers's, was founded in 1729 and there was a theatre, first on Harbour Street and then moved in 1774 to North Parade. Both are still in existence. In 1755 the governor, Sir Charles Knowles, had decided to transfer the government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston.\nBy the end of the 18th century, the city contained more than 3,000 brick buildings. The harbour fostered trade, and played part in several naval wars of the 18th century. Kingston took over the functions of Spanish Town (the capital at the time). These functions included agriculture, commercial, processing and a main transport hub to and from Kingston and other sections of the island. In 1788, Kingston had a population of 25,000, which was about a tenth of the overall population of the island. One in every four people living in Kingston was white, and there was a large population of free people of color there too, meaning that two out of every five people living in Kingston were free. The remaining three-fifths of Kingston's population was made up of black slaves.The government passed an act to transfer the government offices to Kingston from Spanish Town, which occurred in 1872. It kept this status when the island was granted independence in 1962.\n\nIn 1907, 800 people died in another earthquake known as the 1907 Kingston earthquake, destroying nearly all the historical buildings south of Parade in the city. That was when a restriction of no more than 60 feet (18 m) was instituted on buildings in the city centre. These three-story-high buildings were built with reinforced concrete. Construction on King Street in the city was the first area to breach this building code.\nDuring the 1930s, island-wide riots led to the development of trade unions and political parties to represent workers.\nThe city became home to the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies founded in 1948, with 24 medical students.\nNot until the 1960s did major change occur in the development of Kingston's city centre. The international attention of reggae music at that time coincided with the expansion and development of 95 acres (38 ha) of the Kingston city centre waterfront area. These developments led to an influx of shops and offices, and the development of a new financial centre: New Kingston, which replaced the Knutsford Racetrack. Multi-story buildings and boulevards were placed within that section.\nIn 1966 Kingston was the host city to the Commonwealth Games.\nThe western section of the city was not the focus of development, and that area proved to be politically tense. The 1970s saw deteriorating economic conditions that led to recurrent violence and a decline in tourism which later affected the island.\n\nIn the 1980 general elections, the democratic socialist People's National Party (PNP) government was voted out, and subsequent governments have been more market-oriented. Within a global urban era, the 1990s saw that Kingston has made efforts to modernise and develop its city structure and functions. Various organisations such as the Kingston Restoration Company, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), the Port Authority of Jamaica and the Port Royal Development Company, among others sought to develop the urban structure of the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe majority of the population of Kingston is of African descent. Large minority ethnic groups include East Indians and Chinese, who came to the country as indentured servants in the late 19th century. The Chinese occupy important roles in Jamaica's economy especially in the retail markets in Downtown Kingston and the wider metropolitan area. There is also a minority of Europeans, mostly descending from immigrants from Germany and Great Britain. Syrians and Lebanese form one of the most influential ethnic groups in not only Kingston, but the entire island. Though a minority ethnic group, the Lebanese were able to give Jamaica one of its prime ministers, Edward Philip George Seaga. There is a strong undercurrent of bias based on skin color as darker skinned Jamaicans are usually at the very bottom of the socio-economic ladder; a phenomenon evidenced by the disproportionate representation of foreigners and mixed-race individuals in lucrative private sector and government positions. Multi-racial Jamaicans continue to form the second largest racial group, and there is also a small Jewish population in the city.\n79.2% Black\n12.8% Multiracial\n5.2% Asian\n3.4% White\n\n\n== Religion ==\nThere is a wide variety of Christian churches in the city, most of which are Protestant. The chief denominations are Church of God, Baptist, Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal.\nThere is a strong Roman Catholic community, with the Holy Trinity Cathedral which is the seat of metropolitan archbishop and was consecrated in 1911, as well a few Catholic schools and institutions such as the Immaculate Conception High School, St Francis Primary and Infant School, Holy Childhood High School which was founded and is owned by the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of our Lady of Perpetual Help (FMS) in Jamaica.\nAfro-Christian syncretic religions such as the Rastafari movement also have a significant following.\nThe Shaare Shalom Synagogue serves Kingston's Jewish population. The city also has communities of Buddhists and Muslims. The Islamic Council of Jamaica and the Islamic Education and Dawah Centre are both located in Kingston. There are three units of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nKingston plays a central role in Jamaica's economy. The vast majority of economic activity takes place within Kingston, and as most government ministries are located in the city, it is a key force in legislation in regards to Jamaica's finances. The high population density of the capital city means that the majority of monetary transactions occur in Kingston - stimulating much of Jamaica's local economy. The city is also home to the highest number of schools, hospitals and universities anywhere in Jamaica. Kingston is also the island's main transportation hub and its largest seaport.Many multinational conglomerates and financial institutions are headquartered in and around the Kingston Metropolitan Area. Air Jamaica was headquartered in Kingston. The idea of making Jamaica an International Financial Centre has also been proposed as a way to boost the city's financial sector and create more jobs, especially for professionals such as accountants and lawyers.The city's major industries include tourism, apparel manufacturing, and shipping. Many international exports are traded through the city's seaport, with major exports including bauxite, sugar and coffee. The city is also a major tourist destination, and tourism is one of its largest sources of economic activity. The city has suffered economic troubles recently, however, along with the rest of the country of Jamaica. Plans to help the city's economy have made downtown Kingston the subject of numerous redevelopment plans. There have also been attempts to grow the manufacturing industry in the area and to attract call centres to the city.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nKingston is surrounded by the Blue Mountains, Red Hills, Long Mountain and the Kingston Harbour. The city is on the Liguanea plain, an alluvial plain alongside the Hope River. Kingston experiences frequent earthquakes, including the 1907 earthquake.\nKingston has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical wet-and-dry climate (Aw), that borders on a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). characterised by a wet season from May to November, which coincides with the hurricane season, and a dry season from December to April. During the dry season, there is not much rainfall, however, cold and stationary fronts occur at this time, and often bring heavy showers, especially in March. Kingston is in the rain shadow of the Blue Mountains; therefore, little to none of the moisture carried by the Northeast Trade Winds falls over Kingston, causing Kingston to be very dry in comparison to Portland and Saint Mary on the windward side of the Blue Mountains. Kingston is on a coastal location, hence it comes under the influence of the sea, though dense urban development can negate this effect. In the 21st century, Kingston has experienced temperatures as high as 38.8 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) and as low as 13.4 \u00b0C (56 \u00b0F). Between 1895 and 1990, the total average rainfall was recorded at 813 mm (32.0 in), the highest monthly average rainfall recorded in October at 177 mm (7.0 in), and the lowest monthly average rainfall recorded in March at 18 mm (0.71 in). Fog, hail, thunder and tornadoes are all extremely rare.\n\n\n== Housing ==\nIn 1848 the Jamaican government expanded Kingston by constructing new homes in the west, north and east of the city. This housing became highly segregated in terms of race and class and by 1860 the majority of white elites lived on the outskirts of the city.As Kingston's population grew, existing settlements became so densely occupied that marshes in the southwest were filled in to allow the development of new housing. By 1935, continued population growth and poverty resulted in the emergence of slums in the east and west of the city. Later these areas were demolished by the government and residents were rehoused in Denham Town. This development accommodated 3,000 people, leaving more than one sixth of displaced resident homeless. Consequently, overcrowding persisted throughout the city and cramped living condition resulted in public health issues.Suburbanization also became significant and by the 1960s this residential area spread to the foothills of the Blue Mountains. Subsequently, the lack of space and continued consumerism meant this area then expanded to the east of the mountains.In Kingston, 20% of the population now live in squatter settlements. Contrastingly, Kingston is also home to Red Hills, Norbrook, Cherry Gardens, Stony Hill, Jack's Hill, suburbs that hold some of the most expensive houses in all of Jamaica.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThe city of Kingston is home to a number of urban parks which are frequently transformed to accommodate various events and festivities on the Jamaican calendar. The most popular parks include: Emancipation Park, Hope Gardens, Devon House, National Heroes' Park, St William Grant Park and Mandela Park.\n\n\n=== Emancipation Park ===\n\nThe Liguanea Club, a recreational and social club for the upper class in society, located on Knutsford Boulevard, owned over 35 acres (14 ha) of land including the former Liguanea Park now the site of Emancipation Park. The club gave the land measuring seven acres as a gift to the Jamaican Government.\nSeveral government members argued that the land should be converted into a business district, while others felt a multi-functional entertainment complex should be built on the site. The large financial input needed for either venture, was not forthcoming. In 2002 Cabinet granted approval for the transfer of the land to the National Housing Trust on the condition that a park was built and maintained at that location. The land was transferred for one Jamaican dollar.The park is well known for the 11 ft. (approximately 3m) high bronze sculpture done by Jamaican artist Laura Facey, situated at the park's main entrance. This prominent sculpture comprises two naked black male and female statues gazing to the skies \u2013 symbolic of their triumphant rise from the horrors of slavery. The statue was unveiled in July 2003, in time for the park's first anniversary which caused an out cry from the Jamaican populace who believed that the blatant nudity and generous bodily proportions of the figures were very inappropriate to depict the freedom of black people.\n\n\n=== Hope Gardens ===\nThe Royal Botanical Gardens at Hope, popularly called Hope Gardens serves as a national attraction. The Hope Gardens is a part of the 2,000 acres (809 ha) of land making it the largest botanical garden in the English-speaking Caribbean. The land situated by the foothills of the Blue Mountains was originally owned by Major Richard Hope from whom it got its name. Two hundred acres of this land was obtained by the Government of Jamaica in 1880 and was originally established as a plant introduction and crop-testing facility for plants such as pineapple, cocoa, coffee and tobacco. The formal Botanical Gardens were laid out on approximately 60 acres (24 ha) of this land with the assistance of personnel from the Kew Gardens in England.\nIn the 1950s, the Queen, after visiting the island and being pleased with the state of the gardens, gave permission for it to be called the Royal Botanical Gardens, Hope. The Gardens have many exotic species along with some endemic trees of Jamaica. Over the years, the ravages of hurricanes and other disasters have resulted in the loss of a significant number of species. However, there are still some prominent trees and popular sites to be viewed in the Gardens. At Hope Gardens, visitors can view a number of other features including the Coconut Museum, the Sunken Gardens, the Orchid House, the Lily Pond, the Maze and Palm Avenue.The Hope Gardens has an adjoining zoo referred to as Hope Gardens Zoo. The gardens and zoo are undergoing redevelopment to improve the physical landscape and the animal inventory as a part of Bring Back The Hope campaign.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe St William Grant Park (Parade) in the heart of downtown Kingston is the starting point for three of Jamaica's four A roads, namely the A1 (Kingston to Lucea), the A3 (Kingston to Saint Ann's Bay) and the A4 (Kingston to Annotto Bay), while the city itself is provided with a dense network of trunk, main, secondary and minor roads. It also consists of the Highway 2000, Jamaica which runs through Portmore, Ocho Rios and Mandeville. A new section of Highway 2000, Jamaica (called \"T3\") was recently opened to the public. It has greatly reduced the travel time between Kingston and Montego Bay from 4 hours to a mere 2 1/2 hours.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, mini buses and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.Private car ownership levels are high, and like many major urban conurbations Kingston suffers from frequent traffic jams and pollution.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nIn June 1898, the existing mule car service was phased out and a transition to electric trams, initially operated by the West India Electric Company and later by the Jamaica Public Service Company, was undertaken. This transition to the electric tram was completed on 31 March 1899. This service continued to operate, but the inflexibility of a tram service could not keep pace with a growing city, and the tram service ceased to operate on 7 August 1948.Between 1948 and 1953 a motor bus service was operated by a company called Jamaica Utilities. The government revoked its franchise in 1953.\nFrom 1953 to 1983 the Jamaica Omnibus Service operated a service, which at its peak consisted of over 600 buses and served an area spanning Spanish Town, Border, Mt. James, Bull Bay and Port Royal. It was wound up by the government in 1983 after being nationalised in 1974.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, the Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC), mini buses, and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe now disused Kingston railway station served the Kingston to Montego Bay main line with branches from Spanish Town to Ewarton, Bog Walk to Port Antonio, Linstead to New Works and May pen to Frankfield.\nThe railway station opened in 1845 and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica's railways abruptly ceased.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nKingston's international airport is Norman Manley International Airport while Tinson Pen Aerodrome provides domestic services.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\nHistorically, the Kingston waterfront was Jamaica's main port with many finger piers at which freighters and passenger liners could dock. More recently, with the containerisation of freight, the port has moved to Newport West.\n\n\n== Law enforcement ==\nJamaica's police force, the Jamaica Constabulary Force, is based on Old Hope Road near Liguanea. Smaller police stations, such as Hunt's Bay, Matilda's Corner and Half-Way-Tree, are dispersed across the Corporate Area. The Supreme Court of Jamaica is also located in Kingston. Other courts, such as the Half-Way-Tree Resident Magistrate's Court, Gun Court, Traffic Court and Family Court, make Kingston their home. The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) has its headquarters at Up Park Camp near New Kingston and Cross Roads. The JDF also operates a major naval base at Port Royal.\n\n\n=== Fire service ===\nFire response in Kingston is provided by the Jamaica Fire Brigade, the national fire service. The service operates from fire stations spread throughout the Corporate Area. Fire stations are located at \nYork Park (HQ)\nHalf-Way-Tree\nRollington Town\nPort Royal\nNorman Manley International Airport\nStony Hill\nTrench Town\nKingston Harbour (Fire Boat)\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe Gleaner Company, the Jamaica Observer and the Sunday Herald, three of Jamaica's large newspaper companies, make their home in Kingston. Several television and radio stations including Television Jamaica (TVJ), CVM TV, RJR 94 FM, TBC Radio 88.5 FM, Hitz 92 FM, FAME 95 FM, LOVE TV, ZIP 103, Kool 97 FM and LOVE FM, are all based in Kingston.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe capital is home to five association football teams who play in the Jamaican Premier League. The teams are Arnett Gardens, Boy's Town, Harbour View, Maverley Hughenden and Waterhouse F.C..\n\n\n== Telecommunications ==\n\n\n=== Fixed voice and broadband ===\nFixed voice and broadband services in Kingston are provided by either FLOW and Digicel (via their new Digicel Play service which is exclusive to the Kingston Metropolitan Area). FLOW uses a Hybrid Fibre and Coaxial network to provide IPTV, VoIP & POTS and broadband capable of speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. FLOW also uses a Copper network to provide POTS and ADSL capable of speeds up to 12 Mbit/s. Digicel uses a GPON fibre-optic network, providing IPTV, VoIP and broadband speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s. Digicel's Fibre-optic network boasts capacity of up to 10 Gbit/s.\n\n\n=== Mobile voice and broadband ===\nMobile voice and broadband services in Kingston are dominated by incumbents, FLOW & Digicel. Both carriers provide GSM, EDGE, HSPA, HSPA+ and LTE connectivity in and around the city.\nFLOW offers HSPA+ of up to 21 Mbit/s on 850 MHz and 1900 MHz. FLOW also offers DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 1900 MHz spectrum.\nDigicel also offers 21 Mbit/s HSPA+ however, they also offer DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 850 MHz spectrum. Digicel was also first to market with LTE in Jamaica. Their network covers all of Kingston Parish and most of the populous areas in the Kingston Metropolitan Area, capable of speeds of up to 75 Mbit/s on 10 MHz of Band 17 spectrum.\nFLOW also offers LTE in Kingston. FLOW's LTE network is accessible on Band 4 or AWS spectrum. Due to the network delaying its rollout to acquire more spectrum, its network is theoretically faster than both Digicel and Caricel, to the tune of 150 Mbit/s (20 MHz of Bandwidth) with further plans to add low band spectrum, possibly increasing theoretical speeds up to 225 Mbit/s.\nKingston is also home to Caricel, Jamaica's newest telecoms operator, which deployed its LTE network first to the Kingston Metropolitan Area.\nIn addition, both carriers have their Jamaican head offices in the city (with the exception of Digicel, which has its company headquarters in Kingston rather than a regional office there as is the case with FLOW, which is based in Miami).\n\n\n== Postal service ==\nPostal services in Kingston and throughout the island are provided by the Postal Corporation of Jamaica, the national post office of Jamaica. Services include domestic and international mail delivery, post office boxes, registered mail, priority mail (local courier), parcel delivery, express mail service (international courier), advertising mail and provision of post office boxes.\nKingston is divided in several postal zones enumerated as follows;\n\n\n== Institutions ==\nKingston, as the capital, is the financial, cultural, economic and industrial centre of Jamaica. Many financial institutions are based in Kingston, and the city boasts the largest number of hospitals, schools, universities and cultural attractions of any urban area on the island. Notable Kingston landmarks include the University of the West Indies, Jamaica Defence Force Museum, and Bob Marley Museum. A United Nations agency, the International Seabed Authority is headquartered in Kingston.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\nKingston is twinned with:\n\n Miami, Florida, United States\n Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States\n Topeka, Kansas, United States\n Gibraltar, Gibraltar, United Kingdom\n Coventry, England, United Kingdom\n Guadalajara, Mexico\n Shenzhen, People's Republic of China:\n Panev\u0117\u017eys, Lithuania\n Windhoek, Namibia\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of metropolitan areas in the West Indies\nRoy Anthony Bridge\nTrenchtown\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKingston & St Andrew Corporation website",

        "wiki": "Kingston is the capital and largest city of Jamaica, located on the southeastern coast of the island. It faces a natural harbour protected by the Palisadoes, a long sand spit which connects the town of Port Royal and the Norman Manley International Airport to the rest of the island. In the Americas, Kingston is the largest predominantly English-speaking city south of the United States.\nThe local government bodies of the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew were amalgamated by the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation Act of 1923, to form the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC). Greater Kingston, or the \"Corporate Area\" refers to those areas under the KSAC; however, it does not solely refer to Kingston Parish, which only consists of the old downtown and Port Royal. Kingston Parish had a population of 96,052, and St. Andrew Parish had a population of 555,828 in 2001. Kingston is only bordered by Saint Andrew to the east, west and north. The geographical border for the parish of Kingston encompasses the following communities: Tivoli Gardens, Denham Town, Rae Town, Kingston Gardens, National Heroes Park, Bournemouth Gardens, Norman Gardens, Rennock Lodge, Springfield and Port Royal, along with portions of Rollington Town, Franklyn Town and Allman Town.The city proper is bounded by Six Miles to the west, Stony Hill to the north, Papine to the northeast and Harbour View to the east, which are communities in urban and suburban Saint Andrew. Communities in rural St. Andrew such as Gordon Town, Mavis Bank, Lawrence Tavern, Mt. Airy and Bull Bay would not be described as being in Kingston city.\nTwo districts make up the central area of Kingston: the historic Downtown, and New Kingston. Both are served by Norman Manley International Airport and also by the smaller and primarily domestic Tinson Pen Aerodrome.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKingston was founded in July 1693 after the earthquake that devastated Port Royal in 1692, the original section of the city which was situated at the bottom of the Liguanea Plains was laid out to house survivors of the earthquake. Before the earthquake, Kingston's functions were purely agricultural. The earthquake survivors set up a camp on the sea front. Approximately two thousand people died due to mosquito-borne diseases. Initially the people lived in a tented camp on Colonel Barry's Hog Crawle. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by fire in 1703. Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. The new grid system of the town was designed to facilitate commerce, particularly the system of main thoroughfares 66 feet (20 m) across, which allowed transportation between the port and plantations farther inland. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the centre of trade for Jamaica.\nThe government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in Port Royal, and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of Liguanea.\nThe first free school, Wolmers's, was founded in 1729 and there was a theatre, first on Harbour Street and then moved in 1774 to North Parade. Both are still in existence. In 1755 the governor, Sir Charles Knowles, had decided to transfer the government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston.\nBy the end of the 18th century, the city contained more than 3,000 brick buildings. The harbour fostered trade, and played part in several naval wars of the 18th century. Kingston took over the functions of Spanish Town (the capital at the time). These functions included agriculture, commercial, processing and a main transport hub to and from Kingston and other sections of the island. In 1788, Kingston had a population of 25,000, which was about a tenth of the overall population of the island. One in every four people living in Kingston was white, and there was a large population of free people of color there too, meaning that two out of every five people living in Kingston were free. The remaining three-fifths of Kingston's population was made up of black slaves.The government passed an act to transfer the government offices to Kingston from Spanish Town, which occurred in 1872. It kept this status when the island was granted independence in 1962.\n\nIn 1907, 800 people died in another earthquake known as the 1907 Kingston earthquake, destroying nearly all the historical buildings south of Parade in the city. That was when a restriction of no more than 60 feet (18 m) was instituted on buildings in the city centre. These three-story-high buildings were built with reinforced concrete. Construction on King Street in the city was the first area to breach this building code.\nDuring the 1930s, island-wide riots led to the development of trade unions and political parties to represent workers.\nThe city became home to the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies founded in 1948, with 24 medical students.\nNot until the 1960s did major change occur in the development of Kingston's city centre. The international attention of reggae music at that time coincided with the expansion and development of 95 acres (38 ha) of the Kingston city centre waterfront area. These developments led to an influx of shops and offices, and the development of a new financial centre: New Kingston, which replaced the Knutsford Racetrack. Multi-story buildings and boulevards were placed within that section.\nIn 1966 Kingston was the host city to the Commonwealth Games.\nThe western section of the city was not the focus of development, and that area proved to be politically tense. The 1970s saw deteriorating economic conditions that led to recurrent violence and a decline in tourism which later affected the island.\n\nIn the 1980 general elections, the democratic socialist People's National Party (PNP) government was voted out, and subsequent governments have been more market-oriented. Within a global urban era, the 1990s saw that Kingston has made efforts to modernise and develop its city structure and functions. Various organisations such as the Kingston Restoration Company, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), the Port Authority of Jamaica and the Port Royal Development Company, among others sought to develop the urban structure of the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe majority of the population of Kingston is of African descent. Large minority ethnic groups include East Indians and Chinese, who came to the country as indentured servants in the late 19th century. The Chinese occupy important roles in Jamaica's economy especially in the retail markets in Downtown Kingston and the wider metropolitan area. There is also a minority of Europeans, mostly descending from immigrants from Germany and Great Britain. Syrians and Lebanese form one of the most influential ethnic groups in not only Kingston, but the entire island. Though a minority ethnic group, the Lebanese were able to give Jamaica one of its prime ministers, Edward Philip George Seaga. There is a strong undercurrent of bias based on skin color as darker skinned Jamaicans are usually at the very bottom of the socio-economic ladder; a phenomenon evidenced by the disproportionate representation of foreigners and mixed-race individuals in lucrative private sector and government positions. Multi-racial Jamaicans continue to form the second largest racial group, and there is also a small Jewish population in the city.\n79.2% Black\n12.8% Multiracial\n5.2% Asian\n3.4% White\n\n\n== Religion ==\nThere is a wide variety of Christian churches in the city, most of which are Protestant. The chief denominations are Church of God, Baptist, Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal.\nThere is a strong Roman Catholic community, with the Holy Trinity Cathedral which is the seat of metropolitan archbishop and was consecrated in 1911, as well a few Catholic schools and institutions such as the Immaculate Conception High School, St Francis Primary and Infant School, Holy Childhood High School which was founded and is owned by the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of our Lady of Perpetual Help (FMS) in Jamaica.\nAfro-Christian syncretic religions such as the Rastafari movement also have a significant following.\nThe Shaare Shalom Synagogue serves Kingston's Jewish population. The city also has communities of Buddhists and Muslims. The Islamic Council of Jamaica and the Islamic Education and Dawah Centre are both located in Kingston. There are three units of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nKingston plays a central role in Jamaica's economy. The vast majority of economic activity takes place within Kingston, and as most government ministries are located in the city, it is a key force in legislation in regards to Jamaica's finances. The high population density of the capital city means that the majority of monetary transactions occur in Kingston - stimulating much of Jamaica's local economy. The city is also home to the highest number of schools, hospitals and universities anywhere in Jamaica. Kingston is also the island's main transportation hub and its largest seaport.Many multinational conglomerates and financial institutions are headquartered in and around the Kingston Metropolitan Area. Air Jamaica was headquartered in Kingston. The idea of making Jamaica an International Financial Centre has also been proposed as a way to boost the city's financial sector and create more jobs, especially for professionals such as accountants and lawyers.The city's major industries include tourism, apparel manufacturing, and shipping. Many international exports are traded through the city's seaport, with major exports including bauxite, sugar and coffee. The city is also a major tourist destination, and tourism is one of its largest sources of economic activity. The city has suffered economic troubles recently, however, along with the rest of the country of Jamaica. Plans to help the city's economy have made downtown Kingston the subject of numerous redevelopment plans. There have also been attempts to grow the manufacturing industry in the area and to attract call centres to the city.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nKingston is surrounded by the Blue Mountains, Red Hills, Long Mountain and the Kingston Harbour. The city is on the Liguanea plain, an alluvial plain alongside the Hope River. Kingston experiences frequent earthquakes, including the 1907 earthquake.\nKingston has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical wet-and-dry climate (Aw), that borders on a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). characterised by a wet season from May to November, which coincides with the hurricane season, and a dry season from December to April. During the dry season, there is not much rainfall, however, cold and stationary fronts occur at this time, and often bring heavy showers, especially in March. Kingston is in the rain shadow of the Blue Mountains; therefore, little to none of the moisture carried by the Northeast Trade Winds falls over Kingston, causing Kingston to be very dry in comparison to Portland and Saint Mary on the windward side of the Blue Mountains. Kingston is on a coastal location, hence it comes under the influence of the sea, though dense urban development can negate this effect. In the 21st century, Kingston has experienced temperatures as high as 38.8 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) and as low as 13.4 \u00b0C (56 \u00b0F). Between 1895 and 1990, the total average rainfall was recorded at 813 mm (32.0 in), the highest monthly average rainfall recorded in October at 177 mm (7.0 in), and the lowest monthly average rainfall recorded in March at 18 mm (0.71 in). Fog, hail, thunder and tornadoes are all extremely rare.\n\n\n== Housing ==\nIn 1848 the Jamaican government expanded Kingston by constructing new homes in the west, north and east of the city. This housing became highly segregated in terms of race and class and by 1860 the majority of white elites lived on the outskirts of the city.As Kingston's population grew, existing settlements became so densely occupied that marshes in the southwest were filled in to allow the development of new housing. By 1935, continued population growth and poverty resulted in the emergence of slums in the east and west of the city. Later these areas were demolished by the government and residents were rehoused in Denham Town. This development accommodated 3,000 people, leaving more than one sixth of displaced resident homeless. Consequently, overcrowding persisted throughout the city and cramped living condition resulted in public health issues.Suburbanization also became significant and by the 1960s this residential area spread to the foothills of the Blue Mountains. Subsequently, the lack of space and continued consumerism meant this area then expanded to the east of the mountains.In Kingston, 20% of the population now live in squatter settlements. Contrastingly, Kingston is also home to Red Hills, Norbrook, Cherry Gardens, Stony Hill, Jack's Hill, suburbs that hold some of the most expensive houses in all of Jamaica.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThe city of Kingston is home to a number of urban parks which are frequently transformed to accommodate various events and festivities on the Jamaican calendar. The most popular parks include: Emancipation Park, Hope Gardens, Devon House, National Heroes' Park, St William Grant Park and Mandela Park.\n\n\n=== Emancipation Park ===\n\nThe Liguanea Club, a recreational and social club for the upper class in society, located on Knutsford Boulevard, owned over 35 acres (14 ha) of land including the former Liguanea Park now the site of Emancipation Park. The club gave the land measuring seven acres as a gift to the Jamaican Government.\nSeveral government members argued that the land should be converted into a business district, while others felt a multi-functional entertainment complex should be built on the site. The large financial input needed for either venture, was not forthcoming. In 2002 Cabinet granted approval for the transfer of the land to the National Housing Trust on the condition that a park was built and maintained at that location. The land was transferred for one Jamaican dollar.The park is well known for the 11 ft. (approximately 3m) high bronze sculpture done by Jamaican artist Laura Facey, situated at the park's main entrance. This prominent sculpture comprises two naked black male and female statues gazing to the skies \u2013 symbolic of their triumphant rise from the horrors of slavery. The statue was unveiled in July 2003, in time for the park's first anniversary which caused an out cry from the Jamaican populace who believed that the blatant nudity and generous bodily proportions of the figures were very inappropriate to depict the freedom of black people.\n\n\n=== Hope Gardens ===\nThe Royal Botanical Gardens at Hope, popularly called Hope Gardens serves as a national attraction. The Hope Gardens is a part of the 2,000 acres (809 ha) of land making it the largest botanical garden in the English-speaking Caribbean. The land situated by the foothills of the Blue Mountains was originally owned by Major Richard Hope from whom it got its name. Two hundred acres of this land was obtained by the Government of Jamaica in 1880 and was originally established as a plant introduction and crop-testing facility for plants such as pineapple, cocoa, coffee and tobacco. The formal Botanical Gardens were laid out on approximately 60 acres (24 ha) of this land with the assistance of personnel from the Kew Gardens in England.\nIn the 1950s, the Queen, after visiting the island and being pleased with the state of the gardens, gave permission for it to be called the Royal Botanical Gardens, Hope. The Gardens have many exotic species along with some endemic trees of Jamaica. Over the years, the ravages of hurricanes and other disasters have resulted in the loss of a significant number of species. However, there are still some prominent trees and popular sites to be viewed in the Gardens. At Hope Gardens, visitors can view a number of other features including the Coconut Museum, the Sunken Gardens, the Orchid House, the Lily Pond, the Maze and Palm Avenue.The Hope Gardens has an adjoining zoo referred to as Hope Gardens Zoo. The gardens and zoo are undergoing redevelopment to improve the physical landscape and the animal inventory as a part of Bring Back The Hope campaign.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe St William Grant Park (Parade) in the heart of downtown Kingston is the starting point for three of Jamaica's four A roads, namely the A1 (Kingston to Lucea), the A3 (Kingston to Saint Ann's Bay) and the A4 (Kingston to Annotto Bay), while the city itself is provided with a dense network of trunk, main, secondary and minor roads. It also consists of the Highway 2000, Jamaica which runs through Portmore, Ocho Rios and Mandeville. A new section of Highway 2000, Jamaica (called \"T3\") was recently opened to the public. It has greatly reduced the travel time between Kingston and Montego Bay from 4 hours to a mere 2 1/2 hours.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, mini buses and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.Private car ownership levels are high, and like many major urban conurbations Kingston suffers from frequent traffic jams and pollution.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nIn June 1898, the existing mule car service was phased out and a transition to electric trams, initially operated by the West India Electric Company and later by the Jamaica Public Service Company, was undertaken. This transition to the electric tram was completed on 31 March 1899. This service continued to operate, but the inflexibility of a tram service could not keep pace with a growing city, and the tram service ceased to operate on 7 August 1948.Between 1948 and 1953 a motor bus service was operated by a company called Jamaica Utilities. The government revoked its franchise in 1953.\nFrom 1953 to 1983 the Jamaica Omnibus Service operated a service, which at its peak consisted of over 600 buses and served an area spanning Spanish Town, Border, Mt. James, Bull Bay and Port Royal. It was wound up by the government in 1983 after being nationalised in 1974.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, the Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC), mini buses, and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe now disused Kingston railway station served the Kingston to Montego Bay main line with branches from Spanish Town to Ewarton, Bog Walk to Port Antonio, Linstead to New Works and May pen to Frankfield.\nThe railway station opened in 1845 and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica's railways abruptly ceased.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nKingston's international airport is Norman Manley International Airport while Tinson Pen Aerodrome provides domestic services.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\nHistorically, the Kingston waterfront was Jamaica's main port with many finger piers at which freighters and passenger liners could dock. More recently, with the containerisation of freight, the port has moved to Newport West.\n\n\n== Law enforcement ==\nJamaica's police force, the Jamaica Constabulary Force, is based on Old Hope Road near Liguanea. Smaller police stations, such as Hunt's Bay, Matilda's Corner and Half-Way-Tree, are dispersed across the Corporate Area. The Supreme Court of Jamaica is also located in Kingston. Other courts, such as the Half-Way-Tree Resident Magistrate's Court, Gun Court, Traffic Court and Family Court, make Kingston their home. The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) has its headquarters at Up Park Camp near New Kingston and Cross Roads. The JDF also operates a major naval base at Port Royal.\n\n\n=== Fire service ===\nFire response in Kingston is provided by the Jamaica Fire Brigade, the national fire service. The service operates from fire stations spread throughout the Corporate Area. Fire stations are located at \nYork Park (HQ)\nHalf-Way-Tree\nRollington Town\nPort Royal\nNorman Manley International Airport\nStony Hill\nTrench Town\nKingston Harbour (Fire Boat)\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe Gleaner Company, the Jamaica Observer and the Sunday Herald, three of Jamaica's large newspaper companies, make their home in Kingston. Several television and radio stations including Television Jamaica (TVJ), CVM TV, RJR 94 FM, TBC Radio 88.5 FM, Hitz 92 FM, FAME 95 FM, LOVE TV, ZIP 103, Kool 97 FM and LOVE FM, are all based in Kingston.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe capital is home to five association football teams who play in the Jamaican Premier League. The teams are Arnett Gardens, Boy's Town, Harbour View, Maverley Hughenden and Waterhouse F.C..\n\n\n== Telecommunications ==\n\n\n=== Fixed voice and broadband ===\nFixed voice and broadband services in Kingston are provided by either FLOW and Digicel (via their new Digicel Play service which is exclusive to the Kingston Metropolitan Area). FLOW uses a Hybrid Fibre and Coaxial network to provide IPTV, VoIP & POTS and broadband capable of speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. FLOW also uses a Copper network to provide POTS and ADSL capable of speeds up to 12 Mbit/s. Digicel uses a GPON fibre-optic network, providing IPTV, VoIP and broadband speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s. Digicel's Fibre-optic network boasts capacity of up to 10 Gbit/s.\n\n\n=== Mobile voice and broadband ===\nMobile voice and broadband services in Kingston are dominated by incumbents, FLOW & Digicel. Both carriers provide GSM, EDGE, HSPA, HSPA+ and LTE connectivity in and around the city.\nFLOW offers HSPA+ of up to 21 Mbit/s on 850 MHz and 1900 MHz. FLOW also offers DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 1900 MHz spectrum.\nDigicel also offers 21 Mbit/s HSPA+ however, they also offer DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 850 MHz spectrum. Digicel was also first to market with LTE in Jamaica. Their network covers all of Kingston Parish and most of the populous areas in the Kingston Metropolitan Area, capable of speeds of up to 75 Mbit/s on 10 MHz of Band 17 spectrum.\nFLOW also offers LTE in Kingston. FLOW's LTE network is accessible on Band 4 or AWS spectrum. Due to the network delaying its rollout to acquire more spectrum, its network is theoretically faster than both Digicel and Caricel, to the tune of 150 Mbit/s (20 MHz of Bandwidth) with further plans to add low band spectrum, possibly increasing theoretical speeds up to 225 Mbit/s.\nKingston is also home to Caricel, Jamaica's newest telecoms operator, which deployed its LTE network first to the Kingston Metropolitan Area.\nIn addition, both carriers have their Jamaican head offices in the city (with the exception of Digicel, which has its company headquarters in Kingston rather than a regional office there as is the case with FLOW, which is based in Miami).\n\n\n== Postal service ==\nPostal services in Kingston and throughout the island are provided by the Postal Corporation of Jamaica, the national post office of Jamaica. Services include domestic and international mail delivery, post office boxes, registered mail, priority mail (local courier), parcel delivery, express mail service (international courier), advertising mail and provision of post office boxes.\nKingston is divided in several postal zones enumerated as follows;\n\n\n== Institutions ==\nKingston, as the capital, is the financial, cultural, economic and industrial centre of Jamaica. Many financial institutions are based in Kingston, and the city boasts the largest number of hospitals, schools, universities and cultural attractions of any urban area on the island. Notable Kingston landmarks include the University of the West Indies, Jamaica Defence Force Museum, and Bob Marley Museum. A United Nations agency, the International Seabed Authority is headquartered in Kingston.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\nKingston is twinned with:\n\n Miami, Florida, United States\n Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States\n Topeka, Kansas, United States\n Gibraltar, Gibraltar, United Kingdom\n Coventry, England, United Kingdom\n Guadalajara, Mexico\n Shenzhen, People's Republic of China:\n Panev\u0117\u017eys, Lithuania\n Windhoek, Namibia\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of metropolitan areas in the West Indies\nRoy Anthony Bridge\nTrenchtown\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKingston & St Andrew Corporation website",

          "I have family in Jamaica but I rarely do any tourist stuff. Due to being in Kingston I popped in not knowing what I would find. Have to say I was shocked and proud of the heritage of Jamaica. I learnt a bit and would recommend to anyone to visit it.",

        "wiki": "Kingston is the capital and largest city of Jamaica, located on the southeastern coast of the island. It faces a natural harbour protected by the Palisadoes, a long sand spit which connects the town of Port Royal and the Norman Manley International Airport to the rest of the island. In the Americas, Kingston is the largest predominantly English-speaking city south of the United States.\nThe local government bodies of the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew were amalgamated by the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation Act of 1923, to form the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC). Greater Kingston, or the \"Corporate Area\" refers to those areas under the KSAC; however, it does not solely refer to Kingston Parish, which only consists of the old downtown and Port Royal. Kingston Parish had a population of 96,052, and St. Andrew Parish had a population of 555,828 in 2001. Kingston is only bordered by Saint Andrew to the east, west and north. The geographical border for the parish of Kingston encompasses the following communities: Tivoli Gardens, Denham Town, Rae Town, Kingston Gardens, National Heroes Park, Bournemouth Gardens, Norman Gardens, Rennock Lodge, Springfield and Port Royal, along with portions of Rollington Town, Franklyn Town and Allman Town.The city proper is bounded by Six Miles to the west, Stony Hill to the north, Papine to the northeast and Harbour View to the east, which are communities in urban and suburban Saint Andrew. Communities in rural St. Andrew such as Gordon Town, Mavis Bank, Lawrence Tavern, Mt. Airy and Bull Bay would not be described as being in Kingston city.\nTwo districts make up the central area of Kingston: the historic Downtown, and New Kingston. Both are served by Norman Manley International Airport and also by the smaller and primarily domestic Tinson Pen Aerodrome.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKingston was founded in July 1693 after the earthquake that devastated Port Royal in 1692, the original section of the city which was situated at the bottom of the Liguanea Plains was laid out to house survivors of the earthquake. Before the earthquake, Kingston's functions were purely agricultural. The earthquake survivors set up a camp on the sea front. Approximately two thousand people died due to mosquito-borne diseases. Initially the people lived in a tented camp on Colonel Barry's Hog Crawle. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by fire in 1703. Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. The new grid system of the town was designed to facilitate commerce, particularly the system of main thoroughfares 66 feet (20 m) across, which allowed transportation between the port and plantations farther inland. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the centre of trade for Jamaica.\nThe government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in Port Royal, and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of Liguanea.\nThe first free school, Wolmers's, was founded in 1729 and there was a theatre, first on Harbour Street and then moved in 1774 to North Parade. Both are still in existence. In 1755 the governor, Sir Charles Knowles, had decided to transfer the government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston.\nBy the end of the 18th century, the city contained more than 3,000 brick buildings. The harbour fostered trade, and played part in several naval wars of the 18th century. Kingston took over the functions of Spanish Town (the capital at the time). These functions included agriculture, commercial, processing and a main transport hub to and from Kingston and other sections of the island. In 1788, Kingston had a population of 25,000, which was about a tenth of the overall population of the island. One in every four people living in Kingston was white, and there was a large population of free people of color there too, meaning that two out of every five people living in Kingston were free. The remaining three-fifths of Kingston's population was made up of black slaves.The government passed an act to transfer the government offices to Kingston from Spanish Town, which occurred in 1872. It kept this status when the island was granted independence in 1962.\n\nIn 1907, 800 people died in another earthquake known as the 1907 Kingston earthquake, destroying nearly all the historical buildings south of Parade in the city. That was when a restriction of no more than 60 feet (18 m) was instituted on buildings in the city centre. These three-story-high buildings were built with reinforced concrete. Construction on King Street in the city was the first area to breach this building code.\nDuring the 1930s, island-wide riots led to the development of trade unions and political parties to represent workers.\nThe city became home to the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies founded in 1948, with 24 medical students.\nNot until the 1960s did major change occur in the development of Kingston's city centre. The international attention of reggae music at that time coincided with the expansion and development of 95 acres (38 ha) of the Kingston city centre waterfront area. These developments led to an influx of shops and offices, and the development of a new financial centre: New Kingston, which replaced the Knutsford Racetrack. Multi-story buildings and boulevards were placed within that section.\nIn 1966 Kingston was the host city to the Commonwealth Games.\nThe western section of the city was not the focus of development, and that area proved to be politically tense. The 1970s saw deteriorating economic conditions that led to recurrent violence and a decline in tourism which later affected the island.\n\nIn the 1980 general elections, the democratic socialist People's National Party (PNP) government was voted out, and subsequent governments have been more market-oriented. Within a global urban era, the 1990s saw that Kingston has made efforts to modernise and develop its city structure and functions. Various organisations such as the Kingston Restoration Company, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), the Port Authority of Jamaica and the Port Royal Development Company, among others sought to develop the urban structure of the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe majority of the population of Kingston is of African descent. Large minority ethnic groups include East Indians and Chinese, who came to the country as indentured servants in the late 19th century. The Chinese occupy important roles in Jamaica's economy especially in the retail markets in Downtown Kingston and the wider metropolitan area. There is also a minority of Europeans, mostly descending from immigrants from Germany and Great Britain. Syrians and Lebanese form one of the most influential ethnic groups in not only Kingston, but the entire island. Though a minority ethnic group, the Lebanese were able to give Jamaica one of its prime ministers, Edward Philip George Seaga. There is a strong undercurrent of bias based on skin color as darker skinned Jamaicans are usually at the very bottom of the socio-economic ladder; a phenomenon evidenced by the disproportionate representation of foreigners and mixed-race individuals in lucrative private sector and government positions. Multi-racial Jamaicans continue to form the second largest racial group, and there is also a small Jewish population in the city.\n79.2% Black\n12.8% Multiracial\n5.2% Asian\n3.4% White\n\n\n== Religion ==\nThere is a wide variety of Christian churches in the city, most of which are Protestant. The chief denominations are Church of God, Baptist, Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal.\nThere is a strong Roman Catholic community, with the Holy Trinity Cathedral which is the seat of metropolitan archbishop and was consecrated in 1911, as well a few Catholic schools and institutions such as the Immaculate Conception High School, St Francis Primary and Infant School, Holy Childhood High School which was founded and is owned by the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of our Lady of Perpetual Help (FMS) in Jamaica.\nAfro-Christian syncretic religions such as the Rastafari movement also have a significant following.\nThe Shaare Shalom Synagogue serves Kingston's Jewish population. The city also has communities of Buddhists and Muslims. The Islamic Council of Jamaica and the Islamic Education and Dawah Centre are both located in Kingston. There are three units of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nKingston plays a central role in Jamaica's economy. The vast majority of economic activity takes place within Kingston, and as most government ministries are located in the city, it is a key force in legislation in regards to Jamaica's finances. The high population density of the capital city means that the majority of monetary transactions occur in Kingston - stimulating much of Jamaica's local economy. The city is also home to the highest number of schools, hospitals and universities anywhere in Jamaica. Kingston is also the island's main transportation hub and its largest seaport.Many multinational conglomerates and financial institutions are headquartered in and around the Kingston Metropolitan Area. Air Jamaica was headquartered in Kingston. The idea of making Jamaica an International Financial Centre has also been proposed as a way to boost the city's financial sector and create more jobs, especially for professionals such as accountants and lawyers.The city's major industries include tourism, apparel manufacturing, and shipping. Many international exports are traded through the city's seaport, with major exports including bauxite, sugar and coffee. The city is also a major tourist destination, and tourism is one of its largest sources of economic activity. The city has suffered economic troubles recently, however, along with the rest of the country of Jamaica. Plans to help the city's economy have made downtown Kingston the subject of numerous redevelopment plans. There have also been attempts to grow the manufacturing industry in the area and to attract call centres to the city.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nKingston is surrounded by the Blue Mountains, Red Hills, Long Mountain and the Kingston Harbour. The city is on the Liguanea plain, an alluvial plain alongside the Hope River. Kingston experiences frequent earthquakes, including the 1907 earthquake.\nKingston has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical wet-and-dry climate (Aw), that borders on a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). characterised by a wet season from May to November, which coincides with the hurricane season, and a dry season from December to April. During the dry season, there is not much rainfall, however, cold and stationary fronts occur at this time, and often bring heavy showers, especially in March. Kingston is in the rain shadow of the Blue Mountains; therefore, little to none of the moisture carried by the Northeast Trade Winds falls over Kingston, causing Kingston to be very dry in comparison to Portland and Saint Mary on the windward side of the Blue Mountains. Kingston is on a coastal location, hence it comes under the influence of the sea, though dense urban development can negate this effect. In the 21st century, Kingston has experienced temperatures as high as 38.8 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) and as low as 13.4 \u00b0C (56 \u00b0F). Between 1895 and 1990, the total average rainfall was recorded at 813 mm (32.0 in), the highest monthly average rainfall recorded in October at 177 mm (7.0 in), and the lowest monthly average rainfall recorded in March at 18 mm (0.71 in). Fog, hail, thunder and tornadoes are all extremely rare.\n\n\n== Housing ==\nIn 1848 the Jamaican government expanded Kingston by constructing new homes in the west, north and east of the city. This housing became highly segregated in terms of race and class and by 1860 the majority of white elites lived on the outskirts of the city.As Kingston's population grew, existing settlements became so densely occupied that marshes in the southwest were filled in to allow the development of new housing. By 1935, continued population growth and poverty resulted in the emergence of slums in the east and west of the city. Later these areas were demolished by the government and residents were rehoused in Denham Town. This development accommodated 3,000 people, leaving more than one sixth of displaced resident homeless. Consequently, overcrowding persisted throughout the city and cramped living condition resulted in public health issues.Suburbanization also became significant and by the 1960s this residential area spread to the foothills of the Blue Mountains. Subsequently, the lack of space and continued consumerism meant this area then expanded to the east of the mountains.In Kingston, 20% of the population now live in squatter settlements. Contrastingly, Kingston is also home to Red Hills, Norbrook, Cherry Gardens, Stony Hill, Jack's Hill, suburbs that hold some of the most expensive houses in all of Jamaica.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThe city of Kingston is home to a number of urban parks which are frequently transformed to accommodate various events and festivities on the Jamaican calendar. The most popular parks include: Emancipation Park, Hope Gardens, Devon House, National Heroes' Park, St William Grant Park and Mandela Park.\n\n\n=== Emancipation Park ===\n\nThe Liguanea Club, a recreational and social club for the upper class in society, located on Knutsford Boulevard, owned over 35 acres (14 ha) of land including the former Liguanea Park now the site of Emancipation Park. The club gave the land measuring seven acres as a gift to the Jamaican Government.\nSeveral government members argued that the land should be converted into a business district, while others felt a multi-functional entertainment complex should be built on the site. The large financial input needed for either venture, was not forthcoming. In 2002 Cabinet granted approval for the transfer of the land to the National Housing Trust on the condition that a park was built and maintained at that location. The land was transferred for one Jamaican dollar.The park is well known for the 11 ft. (approximately 3m) high bronze sculpture done by Jamaican artist Laura Facey, situated at the park's main entrance. This prominent sculpture comprises two naked black male and female statues gazing to the skies \u2013 symbolic of their triumphant rise from the horrors of slavery. The statue was unveiled in July 2003, in time for the park's first anniversary which caused an out cry from the Jamaican populace who believed that the blatant nudity and generous bodily proportions of the figures were very inappropriate to depict the freedom of black people.\n\n\n=== Hope Gardens ===\nThe Royal Botanical Gardens at Hope, popularly called Hope Gardens serves as a national attraction. The Hope Gardens is a part of the 2,000 acres (809 ha) of land making it the largest botanical garden in the English-speaking Caribbean. The land situated by the foothills of the Blue Mountains was originally owned by Major Richard Hope from whom it got its name. Two hundred acres of this land was obtained by the Government of Jamaica in 1880 and was originally established as a plant introduction and crop-testing facility for plants such as pineapple, cocoa, coffee and tobacco. The formal Botanical Gardens were laid out on approximately 60 acres (24 ha) of this land with the assistance of personnel from the Kew Gardens in England.\nIn the 1950s, the Queen, after visiting the island and being pleased with the state of the gardens, gave permission for it to be called the Royal Botanical Gardens, Hope. The Gardens have many exotic species along with some endemic trees of Jamaica. Over the years, the ravages of hurricanes and other disasters have resulted in the loss of a significant number of species. However, there are still some prominent trees and popular sites to be viewed in the Gardens. At Hope Gardens, visitors can view a number of other features including the Coconut Museum, the Sunken Gardens, the Orchid House, the Lily Pond, the Maze and Palm Avenue.The Hope Gardens has an adjoining zoo referred to as Hope Gardens Zoo. The gardens and zoo are undergoing redevelopment to improve the physical landscape and the animal inventory as a part of Bring Back The Hope campaign.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe St William Grant Park (Parade) in the heart of downtown Kingston is the starting point for three of Jamaica's four A roads, namely the A1 (Kingston to Lucea), the A3 (Kingston to Saint Ann's Bay) and the A4 (Kingston to Annotto Bay), while the city itself is provided with a dense network of trunk, main, secondary and minor roads. It also consists of the Highway 2000, Jamaica which runs through Portmore, Ocho Rios and Mandeville. A new section of Highway 2000, Jamaica (called \"T3\") was recently opened to the public. It has greatly reduced the travel time between Kingston and Montego Bay from 4 hours to a mere 2 1/2 hours.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, mini buses and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.Private car ownership levels are high, and like many major urban conurbations Kingston suffers from frequent traffic jams and pollution.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nIn June 1898, the existing mule car service was phased out and a transition to electric trams, initially operated by the West India Electric Company and later by the Jamaica Public Service Company, was undertaken. This transition to the electric tram was completed on 31 March 1899. This service continued to operate, but the inflexibility of a tram service could not keep pace with a growing city, and the tram service ceased to operate on 7 August 1948.Between 1948 and 1953 a motor bus service was operated by a company called Jamaica Utilities. The government revoked its franchise in 1953.\nFrom 1953 to 1983 the Jamaica Omnibus Service operated a service, which at its peak consisted of over 600 buses and served an area spanning Spanish Town, Border, Mt. James, Bull Bay and Port Royal. It was wound up by the government in 1983 after being nationalised in 1974.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, the Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC), mini buses, and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe now disused Kingston railway station served the Kingston to Montego Bay main line with branches from Spanish Town to Ewarton, Bog Walk to Port Antonio, Linstead to New Works and May pen to Frankfield.\nThe railway station opened in 1845 and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica's railways abruptly ceased.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nKingston's international airport is Norman Manley International Airport while Tinson Pen Aerodrome provides domestic services.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\nHistorically, the Kingston waterfront was Jamaica's main port with many finger piers at which freighters and passenger liners could dock. More recently, with the containerisation of freight, the port has moved to Newport West.\n\n\n== Law enforcement ==\nJamaica's police force, the Jamaica Constabulary Force, is based on Old Hope Road near Liguanea. Smaller police stations, such as Hunt's Bay, Matilda's Corner and Half-Way-Tree, are dispersed across the Corporate Area. The Supreme Court of Jamaica is also located in Kingston. Other courts, such as the Half-Way-Tree Resident Magistrate's Court, Gun Court, Traffic Court and Family Court, make Kingston their home. The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) has its headquarters at Up Park Camp near New Kingston and Cross Roads. The JDF also operates a major naval base at Port Royal.\n\n\n=== Fire service ===\nFire response in Kingston is provided by the Jamaica Fire Brigade, the national fire service. The service operates from fire stations spread throughout the Corporate Area. Fire stations are located at \nYork Park (HQ)\nHalf-Way-Tree\nRollington Town\nPort Royal\nNorman Manley International Airport\nStony Hill\nTrench Town\nKingston Harbour (Fire Boat)\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe Gleaner Company, the Jamaica Observer and the Sunday Herald, three of Jamaica's large newspaper companies, make their home in Kingston. Several television and radio stations including Television Jamaica (TVJ), CVM TV, RJR 94 FM, TBC Radio 88.5 FM, Hitz 92 FM, FAME 95 FM, LOVE TV, ZIP 103, Kool 97 FM and LOVE FM, are all based in Kingston.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe capital is home to five association football teams who play in the Jamaican Premier League. The teams are Arnett Gardens, Boy's Town, Harbour View, Maverley Hughenden and Waterhouse F.C..\n\n\n== Telecommunications ==\n\n\n=== Fixed voice and broadband ===\nFixed voice and broadband services in Kingston are provided by either FLOW and Digicel (via their new Digicel Play service which is exclusive to the Kingston Metropolitan Area). FLOW uses a Hybrid Fibre and Coaxial network to provide IPTV, VoIP & POTS and broadband capable of speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. FLOW also uses a Copper network to provide POTS and ADSL capable of speeds up to 12 Mbit/s. Digicel uses a GPON fibre-optic network, providing IPTV, VoIP and broadband speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s. Digicel's Fibre-optic network boasts capacity of up to 10 Gbit/s.\n\n\n=== Mobile voice and broadband ===\nMobile voice and broadband services in Kingston are dominated by incumbents, FLOW & Digicel. Both carriers provide GSM, EDGE, HSPA, HSPA+ and LTE connectivity in and around the city.\nFLOW offers HSPA+ of up to 21 Mbit/s on 850 MHz and 1900 MHz. FLOW also offers DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 1900 MHz spectrum.\nDigicel also offers 21 Mbit/s HSPA+ however, they also offer DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 850 MHz spectrum. Digicel was also first to market with LTE in Jamaica. Their network covers all of Kingston Parish and most of the populous areas in the Kingston Metropolitan Area, capable of speeds of up to 75 Mbit/s on 10 MHz of Band 17 spectrum.\nFLOW also offers LTE in Kingston. FLOW's LTE network is accessible on Band 4 or AWS spectrum. Due to the network delaying its rollout to acquire more spectrum, its network is theoretically faster than both Digicel and Caricel, to the tune of 150 Mbit/s (20 MHz of Bandwidth) with further plans to add low band spectrum, possibly increasing theoretical speeds up to 225 Mbit/s.\nKingston is also home to Caricel, Jamaica's newest telecoms operator, which deployed its LTE network first to the Kingston Metropolitan Area.\nIn addition, both carriers have their Jamaican head offices in the city (with the exception of Digicel, which has its company headquarters in Kingston rather than a regional office there as is the case with FLOW, which is based in Miami).\n\n\n== Postal service ==\nPostal services in Kingston and throughout the island are provided by the Postal Corporation of Jamaica, the national post office of Jamaica. Services include domestic and international mail delivery, post office boxes, registered mail, priority mail (local courier), parcel delivery, express mail service (international courier), advertising mail and provision of post office boxes.\nKingston is divided in several postal zones enumerated as follows;\n\n\n== Institutions ==\nKingston, as the capital, is the financial, cultural, economic and industrial centre of Jamaica. Many financial institutions are based in Kingston, and the city boasts the largest number of hospitals, schools, universities and cultural attractions of any urban area on the island. Notable Kingston landmarks include the University of the West Indies, Jamaica Defence Force Museum, and Bob Marley Museum. A United Nations agency, the International Seabed Authority is headquartered in Kingston.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\nKingston is twinned with:\n\n Miami, Florida, United States\n Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States\n Topeka, Kansas, United States\n Gibraltar, Gibraltar, United Kingdom\n Coventry, England, United Kingdom\n Guadalajara, Mexico\n Shenzhen, People's Republic of China:\n Panev\u0117\u017eys, Lithuania\n Windhoek, Namibia\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of metropolitan areas in the West Indies\nRoy Anthony Bridge\nTrenchtown\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKingston & St Andrew Corporation website",

        "wiki": "Kingston is the capital and largest city of Jamaica, located on the southeastern coast of the island. It faces a natural harbour protected by the Palisadoes, a long sand spit which connects the town of Port Royal and the Norman Manley International Airport to the rest of the island. In the Americas, Kingston is the largest predominantly English-speaking city south of the United States.\nThe local government bodies of the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew were amalgamated by the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation Act of 1923, to form the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC). Greater Kingston, or the \"Corporate Area\" refers to those areas under the KSAC; however, it does not solely refer to Kingston Parish, which only consists of the old downtown and Port Royal. Kingston Parish had a population of 96,052, and St. Andrew Parish had a population of 555,828 in 2001. Kingston is only bordered by Saint Andrew to the east, west and north. The geographical border for the parish of Kingston encompasses the following communities: Tivoli Gardens, Denham Town, Rae Town, Kingston Gardens, National Heroes Park, Bournemouth Gardens, Norman Gardens, Rennock Lodge, Springfield and Port Royal, along with portions of Rollington Town, Franklyn Town and Allman Town.The city proper is bounded by Six Miles to the west, Stony Hill to the north, Papine to the northeast and Harbour View to the east, which are communities in urban and suburban Saint Andrew. Communities in rural St. Andrew such as Gordon Town, Mavis Bank, Lawrence Tavern, Mt. Airy and Bull Bay would not be described as being in Kingston city.\nTwo districts make up the central area of Kingston: the historic Downtown, and New Kingston. Both are served by Norman Manley International Airport and also by the smaller and primarily domestic Tinson Pen Aerodrome.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKingston was founded in July 1693 after the earthquake that devastated Port Royal in 1692, the original section of the city which was situated at the bottom of the Liguanea Plains was laid out to house survivors of the earthquake. Before the earthquake, Kingston's functions were purely agricultural. The earthquake survivors set up a camp on the sea front. Approximately two thousand people died due to mosquito-borne diseases. Initially the people lived in a tented camp on Colonel Barry's Hog Crawle. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by fire in 1703. Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. The new grid system of the town was designed to facilitate commerce, particularly the system of main thoroughfares 66 feet (20 m) across, which allowed transportation between the port and plantations farther inland. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the centre of trade for Jamaica.\nThe government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in Port Royal, and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of Liguanea.\nThe first free school, Wolmers's, was founded in 1729 and there was a theatre, first on Harbour Street and then moved in 1774 to North Parade. Both are still in existence. In 1755 the governor, Sir Charles Knowles, had decided to transfer the government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston.\nBy the end of the 18th century, the city contained more than 3,000 brick buildings. The harbour fostered trade, and played part in several naval wars of the 18th century. Kingston took over the functions of Spanish Town (the capital at the time). These functions included agriculture, commercial, processing and a main transport hub to and from Kingston and other sections of the island. In 1788, Kingston had a population of 25,000, which was about a tenth of the overall population of the island. One in every four people living in Kingston was white, and there was a large population of free people of color there too, meaning that two out of every five people living in Kingston were free. The remaining three-fifths of Kingston's population was made up of black slaves.The government passed an act to transfer the government offices to Kingston from Spanish Town, which occurred in 1872. It kept this status when the island was granted independence in 1962.\n\nIn 1907, 800 people died in another earthquake known as the 1907 Kingston earthquake, destroying nearly all the historical buildings south of Parade in the city. That was when a restriction of no more than 60 feet (18 m) was instituted on buildings in the city centre. These three-story-high buildings were built with reinforced concrete. Construction on King Street in the city was the first area to breach this building code.\nDuring the 1930s, island-wide riots led to the development of trade unions and political parties to represent workers.\nThe city became home to the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies founded in 1948, with 24 medical students.\nNot until the 1960s did major change occur in the development of Kingston's city centre. The international attention of reggae music at that time coincided with the expansion and development of 95 acres (38 ha) of the Kingston city centre waterfront area. These developments led to an influx of shops and offices, and the development of a new financial centre: New Kingston, which replaced the Knutsford Racetrack. Multi-story buildings and boulevards were placed within that section.\nIn 1966 Kingston was the host city to the Commonwealth Games.\nThe western section of the city was not the focus of development, and that area proved to be politically tense. The 1970s saw deteriorating economic conditions that led to recurrent violence and a decline in tourism which later affected the island.\n\nIn the 1980 general elections, the democratic socialist People's National Party (PNP) government was voted out, and subsequent governments have been more market-oriented. Within a global urban era, the 1990s saw that Kingston has made efforts to modernise and develop its city structure and functions. Various organisations such as the Kingston Restoration Company, the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), the Port Authority of Jamaica and the Port Royal Development Company, among others sought to develop the urban structure of the city.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe majority of the population of Kingston is of African descent. Large minority ethnic groups include East Indians and Chinese, who came to the country as indentured servants in the late 19th century. The Chinese occupy important roles in Jamaica's economy especially in the retail markets in Downtown Kingston and the wider metropolitan area. There is also a minority of Europeans, mostly descending from immigrants from Germany and Great Britain. Syrians and Lebanese form one of the most influential ethnic groups in not only Kingston, but the entire island. Though a minority ethnic group, the Lebanese were able to give Jamaica one of its prime ministers, Edward Philip George Seaga. There is a strong undercurrent of bias based on skin color as darker skinned Jamaicans are usually at the very bottom of the socio-economic ladder; a phenomenon evidenced by the disproportionate representation of foreigners and mixed-race individuals in lucrative private sector and government positions. Multi-racial Jamaicans continue to form the second largest racial group, and there is also a small Jewish population in the city.\n79.2% Black\n12.8% Multiracial\n5.2% Asian\n3.4% White\n\n\n== Religion ==\nThere is a wide variety of Christian churches in the city, most of which are Protestant. The chief denominations are Church of God, Baptist, Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal.\nThere is a strong Roman Catholic community, with the Holy Trinity Cathedral which is the seat of metropolitan archbishop and was consecrated in 1911, as well a few Catholic schools and institutions such as the Immaculate Conception High School, St Francis Primary and Infant School, Holy Childhood High School which was founded and is owned by the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of our Lady of Perpetual Help (FMS) in Jamaica.\nAfro-Christian syncretic religions such as the Rastafari movement also have a significant following.\nThe Shaare Shalom Synagogue serves Kingston's Jewish population. The city also has communities of Buddhists and Muslims. The Islamic Council of Jamaica and the Islamic Education and Dawah Centre are both located in Kingston. There are three units of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nKingston plays a central role in Jamaica's economy. The vast majority of economic activity takes place within Kingston, and as most government ministries are located in the city, it is a key force in legislation in regards to Jamaica's finances. The high population density of the capital city means that the majority of monetary transactions occur in Kingston - stimulating much of Jamaica's local economy. The city is also home to the highest number of schools, hospitals and universities anywhere in Jamaica. Kingston is also the island's main transportation hub and its largest seaport.Many multinational conglomerates and financial institutions are headquartered in and around the Kingston Metropolitan Area. Air Jamaica was headquartered in Kingston. The idea of making Jamaica an International Financial Centre has also been proposed as a way to boost the city's financial sector and create more jobs, especially for professionals such as accountants and lawyers.The city's major industries include tourism, apparel manufacturing, and shipping. Many international exports are traded through the city's seaport, with major exports including bauxite, sugar and coffee. The city is also a major tourist destination, and tourism is one of its largest sources of economic activity. The city has suffered economic troubles recently, however, along with the rest of the country of Jamaica. Plans to help the city's economy have made downtown Kingston the subject of numerous redevelopment plans. There have also been attempts to grow the manufacturing industry in the area and to attract call centres to the city.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nKingston is surrounded by the Blue Mountains, Red Hills, Long Mountain and the Kingston Harbour. The city is on the Liguanea plain, an alluvial plain alongside the Hope River. Kingston experiences frequent earthquakes, including the 1907 earthquake.\nKingston has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical wet-and-dry climate (Aw), that borders on a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). characterised by a wet season from May to November, which coincides with the hurricane season, and a dry season from December to April. During the dry season, there is not much rainfall, however, cold and stationary fronts occur at this time, and often bring heavy showers, especially in March. Kingston is in the rain shadow of the Blue Mountains; therefore, little to none of the moisture carried by the Northeast Trade Winds falls over Kingston, causing Kingston to be very dry in comparison to Portland and Saint Mary on the windward side of the Blue Mountains. Kingston is on a coastal location, hence it comes under the influence of the sea, though dense urban development can negate this effect. In the 21st century, Kingston has experienced temperatures as high as 38.8 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) and as low as 13.4 \u00b0C (56 \u00b0F). Between 1895 and 1990, the total average rainfall was recorded at 813 mm (32.0 in), the highest monthly average rainfall recorded in October at 177 mm (7.0 in), and the lowest monthly average rainfall recorded in March at 18 mm (0.71 in). Fog, hail, thunder and tornadoes are all extremely rare.\n\n\n== Housing ==\nIn 1848 the Jamaican government expanded Kingston by constructing new homes in the west, north and east of the city. This housing became highly segregated in terms of race and class and by 1860 the majority of white elites lived on the outskirts of the city.As Kingston's population grew, existing settlements became so densely occupied that marshes in the southwest were filled in to allow the development of new housing. By 1935, continued population growth and poverty resulted in the emergence of slums in the east and west of the city. Later these areas were demolished by the government and residents were rehoused in Denham Town. This development accommodated 3,000 people, leaving more than one sixth of displaced resident homeless. Consequently, overcrowding persisted throughout the city and cramped living condition resulted in public health issues.Suburbanization also became significant and by the 1960s this residential area spread to the foothills of the Blue Mountains. Subsequently, the lack of space and continued consumerism meant this area then expanded to the east of the mountains.In Kingston, 20% of the population now live in squatter settlements. Contrastingly, Kingston is also home to Red Hills, Norbrook, Cherry Gardens, Stony Hill, Jack's Hill, suburbs that hold some of the most expensive houses in all of Jamaica.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nThe city of Kingston is home to a number of urban parks which are frequently transformed to accommodate various events and festivities on the Jamaican calendar. The most popular parks include: Emancipation Park, Hope Gardens, Devon House, National Heroes' Park, St William Grant Park and Mandela Park.\n\n\n=== Emancipation Park ===\n\nThe Liguanea Club, a recreational and social club for the upper class in society, located on Knutsford Boulevard, owned over 35 acres (14 ha) of land including the former Liguanea Park now the site of Emancipation Park. The club gave the land measuring seven acres as a gift to the Jamaican Government.\nSeveral government members argued that the land should be converted into a business district, while others felt a multi-functional entertainment complex should be built on the site. The large financial input needed for either venture, was not forthcoming. In 2002 Cabinet granted approval for the transfer of the land to the National Housing Trust on the condition that a park was built and maintained at that location. The land was transferred for one Jamaican dollar.The park is well known for the 11 ft. (approximately 3m) high bronze sculpture done by Jamaican artist Laura Facey, situated at the park's main entrance. This prominent sculpture comprises two naked black male and female statues gazing to the skies \u2013 symbolic of their triumphant rise from the horrors of slavery. The statue was unveiled in July 2003, in time for the park's first anniversary which caused an out cry from the Jamaican populace who believed that the blatant nudity and generous bodily proportions of the figures were very inappropriate to depict the freedom of black people.\n\n\n=== Hope Gardens ===\nThe Royal Botanical Gardens at Hope, popularly called Hope Gardens serves as a national attraction. The Hope Gardens is a part of the 2,000 acres (809 ha) of land making it the largest botanical garden in the English-speaking Caribbean. The land situated by the foothills of the Blue Mountains was originally owned by Major Richard Hope from whom it got its name. Two hundred acres of this land was obtained by the Government of Jamaica in 1880 and was originally established as a plant introduction and crop-testing facility for plants such as pineapple, cocoa, coffee and tobacco. The formal Botanical Gardens were laid out on approximately 60 acres (24 ha) of this land with the assistance of personnel from the Kew Gardens in England.\nIn the 1950s, the Queen, after visiting the island and being pleased with the state of the gardens, gave permission for it to be called the Royal Botanical Gardens, Hope. The Gardens have many exotic species along with some endemic trees of Jamaica. Over the years, the ravages of hurricanes and other disasters have resulted in the loss of a significant number of species. However, there are still some prominent trees and popular sites to be viewed in the Gardens. At Hope Gardens, visitors can view a number of other features including the Coconut Museum, the Sunken Gardens, the Orchid House, the Lily Pond, the Maze and Palm Avenue.The Hope Gardens has an adjoining zoo referred to as Hope Gardens Zoo. The gardens and zoo are undergoing redevelopment to improve the physical landscape and the animal inventory as a part of Bring Back The Hope campaign.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe St William Grant Park (Parade) in the heart of downtown Kingston is the starting point for three of Jamaica's four A roads, namely the A1 (Kingston to Lucea), the A3 (Kingston to Saint Ann's Bay) and the A4 (Kingston to Annotto Bay), while the city itself is provided with a dense network of trunk, main, secondary and minor roads. It also consists of the Highway 2000, Jamaica which runs through Portmore, Ocho Rios and Mandeville. A new section of Highway 2000, Jamaica (called \"T3\") was recently opened to the public. It has greatly reduced the travel time between Kingston and Montego Bay from 4 hours to a mere 2 1/2 hours.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, mini buses and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.Private car ownership levels are high, and like many major urban conurbations Kingston suffers from frequent traffic jams and pollution.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nIn June 1898, the existing mule car service was phased out and a transition to electric trams, initially operated by the West India Electric Company and later by the Jamaica Public Service Company, was undertaken. This transition to the electric tram was completed on 31 March 1899. This service continued to operate, but the inflexibility of a tram service could not keep pace with a growing city, and the tram service ceased to operate on 7 August 1948.Between 1948 and 1953 a motor bus service was operated by a company called Jamaica Utilities. The government revoked its franchise in 1953.\nFrom 1953 to 1983 the Jamaica Omnibus Service operated a service, which at its peak consisted of over 600 buses and served an area spanning Spanish Town, Border, Mt. James, Bull Bay and Port Royal. It was wound up by the government in 1983 after being nationalised in 1974.\nKingston is served well by a modern bus system, the Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC), mini buses, and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, Cross Roads, Half Way Tree and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe now disused Kingston railway station served the Kingston to Montego Bay main line with branches from Spanish Town to Ewarton, Bog Walk to Port Antonio, Linstead to New Works and May pen to Frankfield.\nThe railway station opened in 1845 and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica's railways abruptly ceased.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nKingston's international airport is Norman Manley International Airport while Tinson Pen Aerodrome provides domestic services.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\nHistorically, the Kingston waterfront was Jamaica's main port with many finger piers at which freighters and passenger liners could dock. More recently, with the containerisation of freight, the port has moved to Newport West.\n\n\n== Law enforcement ==\nJamaica's police force, the Jamaica Constabulary Force, is based on Old Hope Road near Liguanea. Smaller police stations, such as Hunt's Bay, Matilda's Corner and Half-Way-Tree, are dispersed across the Corporate Area. The Supreme Court of Jamaica is also located in Kingston. Other courts, such as the Half-Way-Tree Resident Magistrate's Court, Gun Court, Traffic Court and Family Court, make Kingston their home. The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) has its headquarters at Up Park Camp near New Kingston and Cross Roads. The JDF also operates a major naval base at Port Royal.\n\n\n=== Fire service ===\nFire response in Kingston is provided by the Jamaica Fire Brigade, the national fire service. The service operates from fire stations spread throughout the Corporate Area. Fire stations are located at \nYork Park (HQ)\nHalf-Way-Tree\nRollington Town\nPort Royal\nNorman Manley International Airport\nStony Hill\nTrench Town\nKingston Harbour (Fire Boat)\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe Gleaner Company, the Jamaica Observer and the Sunday Herald, three of Jamaica's large newspaper companies, make their home in Kingston. Several television and radio stations including Television Jamaica (TVJ), CVM TV, RJR 94 FM, TBC Radio 88.5 FM, Hitz 92 FM, FAME 95 FM, LOVE TV, ZIP 103, Kool 97 FM and LOVE FM, are all based in Kingston.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe capital is home to five association football teams who play in the Jamaican Premier League. The teams are Arnett Gardens, Boy's Town, Harbour View, Maverley Hughenden and Waterhouse F.C..\n\n\n== Telecommunications ==\n\n\n=== Fixed voice and broadband ===\nFixed voice and broadband services in Kingston are provided by either FLOW and Digicel (via their new Digicel Play service which is exclusive to the Kingston Metropolitan Area). FLOW uses a Hybrid Fibre and Coaxial network to provide IPTV, VoIP & POTS and broadband capable of speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. FLOW also uses a Copper network to provide POTS and ADSL capable of speeds up to 12 Mbit/s. Digicel uses a GPON fibre-optic network, providing IPTV, VoIP and broadband speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s. Digicel's Fibre-optic network boasts capacity of up to 10 Gbit/s.\n\n\n=== Mobile voice and broadband ===\nMobile voice and broadband services in Kingston are dominated by incumbents, FLOW & Digicel. Both carriers provide GSM, EDGE, HSPA, HSPA+ and LTE connectivity in and around the city.\nFLOW offers HSPA+ of up to 21 Mbit/s on 850 MHz and 1900 MHz. FLOW also offers DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 1900 MHz spectrum.\nDigicel also offers 21 Mbit/s HSPA+ however, they also offer DC-HSDPA (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s on contiguous 850 MHz spectrum. Digicel was also first to market with LTE in Jamaica. Their network covers all of Kingston Parish and most of the populous areas in the Kingston Metropolitan Area, capable of speeds of up to 75 Mbit/s on 10 MHz of Band 17 spectrum.\nFLOW also offers LTE in Kingston. FLOW's LTE network is accessible on Band 4 or AWS spectrum. Due to the network delaying its rollout to acquire more spectrum, its network is theoretically faster than both Digicel and Caricel, to the tune of 150 Mbit/s (20 MHz of Bandwidth) with further plans to add low band spectrum, possibly increasing theoretical speeds up to 225 Mbit/s.\nKingston is also home to Caricel, Jamaica's newest telecoms operator, which deployed its LTE network first to the Kingston Metropolitan Area.\nIn addition, both carriers have their Jamaican head offices in the city (with the exception of Digicel, which has its company headquarters in Kingston rather than a regional office there as is the case with FLOW, which is based in Miami).\n\n\n== Postal service ==\nPostal services in Kingston and throughout the island are provided by the Postal Corporation of Jamaica, the national post office of Jamaica. Services include domestic and international mail delivery, post office boxes, registered mail, priority mail (local courier), parcel delivery, express mail service (international courier), advertising mail and provision of post office boxes.\nKingston is divided in several postal zones enumerated as follows;\n\n\n== Institutions ==\nKingston, as the capital, is the financial, cultural, economic and industrial centre of Jamaica. Many financial institutions are based in Kingston, and the city boasts the largest number of hospitals, schools, universities and cultural attractions of any urban area on the island. Notable Kingston landmarks include the University of the West Indies, Jamaica Defence Force Museum, and Bob Marley Museum. A United Nations agency, the International Seabed Authority is headquartered in Kingston.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\nKingston is twinned with:\n\n Miami, Florida, United States\n Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States\n Topeka, Kansas, United States\n Gibraltar, Gibraltar, United Kingdom\n Coventry, England, United Kingdom\n Guadalajara, Mexico\n Shenzhen, People's Republic of China:\n Panev\u0117\u017eys, Lithuania\n Windhoek, Namibia\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of metropolitan areas in the West Indies\nRoy Anthony Bridge\nTrenchtown\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKingston & St Andrew Corporation website",

        "wiki": "Kingston is a city in and the county seat of Ulster County, New York, United States. It is 91 miles (146 km) north of New York City and 59 miles (95 km) south of Albany. The city's metropolitan area is grouped with the New York metropolitan area around Manhattan by the United States Census Bureau, \nIt became New York's first capital in 1777. During the American Revolutionary War, the city was burned by the British on October 13, 1777, after the Battles of Saratoga.\nIn the 19th century, the city became an important transport hub after the discovery of natural cement in the region. It had connections to other markets through both the railroad and canal connections.\nMany of the older buildings are considered contributing as part of three historic districts, including the Stockade District uptown, the Midtown Neighborhood Broadway Corridor, and the Rondout-West Strand Historic District downtown. Each district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSuccessive cultures of humans are believed to have been settled on the land that is today Kingston for at least 13,000 years. Before colonization, the two main historic tribes on the land were the Esopus (a band of the larger Lenape tribe, also known as the Delaware) and the Mohican. The Lenape had three major dialect groups and occupied territory along the mid-Atlantic coast extending from Connecticut, through the Lower Hudson River Valley (including the southern parts of Kingston), parts of Pennsylvania, and into New Jersey on both sides of the Delaware River, and in Eastern Delaware. The exact population of the Lenape is unknown but estimated to have been around 10,000 people in 1600. In the Kingston area, the Lenape spoke a dialect called Munsee.\nThe Esopus existed peacefully with their northern Mohican neighbors, who occupied the land of Northern Kingston and into parts of present-day Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. The tribes traded, protected one another from attack, and recognized common interests for land protection. They never formed a broader, more official alliance as did some other nations in the area, such as those of the Iroquois League in New York and the Pequot in New England.\nBoth tribes lived in small communities of relatives ranging in groups from 10-100 people. They moved seasonally between camps to follow game, fish, and produce. The women developed diverse and sophisticated agricultural practices, cultivating different types of squash, maize (corn) and beans. The community enjoyed a range of many types of corn, beans, and squash, in addition to the produce the women would gather: hickory and other nuts, berries, and roots. Men hunted for large and small game, including elk, deer, rabbits, turkey, raccoons, waterfowl, and bears. They also caught fish in the rivers.\n\n\n=== Colonial history ===\nAs early as 1614, the Dutch had set up a factorij (trading post) at Ponckhockie, at the junction of the Rondout Creek and the Hudson River. They traded European goods with the Lenape and Mohican for the furs their trappers collected. The first recorded permanent settler in what would become the city of Kingston was Thomas Chambers. He came from the area of Rensselaerswyck in 1653. The new settlement was called Esopus after the local Lenape people.\nIn 1654, European settlers began buying land in what now is Kingston from the Esopus Indians, although historians believe the two cultures had drastically different conceptions of property and land use. Tension between the two cultures rose quickly as a result.\nCommon sources of friction between Dutch settlers and the Esopus included settlers' livestock trampling Indian cornfields, disputes over trade, and the adverse effects of Dutch brandy on the Native Americans. Prior to the Europeans' arrival, they had no experience with liquor. In the spring of 1658, Peter Stuyvesant, Director-General of New Amsterdam, ordered the consolidation and fortification of the settlement on high ground in what today is Uptown Kingston. The building of the defensive Stockade increased the conflicts. Tensions broke out is the Esopus Wars.In 1661 the settlement was granted a charter as a separate municipality; Stuyvesant named it Wiltwijck (Wiltwyck). It was not until 1663 that the Dutch ended the four-year conflict with the Esopus, defeating them with a coalition of Dutch settlers, Wappinger and Mohawk peoples.\nWiltwyck was one of three large Hudson River settlements in New Netherland, the other two being Beverwyck, now Albany; and New Amsterdam, now New York City. With the English seizure of New Netherland in 1664, relations between the Dutch settlers and the English soldiers garrisoned there were often strained. In 1669, the English renamed Wiltwyck as Kingston, in honor of the family seat of Governor Lovelace's mother. In 1683, citizens of Kingston petitioned the Kingston court to buy more land from the Esopus people. Officials from Ulster County maintained contact with the Esopus until 1727.Many descendants of the Esopus people who inhabited the area became remnant members of several other related, displaced tribes. Some in the diaspora are among the federally recognized Stockbridge\u2013Munsee Community, who moved from New York to Shawano County, Wisconsin; the Munsee-Delaware of the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario, Canada, established after the Revolution by the Crown for its Iroquois and other Indian allies; and the Ramapough Lenape Indian Nation (located primarily in the highland of the New York-New Jersey border area).\nIn 1777, Kingston was designated as the first capital of the state of New York. During the summer of 1777, when the New York State constitution was being written, New York City was occupied by British troops. Albany (then the second-largest settlement in New York and capital of the newly independent State of New York) was under threat of attack by the British. The seat of government was moved to Kingston, which was deemed safer.\nThe British never reached Albany, having been stopped at Saratoga, but they did reach Kingston. On October 13, 1777, the city was burned by British troops moving up river from New York City, and disembarking at the mouth of the Rondout Creek at \"Ponckhockie\". The residents of Kingston knew about the oncoming fleet. By the time the British arrived, the residents and government officials had removed to Hurley, New York. The Kingston area was largely agricultural and a major granary for the colonies at the time, so the British burned large amounts of wheat and all but one or two of the buildings. Kingston celebrates and re-enacts the 1777 burning of the city by the British every other year. (2019 is the year for the next \"burning\" of Kingston), in a citywide theatrical staging of the event that begins at the Rondout.)\nKingston was incorporated as a village on April 6, 1805. In the early 1800s, four sloops plied the river, carrying passengers and freight from Kingston to New York. By 1829, river steamers made the trip to Manhattan in a little over twelve hours, usually travelling by night. Columbus Point (now known as Kingston Point) was the river landing for Kingston, and stage lines ran from the village to the Point. The Dutch cultural influence in Kingston remained strong through the end of the nineteenth century.\n\n\n=== Rondout ===\n\nRondout was a small farming village until 1825, when construction of the Delaware and Hudson Canal from Rondout to Honesdale, Pennsylvania, attracted an influx of laborers. When they completed the canal in 1828, Rondout became an important tidewater coal terminal. Natural cement deposits were found throughout the valley, and in 1844 quarrying began in the \"Ponchockie\" section of Rondout. The Newark Lime and Cement Company shipped cement throughout the United States, a thriving business until the invention of cheaper, quicker drying Portland Cement. Workers cut and stored ice from the Hudson River each winter, keeping it in large warehouses of ice near the river. The ice would be cut in chunks and delivered to customers around the city. It was preserved in straw all year and ice chunks served as an early method of refrigeration.Large brick making factories also were built near this shipping hub. Rondout's primacy as a shipping hub ended with the advent of railroads. These lines were built through Rondout and Kingston, with stations in each place. They could also transport their loads through the city without stopping.\n\n\n=== Wilbur ===\nWilbur (aka Twaalfskill) was a hamlet upstream from Rondout, where the Twaalfskill Creek met the Rondout Creek. There was a sloop landing there. The hamlet became the center for the shipment of bluestone to lay the sidewalks of New York City.\nKingston officially became a city on May 29, 1872, with the merger of the villages of Rondout and Kingston, and the hamlet of Wilbur.\n\n\n=== Historic churches ===\n\n\n==== Old Dutch Church ====\n\nKingston is home to many historic churches. The oldest is the First Reformed Protestant Dutch Church of Kingston, which was organized in 1659. Referred to as The Old Dutch Church, it is in uptown Kingston. Many of the city's historic churches are on Wurts street (six are in one block). What is now called the Hudson Valley Wedding Chapel was built in 1867; it has been restored and is used for weddings. George Clinton, first governor of New York and fourth US vice president, is buried in the churchyard.\n\n\n==== Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church ====\nTrinity Evangelical Lutheran Church at 75 Spring Street was founded in 1842. The original church building at the corner of Hunter and Ravine streets burned to the ground in the late 1850s. The current church on Spring Street was built in 1874.\n\n\n==== St. John's Episcopal Church ====\nSt. John's Episcopal Church was named for St. John the Evangelist. It was founded in 1832, on June 24, the feast of St. John the Baptist. Therefore, both are considered patrons of the parish. Rev. Reuben Sherwood of Saugerties, New York was the first rector. The first church was built on Wall Street and opened November 24, 1835.\nIn 1926, the property was sold to the Up-to-Date clothing company. The church structure was dismantled and relocated to Albany Ave. In 1992, St. John's established \"Angel Food East\", a ministry that delivers food prepared at the church kitchen to persons in need throughout Ulster County.\n\n\n==== Church of the Holy Cross ====\nIn 1891, Lewis T. Wattson, rector of St. John's, established the Church of the Holy Cross as a mission of St. John's, to serve working-class families living near the West Shore Railroad. Many of them worked for the railroad. Holy Cross had a more Anglo-Catholic tradition and a particular mission to the poor. Since the late 20th century, given increased Latinx immigration from Mexico, Central and South America, Holy Cross/Santa Cruz has become a bilingual (Spanish/English), multicultural Episcopal parish.\n\n\n==== St. Joseph's RC ====\nSt. Joseph's Parish began in 1863 as a one-room Roman Catholic mission school to serve the children of the Wilbur area. It was founded by Father Felix Farrelly, pastor of St. Mary's Parish in Rondout. The building was later sold to the city of Kingston in 1871.In 1867, Rev. James Coyne was appointed pastor of St. Mary's in Rondout. The following year he established St. Joseph's in Kingston. He purchased the Young Men's Gymnasium on the corner of Fair and Bowery streets. The first Mass was said on September 21, 1868 by Fr. James Dougherty, an alumnus of St. Mary's parochial school. Dougherty became the first pastor of St. Joseph's parish. Fr. Dougherty is buried in St. Mary's Cemetery.\nAs the chapel was deemed too small, the parish purchased the former Kingston Armory at the corner of Wall and Main streets for use as a church. Many new Catholic immigrants had arrived in the mid-century from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe. The new church was dedicated on July 26, 1869. In 1877 Jockey Hill was made a mission of St. Joseph's. In 1962 a mission was established in Hurley.\nIn 1893, St. Joseph's Church underwent a major renovation, including the installation of the side altars. The new church front was completed in 1898. The interior was renovated in 1905.The frame building on the Bowery was adapted as a schoolhouse. This was replaced in 1905 with the acquisition of the former mansion of Judge Alton B. Parker at 1 Pearl Street, for a new St. Joseph's School and Convent. The Fair Street school building continued to be used as the parish hall until the property was sold in 1911. Also in 1911 a site for a larger school and convent was secured and 1 Pearl Street was sold. In 1943 the Sisters of St. Ursula replaced the Sisters of Charity at the school.\nIn February 1962, construction began on the current St Joseph School, which housed eight additional classrooms. Old St. Joseph School was renamed as the Msgr. Stephen Connolly Bldg. A plaque donated by the Holy Name Society in honor of Father John Broidy, the pastor who oversaw construction of the building in 1912, is installed on the right front of the building.\n\n\n== Geography and culture ==\nKingston has three recognized area neighborhoods. The Uptown Stockade Area, The Midtown Area, and The Downtown Waterfront Area. The Uptown Stockade District was the first capital of New York State. Meanwhile, the Midtown area is known for its early 20th century industries and is home to the Ulster Performing Arts Center and the historic City Hall building.\nThe downtown area, once the village of Rondout and now the Rondout-West Strand Historic District, borders the Rondout Creek and includes a recently redeveloped waterfront. The creek empties into the Hudson River through a large, protected tidal area which was the terminus of the Delaware and Hudson Canal, built to haul coal from Pennsylvania to New York City.The Rondout neighborhood is known for its artists' community and its many art galleries; in 2007 Business Week online named it as among \"America's best places for artists.\" It is also the site of a number of festivals, including the Kingston Jazz Festival and the Artists Soapbox Derby.Midtown is the largest of Kingston's neighborhoods, home to Kingston High School and both campuses of HealthAlliance Hospital, part of the Westchester Medical Center Health Network; HealthAlliance Broadway Campus (formerly The Kingston Hospital) and HealthAlliance Mary's Avenue Campus (formerly Benedictine Hospital).\nWhile the Uptown area is noted for its \"antique\" feeling, the overhangs attached to buildings along Wall and North Front streets were added to historic buildings in the late 1970s and are not authentically part of the 19th century Victorian architecture. The historic covered storefront walks, known as the Pike Plan, were recently reinforced and modernized with skylights. In the Stockade district of Uptown, many 17th century stone buildings remain. Among these is the Senate House, which was built in the 1670s and was used as the state capitol during the revolution. Many of these old buildings were burned by the British Oct. 17, 1777, and restored later. A controversial restoration of 1970s-era canopies was marred by the sudden appearance of painted red goats on planters just prior to the neighborhood's rededication. This part of the city is also the location of the Ulster County Office Building.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 8.6 square miles (22.4 km2), of which 7.3 square miles (19.0 km2) is land and 1.3 square miles (3.4 km2), or 15.03%, is water. The city is on the west bank of the Hudson River. Neighboring towns include Hurley, Saugerties, Rhinebeck, and Red Hook.\nThe city's Hasbrouck Park was created in 1920;  it includes a 45 acres (18 ha) area and includes a nature trail.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2010 census, the city had 23,887 people, 9,844 households, and 5,498 families. The population density was 3,189.5 persons per square mile (1,232.2/km2). There were 10,637 housing units at an average density of 1,446.4 houses per square mile (558.8/km2).

The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.1 males.\nThe city's median household income was $31,594, and the median family income was $41,806. Males had a median income of $31,634 versus $25,364 for females. The city's per capita income was $18,662, with 12.4% of families and 15.8% of the population below the poverty line, including 23.5% of those under age 18 and 10.3% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe Kingston Tigers are the city high school's sports teams.\nKingston Stockade FC is a men's semi-professional soccer club that competes in the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL) in the 4th division of the US soccer pyramid. Kingston Stockade FC play their home games at Dietz Stadium.In 1921, one time major league player Dutch Schirick organized a semi-professional team, the Colonels, in Kingston, New York. Major league teams would, on occasion, play exhibition games against the Kingston Colonels, and would sometimes recruit local talent. Bud Culloton became a pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe government of Kingston consists of a mayor and city council known as the Common Council. The Common Council consists of 10 members, nine of which are elected from wards while one is elected at large. The mayor is elected in a citywide vote every four years.\nSteve Noble was elected to the mayoral post in 2015.List of Mayors: \n\n\n== Education ==\nThe Kingston City School District contains seven elementary schools, two middle schools, and one high school.\nKingston High School is the city's public high schoolThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York operates Catholic schools in Ulster County. Most students at John A. Coleman Catholic High School reside within the Kingston city school district. Kingston Catholic School is also in the community.\nSt. Joseph School in Kingston had 267 students in 2007. It was originally scheduled to close in 2013. However the archdiocese reversed course and allowed it to stay open. However, in 2017 the school ultimately did close. By spring 2017 the school had 146 students. The would-be enrollment had dropped to 90 for the 2017\u20132018 school year. Kingston Catholic School acquired the newer St. Joseph building and turned it into its middle school facility. The older building was put up for sale in 2019.The Kingston Center of SUNY Ulster (KCSU) is a branch of the county's community college that offers programs, courses and certifications at a convenient Midtown location. KCSU is the new home for Police Basic Training and also offers human services, criminal justice and the general education courses required by the State of New York to satisfy the liberal arts core of an A.A. or A.S. degree.\n\n\n== Media ==\nNewspapers\nKingston-based: Daily Freeman, Kingston Times\nOutside Kingston: Art Times, Poughkeepsie Journal, Times-Herald Record (Middletown)\nSee also: List of newspapers in New York in the 18th-century: Kingston\nTelevision: Time Warner Cable Kingston Area Public-access television cable TV channel 23\nRadio\nKingston-based: WGHQ (920 AM), WKNY (1490 AM), WKXP (94.3 FM)\nOutside Kingston: WFGB (89.7 FM), WBPM (92.9 FM, Saugerties), WKZE-FM (98.1, Salisbury, Connecticut/Rhinebeck, New York), WDST (100.1 FM, Woodstock).\nMagazines: Chronogram, Trends Journal\nMusic festivals: O+ Festival\nBlogs: The Kingston News, Kingston Creative, and Kingston Happenings\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nCommuter service is available by bus to New York City daily via Trailways of New York. The 90-mile trip takes roughly two hours by motor coach.\n\nPassenger railroad service to Kingston Union Station was discontinued in 1958 when the New York Central Railroad ended passenger service on the West Shore Railroad, which ran on an Albany\u2014Kingston\u2014Newburgh -- Weehawken, New Jersey itinerary. Amtrak maintains service on the east side of the Hudson. The Rhinecliff-Kingston Amtrak station is about 11 miles (20 km) away, and there is also access to Amtrak at the Poughkeepsie station, on the east bank of the Hudson and about 17 miles (30 km). That station also serves Metro-North trains.\nCSX Transportation operates freight rail service through Kingston on the River Line Subdivision. A small rail yard of about 7 tracks is operated in Kingston.\nThe Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge, 4.32 miles (6.95 km) to the north, carries New York State Route 199 and is the nearest bridge traversing the Hudson River. U.S. Highway 9W runs north\u2013south through the city. The New York State Thruway, also known at this section as Interstate 87, runs through the western part of the city.\nThe area is served by Kingston-Ulster airport (20N), located at the western base of the Kingston-Rhinecliff bridge. The nearest major airports to Kingston are Stewart International Airport 39 miles (62.8 km) south in Newburgh, and Albany International Airport, approximately 65 mi (105 km) north.The three major metropolitan airports for New York City are located on western Long Island: LaGuardia Airport approximately 80 mi (129 km) south and John F. Kennedy International approximately 93 mi (150 km) south, and in New Jersey: Newark Liberty International is approximately 86 mi (138 km) south.\nLocal travel is supported by the city-owned CitiBus system (headquarters at 420 Broadway) provides city bus service, and Ulster County Area Transit (UCAT) provides service to points elsewhere in Ulster County. Route A travels between Kingston Plaza and Riverfront, B between Albany Avenue and Fairview Avenue, and C between Golden Hill and Port Ewen.On the first Saturday of every month, an \"art bus\", usually a CitiBus tourist trolley, takes passengers on a guided tour of the art galleries of Kingston. The fare is $1. Kingston's art galleries all have openings on the first Saturday of the month.\nWeekend water taxi service between Kingston and Rhinecliff, New York is available May through October for $10 round-trip.  Some trips stop at the Rondout Light; a tour is available for an additional $5.Kingston historically was an important transportation center for the region. The Hudson River, Rondout Creek and Delaware and Hudson Canal were important commercial waterways. At one time, Kingston was served by four railroad companies and two trolley lines. Kingston has been designated as a New York State Heritage Area, with a transportation theme. The Hudson River Maritime Museum and Trolley Museum of New York are located along the waterfront and help interpret this historic role.\nThe Catskill Mountain Railroad, a scenic railroad company, runs trains from Kingston on the former Ulster and Delaware right of way.\n\nAs of 2016, more than a dozen projects were being coordinated among the Kingston Land Trust, Kingston City Government, and Ulster County Government, which will connect all three of Kingston's historic neighborhoods with a combination of rail trails, bike lanes and Complete Streets connections.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nResidents of the city and surrounding areas are served by the two hospital campuses of HealthAlliance of the Hudson Valley, a 315-bed healthcare system:\n\nHealthAlliance Hospital: Broadway Campus (formerly Kingston Hospital)\nHealthAlliance Hospital: Mary's Avenue Campus (formerly Benedictine Hospital)HealthAlliance is part of the Westchester Medical Center Health Network, a 10-hospital, 1,700-bed Hudson Valley-wide healthcare system.\nThere are also multiple urgent care sites, private practice offices and laboratories in the city and surrounding area.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCity of Kingston, New York",

        "wiki": "Niagara Falls  is a group of three waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge, spanning the border between the province of Ontario in Canada and the state of New York in the United States. The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls, also known as Canadian Falls, which straddles the international border of the two countries. The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie within the United States. Bridal Veil Falls are separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat Island and from American Falls by Luna Island, with both islands situated in New York.\nLocated on the Niagara River, which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario, the combined falls have the highest flow rate of any waterfall in North America that has a vertical drop of more than 50 metres (160 ft). During peak daytime tourist hours, more than 168,000 m3  (six million cubic feet) of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute. Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful waterfall in North America, as measured by flow rate.The falls are 27 kilometres (17 mi) north-northwest of Buffalo, New York, and 121 kilometres (75 mi) south-southeast of Toronto, between the twin cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, New York. Niagara Falls was formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation (the last ice age), and water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path through the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean.\nNiagara Falls is famed both for its beauty and as a valuable source of hydroelectric power. Balancing recreational, commercial, and industrial uses has been a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 19th century.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe Horseshoe Falls drop about 57 metres (187 ft), while the height of the American Falls varies between 21 and 30 metres (69 and 98 ft) because of the presence of giant boulders at its base. The larger Horseshoe Falls are about 790 metres (2,590 ft) wide, while the American Falls are 320 metres (1,050 ft) wide. The distance between the American extremity of the Niagara Falls and the Canadian extremity is 3,409 feet (1,039 m).\nThe peak flow over Horseshoe Falls was recorded at 6,400 cubic metres (230,000 cu ft) per second. The average annual flow rate is 2,400 cubic metres (85,000 cu ft) per second. Since the flow is a direct function of the Lake Erie water elevation, it typically peaks in late spring or early summer. During the summer months, at least 2,800 cubic metres (99,000 cu ft) per second of water traverses the falls, some 90% of which goes over the Horseshoe Falls, while the balance is diverted to hydroelectric facilities. This is accomplished by employing a weir \u2013 the International Control Dam \u2013 with movable gates upstream from the Horseshoe Falls. \n\n \nThe falls' flow is further halved at night, and, during the low tourist season in the winter, remains a minimum of 1,400 cubic metres (49,000 cu ft) per second. Water diversion is regulated by the 1950 Niagara Treaty and is administered by the International Niagara Board of Control (IJC). The verdant green color of the water flowing over the Niagara Falls is a byproduct of the estimated 60 tonnes/minute of dissolved salts and \"rock flour\" (very finely ground rock) generated by the erosive force of the Niagara River itself.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe features that became Niagara Falls were created by the Wisconsin glaciation about 10,000 years ago. The retreat of the ice sheet left behind a large amount of meltwater (see Lake Algonquin, Lake Chicago, Glacial Lake Iroquois, and Champlain Sea) that filled up the basins that the glaciers had carved, thus creating the Great Lakes as we know them today. Scientists argue there is an old valley, St David's Buried Gorge, buried by glacial drift, at the approximate location of the present Welland Canal.\n\nWhen the ice melted, the upper Great Lakes emptied into the Niagara River, which followed the rearranged topography across the Niagara Escarpment. In time, the river cut a gorge through the north-facing cliff, or cuesta. Because of the interactions of three major rock formations, the rocky bed did not erode evenly. The top rock formation was composed of erosion-resistant limestone and dolomite of the Lockport Formation. That hard layer of stone eroded more slowly than the underlying materials. The aerial photo on the right clearly shows the hard caprock, the Lockport Formation (Middle Silurian), which underlies the rapids above the falls, and approximately the upper third of the high gorge wall. Immediately below the hard-rock formation, comprising about two-thirds of the cliff, lay the weaker, softer, sloping Rochester Formation (Lower Silurian). This formation was composed mainly of shale, though it has some thin limestone layers. It also contains ancient fossils. In time, the river eroded the soft layer that supported the hard layers, undercutting the hard caprock, which gave way in great chunks. This process repeated countless times, eventually carving out the falls.\nSubmerged in the river in the lower valley, hidden from view, is the Queenston Formation (Upper Ordovician), which is composed of shales and fine sandstones. All three formations were laid down in an ancient sea, their differences of character deriving from changing conditions within that sea.\n\nAbout 10,900 years ago, the Niagara Falls was between present-day Queenston, Ontario, and Lewiston, New York, but erosion of their crest has caused the waterfalls to retreat approximately 6.8 miles (10.9 km) southward. The Horseshoe Falls, which are about 2,600 feet (790 m) wide, have also changed their shape through the process of erosion; evolving from a small arch to a horseshoe bend, to the present day gigantic V. Just upstream from the falls' current location, Goat Island splits the course of the Niagara River, resulting in the separation of the mostly Canadian Horseshoe Falls to the west from the American and Bridal Veil Falls to the east. Engineering has slowed erosion and recession.The current rate of erosion is approximately 30 centimeters (1 ft) per year, down from a historical average of 0.91 m (3 ft) per year. According to the timeline of the far future, in roughly 50,000 years Niagara Falls will have eroded the remaining 32 kilometres (20 mi) to Lake Erie and cease to exist.\n\n\n=== Preservation efforts ===\nIn the 1870s, sightseers had limited access to Niagara Falls and often had to pay for a glimpse, and industrialization threatened to carve up Goat Island to further expand commercial development. Other industrial encroachments and lack of public access led to a conservation movement in the U.S. known as Free Niagara, led by such notables as Hudson River School artist Frederic Edwin Church, landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted, and architect Henry Hobson Richardson. Church approached Lord Dufferin, governor-general of Canada, with a proposal for international discussions on the establishment of a public park.\n\nGoat Island was one of the inspirations for the American side of the effort. William Dorsheimer, moved by the scene from the island, brought Olmsted to Buffalo in 1868 to design a city park system and helped promote Olmsted's career. In 1879, the New York state legislature commissioned Olmsted and James T. Gardner to survey the falls and to create the single most important document in the Niagara preservation movement, a Special Report on the preservation of Niagara Falls. The report advocated for State purchase, restoration and preservation through public ownership of the scenic lands surrounding Niagara Falls. Restoring the former beauty of the falls was described in the report as a \"sacred obligation to mankind.\" In 1883, New York Governor Grover Cleveland drafted legislation authorizing acquisition of lands for a state reservation at Niagara, and the Niagara Falls Association, a private citizens group founded in 1882, mounted a great letter-writing campaign and petition drive in support of the park. Professor Charles Eliot Norton and Olmsted were among the leaders of the public campaign, while New York Governor Alonzo Cornell opposed.Preservationists' efforts were rewarded on April 30, 1885, when Governor David B. Hill signed legislation creating the Niagara Reservation, New York's first state park. New York State began to purchase land from developers, under the charter of the Niagara Reservation State Park. In the same year, the province of Ontario established the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park for the same purpose. On the Canadian side, the Niagara Parks Commission governs land usage along the entire course of the Niagara River, from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario.In 1887, Olmsted and Calvert Vaux issued a supplemental report detailing plans to restore the falls. Their intent was \"to restore and conserve the natural surroundings of the Falls of Niagara, rather than to attempt to add anything thereto\", and the report anticipated fundamental questions. How would preservationists provide access without destroying the beauty of the falls? How would they restore natural landscapes damaged by man? They planned a park with scenic roadways, paths and a few shelters designed to protect the landscape while allowing large numbers of visitors to enjoy the falls. Commemorative statues, shops, restaurants, and a 1959 glass and metal observation tower were added later. Preservationists continue to strive to strike a balance between Olmsted's idyllic vision and the realities of administering a popular scenic attraction.Preservation efforts continued well into the 20th century. J. Horace McFarland, the Sierra Club, and the Appalachian Mountain Club persuaded the United States Congress in 1906 to enact legislation to preserve the falls by regulating the waters of the Niagara River. The act sought, in cooperation with the Canadian government, to restrict diversion of water, and a treaty resulted in 1909 that limited the total amount of water diverted from the falls by both nations to approximately 56,000 cubic feet (1,600 m3) per second. That limitation remained in effect until 1950.\n\nErosion control efforts have always been of extreme importance. Underwater weirs redirect the most damaging currents, and the top of the falls has also been strengthened. In June 1969, the Niagara River was completely diverted from the American Falls for several months through construction of a temporary rock and earth dam. During this time, two bodies were removed from under the falls, including a man who had been seen jumping over the falls, and the body of a woman, which was discovered once the falls dried.While the Horseshoe Falls absorbed the extra flow, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers studied the riverbed and mechanically bolted and strengthened any faults they found; faults that would, if left untreated, have hastened the retreat of the American Falls. A plan to remove the huge mound of talus deposited in 1954 was abandoned owing to cost, and in November 1969, the temporary dam was dynamited, restoring flow to the American Falls. Even after these undertakings, Luna Island, the small piece of land between the main waterfall and the Bridal Veil, remained off limits to the public for years owing to fears that it was unstable and could collapse into the gorge.\n\nCommercial interests have continued to encroach on the land surrounding the state park, including the construction of several tall buildings (most of them hotels) on the Canadian side. The result is a significant alteration and urbanisation of the landscape. One study indicated it has caused the airflow near the falls to change direction. Students at the University of Guelph demonstrated, using scale models, that as air passes over the top of the new hotels it causes a breeze to roll down the south sides of the buildings and spill into the gorge below the falls, where it feeds into a whirlpool of moisture and air. The inference was that a documented rise in the number of \"mist days\" was a result of these breezes, where mist days refers to the mist plume of the falls reaching landside. In 1996 there were 29 mist days recorded, but by 2003 that number had risen to 68. Another study has discounted this opinion and linked mist production to the difference in air and water temperature at the falls. However, this study does not offer opinion as to why mist days have been increasing, just that the hotel breezes are an unlikely cause.In 2013, New York State began an effort to renovate The Sisters Islands located on Goat Island. New York State used funds from the re-licensing of the New York Power Authority hydroelectric plant downriver in Lewiston, New York, to rebuild walking paths on the Three Sisters Islands and to plant native vegetation on the islands. The state also renovated the area around Prospect Point at the brink of the American Falls in the state park.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTheories differ as to the origin of the name of the falls. According to Iroquoian scholar Bruce Trigger, Niagara is derived from the name given to a branch of the local native Neutral Confederacy, who are described as being called the Niagagarega people on several late-17th-century French maps of the area. According to George R. Stewart, it comes from the name of an Iroquois town called Onguiaahra, meaning \"point of land cut in two\".Henry Schoolcraft reported:\n\nNiagara Falls. This name is Mohawk. It means, according to Mrs. Kerr, the neck; the term being first applied to the portage or neck of land, between lakes Erie and Ontario. By referring to Mr. Elliott's vocabulary, (chapter xi) it will be seen that the human neck, that is, according to the concrete vocabulary, his neck, is onyara. Red Jacket pronounced the word Niagara to me, in the spring of 1820, as if written O-ne-au-ga-rah.\n\nMany figures have been suggested as first circulating a European eyewitness description of Niagara Falls. The Frenchman Samuel de Champlain visited the area as early as 1604 during his exploration of Canada, and members of his party reported to him the spectacular waterfalls, which he described in his journals. The Finnish-Swedish naturalist Pehr Kalm explored the area in the early 18th century and is credited with the first scientific description of the falls. The consensus honoree for the first description is the Belgian missionary Louis Hennepin, who observed and described the falls in 1677, earlier than Kalm, after traveling with the explorer Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, thus bringing the falls to the attention of Europeans. Further complicating matters, there is credible evidence the French Jesuit missionary Paul Ragueneau visited the falls some 35 years before Hennepin's visit while working among the Huron First Nation in Canada. Jean de Br\u00e9beuf also may have visited the falls, while spending time with the Neutral Nation.\n\nIn 1762, Captain Thomas Davies, a British Army officer and artist, surveyed the area and painted the watercolor, An East View of the Great Cataract of Niagara, the first eyewitness painting of the falls.During the 19th century, tourism became popular, and by mid-century, it was the area's main industry. Theodosia Burr Alston (daughter of Vice President Aaron Burr) and her husband Joseph Alston were the first recorded couple to honeymoon there in 1801. Napoleon Bonaparte's brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me visited with his bride in the early 19th century.In 1825, British explorer John Franklin visited the falls while passing through New York en route to Cumberland House as part of his second Arctic expedition, calling them \"so justly celebrated as the first in the world for grandeur\".In March 1848, an ice blockage caused the falls to stop; no water (or at best a trickle) fell for as much as 40 hours. Waterwheels stopped, and mills and factories shut down for having no power.\n\nLater that year, demand for passage over the Niagara River led to the building of a footbridge and then Charles Ellet's Niagara Suspension Bridge. This was supplanted by German-born John Augustus Roebling's Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge in 1855. After the American Civil War, the New York Central Railroad publicized Niagara Falls as a focus of pleasure and honeymoon visits. With increased railroad traffic, in 1886, Leffert Buck replaced Roebling's wood and stone bridge with the predominantly steel bridge that still carries trains over the Niagara River today. The first steel archway bridge near the falls was completed in 1897. Known today as the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge, it carries passenger vehicles and trains between Canada (through Canadian Customs Border Control) and the U.S.A. just downstream of the falls.\nIn about 1840, the English industrial chemist Hugh Lee Pattinson traveled to Canada, stopping at the Niagara Falls long enough to make the earliest known photograph of the falls, a daguerreotype in the collection of Newcastle University. It was once believed that the small figure standing silhouetted with a top hat was added by an engraver working from imagination as well as the daguerreotype as his source, but the figure is clearly present in the photograph. Because of the very long exposure required, of ten minutes or more, the figure is assumed by Canada's Niagara Parks agency to be Pattinson himself. The image is left-right inverted and taken from the Canadian side. Pattinson made other photographs of the Horseshoe Falls as well as of Rome and Paris. These were then transferred to engravings to illustrate No\u00ebl Marie Paymal Lerebours' Excursions Daguerriennes (Paris, 1841\u20131864).On 6 August 1918, an iron scow became stuck on the rocks above the falls. The two men on the scow were rescued but the vessel remained trapped on rocks in the river, and is still visible there in a deteriorate state, although its position shifted by 50 meters during a storm on 31 October 2019. Daredevil William \"Red\" Hill Sr. was particularly praised for his role in the rescue.\n\nAfter the First World War, tourism boomed again, as automobiles made getting to the falls much easier. The story of Niagara Falls in the 20th century is largely that of efforts to harness the energy of the falls for hydroelectric power, and to control the development on both sides that threaten the area's natural beauty. In 1941, the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission completed the third current crossing in the immediate area of Niagara Falls with the Rainbow Bridge, carrying both pedestrian and vehicular traffic between the two countries and Canadian and U.S. customs for each country.\nBefore the late 20th century, the northeastern end of the Horseshoe Falls was in the United States, flowing around the Terrapin Rocks, which were once connected to Goat Island by a series of bridges. In 1955, the area between the rocks and Goat Island was filled in, creating Terrapin Point. In the early 1980s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers filled in more land and built diversion dams and retaining walls to force the water away from Terrapin Point. Altogether, 400 ft (120 m) of the Horseshoe Falls were eliminated, including 100 ft (30 m) on the Canadian side. According to author Ginger Strand, the Horseshoe Falls is now entirely in Canada. Other sources say \"most of\" Horseshoe Falls is in Canada.\n\n\n=== History of freezing over ===\n\nThe only recorded freeze-up of the river and falls was due to an ice jam on March 29, 1848. In 1912, the American Falls was completely frozen but the other two kept flowing. Although the falls commonly ice up most winters, the river and the falls do not freeze completely. The years 1885, 1902, 1906, 1911, 1932, 1936, 2014, 2017 and 2019 are noted for partial freezing of the falls.A so-called ice bridge was also common in certain years at the base of the falls and was used by people who wanted to cross the river before bridges had been built. During some winters, the ice sheet was as thick as 40 feet (12m) to 100 feet (30m) but that thickness has not occurred since 1954. The ice bridge of 1841 was said to be at least 100 feet thick.   \n On 12 February 1912, the ice bridge which had formed on 15 January began breaking up while people were still on it. Many escaped but three died during the event, later named the Ice Bridge Disaster or Tragedy.\n\n\n=== History of the bridges ===\n\nA number of bridges have spanned the Niagara River in the general vicinity of the falls. The first, not far from the Whirlpool, was a suspension bridge above the gorge. It opened for use by the public in July 1848 and remained in use until 1855. A second bridge in the Upper Falls area was commissioned, with two levels or decks, one for use by the Great Western Railway. This Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge opened in 1855. In 1882, the Grand Trunk Railway took over control of the second deck after it absorbed the Great Western company. Significant structural improvements were made in the late 1870s and then in 1886; this bridge remained in use until 1897.Due to the volume of traffic, the decision was made to construct a new arch bridge nearby: under and around the existing bridge. After it opened in September 1897, a decision was made to remove and scrap the Railway Suspension Bridge. This new bridge was initially known as the Niagara Railway Arch, or Lower Steel Arch Bridge; it had two decks, the lower one used for carriages and the upper for trains. In 1937, it was renamed the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge and remains in use today. All of the structures built up to that time were referred to as Lower Niagara bridges and were some distance from the falls.\n\nThe first bridge in the so-called Upper Niagara area (closer to the falls) was a two level suspension structure that opened in January 1869; it was destroyed during a severe storm in January 1889. The replacement was built quickly and opened in May of the same year. In order to handle heavy traffic a second bridge was commissioned, slightly closer to the American Falls. This one was fully made of steel and opened to traffic in June 1897; it was known as the Upper Steel Arch Bridge, but was often called the Honeymoon Bridge. The single level included a track for trolleys and space for carriages and pedestrians. The design led to the bridge being very close to the surface of the river and in January, 1938, an ice jam twisted the steel frame of the bridge which later collapsed, on January 27, 1938.\n\nAnother Lower Niagara bridge had been commissioned in 1883 by Cornelius Vanderbilt for use by railways at a location roughly approximately 200 feet south of the Railway Suspension Bridge. This one was of an entirely different design; it was a Cantilever bridge to provide greater strength. The Niagara Cantilever Bridge had two cantilevers which were joined by steel sections; it opened officially in December 1883 and improvements were made over the years for a stronger structure. As rail traffic was increasing, the Michigan Central Railroad company decided to build a new bridge in 1923, to be located between the Lower Steel Arch Bridge and the Cantilever Bridge. The Michigan Central Railway Bridge opened in February 1925 and remained in use until the early 21st century. The Cantilever Bridge was removed and scrapped after the new rail bridge opened. Nonetheless, it was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame in 2006.There was a lengthy dispute as to which agency should build the replacement for the Niagara Railway Arch, or Lower Steel Arch Bridge in the Upper Niagara area. When that was resolved, construction of a steel bridge commenced in February 1940. Named the Rainbow Bridge, and featuring two lanes for traffic separated by a barrier, this one opened in November 1941. It remains in use today.\n\n\n== Impact on industry and commerce ==\n\n\n=== Hydroelectric power ===\n\nThe enormous energy of Niagara Falls has long been recognized as a potential source of power. The first known effort to harness the waters was in 1759, when Daniel Joncaire built a small canal above the falls to power his sawmill. Augustus and Peter Porter purchased this area and all of American Falls in 1805 from the New York state government, and enlarged the original canal to provide hydraulic power for their gristmill and tannery. In 1853, the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Mining Company was chartered, which eventually constructed the canals that would be used to generate electricity. In 1881, under the leadership of Jacob F. Schoellkopf, the Niagara River's first hydroelectric generating station was built. The water fell 86 feet (26 m) and generated direct current electricity, which ran the machinery of local mills and lit up some of the village streets.\nThe Niagara Falls Power Company, a descendant of Schoellkopf's firm, formed the Cataract Company headed by Edward Dean Adams, with the intent of expanding Niagara Falls' power capacity. In 1890, a five-member International Niagara Commission headed by Sir William Thomson among other distinguished scientists deliberated on the expansion of Niagara hydroelectric capacity based on seventeen proposals, but could not select any as the best combined project for hydraulic development and distribution. In 1893, Westinghouse Electric (which had built the smaller-scale Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant near Ophir, Colorado, two years earlier) was hired to design a system to generate alternating current on Niagara Falls, and three years after that this large-scale AC power system was created (activated on August 26, 1895). The Adams Power Plant Transformer House remains as a landmark of the original system.\n\nBy 1896, financing from moguls including J.P. Morgan, John Jacob Astor IV, and the Vanderbilts had fueled the construction of giant underground conduits leading to turbines generating upwards of 100,000 horsepower (75 MW), sent as far as Buffalo, 20 miles (32 km) away. Some of the original designs for the power transmission plants were created by the Swiss firm Faesch & Piccard, which also constructed the original 5,000 hp waterwheels.\nPrivate companies on the Canadian side also began to harness the energy of the falls. The Government of Ontario eventually brought power transmission operations under public control in 1906, distributing Niagara's energy to various parts of the Canadian province.\nOther hydropower plants were also being built along the Niagara River. But in 1956, disaster struck when the region's largest hydropower station was partially destroyed in a landslide. This drastically reduced power production and put tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs at stake. In 1957, Congress passed the Niagara Redevelopment Act, which granted the New York Power Authority the right to fully develop the United States' share of the Niagara River's hydroelectric potential.In 1961, when the Niagara Falls hydroelectric project went online, it was the largest hydropower facility in the Western world. Today, Niagara is still the largest electricity producer in New York state, with a generating capacity of 2.4 GW. Up to 1,420 cubic metres (380,000 US gal) of water a second is diverted from the Niagara River through conduits under the city of Niagara Falls to the Lewiston and Robert Moses power plants. Currently between 50% and 75% of the Niagara River's flow is diverted via four huge tunnels that arise far upstream from the waterfalls. The water then passes through hydroelectric turbines that supply power to nearby areas of Canada and the United States before returning to the river well past the falls. This water spins turbines that power generators, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. When electrical demand is low, the Lewiston units can operate as pumps to transport water from the lower bay back up to the plant's reservoir, allowing this water to be used again during the daytime when electricity use peaks. During peak electrical demand, the same Lewiston pumps are reversed and actually become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant.To preserve Niagara Falls' natural beauty, a 1950 treaty signed by the U.S. and Canada limited water usage by the power plants. The treaty allows higher summertime diversion at night when tourists are fewer and during the winter months when there are even fewer tourists. This treaty, designed to ensure an \"unbroken curtain of water\" flowing over the falls, states that during daylight time during the tourist season (April 1 to October 31) there must be 100,000 cubic feet per second (2,800 m3/s) of water flowing over the falls, and during the night and off-tourist season there must be 50,000 cubic feet per second (1,400 m3/s) of water flowing over the falls. This treaty is monitored by the International Niagara Board of Control, using a NOAA gauging station above the falls. During winter, the Power Authority of New York works with Ontario Power Generation to prevent ice on the Niagara River from interfering with power production or causing flooding of shoreline property. One of their joint efforts is an 8,800-foot-long (2,700 m) ice boom, which prevents the buildup of ice, yet allows water to continue flowing downstream. In addition to minimum water volume, the crest of the Horseshoe falls was reduced to maintain an uninterrupted \"curtain of water.\"\n\nThe most powerful hydroelectric stations on the Niagara River are the Sir Adam Beck 1 and 2 on the Canadian side and the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant and the Lewiston Pump Generating Plant on the American side. Together, Niagara's generating stations can produce about 4.4 gigawatts of power.\nIn August 2005 Ontario Power Generation, which is responsible for the Sir Adam Beck stations, started a major civil engineering project, called the Niagara Tunnel Project, to increase power production by building a new 12.7-metre (42 ft) diameter, 10.2-kilometre-long (6.3 mi) water diversion tunnel. It was officially placed into service in March 2013, helping to increase the generating complex's nameplate capacity by 150 megawatts. It did so by tapping water from farther up the Niagara River than was possible with the preexisting arrangement. The tunnel provided new hydroelectricity for approximately 160,000 homes.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nShips can bypass Niagara Falls by means of the Welland Canal, which was improved and incorporated into the Saint Lawrence Seaway in the mid-1950s. While the seaway diverted water traffic from nearby Buffalo and led to the demise of its steel and grain mills, other industries in the Niagara River valley flourished with the help of the electric power produced by the river. However, since the 1970s the region has declined economically.\nThe cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, and Niagara Falls, New York, United States, are connected by two international bridges. The Rainbow Bridge, just downriver from the falls, affords the closest view of the falls and is open to non-commercial vehicle traffic and pedestrians. The Whirlpool Rapids Bridge lies one mile (1.6 km) north of the Rainbow Bridge and is the oldest bridge over the Niagara River. Nearby Niagara Falls International Airport and Buffalo Niagara International Airport were named after the waterfall, as were Niagara University, countless local businesses, and even an asteroid.\n\n\n== Over the falls ==\n\n\n=== Jumps, plunges and walks ===\n\nIn October 1829, Sam Patch, who called himself \"the Yankee Leapster\", jumped from a high tower into the gorge below the falls and survived; this began a long tradition of daredevils trying to go over the falls.\nEnglishman Captain Matthew Webb, the first man to swim the English Channel, drowned in 1883 trying to swim the rapids downriver from the falls.On October 24, 1901, 63-year-old Michigan school teacher Annie Edson Taylor became the first person to go over the falls in a barrel as a publicity stunt; she survived, bleeding, but otherwise unharmed. Soon after exiting the barrel, she said, \"No one ought ever do that again.\" Before Taylor's attempt, on October 19 her domestic cat named Iagara was sent over the Horseshoe Falls in her barrel to test its strength. Contrary to rumours at the time, the cat survived the plunge unharmed and later posed with Taylor in photographs. Since Taylor's historic ride, over a dozen people have intentionally gone over the falls in or on a device, despite her advice. Some have survived unharmed, but others have drowned or been severely injured. Survivors face charges and stiff fines, as it is now illegal, on both sides of the border, to attempt to go over the falls.\n\nBobby Leach went over the Horseshoe Falls in a crude steel barrel in 1911, and needed rescuing by William \"Red\" Hill Sr.. Hill would again come to the rescue of Leach following his failed attempt to swim the Niagara Gorge in 1920.\nIn 1918, there was a near disaster when a barge working upriver, known locally as the Niagara Scow, broke its tow line and almost plunged over the falls. The two workers on board saved themselves by grounding the vessel on rocks just short of the falls, where it has remained ever since. \"Red\" Hill was credited with the rescue of the two boatmen. In October 2019, as a result of inclement weather, the Niagara Scow finally moved from its original resting place, moving closer to the brink of Horseshoe Falls.In 1928, \"Smiling Jean\" Lussier tried an entirely different concept, going over the falls in a large rubber ball; he was successful and survived the ordeal.Charles Stephens, a 58-year-old barber from Bristol, England, went over the falls in a wooden barrel in July 1920 and was the first person to die in an endeavor of this type.\n\nIn the \"Miracle at Niagara\", Roger Woodward, a seven-year-old American boy, was swept over the Horseshoe Falls after their boat lost power on July 9, 1960; two tourists pulled his 17-year-old sister Deanne from the river only 20 feet (6.1 m) from the lip of the Horseshoe Falls at Goat Island. Minutes later, Woodward was plucked from the roiling plunge pool beneath the Horseshoe Falls after grabbing a life ring thrown to him by the crew of the Maid of the Mist boat. The third person who had been in the boat, James Hunicutt, did not survive the mishap.On July 2, 1984, Canadian Karel Soucek from Hamilton, Ontario, plunged over the Horseshoe Falls in a barrel with only minor injuries. Soucek was fined $500 for performing the stunt without a license. In 1985, he was fatally injured while attempting to re-create the Niagara drop at the Houston Astrodome. His aim was to climb into a barrel hoisted to the rafters of the Astrodome and to drop 180 feet (55 m) into a water tank on the floor. After his barrel released prematurely, it hit the side of the tank and he died the next day from his injuries.\n\nIn August 1985, Steve Trotter, an aspiring stuntman from Rhode Island, became the youngest person ever (age 22) and the first American in 25 years to go over the falls in a barrel. Ten years later, Trotter went over the falls again, becoming the second person to go over the falls twice and survive. It was also the second-ever \"duo\"; Lori Martin joined Trotter for the barrel ride over the falls. They survived the fall but their barrel became stuck at the bottom of the falls, requiring a rescue.On September 28, 1989, Niagara natives Peter DeBernardi (age 42) and Jeffery James Petkovich (age 25) became the first \"team\" to make it over the falls in a two-person barrel. The stunt was conceived by DeBenardi, who wanted to discourage youth from following in his path of addictive drug use. The pair emerged shortly after going over with minor injuries and were charged with performing an illegal stunt under the Niagara Parks Act.On June 5, 1990, Jesse Sharp, a whitewater canoeist from Tennessee paddled over the falls in a closed deck canoe. He neglected to wear a helmet to make his face more visible for photographs of the event. He also did not wear a life vest because he believed it would hinder his escape from the hydraulics at the base of the falls. His boat flushed out of the falls, but his body was never found.On September 27, 1993, John \"David\" Munday, of Caistor Centre, Ontario, completed his second journey over the falls.On October 1, 1995, Robert Douglas \"Firecracker\" Overacker went over the falls on a Jet Ski to raise awareness for the homeless. His rocket-propelled parachute failed to open and he plunged to his death. Overacker's body was recovered before he was pronounced dead at Niagara General Hospital.Kirk Jones of Canton, Michigan, became the first known person to survive a plunge over the Horseshoe Falls without a flotation device on October 20, 2003. According to some reports, Jones had attempted to commit suicide, he survived the 16-story fall with only battered ribs, scrapes, and bruises. Jones tried going over the falls again in 2017, this time, using a large inflatable ball, but died in the process. Later reports revealed that Jones had arranged for a friend to shoot video clips of his stunt.\n\nOn March 11, 2009, a man survived an unprotected trip over the Horseshoe Falls, and when rescued from the river, was reported to be suffering from severe hypothermia and a large wound to his head. His identity was never released. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the man intentionally enter the water.On May 21, 2012, an unidentified man in his early 40s became the fourth person to survive an unprotected trip over the Horseshoe Falls. Eyewitness reports show he \"deliberately jumped\" into the Niagara River after climbing over a railing.On July 8, 2019, at roughly 4 am, officers responded to a report of a person in crisis at the brink of the Canadian side of the falls. Once officers got to the scene, the man climbed the retaining wall, jumped into the river and went over the Horseshoe Falls. Authorities subsequently began to search the lower Niagara River basin, where the man was found sitting on the rocks at the water's edge.\n\nOther daredevils have made crossing the gorge their goal, starting with the successful passage by Jean Fran\u00e7ois \"Blondin\" Gravelet, who crossed Niagara Gorge in 1859. Between 1859 and 1896 a wire-walking craze emerged, resulting in frequent feats over the river below the falls. One inexperienced walker slid down his safety rope. Only one man fell to his death, at night and under mysterious circumstances, at the anchoring place for his wire.Maria Spelterini, a 23-year-old Italian was the first and only woman to cross the Niagara River gorge; she did so on a tightrope, on 8 July 1876. She repeated the stunt several times during the same month. During one crossing she was blindfolded and during another, her ankles and wrists were handcuffed.The tightrope walkers drew huge crowds to witness their exploits. Their wires ran across the gorge, near the current Rainbow Bridge, not over the waterfall itself. Blondin made his first gorge crossing on a tightrope on 30 June 1859 and did so again eight times that year. His most difficult crossing occurred on August 14, when he carried his manager, Harry Colcord, on his back.   His final crossing, on 8 September 1860, was witnessed by the Prince of Wales.Among the many competitors was Ontario's William Hunt, who billed himself as \"The Great Farini\"; his first crossing was in 1860. Farini competed with Blondin in performing outrageous stunts over the gorge. On 8 August  1864 however, an attempt failed and he needed to be rescued.On 15 June 2012, high wire artist Nik Wallenda became the first person to walk across the falls area in 116 years, after receiving special permission from both governments. The full length of his tightrope was 1,800 feet (550 m). Wallenda crossed near the brink of the Horseshoe Falls, unlike walkers who had crossed farther downstream. According to Wallenda, it was the longest unsupported tightrope walk in history. He carried his passport on the trip and was required to present it upon arrival on the Canadian side of the falls.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nPeak visitor traffic occurs in the summertime, when Niagara Falls are both a daytime and evening attraction. From the Canadian side, floodlights illuminate both sides of the falls for several hours after dark (until midnight). The number of visitors in 2007 was expected to total 20 million, and by 2009 the annual rate was expected to top 28 million tourists.The oldest and best known tourist attraction at Niagara Falls is the Maid of the Mist boat cruise, named for an ancient Ongiara Indian mythical character, which has carried passengers into the rapids immediately below the falls since 1846. Cruise boats operate from boat docks on both sides of the falls, with the Maid of the Mist operating from the American side and Hornblower Cruises (originally Maid of the Mist until 2014) from the Canadian side.From the U.S. side, the American Falls can be viewed from walkways along Prospect Point Park, which also features the Prospect Point Observation Tower and a boat dock for the Maid of the Mist. Goat Island offers more views of the falls and is accessible by foot and automobile traffic by bridge above the American Falls. From Goat Island, the Cave of the Winds is accessible by elevator and leads hikers to a point beneath Bridal Veil Falls. Also on Goat Island are the Three Sisters Islands, the Power Portal where a statue of Nikola Tesla (the inventor whose patents for the AC induction motor and other devices for AC power transmission helped make the harnessing of the falls possible) can be seen, and a walking path that enables views of the rapids, the Niagara River, the gorge, and all of the falls. Most of these attractions lie within the Niagara Falls State Park.\n\nThe Niagara Scenic Trolley offers guided trips along the American Falls and around Goat Island. Panoramic and aerial views of the falls can also be viewed by helicopter. The Niagara Gorge Discovery Center showcases the natural and local history of Niagara Falls and the Niagara Gorge. A casino and luxury hotel was opened in Niagara Falls, New York, by the Seneca Indian tribe. The Seneca Niagara Casino & Hotel occupies the former Niagara Falls Convention Center. The new hotel is the first addition to the city's skyline since completion of the United Office Building in the 1920s.On the Canadian side, Queen Victoria Park features manicured gardens, platforms offering views of both the American and Horseshoe Falls, and underground walkways leading into observation rooms that yield the illusion of being within the falling waters. Along the Niagara River, the Niagara River Recreational Trail runs 35 miles (56 km) from Fort Erie to Fort George, and includes many historical sites from the War of 1812.\n\nThe observation deck of the nearby Skylon Tower offers the highest view of the falls, and in the opposite direction gives views as far as Toronto. Along with the Tower Hotel (built as the Seagrams Tower, later renamed the Heritage Tower, the Royal Inn Tower, the Royal Center Tower, the Panasonic Tower, the Minolta Tower, and most recently the Konica Minolta Tower before receiving its current name in 2010), it is one of two towers in Canada with a view of the falls.The Whirlpool Aero Car, built in 1916 from a design by Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres y Quevedo, is a cable car that takes passengers over the Niagara Whirlpool on the Canadian side. The Journey Behind the Falls consists of an observation platform and series of tunnels near the bottom of the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side.There are two casinos on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, the Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort and Casino Niagara.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Movies and television ===\n\nAlready a huge tourist attraction and favorite spot for honeymooners, Niagara Falls visits rose sharply in 1953 after the release of Niagara, a movie starring Marilyn Monroe and Joseph Cotten.The 1956 animated short Niagara Fools featured Woody Woodpecker attempting to go over the falls in a barrel. The falls was a featured location in the major motion picture Superman II in 1980, and was itself the subject of a popular IMAX movie, Niagara: Miracles, Myths and Magic. Illusionist David Copperfield performed a trick in which he appeared to travel over the Horseshoe Falls in 1990.The falls, or more particularly, the tourist-supported complex near the falls, was the setting of the short-lived Canadian-shot US television show Wonderfalls in early 2004. Location footage of the falls was shot in October 2006 to portray \"World's End\" of the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Professional kayaker Rafa Ortiz's preparation to paddle over the falls in a kayak is documented in the 2015 film Chasing Niagara.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nComposer Ferde Grof\u00e9 was commissioned by the Niagara Falls Power Generation project in 1960 to compose the Niagara Falls Suite in honor of the completion of the first stage of hydroelectric work at the falls. In 1997, composer Michael Daugherty composed Niagara Falls, a piece for concert band inspired by the falls.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe Niagara Falls area features as the base camp for a German aerial invasion of the United States in the H. G. Wells novel The War in the Air.Many poets have been inspired to write about the falls. Among them was the Cuban poet Jos\u00e9 Maria Heredia, who wrote the poem \"Niagara\". There are commemorative plaques on both sides of the falls recognising the poem.In the original 1920s and 1930s Buck Rogers stories and newspaper cartoons, Buck Rogers, in his adventures in the 25th century that take place on Earth.Part of Mark Twain's 1893 short story, \"Extract from Adam's Diary\" is set at Niagara Falls.The Bulgarian writer Aleko Konstantinov portrays the impressiveness of the Niagara Falls in his book, To Chicago and Back.\nIn 2014, the writer Alessandro Baricco published the book Smith & Wesson recounting the story of Rachel Green going over the falls.\n\n\n== Fine art ==\nThe Niagara Falls were such an attraction to landscape artists that, writes John Howat, they were \"the most popular, the most often treated, and the tritest single item of subject matter to appear in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European and American landscape painting\".\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Panoramic views ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nFederal Power Commission v.

        "wiki": "This is a comprehensive list of awards, honours and other recognitions bestowed on Nelson Mandela. Mandela received more than 260 awards over 40 years, most notably the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.\nFrom 1994 to 1999, Mandela was President of South Africa. He was the first such African to be elected in fully representative democratic polls.\nBefore his presidency, Mandela was an anti-apartheid activist and leader of the African National Congress and its armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe. He spent 27 years in prison, much of it in a cell on Robben Island. The rest of his incarceration was in Pollsmoor Prison, on convictions for crimes that included sabotage committed while he spearheaded the struggle against apartheid.\nFollowing his release from prison on 11 February 1990, his advocacy of a policy of reconciliation and negotiation helped lead the transition to multi-racial democracy in South Africa. Since the end of apartheid, he was widely praised, even by former opponents.\nMandela died on 5 December 2013, a celebrated elder statesman who continued to voice his opinion on topical issues. In South Africa he was often known as Madiba, an aristocratic title adopted by the elderly members of the royal clan that he belongs to. This title has come to be synonymous with Nelson Mandela.\n\n\n== 1940s ==\n1942 \u2013 Bachelor of Arts degree, University of South Africa\n\n\n== 1960s ==\n1964 \u2013 Elected Honorary President of the Students' Union, University of Leeds Tyler Hopper\n\n\n== 1970s ==\n1973 \u2013 A nuclear particle discovered by scientists at the University of Leeds is named the \"Mandela particle\".\n1975 \u2013 Honorary life membership of the Students' Union, University of London\n1979 \u2013 Awarded Honorary Doctorate of Law, University of Lesotho, Maseru, 29 September\n1979 \u2013 Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding, by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations New Delhi, India\n\n\n== 1981 ==\nAugust \u2013  Freedom of the City of Glasgow\nThe first UK road named in his honor \u2013 \"Mandela Close\" \u2013 is unveiled in the London Borough of Brent\nBruno Kreisky Award for merit in the field of human rights, chosen by a panel of international judges, Vienna, Austria\n\n\n== 1982 ==\nElected Honorary Life President of the Students' Union at the London School of Economics and Political Science\n\n\n== 1983 ==\nHonorary citizenship of Rome, February\nHonorary citizenship of Olympia, Greece, 17 March\nOrnamental gardens in Hull, United Kingdom, named 'Nelson Mandela Gardens', May\nHonorary Doctorate of Laws.

        "wiki": "Liguanea ( LIG-\u0259nee) is an area of the island of Jamaica. Its name came from the language of the Yamaye people who currently inhabit some of the island's rural areas in Cornwall County. and named it after the iguana lizard that is endemic to the island, and an important source of food for the Yamaye.\nGeographically, the Liguanea Plains are the fertile flat lands of alluvium spreading south towards Kingston Harbour, but the area known as Liguanea is only a small part of the Kingston Corporate Area, a section of the parish of St Andrew. From a socioeconomic point of view, Liguanea is the name of a distinct commercial district: east to west, between Half-Way-Tree (up to Jamaica House) and Papine (at UTech's front gate); north to south, between Millsborough (Barbican Road) and New Kingston (Mountain View Road to Trafalgar Road).\nThe heart of the Liguanea suburban commercial district is Matilda's Corner, the only intersection of Hope and Old Hope Roads. Activities here serve the immediate neighbourhoods as well as the adjoining area of Papine. The origin of the name Matilda's Corner is unknown. Enclosing residential areas include Mona, Wellington, Mona Heights, Hope Pastures, Trafalgar Park, and Beverly Hills. The \"small communities\", also known as ghettoes or \"deep urban areas\", nearby are Sandy Gully, Stand Pipe and Chambers Lane/Air Pipe.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing the English invasion of Jamaica Lt.-Colonel Henry Archibold established a regimental plantation, using the labour of  soldiers under his command to develop \u201cone of the best plantations in the island\u201d (Commander William Brayne).\n\n\n=== Hope Estate ===\nRichard Hope, a member of the English Army, founded the Hope Estate in the 1660s. It was first a cattle-mill. Given permission to operate a watermill along Hope River to grind sugar cane in 1752, it became a sugar plantation. It was called the Hope Plantation. The estate grew and in 1826 it was called Hope Estate.\n\n\n=== Hope Botanical Garden and Zoo ===\nThe Hope Botanical Garden and Zoo, located on Old Hope Road, includes a botanical garden, orchid house, and stone aqueduct. There is also a children\u2019s amusement park and a zoo. It is located on what was formerly the Hope Estate. In 1881, the government acquired the land and laid out the gardens.

        "wiki": "Trench Town (also Trenchtown) is a neighbourhood located in the parish of St. Andrew which shares  municipality with Kingston, the capital and largest city of Jamaica. In the 1960s Trench Town was known as the Hollywood of Jamaica. Today Trench Town is the location of the Trench Town Culture Yard Museum, a National Heritage Site presenting the unique history and contribution of Trench Town to Jamaica.\nTrench Town is the birthplace of rocksteady and reggae music, as well as the home of reggae and Rastafari ambassador Bob Marley. The neighborhood gets its name from its previous designation as Trench Pen, 400 acres (162 hectares) of land once used for livestock by Daniel Power Trench, an Irish immigrant of the 18th century (descendants of the Earls of Clancarty). The Trench family abandoned the land in the late 19th century. Trench Town is home to the communities of Wilton Gardens [Rema], Federal Gardens, Arnett Gardens [Jungle], Havana, Buckers and others. Trench Town today is also the home of two of Jamaica's top Premier League football club teams, Arnett Gardens and Boys' Town.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the colonial period, Trenchtown was part of the Greenwich Park estate of Daniel Power Trench (1813-1884), son of a wealthy plantation owner and slave-holder. Christopher Whyms-Stone asserts the settlement's name derives from Daniel Trench (rather than, for instance, taking its name from gulleys and trenches observable in its landscape).During the 1930s, Trench Pen, in southern St. Andrew (neighboring western Kingston), was a growing squatter settlement for the rural to urban migrants.  Trench Pen was developed into Trench Town when the colonial government's Central Housing Authority (CHA) initiated a model township project which included owner occupied housing, rental social housing, schools, a theatre (The Ambassador), a park (Vin Lawrence Park), YMCA & YWCA, health clinic and fire station. Approximately 200 acres (81 hectares) of Trench Pen was used to create Trench Town while the remaining land became known as Rose Town, a residential community. Many who came from rural Jamaica to find work settled in the western side of Kingston as there were available \"idle\" lands and also the area  was a desirable location being close to downtown and the market district.\nThe new residences consisted of one- and two-storey 'knog' buildings, built in clusters or around a central courtyard with communal cooking and bathroom facilities. These residences became the famous Government Yards of Trench Town. Knog construction refers to a labor-intensive traditional method of construction where a timber frame structure is in-filled with brick or rubble then covered with a wire mesh and plastered. The architecture used was that of a rural Caribbean vernacular with hip roofs and wide verandas. Trench Town was a planned community with a hierarchical grid of streets and central sewage and garbage disposal systems.\nTrench Town became famous for the talent which emerged from the project. In the 1950s and 60s bread and milk were delivered door to door, each month the CHA would inspect the residences to ensure compliance and tenants paid their twelve shillings per month on time. Trench Town is mainly known for the vast number of musicians it produced. The community has also produced some of Jamaica's top professional, business and political leaders as well as famous sports and religious personalities. This small area contributed widely to global awareness of the impoverished and politically corrupt conditions in Jamaica.Like the rest of Jamaica, Trench Town became unstable and dangerous in the early 1970s when politics became violent. The two major Jamaican political parties \u2014 the People's National Party and the Jamaica Labour Party \u2013 had emerged in Kingston and violently enforced code that ensured only their party's supporters had access to jobs and services. The lower part of Trench Town below Seventh Street was sympathetic to the JLP, which in the 70s put it at war with its northern neighbor Arnette Gardens, a PNP stronghold. The road connecting the two, Seventh Street, became the front-line in an all-out war which saw the entire two blocks of Government Yards between Fifth Street and Seventh Streets being destroyed. The community's and Jamaica's greatest challenge today is poverty.\nTraditional community organizations such as Boys Town [YMCA] and Joy Town [YWCA] continue to contribute to the welfare of the residents. New organizations such as AIR (Agency for Inner-city Renewal), the Trenchtown Reading Centre [FACE Jamaica], and the Trench Town Development Association, were formed to increase positive social attitudes, increase literacy  and encourage government spending and development in the area. Crime in the neighbourhood has declined; the murder rate in western Kingston has dropped since the mid-1990s.  The Prince of Wales has funded a regeneration project in Rose Town through his Foundation for Building Community.\n\n\n=== Birthplace of reggae ===\nTrench Town is known in popular culture due to numerous ska, rocksteady, and reggae musicians who grew up there, most notably Bob Marley, who spent much of his youth in a \"government yard\" on First Street. His songs \"Trenchtown\", \"Natty Dread\", \"Trenchtown Rock\" and \"No Woman, No Cry\" make reference to it. It was also home to Rastafari elder Mortimo \"Kumi\" Planno, and the following artists and groups:\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nTrench Town Culture Yard Museum\nTrenchtown Reading Centre\nVin Lawrence Park (locally called simply 'the park')\nTrench Town Peace and Justice Centre\n\n\n== Education ==\nTrench Town Primary School\nTrench Town Polytechnic College, Formerly Trench Town High School\nIris Gelly Primary\nCharlie Smith High School\nJones Town Primary\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nDJ Kool Herc (Clive Campbell), DJ and rapper\nAlton Ellis, rocksteady singer and recording artist\nDean Fraser, saxophonist and recording artist\nJoe Higgs, reggae musician and recording artist\nKnowledge (band) (Anthony Doyley, Michael Smith, Delroy Fawlin, Michael Samuels, Earl MacFarlane, Paul Freeman)\nBob Marley reggae singer, songwriter, guitarist and recording artist\nMassive Dread (Dennis James), reggae deejay\nMortimer Planno, Rastafari elder\nErnest Ranglin, composer, guitarist, and recording artist\nCollie Smith, West Indian cricketer\nPeter Tosh (Winston Hubert McIntosh) OM, reggae singer, guitarist, percussionist, recording artist\nBunny Wailer (Neville O'Riley Livingston), reggae singer, songwriter, percussionist, and recording artist\nDelroy Wilson, ska, rocksteady, and reggae singer and recording artist\nAngela Todd, Doctor, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Private Practitioner for over 25 years\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTrenchTown Reading Centre\nVisitJamaica.com \u2013 Trench Town\nAerial view\nBorn In Trench Town documentary",

        "wiki": "Newcastle is a settlement in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. Formerly a military hill station for the British Army it is now a training centre for the Jamaica Defence Force.\nNewcastle became a military centre in the 1840s when Major General Sir William Maynard Gomm, Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica (and Britain's longest serving soldier), observed that yellow fever, a major cause of death among the British troops stationed in Jamaica, was far less prevalent in the mountains.\nAfter unsuccessful attempts to persuade the government to pay for the construction of a military barracks up in the hills, Gomm went ahead with construction of the barracks at the Newcastle coffee plantation on his own initiative.  Construction was subsequently authorised by the Board of Ordnance.  The death toll among the troops posted to the West Indies garrison, formerly regarded as virtually a death sentence, declined dramatically.During the colonial period until 1959, Newcastle was used as a \"change-of-air camp\" by British regiments stationed in Jamaica.  In 1959 Newcastle became the Training Depot of the West Indies Federation's Federal Defence Force. When the Federation was dissolved and Jamaica achieved independence in 1962, Newcastle was part of a general transfer of all military lands in Jamaica to the Jamaican Government.   The Newcastle Barracks are still used by the Jamaica Defence Force as a training centre.The Blue Mountain and John Crow Mountain National Park in which Newcastle is located was established in 1992.  Newcastle lies on the Kingston to Buff Bay road through the National Park.  The Blue Mountains are criss-crossed by trails connecting villages to farms and plantations and other villages and trails from Newcastle to Catherine's Peak and Mt. Horeb are among the attractions for hikers and other visitors to the Park.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPicture of Newcastle at Jamaica Defence Force website (accessed 18 March 2011)\nView of Newcastle in the hills overlooking Kingston at Jamaican Family Search website (accessed 18 March 2011)\n\"New Castle (sic) Training Depot\" page at Jamaica National Heritage Trust website (accessed 18 March 2011)",

        "wiki": "This is a list of episodes for the 1979\u20131985 CBS action-adventure/comedy series The Dukes of Hazzard. The show ran for seven seasons and a total of 147 episodes. Many of the episodes followed a similar structure: \"out-of-town crooks pull a robbery, Duke boys blamed, spend the rest of the hour clearing their names, the General Lee flies and the squad cars crash\". Also, almost every episode would begin with the Duke boys driving along in the General Lee, whether running an errand or just out on a leisurely drive, and inadvertently stumbling upon one of the sheriff's speed traps.\n\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n=== Season 1 (1979) ===\n\n\n=== Season 2 (1979\u201380) ===\nStarting with this season, a new closing sequence was introduced. This time, it shows the General Lee and Rosco's police car going around in circles. This remained in use until the end of the series in 1985. Also at the beginning of this season, the show is now produced by Lou Step Productions.\n\n\n=== Season 3 (1980\u201381) ===\nThis season consisted of 23 episodes.\nSeason 3 brought a big change to the show.  Sonny Shroyer, who played the part of Deputy Enos Strate, was leaving the show to star in a short-lived Dukes of Hazzard spin-off series, called Enos. Rosco's pet dog Flash was introduced in this season. Flash would stay until the end of the series in 1985.\nIn the second episode, Enos was written out of the show as moving to California to take a job with the Los Angeles Police Department. This is the last season to use the Season 2 closing theme.\nDuring the opening credits, Enos is out, and Cletus Hogg (Rick Hurst) is in.\n\n\n=== Season 4 (1981\u201382) ===\n\n\n=== Season 5 (1982\u201383) ===\nByron Cherry and Christopher Mayer were promoted to opening titles starting with this season.\nBeginning with season 5, over a royalties dispute, John Schneider (Bo Duke) and Tom Wopat (Luke Duke) were fired from the series. They were replaced by their cousins Coy Duke and Vance Duke. The show's ratings nosedived and, after 18 episodes, Wopat and Schneider were hired back.\nAccording to the series bible, Luke and Bo's 18-episode absence was due to their competing (and, ultimately, winning big) in the NASCAR circuit. Their return episode has the distinction of featuring all four Duke boys.\nThis season consisted of 22 episodes.\nSonny Shroyer returns as Enos for the rest of the series after the cancellation of the spin-off Enos.\n\n\n=== Season 6 (1983\u201384) ===\n\n\n=== Season 7 (1984\u201385) ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDukes of Hazzard \u2013 list of episodes on IMDb",

      "name": "Port Royal",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Port Royal is a village located at the end of the Palisadoes at the mouth of Kingston Harbour, in southeastern Jamaica. Founded in 1494 by the Spanish, it was once the largest city in the Caribbean, functioning as the centre of shipping and commerce in the Caribbean Sea by the latter half of the 17th century. It was destroyed by an earthquake on 7 June 1692, which had an accompanying tsunami. Severe hurricanes have regularly damaged it. Another severe earthquake occurred in 1907.\nPort Royal was once home to privateers who were encouraged to attack Habsburg Spain's vessels at a time when smaller European powers dared not make war on Spain directly. As a port city, it was notorious for its gaudy displays of wealth and loose morals. It was a popular homeport for the English and Dutch-sponsored privateers to spend their treasure during the 17th century. When those governments abandoned the practice of issuing letters of marque to privateers against the Spanish treasure fleets and possessions in the later 16th century, many of the crews turned pirate. They continued to use the city as their main base during the 17th century. Pirates from around the world congregated at Port Royal, coming from waters as far away as Madagascar.\nAfter the 1692 disaster, Port Royal's commercial role was steadily taken over by the nearby town (and later, city) of Kingston. Plans were developed in 1999 to redevelop the small fishing town as a heritage tourism destination to serve cruise ships. Thoughts were that it could capitalize on its unique heritage, with archaeological findings from pre-colonial and privateering years as the basis of possible attractions.\n\n\n== Colonisation of Port Royal ==\n\n\n=== Taino ===\nThe Taino Native Americans occupied this area for centuries before European settlement. They used the area, which they called Caguay or Caguaya, during their fishing expeditions. Although it is not known whether they ever settled at the spot, they did inhabit other parts of Jamaica.\n\n\n=== Spanish ===\nThe Spanish first landed in Jamaica in 1494 under the leadership of Christopher Columbus. Permanent settlement occurred when Juan de Esquivel brought a group of settlers in 1509. They came in search of new lands and valuable resources, like gold and silver. Instead they began to cultivate and process the sugar cane. Much like the Taino before them, the Spanish did not appear to have much use for the Port Royal area. They did, however, retain its Taino name.Spain kept control of Jamaica mostly so that it could prevent other countries from gaining access to the island, which was strategically situated within the trade routes of the Caribbean. Spain maintained control over the island for 146 years, until the English took control following their invasion of 1655.\n\n\n=== English ===\n\nThe town was captured by England in 1655 during the invasion of Jamaica. By 1659 two hundred houses, shops and warehouses had been built around the fort; by 1692 five forts defended the port.The English initially called the place Cagway but soon renamed it as Port Royal. For much of the period between the English conquest and the 1692 earthquake, Port Royal served as the unofficial capital of Jamaica, while Spanish Town remained the official capital. In 1872 the government designated Kingston, the largest city, as the capital.\n\n\n== Defense of the port ==\nIn 1657, as a solution to his defence concerns, Governor Edward D'Oley invited the Brethren of the Coast to come to Port Royal and make it their home port. The Brethren was made up of a group of pirates who were descendants of cattle-hunting boucaniers (later anglicized to buccaneers), who had turned to piracy after being robbed by the Spanish (and subsequently thrown out of Hispaniola). These pirates concentrated their attacks on Spanish shipping, whose interests were considered the major threat to the town.\nThese pirates later became legal English privateers who were given letters of marque by Jamaica's governor. Around the same time that pirates were invited to Port Royal, England launched a series of attacks against Spanish shipping vessels and coastal towns. By sending the newly appointed privateers after Spanish ships and settlements, England had successfully set up a system of defence for Port Royal. Spain was forced to continually defend their property, and did not have the means with which to retake its land.\n\n\n== 17th-century economy ==\nSpain could not retake the island and, due to pirates, could no longer regularly provide their colonies in the New World with manufactured goods. The progressive irregularity of annual Spanish fleets, combined with an increasing demand by colonies for manufactured goods, stimulated the growth of Port Royal. Merchants and privateers worked together in what is now referred to as \"forced trade.\" Merchants would sponsor trading endeavors with the Spanish, while also sponsoring privateers to attack Spanish ships and rob Spanish coastal towns. While the merchants most certainly had the upper hand, the privateers were an integral part of the operation.\nNuala Zahedieh, a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, wrote, \"Both opponents and advocates of so-called 'forced trade' declared the town's fortune had the dubious distinction of being founded entirely on the servicing of the privateers' needs and highly lucrative trade in prize commodities.\" She added, \"A report that the 300 men who accompanied Henry Morgan to Portobello in 1668 returned to the town with a prize to spend of at least \u00a360 each (two or three times the usual annual plantation wage) leaves little doubt that they were right\".The forced trade became almost a way of life in Port Royal. Michael Pawson and David Busseret wrote \"...one way or the other nearly all the propertied inhabitants of Port Royal seem to have an interest in privateering.\" Forced trade was rapidly making Port Royal one of the wealthiest communities in the English territories of North America, far surpassing any profit made from the production of sugar cane. Zahedieh wrote, \"The Portobello raid [in 1668] alone produced plunder worth \u00a375,000, more than seven times the annual value of the island\u2019s sugar exports, which at Port Royal prices did not exceed \u00a310,000 at this time.\"\n\n\n== Climate ==\nPort Royal has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Aw) with a short dry season from January to April and a lengthy wet season from May to October. Temperatures remain steady throughout the year with the dry season being slightly cooler and range from 25.5 \u00b0C (77.9 \u00b0F) in January to 27.7 \u00b0C (81.9 \u00b0F) in May. The average annual precipitation is 1,345 millimetres (53 in).\n\n\n== Piracy in Port Royal ==\n\nPort Royal provided a safe harbour initially for privateers and subsequently for pirates plying the shipping lanes to and from Spain and Panama. Buccaneers found Port Royal appealing for several reasons. Its proximity to trade routes allowed them easy access to prey, but the most important advantage was the port's proximity to several of the only safe passages or straits giving access to the Spanish Main from the Atlantic. The harbour was large enough to accommodate their ships and provided a place to careen and repair these vessels. It was also ideally situated for launching raids on Spanish settlements. From Port Royal, Christopher Myngs sacked Campeche and Henry Morgan attacked Panama, Portobello, and Maracaibo. Additionally, buccaneers Roche Brasiliano, John Davis and Edward Mansvelt used Port Royal as a base of operations.\nSince the English lacked sufficient troops to prevent either the Spanish or French from seizing it, the Jamaican governors eventually turned to the pirates to defend the city. By the 1660s the city had, for some, become a pirate utopia and had gained a reputation as the \"Sodom of the New World\", where most residents were pirates, cutthroats, or prostitutes. When Charles Leslie wrote his history of Jamaica, he included a description of the pirates of Port Royal:\n\nWine and women drained their wealth to such a degree that [...] some of them became reduced to beggary. They have been known to spend 2 or 3,000 pieces of eight in one night; and one gave a strumpet 500 to see her naked. They used to buy a pipe of wine, place it in the street, and oblige everyone that passed to drink.\nThe taverns of Port Royal were known for their excessive consumption of alcohol such that records even exist of the wild animals of the area partaking in the debauchery. During a passing visit, famous Dutch explorer Jan van Riebeeck is said to have described the scenes:\n\nThe parrots of Port Royal gather to drink from the large stocks of ale with just as much alacrity as the drunks that frequent the taverns that serve it.\nThere is even speculation in pirate folklore that the infamous Blackbeard (Edward Thatch) met a howler monkey, while at leisure in a Port Royal alehouse, whom he named Jefferson and formed a strong bond with during the expedition to the island of New Providence. Recent genealogical research indicates that Blackbeard and his family moved to Jamaica where Edward Thatch, Jr. is listed as being a mariner in the Royal Navy aboard HMS Windsor in 1706. Port Royal benefited from this lively, glamorous infamy and grew to be one of the two largest towns and the most economically important port in the English colonies. At the height of its popularity, the city had one drinking house for every 10 residents. In July 1661 alone, 40 new licenses were granted to taverns. During a 20-year period that ended in 1692, nearly 6,500 people lived in Port Royal. In addition to prostitutes and buccaneers, there were four goldsmiths, 44 tavern keepers, and a variety of artisans and merchants who lived in 2,000 buildings crammed into 51 acres (21 ha) of real estate. 213 ships visited the seaport in 1688. The city's wealth was so great that coins were preferred for payment over the more common system of bartering goods for services.\nFollowing Henry Morgan's appointment as lieutenant governor, Port Royal began to change. Pirates were no longer needed to defend the city. The selling of slaves took on greater importance. Upstanding citizens disliked the reputation the city had acquired. In 1687, Jamaica passed anti-piracy laws. Consequently, instead of being a safe haven for pirates, Port Royal became noted as their place of execution. Gallows Point welcomed many to their death, including Charles Vane and Calico Jack, who were hanged in 1720. About five months later, the famous woman pirate Mary Read died in the Jamaican prison in Port Royal. Two years later, 41 pirates met their death in one month.\n\n\n== The Royal Navy in Port Royal ==\n\nUnder British rule the Royal Navy made use of a careening wharf at Port Royal and rented a building on the foreshore to serve as a storehouse. From 1675, a resident Naval Officer was appointed to oversee these facilities; however, development was cut short by the 1692 earthquake. After the earthquake, an attempt was made to establish a naval base at Port Antonio instead, but the climate there proved disagreeable. From 1735, Port Royal once more became the focus of the Admiralty's attention. New wharves and storehouses were built at this time, as well as housing for the officers of the Yard. Over the next thirty years, more facilities were added: cooperages, workshops, sawpits, and accommodation (including a canteen) for the crews of ships being careened there. A Royal Naval Hospital was also established on land a little to the west of the Naval Yard; and by the end of the 18th century a small Victualling Yard had been added to the east (prior to this ships had had to go to Kingston and other settlements to take on supplies).At the start of the 19th century, a significant amount of rebuilding took place in what was by now a substantial Royal Navy Dockyard serving the fleet in the Caribbean. A sizeable storehouse with a clocktower formed the centrepiece, with a covered way leading from it to the careening wharves. The adjacent Port Admiral's (later Commodore's) House included a watch tower, to counter the threat of privateers. The Yard continued to expand to meet the new requirements of steam-powered vessels: the victualling wharf became a coaling depot in the 1840s, and twenty years later a small engineering complex was built. The Yard continued to expand through to the beginning of the 20th century, but then (with the Admiralty focusing more and more on the situation in Europe) the Navy withdrew from its station in Jamaica and the Dockyard closed in 1905.\nMany of the Dockyard buildings (most of which were of timber construction) were subsequently demolished or destroyed (some in the 1907 Kingston earthquake, others by Hurricane Charlie in 1951). A few remain in place, however, including the Naval Hospital complex, some of the steam engineering buildings and a set of officers' houses. There is also a slipway, completed as late as 1904, which (with its accompanying sheds) was designed for housing and launching torpedo boats, stationed there for the Yard's protection. In 2014, it was announced that some of the Historic Naval Hospital buildings would be restored to house a museum as part of a broader Port Royal Heritage Tourism Project.\n\n\n== Earthquake of 1692 and its aftermath ==\n\nThe town grew rapidly, reaching a population of around 6,500 people and approximately 2,000 dwellings, by 1692. As land on which to build diminished, it became common practice to either fill in areas of water and build new infrastructure on top of it, or simply build buildings taller. Buildings gradually became heavier as the residents adopted the brick style homes of their native England. Some urged the population to adopt the low, wooden building style of the previous Spanish inhabitants, but many refused. In the end, all of these separate factors contributed to the impending disaster.\n\nOn 7 June 1692, a devastating earthquake hit the city causing most of its northern section to be lost \u2013 and with it many of the town's houses and other buildings. Many of the forts were destroyed, as well; Fort Charles survived, but Forts James and Carlisle sank into the sea, Fort Rupert became a large region of water, and great damage was done to an area known as Morgan's Line.Although the earthquake hit the entire island of Jamaica, the citizens of Port Royal were at a greater risk of death due to the perilous sand, falling buildings, and the tsunami that followed. Though the local authorities tried to remove or sink all of the corpses from the water, they were unsuccessful; some simply got away from them, while others were trapped in places that were inaccessible. Improper housing, a lack of medicine or clean water, and the fact that most of the survivors were homeless led to many people dying of malignant fevers. The earthquake and tsunami killed between 1,000 and 3,000 people combined, nearly half the city's population. Disease ran rampant in the next several months, claiming an estimated 2,000 additional lives.The historical Jamaica earthquake of 7 June 1692 can be dated closely not only by date, but by time of day as well. This is documented by recovery from the sea floor in the 1960s of a pocket watch stopped at 11:43 a.m., recording the time of the devastating earthquake.The earthquake caused the sand under Port Royal to liquefy and flow out into Kingston Harbour. The water table was generally only two feet down before the impact, and the town was built on a layer of some 65 feet (20 m) of water-saturated sand. This type of area did not provide a solid foundation on which to build an entire town. Unlike the Spanish before them, the English had decided to settle and develop the small area of land, even while acknowledging that the area was nothing but \"hot loose sand\".\n\nAccording to Mulcahy, \"[Modern] scientists and underwater archaeologists now believe that the earthquake was a powerful one and that much of the damage at Port Royal resulted from a process known as liquefaction.\" Liquefaction occurs when earthquakes strike ground that is loose, sandy, and water-saturated, increasing the water pressure and causing the particles to separate from one another and form a sludge resembling quicksand. Eyewitness accounts attested to buildings sliding into the water, but it is likely some simply sank straight down into the now unstable layer.Underwater archeology, some of which can be seen in the National Geographic Channel show Wicked Pirate City, reveals the foundations of building underwater, showing there was subsidence, as do comparisons of post-earthquake maps and pre-earthquake maps.\nSome attempts were made to rebuild the city, starting with the one third that was not submerged, but these met with mixed success and numerous disasters.  An initial attempt at rebuilding was again destroyed in 1703 by fire.  Subsequent rebuilding was hampered by several hurricanes in the first half of the 18th century, including flooding from the sea in 1722, a further fire in 1750, and a major hurricane in 1774, and soon Kingston eclipsed Port Royal in importance. In 1815, what repairs were being undertaken were destroyed in another major fire, while the whole island was severely affected by an epidemic of cholera in 1850.\n\n\n== 1907 earthquake and more recent history ==\n\nA devastating earthquake on 14 January 1907 liquefied the sand spit, destroying nearly all of the rebuilt city, submerging additional portions, and tilting The Giddy House, an artillery storage room built c. 1880 that is today a minor tourist attraction.Today, the area is a shadow of its former self with a population of less than 2,000 that has little to no commercial or political importance. The area is frequented by tourists, but is in a state of disrepair.  The Jamaican government has recently resolved to further develop the area for its historic and tourist value. This is in part a result of abandonment of plans begun in the early 1960s to develop the town as a cruise ship port and destination. The plans stimulated the archaeological explorations on the site which, in turn, led to the suspension of development solely as a port but now included archaeological and other attractions.In 1981, the Nautical Archaeology Program at Texas A&M University began a 10-year underwater archaeological investigation of the portion of Port Royal that sank underwater during the 17th century.  The program focused on an area that had sunk directly into the sea and suffered very little damage. Due to very low oxygen levels, a large amount of organic material could be recovered. The efforts made by the program have allowed everyday life in the English colonial port city to be reconstructed in great detail.In 1998, the Port Royal Development Company commissioned architectural firm The Jerde Partnership to create a master plan for the redevelopment of Port Royal, which was completed in 2000. The focus of the plan is a 17th-century-themed attraction that reflects the city's heritage. It has two anchor areas: Old Port Royal and the King's Royal Naval Dockyard. Old Port Royal features a cruise ship pier extending from a reconstructed Chocolata Hole harbour and Fisher's Row, a group of cafes and shops on the waterfront. The King's Royal Naval Dockyard features a combination shipbuilding-museum and underwater aquarium with dioramas for views of the native tropical sealife. The Royal Naval Dockyard also includes the headquarters for the Admiral of the Royal Navy. The redevelopment plan also includes a five-star hotel.Today, Port Royal is known to post-medieval archaeologists as the \"City that Sank\". Robert Marx considers it the most important underwater archaeological site in the western hemisphere, yielding 16th\u2013and-17th-century artifacts and many important treasures from indigenous peoples predating its 1518 founding, some from as far away as Guatemala. Several 17th and early 18th century pirate ships sank within Kingston Harbour and are being carefully harvested, under controlled conditions, by various teams of archaeologists. Other \"digs\" are staked out along various quarters and streets by different teams.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nFilm\n\n1934: Port Royal is the one of the settings for the film Captain Blood, starring Errol Flynn.\n1942: Port Royal is the main setting for the film The Black Swan, starring Tyrone Power and George Sanders.\n1953: Port Royal is the \"City Beneath the Sea\" in the film of that name.\n1995: Port Royal appears in the film Cutthroat Island directed by Renny Harlin, shot in Thailand and Malta.\n2003: Port Royal has been featured as a location within Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean film series, though much of the location work for Port Royal was actually done on the island of Saint Vincent, not in Jamaica.Literature\n\n1989: James Michener's historical novel The Caribbean details the history, atmosphere, and geography of Port Royal.\n2009: Extensive scenes in Michael Crichton's posthumous novel Pirate Latitudes take place in Port Royal in the mid-1660s.Video games\n\nThe game Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag has a section where you are in Port Royal.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"360\u00b0 Virtual Tour\".

        "wiki": "Bull Bay is an area located on the southeast coast of Jamaica, 10 miles (16 km) to the east of Kingston on the border between St Andrew and St Thomas, beside Cow Bay. According to folklore, both bays were so named because cattle once roamed the whole area and were slaughtered to provide food for buccaneers and English colonists. Industry in the area includes quarrying for gypsum.\n\n\n== Floods ==\nAs a result of being located in the floodplains of five rivers (the Salt Spring River, Chalky River, Bull Park River, Spring Gut River and the Cane River), Bull Bay has been the subject of several floods. The land is low-lying, with an approximate maximum elevation of 150 feet (46 m) above sea level. The drainage basin is composed of relatively hard and impervious rock structures.The floods in September 2002 followed heavy rainfall that month (3,500 millimetres, 140 in), due to Hurricane Lili. One person died. Local residents described the flood as being the most disastrous since Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988. A contributing factor to the flooding was identified by residents as silt. Some of this comes from local quarries, particularly belonging to Jamaica Gypsum & Quarries Ltd., but local deforestation by residents seeking firewood was also a contributing factor. The dumping of garbage was another factor.\nThe Ten Miles and Eleven Miles areas of Bull Bay are regularly subject to floods. Residents have lost livestock, personal belongings, cars, and houses. They also complained of increased problems with insects and pests, bad roads, and resultant health problems.\n\n\n== Local industries ==\nJamaica Gypsum & Quarries Ltd.\nWalker's Blocks and Quarry\n\n\n== Culture and entertainment ==\nBull Bay is home to a Rastafari community of Bobo Ashanti known as Bobo Hill. The area also contains several nightclubs.\nSun Coast Adventure Park \u2013 Jamaica's first and largest paintball facility\nBob Marley Beach\nCane River Falls \u2013 Bob Marley's favourite place to wash his dreadlocks\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nBilly \"Mystic\" Wilmot - guitarist, vocalist, songwriter and surfer\nJavon \"Donkey Man\" Francis - Jamaican sprinter.\nJada \"Jada Kingdom\" Murphy - singer, songwriter\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The exemptions level of knowledge and customer service from all the staff members of this museum made me so happy I\u2019m Jamaican. It was unbelievable that someone could retain so much knowledge. Definitely worth going!",
          "The history and the photographs are really informative. I really enjoyed the murals of the Wailers and the statue of Bob Marley - very nice!!!",
          "Tour was very eye opening into the life of Bob. Tour offers allow you to feel connected to the singer understand why he wrote certain songs and how his life was.",
          "The guided tour was a bit fast, sometimes we didn't have enough time to look around, but it provided a great overview of Bob Marley's work and life. I'd recommend to do it after the Trench Town Culture Yard to follow the stages of Marley's journey.",
          "The whole family (ages 8 thru 63) loved this tour. Our tour guide was funny and knowledgeable and his love for Bob Marley and his music was very obvious",
          "This one-hour tour will be considered excellent by a number of tourists whose knowledge of Jamaica is primarily Bob Marley and his music. As with many of the Jamaican tours, this expensive one too is quoted in U.S. dollars so it typically caters to attracting tourists to gain",
          "The tour was well organized and very informative. As a local and practically knowing about Bob Marley all my life, I still learned so much. You can't take pictures inside the house but you can take pictures around the yard and with the statue at the front. I'd recommend anyone",
          "This guided tour simply brings Bob Marley back to life. Between meeting Bongo Herman, playing instruments and getting to see how Bob Marley lived, it feels like the King of Reggae could return tomorrow!",
          "I absolutely loved this tour. It was very informative and interesting. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and presented the information in a fun and engaging way. Learning about this legend was truly amazing.",
          "The visit to the Bob Marley Museum was an intensely emotional one for me. My friend and I were overwhelmed with tears as we entered the museum, which is situated on the site of the legendary musician\u2019s home, purchased in 1975. This was Marley\u2019s home until his death from cancer",
          "The tour guide Ricky was entertaining but the tour was mediocre at best. If you like looking at record covers and an a traditional Caribbean style house you may enjoy the tour. I guess they don't allow you to take photos so you won't remember how boring the experience was.",
          "All I can say is that this is a must do when in Jamaica. No matter if you are a huge fan like myself or not. The house is beautiful and well kept. The guide knew his stuff and even sang for us. I truly enjoyed the tour and Kenny/Kenneth was incredible and a great singer and",
          "If you're a fan of Bob Marley, this place is a must visit! The guide took us through each of the rooms and explained all of Bob Marley's achievements. She encouraged the group to sing his songs and it was very interactive! \ud83d\ude04 One of the rooms included his recording studio and",
          "All 4 of us went on this all day trip to Kingston. We pulled up and once stretched the legs after the journey, we had a look around the grounds before being led inside. The museum is also what once the recording studios, and it is stacked in all the history of Bob Marley and the",
          "This was a wonderful day out from our hotel in Montego Bay, to see the capital and also take in the museum/recording studios of Bob Marley. Our 1st visit to Jamaica we did the 9 miles excursion to see the birth/resting place of Bob Marley and his mum. This is where the music was",
          "What a fantastic tour. Stayed in montego bay. Well worth the visit Stefan the tour guide amazing thanks guys.xx",
          "My visit to the Bob Marley museum was indeed a very awesome one. I will always have fond memories of this trip. There was so much nostalgia associated with it and i gave me a renewed appreciation for the man Bob Marley. All those songs he penned - the lyrics are very profound",
          "Students really enjoyed this tour of Bob Marley's adult home and the assortment of artifacts there. Great, interactive tour concluded by a moving documentary. Enriching educational experience about this fascinating figure in Jamaican history and life.",
          "This was my 2nd time visiting the museum in 3 months. The 1st time it was well narrated and the guide took time to answer questions. I went on Monday June 3rd and had a female guide for the 2:00 tour. She didn't answer questions and we were rushed. Furthermore, Bob Marley had a",
          "Another must visit if you are a Bob Marley fan, to see such a place is fantastic how they keep the memory of Bob Marley going years after his passing. Congratulations to the staff for a wonderful time.",
          "A short ($5) taxi ride from our hotel (also, walking distance), we enjoyed the tour of the Marley house/museum. In a city having few tourist destinations, this becomes a highlight. Only accessible by a guided, group tour, you see a recording studio and lots of memorabilia.",
          "This visit stirred my emotions. The tour is very well narrated by wonderful young staff that pride themselves in sharing the story of the legend Bob Marley. Must see when in Jamaica!",
          "The Museum was not what I expected at all. It was fascinating to experience were a man who wanted more for his country and fellowman than he himself. A man whos children saw his legacy live on who was robbed of his life too early. If you live in or visit Jamaica visit Bob",
          "Our party of 15 from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. visited the Museum in May 2019. We were blown away with Oshanes passionate delivery. He was engaging and knowledgable. There were moments. during the tour that we could not have been convinced that he wasn't a grandchild",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the knowledge of Oshe, our guide. He took time to explain Bob Marley's life accomplishment. Every room had such a personal touch. The video at the end was a nice treat. Gift shop right after the tour.",
          "We had a wonderful time at the Bob Marley museum. Our guide was lovely, she told us all kinds of stories, knew a lot about the origins and was cheerfully singin Bob's songs. The house is in a good state and shows a lot of facets of his life. The mark this man left on the world",

          "Great guided tour. Pointed out some of the interesting things about Bob Marley and his family. Lovely to see where and how he lived. Time passes quickly on the tour and the groups aren\u2019t too big so you can hear everything that is being told to you and ask questions. Good",
          "This was my 2nd time here. My partner's 1st. Wow!! The 2nd time around was so fantastic. Had a different guide this time. She was charismatic & so passionate about her job which was commendable. I'm really sorry I forgot her name. People please obey the rules of the tour which",
          "We had a good time but the tour was ok, but a tad cheesey. We were a little underwhelmed because we expected to see more. The tour guide Ricky was very entertaining.",
          "Amazing facts, amazing stuff that was owned by bob, and amazing tour guide. Very fun and interesting at the same thing.",
          "Very interesting tour and an eye opener to see how simply Bob Marley lived. Felt like we saw modern day history first hand. Would definitely recommend",
          "Great museum although the tour felt very rushed. Disappointed no photos were allowed to be taken in the museum.",
          "Our fantastic guide (Irie Sue?) made the tour a treat. It was great to see artefacts that had belonged to Bob scattered around this old house (now the museum). Special props for allowing a visit Bob\u2019s recording studio \u2014that was simply amazing!",
          "I think the title says it all !! Must visit the home/museum of the King of Reggae in Kingston. Also, don't forget to try the smoothies in the cafe there and don't trip if you get the occasional whiff of the 'herb'......",

          "I visited the Bob Marley Museum today anybody who visits Jamaica must see this museum It was Bob\u2019s house in Kingston, his recording studio, where he played football, where he rehearsed, and where he hung out. It\u2019s also where unidentified gunmen tried to assassinate him - you can",
          "This tour took me all the back to when I was a child listening to Bob Marley's LP's spinning...the grainy sound and pure good vibes. I hardly listened to the Tour Guide... I'm glad I experience this icons Home..",
          "If you love Bob Marley even a little bit, a visit to this museum is a must. 56 Hope Road was Bob\u2019s house in Kingston, his recording studio, where he played football, where he rehearsed, and where he hung out. It\u2019s also where unidentified gunmen tried to assassinate him - you",
          "A little difficult to find the location, since there are no directions signs on the road, but thanks for Waze! that solved the problem. You don\u2019t need to take an organized tour, you can just go by yourself. There is parking for cars on the premises. This is a great museum for",
          "We felt obliged to go to this museum whilst in Kingston, but it turned out to fantastic particularly because of our excellent \"guide\" Evi Jo who was a one woman show with a fantastic voice that brought the whole experience alive - to call her a guide is a dis-service she was",
          "I first visited the museum in 2017 and was blown away... see my previous review. Irie Sue is a QUEEN. My family returned to Jamaica for Reggae Month and had the honor & privilege of visiting on Bob's 74th birthday for the concert and celebration. Y'all... this was unlike",
          "I spent my morning at the Bob Marley museum, it was fabulous. It was pretty busy because of the influx of travellers for Buju LWTF concert. I had a great time seeing the real home of legend Bob Marley. I learned some cool new facts and enjoyed myself.",
          "My sister and I went to the Bob Marley museum yesterday and absolutely loved it!! Firstly, our tour guide, Irie-Sue, was so colorful and full of energy; I think if she spent 2 hours talking with us about the plumbing in the house, we still would have loved it!!! She sang verses",
          "The museum is great and informative and our tour guide was an amazing story teller. We enjoyed learning more about Bob Marley and the history and politics. If you are going to Kingston this is a must.",
          "As a huge Bob Marley fan, I was very disappointed with the fact that you can't take pictures inside the house. You can outside, and you can also stay there as long as you want. The grounds are nice, and it's good to see this place with your own eyes after seeing in on film so",
          "This was a real tour experience. Got a glimpse in the past; hear all the stories about Bob his struggles and that of his band and family in early music life. Loved every bit of it... the house, theatre, gift shop and the ital restaurant. very chill environment. the only thing",
          "This is a great museum for everyone, including those who might not know much of Bob Marley from before. I am not proud to say that I didn\u2019t know much about the guy before I came, I had only heard a few of his songs before. But after hearing about his career and what he did, and",
          "Learning about the reggae legend was certainly a great and emotional experience. Seeing his home, recording studio and the property all together made for an emotional visit into his life. Unfortunately no photos of the inside are allowed.",
          "If you got about 2 hours to spend in Kingston this is a nice place to see, especially if you like Bob Marley. The tour guides were really cool and incredibly knowledgeable, our even sing some songs by Bob Marley to get us in to the mood and as part of his story telling.",
          "I visited the Bob Marley museum in Kingston, Jamaica with some friends. I found it to be extremely informational. At first, I didn\u2019t think it was going to be that amazing. I thought what can they possibly talk about. It turned out the tour guide was very informative,",
          "Standing the a room with a real Grammy Award was cool. I didn't know much about Bob Marley, but now I do!",
          "A little difficult to find. they could do with a bigger sign off the road, but once there it was very interesting and informative and a must go to attraction for anyone even remotely interested in the life of Bob Marley. The tour guides were incredibly knowledgeable and",
          "If you visit jamaica and Kingston then you must visit the house of Bob Marley. If you want to see the house from inside you have to take a well guided tour. If you come with your own (rental) car then you can park inside the premises, just drive you car in front of the gate and",
          "I nearly blanched when I as the price-even with the teacher discount it cost more than most museums in Europe-but the tour and guide (ShAne) were both great, 90 minutes together, and though I'm a mediocre Bob Marley fan (2 albums only) I really enjoyed it. You can tell that",
          "Was really looking forward to visiting here and it is an informative tour and you do get a big insight to Bobs life and music more so here than at nine miles, unfortunately to bring home memories you need to keep them in your mind and heart as you are not allowed to take any",
          "What an excellent trip . Very emotional. The guide was brilliant and so informative. I loved this trip",
          "Kenny was a good, informative and humorous guide through Bob Marley's home. It was awesome to see his gold and silver records displayed in a former guest room upstairs. It was very cool to see a Grammy award up close and his bedroom and his love of denim! They have taken care",
          "Don't think you're going to Kingston without visiting one of the places where the legend himself lived! The Hope Road house is a must see, but just one of the landmarks of Bob Marley's life in Jamaica.",
          "My company was hosting some internationals for a conference, and figured one of the best places in Kingston to showcase the rich heritage of Jamaica and one of its most popular exports (reggae music, of course) would be the Bob Marley Museum. I could go on and on about the",
          "We went because it was on our sons bucket list. He was even disappointed. The most interesting thing we saw was someone trying to sell us the largest joint I have ever seen in my life. Our guide was so stoned that his eyes were barely open and red. You weren\u2019t allowed to smoke",
          "This place is an absolute must to visit! You can't go to Jamaica and not visit this place. Bob is a legend in Jamaica and part of their whole culture. Everywhere you go in Jamaica you will hear his music so even if you aren't a fan you should experience this and Nine Mile too.",
          "If you go to Jamaica this museum is a must. Our guide was really knowledgeable and passionate about the life and history of Bob Marley. The museum itself has a great vibe with lots of memorabilia, including bullet holes. If you like music you have to go",
          "Regardless if you like reggae/Bob or not, a visit is a must. You will be surprised how famous Bob is in Jamaica. You walk through the place with a guide, she had us singing Bob\u2019s lyrics (!), and gets the history. It is worth visiting. You can eat at the museums restaurant. The",
          "A beautiful day people from all across the world enjoy a day of Bobs Music. The music transcends your soul and you get the picture of what it would be like if we all would see our likeness and not our differences. If you are in the Kingston Area for the birthday celebration it",
          "Too expensive for what it really is. I guess that unless you're a big fan (which I am not) it's not really worth it",
          "I previously visited 9 mile where Bob Marley is buried, so visiting here added to the trajectory of learning the true culture of who he was to music, his birth country of Jamaica and the entire world! This tour and learning experience was everything! Might I add, I love that",
          "Very enthusiastic guide. House intact but very little furnishings. Lots of album covers and photos. Film at the end touching",
          "Myself and a colleague took a break from powerpoint to visit the Bob Marley museum as we\u2019d heard good things. It did not disappoint. Admittedly I did not know much about the great man and our tour guide soon started to fill in all the details of Bob\u2019s life and passion. The",

          "The tour guides at the Bob Marley Museum really gave us a lot of insights into his life, and it was cool to see where he had been shot and lived. The grounds are pretty small though, so it's hard for super large groups. It was definitely enjoyable and worth seeing, but you can't",
          "It is so worth the money. My children and I loved our tour. Our tour guide had the voice of an angel and we learned so many fascinating facts about a remarkable man. My children and I will never forget our time spent in his home. We also paid for the Tuff Gong studio tour. It",
          "Very surreal. It is a perfect setting for Bob Marley (and his brother\u2019s) mausoleum. The guides are knowledgeable and helpful. So pretty. The ride got out in the country side and you got to see how the people live. Also stopped at Bumper Lawn for some excellent jerk chicken",
          "We really enjoyed our visit and our tour guide was excellent he had a great knowledge of the life of Bob Marley along with know,edge of his friends & family. Some very interesting pieces to see and learn about, I especially like the rooms that were still preserved as actual",

          "Decent place to spend an hour. I came to the museum not knowing anything about Bob Marley so the information was interesting. No photo policy inside the museum which is unfortunate. After the tour ends they trap you at the very end to watch a 30 minute video on Bob Marelys life.",
          "This was actually one of Bob Marley\u2019s home. In the yard of this residence is where there was an attempt on his life. Tour guides are very knowledgeable and have ajamaican charm. Worth the time.",

          "I really liked this place as I came there with my Jamaican friend who lives in Kingston and never been in the museum anyway. We had AMAZING guide. She was singing all the time, knew everything about Bob Marley, his life and his family. I paid 2500 J$ entry but worth every penny.",
          "It was amazing to learn more about Bob Marley and his legacy. The tour guides were great and shared more about the historical, personal, and musical aspects of all that represented Bob Marley. It is worth visiting and gaining additional perspectives and appreciation!",

          "The tour guides of this stop are very full of information here you will see all the records produced, even a visit from Bob Marley him self you must come stop by to see what this means. Enjoy listening to the stories of the past. Enjoy taking in all the sights the sounds of",
          "This was an interesting tour. It was a long ride for this short tour. I was also very hot inside.It really showed how modest Bob Marley was. Although it was a long ride for a short tour, I could not image coming to Jamaica and not visiting the museum.",
          "A great tour for an hour if your local to the museum, as we had to drive for 4 hours there & 4 hours back, I was a bit disappointed, great knowledge of a great legend, just not worth an 8 hour drive for 1 hour tour.",

          "So much rich history about Caribbean music. Loved being there in house that musical icons recorded music and lived in. Worth the visit.",
          "As a fan of Bob Marley this was a neat place to visit. If you don\u2019t particularly enjoy him... this could just be out of the way for you. The tour itself is short, but informative. The trip up to Nine Mile shows you a very different part of the Jamaican countryside.",

          "This museum has a special atmosphere. We had a really nice friendly guide, met a drummer that cooperated with Bob himself and he was teaching us how to play some special instruments. It was real fun. Even though it might seem that the entry fee is kind of high, it\u00b4s definitely",
          "Loved everything about this tour even if photography is prohibited inside. Learned so much but the thing that made the tour come to life was our tour guide, Oshane. He made the museum come to life. Well worth the time and money spent.",

          "Bob Marley Museum - confused why everything had to be a rush and why you need a Guide. I would've preferred walking around at my leisure and enjoying Bob's legacy. It wasn't busy when I visited.",
          "I really enjoyed my visit here. After driving past it regularly it was good to finally visit. As a Bob Marley fan it's great to be able to walk around the house that he called his home and walk in the grounds where he played football. You get to see the bullet holes in the",

          "Warning, this is not ideal for kids or non pot smokers, but it is a great way to get close to Bob Marley. You get to see his house and mausoleum and truly get in the spirit of reggae. Some downsides, though: It's a very long, arduous trip to get there. In fact, most of the time",
          "Worth a hour to stroll through and see Bob and how Bob lived. No big surprises here. All nice to see",
          "This was the best tour ever. However it is very hot inside and no photography of anytime is allowed. The museum's shop is a tad bit over priced and the cds they sale are extremely overpriced. The very last part of the museum is the ABSOLUTE BEST! I would love to visit the",

          "What a wonderful experience! This isn't a museum where you wander around, read a few things, and head out. This guided tour brings Bob Marley's history alive. The fabulous tour guide's passion for Bob and his music came through in his description of every photo, song, and item.",
          "We recently visited the Bob Marley Museum, which is actually his final home before he passed away. There is so much to see at this museum, the home showcases some of Bob Marley's best known outfits that he made himself and wore both on stage and when he played his beloved",

          "Being in Jamaica and missing out on Bob Marley would be unforgivable but i could only do one of these: Nine Mile Mausoleum or Kingston Museum. It was a tough decision, both are very good according to reviews, but Kingston is more preferable even thou i had to drive from Ocho",

          "My friends and I got a private shuttle to take us to the museum (Jacques Tours Jamaica). The grounds are colorful and welcoming. It was a great tour of the house and studio. Lots of information and we got to watch a documentary at the end in a air conditioned theater. Very cool",

          "As general music lovers the Bob Marley Museum was high on our list, however we were mildly disappointed to find the tour was more of a karaoke session than an informative narrative. My husband and I are familiar with Marley's music and were hoping to learn more about his life.",

          "If you visit Jamaica you have to visit here. It was really interesting, we had a great guide. They should have played his music tho. There is a not bad souvenir shop. We were on a tour so it seemed a bit rushed.",
          "Expensive and money grab - beware of the pressure for additional tipping. Place is under construction and areas need repair. Should have music playing during the tour. Often rushed through the tour to get completed it seemed like inside the home...",

          "If you know about him,you will enjoy the tour. If you dont ,then I call it terrible.But the 40 mins documentary will give you more information. I would rather say it is more informative than entertaining ,in my case as i didnt know about him prior my visit .",

          "It wouldn't be a proper visit to Jamaica without doing something involving Bob Marley. We travelled from Ocho Rios to Kingston to visit the home come museum of Bob Marley. We arrived at this attraction and paid for the tour. You can not go inside the house alone, you must wait",
          "This was absolutely brilliant, the young girl that was our guide was fantastic, even trying to sing some songs, well worth the trip",

          "It's a must do and it's great to hear the different music as you go around. Our guide told us lots about being a rasta and their way of life too and regularly broke into song. He also involved the group and was really interactive. Good shop at the end for higher quality",

          "If you\u2019re in Kingston or anyplace on the island, this is a must stop, whether you\u2019re a Marley fan or not since his music played such a significant role in the life and culture of Jamaicans. We had a very knowledgeable guide names Johjoy who made the visit extremely interesting",

          "I was a bit disappointed with this museum. First, it is very expensive in my opinion (25 USD per person). Second, it is only about his music which might be enough for some people but Bob Marley is more than just Reggae Music and this part is not shown in that museum and not",
          "A very good experience abet lasts way to long. You really need to be a avid fan to enjoy the tour to its most. Expensive to say the least. Child is charged $14/(4 year old) which is a rip off. Good day if an avid fan",
          "This is a great place to visit while in Kingston. Learned a lot about Bob Marley.It is a must do while there.",
          "It\u2019s amazing to see what they have done with the place and how they have managed to conserve it the way it is. Do the tour wether you are a Bob Marley fan or not. Guaranteed by the end of it you will find not only a new found appreciation for him but for Jamaica as a whole.",
          "It's interesting if you are into music. Displays of gold discs. Gift shop is a little overpriced and you can get the music more cheaply in UK, but hey you can say you bought your marley in kingston!",
          "Travelled from Negril to Kingston to visit the museum and if your a fan, it\u2019s a must see! Downside is it\u2019s busy and so the tour is alittle rushed and you have one group waiting on another once your in the house. Outside the house you are free to roam and take as many pictures as",
          "Great little tour however a little disappointing the formation of the wailers gets little mention, especially Peter and Bunny. The museum is all about Bob and his music and is highly organized and professional, however, the original wailers need to be implemented as Bob didn\u2019t",
          "Overall I enjoyed the experience of the tour the tour guide was excellent, funny and full of energy with a real passion for bob's history. The downsides were the rooms weren't air conditioned which at times made the tour uncomfortable other than that I really enjoyed the",

          "I'm a big fan of Bob Marley. The museum was his house in Kingston. It includes some of this gold records and awards. It requires a docent to take you through the rooms. Our docent was very good and entertaining.",
          "This for me was one of the better value tours lasting 1 hour 40 mins. It was nice to get a history of his life and where he stayed and made his music. Tour guide was nice and sang some songs for us and talked about the Rastafarian religion which was insightful. I\u2019d go again",
          "Visited here as part of the \u2018a splash of reggae\u2019 excursion with Thomson. After a long journey from Negril, I can say it definitely wasn\u2019t worth it. We arrived and went straight up to the bar whilst we waited for our tour guide. You can buy a Bob Marley shot for $10 and other",
          "We went to the Bob Marley Museum because whilst you're in Jamaica, you've gotta go somewhere to do with Bob Marley!! The tour itself was good and our tour guide was very helpful and informative. But the tour only lasted half an hour and it was boiling hot - to the point that a",
          "I didn't come with great expectations, but I was aactually still negatively suprised. You pay 25 USD (or 2500 Jay, if you want to save some) for a tour of about 80 minutes. The tour guide, Ricky, I believe, was actually quite entertaining, but thats already the good part. You go",
          "Yes, it is a must on a trip to Kinston of course. and yes i did like some of his music, but they have tried to do too much to the place I think.",
          "I saw this on the main road as I was passing and thought I must go there. So glad I did. It's a guided tour and you can't go around the house on your own but the thrill for me was that I had no idea that it was the house where he actually lived. The tour guide was knowledgeable",
          "The Legend lived here and recorded all the beautiful songs we still hear and cherish .... this place reminded me of the song No woman No cry and this is the place which still saves the treasure of Bob Marley's unreleased songs which I await to hear some day !!!",

          "Working overseas and wanted to fit this in. Our host was Vanessa who was sparky and sharp who made it fun, educational and melancholy at the right time. The man was a genius taken far too early - sad that the concept of one love is farther away then ever Visit this place and",
          "An hour and a bit away from Montego Bay, the Bob Marley tour is hidden in the hills of Nine Mile. It is a bumpy journey in the mountains but was totally worth it. The moment you get of the bus, you have the opportunity to purchase some local herbs to enrich the experience.",
          "What a waste of money and time.A shell of a house with a few rooms of discs and awards,2 cut down pairs of his shorts,a couple of shirts,and denim covered bed.Our guide seemed so content at showing us her vocal range and singing prowess at every opportunity,with a painful",
          "The museum is quite small, we saw 3 or 4 rooms of the house that Bob lived in, listened to the musicians play a few of Bob's songs and then visited Cedella and Bob in their mausoleums. Yes it is possible to buy weed products to smoke, eat or take away with you - if this is",
          "Great tour on the history and a Jamaican icon's life and legacy. The tour is organization and just enough time to get a sense of who Bob was and what he offered as a music icon. Highly recommend this tour.",
          "Our tour guide was amazing she was so lively and made the tour very interesting. It is a shame that I can't remember her name. I think the $25 charge is a bit much and perhaps they need to have a family rate. Also the history of Bob was a bit watered down and focused a lot on",
          "I learned so much about Bob Marley during this tour that I had never heard before. The museum alone which is his actual home converted, brings the legend to life in a powerful way. For example - the bullet hole from the assassination attempt remains. The tour guides are",
          "This is just a tourist grab. They provide no history education not a single thing except ways to get you to spend money there. I see why those who stay in a resort all week want to go. In a resort you don't get a true Jamaican experience. This is sold as just that. It is",
          "This is my 6th time to Jamaica but my first to Kingston.. We visited the museum yesterday, didn't pre book but got there just in time to catch the last tour.. 2 hour tour with a great guide who was entertaining and had a great voice.. sang as we walked around. $25 US to get in",
          "Bob Marley museum is well worth a visit. You get a peak into his life, expertly recounted by Shane our guide. There is lots to see and you have opportunity to ask questions and explore the house and grounds. There is a great film at the end of the tour and a cafe that you can",
          "Definitely a great experience.... our tour guide was very knowledgeable. She made the tour very fun and interactive \"Irie Mon!\" Great souvenirs too! :)",
          "First of all the choice of location is poor.. a house on a busy street and the entrance just off the highway.. u likely to miss it first time.. Then the $25 surcharge.. the security says you cant see anything unless one pays.. and i was already aware there wasnt much to see",
          "After an hour & 20 minute guided tour of this rather quaint museum, the only thing I learned is that Bob, like myself, has a love for blue denim shirts! No pictures are allowed in this home and its certainly understandable why, for there is little to capture. Well, aside from",
          "Definitely a must see on your next trip to Kingston. The tour was very informative. You felt Bob's spirit.",
          "The Bob Marley Museum was a major disappointment. We were charged $95.00 per person, which was too expensive. We were reluctant to pay this amount. However, we wanted to find out more information about this iconic figure. Unfortunately, this experience was not worth $95.00",
          "Pros Highly knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff Cons $25 per person Must be in a tour group No pictures inside the house Things to be noted: A substantial amount of time is watching a video of his performances Some rooms were unavailable when I visited There is a small",
          "As a huge fan of Bob Marley since I was 13 years old it was a highlight of my holiday to visit the museum And it didn't disappoint. Some fabulous memories were revisited here. Our guide was very cool. Young guy. There were only 4 of us on his tour. The other couple were French",
          "The Bob Marley Museum is the site of the home he lived in with his family before his death in 1981. As a longtime fan, and having lived in Jamaica when he died, it was really special to be there. But it was a typical tourist attraction, our host was quite cheesy and didn't",
          "We paid $25 per person. Tiny property and really not much too see. Just an overrated photo op. Unless you are a hard core Bob fan I don\u2019t see how one can justify the cost.",
          "As a huge Bob Marley fan I really enjoyed the museum. It was really interesting to tour his home and learn new things about Bob Marley and his family. Our tour guide was really knowledgeable and funny. I highly recommend the Bob Marley museum.",
          "Sure, if you like Bob Marley, you'll be going regardless of ratings! Is a guided tour of his house, our guide was very enthusiastic which made it enjoyable. Tour lasts around 1.5 hours although 20 mins of that is a film. Nice old relics, would have liked a bit more info about",
          "cool place... bob marley has been an inspiration for me and his music.. very happe to visit an important house. unfortunally is far, it takes 2 hours by a dificult road and almost loose my cruise for that reason, but it was an amazing experience",
          "The tour is about 90 mins and you get to view the inside of Bob Marley's house. This was a nice experience for me. I felt like I got to learn a lot about him that I didn't know before. The house was built in the 1800s but a lot of it is in the original condition in which Mr.",
          "Interesting tour of bob Marley house. Saw his platinum records, Grammy and rooms in the house and the studio where he made music. Saw the shot room where is was attacked by gunmen and survived the shooting. Could be a better experience with more immersive interaction and better",
          "The tour is very informative. A good look into the life and history of the iconic Bob Marley. A bit pricey, bit long...it is the Caribbean so expect it to be a bit warm/hot at times on the outside. The tour guides are very informative and you get to meet a gentleman who played",
          "Loved this place and the tour guide was excellent . We bought tickets and wait around 15 minutes before the tour started. Overall , a good time",
          "I was visiting some friends in Kingston who live there so we were looking for some things to do with our children. We were considering taking our children to the Bob Marley Museum. The website advertised that students of Jamaica would be eligible to pay a rate of $5. Because my",
          "I never really considered myself a Bob Marley fan--but I do like his music and I love the history of music. It seemed a must do thing when in Kingston and I am glad we did. It was interesting to get to know more about him and learn the values he lived by. The tour guide was",
          "You can really feel the presence of all the great people who have spent time in that house! We had Stephan as our guide and he was adorable and great. The tour was very informative and just being in there was so amazing. If you are a Marley fan, YOU MUST DO THIS! We stayed in",
          "At 25.00 USD for the tour of the actual house in which the Legendary Robert Nesta Marley lived, what can I say? It's a bargain. Bear in mind that if you're a local it's pricey and non-English speakers will need an interpreter. Besides the walk-through, one can see and touch",
          "Very interesting for those who love Bob. Worth a visit, you'll learn a lot more about this legend called Bob Marley that left behind a history.",
          "I absolutely loved this Museum. I was so excited going here and I was not disappointed at all. The house is beautiful and it was wonderful to get the opportunity to walk around and get some sort of an idea of Bob Marleys life. Very interesting. I would definitely recommend this",
          "Wow....Great visit, wonderful experience. My eyes were filled with tears learning Bob Marley's story and legacy.... Becky's a great guide and has a beautiful voice!",
          "A bit too commercial, get rid of the car park and really bring it back to the way it was. The guide was enthusiastic, but maybe a little too much. Asking for tips......a big no no! Too many signs get in the way of picture taking.",
          "A must visit for anyone even remotely touched by the music of Bob Marley and the Wailers. As a long time fan - I learnt a lot more about the great man - & my wife became an immediate fan. Our guide was very informative & got the whole group participating in the fun. This is a",
          "It was interesting to see Bob Marley's former house and recording studio, and the tour guides were very knowledgeable and funny. However, you're not allowed to take any pictures inside the museum itself, and it was rather strange seeing him deified, so to speak. A little over",
          "This was my favorite part of the trip. The bus ride up the mountain was long but super beautiful view along the way. Driving through the small towns made me feel like I was seeing the not so tourist part of the island. When we got there people were selling the herb which I",
          "This tour takes about 2 hours, so come prepared to absorb. You aren't walking far, but there is a lot to hear about the Legend. Stay for the movie at the end of the tour to see an interview with Bob.",
          "I enjoyed the visit. After the tour with a very enthusiastic guide, I can say the entrance fee was high. I'm sorry you're not allowed to take pictures. Nice souvenirs but quite expensive for me. Visiting the Bob Marley Museum is a thing to do if you're into him.",
          "I know things in Jamaica are expensive, but this is ridiculously overpriced for what it is. The house and gardens are in good condition, and the guide was very knowledgable about Bob Marley - even claiming to know him from Trenchtown days (however he was probably much too young",
          "Went there to see the museum, and was lucky to have a guided tour - that i can recommend, the tour would not be the same without. Our guide was could tell us a lot about Bob Marley and Jamaicam culture, music - and this was a tour of the Bob Marley history i will always remember.",
          "One of the best museums I've ever visited. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and very amiable! I was riveted from the beginning to the end of the tour. Bob's house is so worth the visit (\u00e7a vaut vraiment le coup)!! I've been twice already and hope to go again this summer!!!",
          "So I was curious about the Bob Marley Museum and what it had to offer me as a local. I thought that as a local, it would take some doing to impress me. The museum is not aesthetically modern, which is fine. There were a lot of souvenirs to be bought, I thought they were",
          "I went with my husband and daughter on May of 2017. When we arrived at the museum, it was a bit scare as the people from the area jump to offer you marijuana. They open the big doors from the museum very quickly. Don't be scare as they smoke marijuana in front of you even the",
          "We went and had the tourist experience. It was very informative and the guides made the tour interactive and fun.",
          "I enjoyed the tour of the museum. I learned a lot about Bob Marley. My grandparents are Jamaican and it was interesting to hear and view the beginning of Reggae music and its influences around the world.",
          "It was a cool activity, completely design for tourist and about \u00a320 the entrance fee. The staff is really friendly and make it all more fun and chilled.",
          "It's definitely worth the price. You get to learn so much about the man, the legend, Robert Nesta Marley.",
          "There was a film which chronicled Bob's experience from the ghetto to stardom. It provided snippet of interviews he has had that unearthed his thinking of inequality and sufferings of the struggling class.",
          "We visited Jamaica for 3 weeks and visited the museum twice in 2 groups. Outside the ticket booth, there's a snack stand & a little hut at the back parking lot for fresh juices and herbal refreshments. A few of our non-herbal friends ate the brownies and were too hot to enjoy",
          "We visited the Bob Marley museum as part of our day off during our time in Kingston and I found it fascinating even though I wouldn't exactly call myself a Bob fan. His life story was told by a very capable female guide who not only showed us round the inside of the property",
          "We all know this legends name we have an idea of what he means to Jamaican people we know his music has reach the corners of the earth but do we actually know his history if you don't then do yourself a favor pay the $25usd and be prepared to learn much . If you are able I would",
          "This was actually much more interesting than I had expected. I love reggae music so enjoyed the tour. The guide was very knowlegable and the movie was great. Too bad the man died so young.",
          "Well, its a great stop, our tour guide knew lots about Bob Marley, i am a fan so naturally its not an objective review... i think its great to hear about a legend who sang songs with meaning, and how his songs still are beautiful even today. Not like todays artists who cant",
          "I love reggae music and although not an avid fan of Bob Marley, I have an appreciation of his music I have to say I loved this tour and found out so much more about how Bob Marley's influence was felt around the world as well as in his local community Great tour guide called",
          "We visited the museum in April 2016, and it was a pleasant experience. Could I live without the experience? Probably. In saying that, there is not a lot to do in Kingston as opposed to some of the other touristy destinations i.e. Negril, Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, so this was a",
          "As a lifelong fan of the great Bob Marley, this trip was high on my list of things to do in Jamaica. Our guide, Jah Fire was awesome. Very interactive and informative and a great singer. The tour starts outside where we were given a brief history of the property and background",
          "The tour cost $25pp. You meet up with your tour guide and about 5-8 others. The tour starts outside and then a walk through of Bob Marley's home. However, if you have difficulty navigating stairs this trip may be difficult as you have to climb stairs inside the home. The tour is",
          "I never thought I'd ever be able to visit Hope Street. One of my top bucketlist items checked off! Now I want to return! XX",
          "We have visited 9 mile and were excited to see and learn about the latter years of Bob's life. The tour guide was very informative, I definitely learned and re-learned some information about the King of Reggae. A must see if you are in this area. It is a considerable ride",
          "If you love Bob Marley this is a must see. The tour was almost 1:45 minutes long. The guides sang too much, had the group shout out too much and tried to interact with the group too much.For example he asked 10 times if we were ready to go and he wouldn't open the door until",
          "Great place of worship and respect for my legend Bob Marley. Been here 3 times now and still love to see the man himself! Legend",
          "The price, worth while. The entry is accommodating and customer friendly. The tour is educational and entertaining. This is the full life story of the iconic Bob Marley, from birth through life to death. After a guided tour you will be entertained and relaxed at the studio",
          "it was amazing to see where Bob Marley created most of his songs...the bed were he slept, his kitchen,the shoot room etc etc..the house is well maintained .. we were so lucky to be at the right time (about closing) and the right spot to witness a friendly soccer game with",
          "Almost every moment in and around the house and museum makes you say \"whoa\". Everything is setup to make you appreciate the worldwide impact of Bob Marley's music. And unfortunately that's the limitation of this attraction. It is a shrine to Bob Marley's music but very light on",
          "Went there on our first day in Kingston and I highly recommend. Visit last abt 1h30 min and is very immersive and informative plus our guide (Stephen) was great too. A must do.",
          "This was well worth the time. Great place to visit to learn about Bob Marley and his impact on the world. It is loaded with awards and personal memorabilia. I learned a lot and would go back.",
          "We couldn't leave without visiting the Bob Marley Museum ... Definitely don't miss it. The guide we had was very friendly and open to answer any questions anyone might have. We actually found out lots of things about Bob that we didn't know before! You get to see and walk",
          "Was so great to see the history behind Bob Marley, the guide was amazing with such a fun way to share Bob's life. The price was excellent and the tour the perfect amount of time.",
          "It was a thrill to visit Bob Marley's home, but the museum as such is lacking. You walk through the empty house with just wall art. Not really much feeling in the house.",
          "Great tour, and rich in culture and history. A must do while in Kingston. Pictures are not allowed inside the house, but it was a wonderful experience.",
          "It was very nice to come back here for a second time \ud83c\udfc3 the vibe was out of this world and the locales was very nice and welcome us with open arms",
          "We really enjoyed touring the house of Bob Marley and the tour guide was informative and funny. I would recommend this for family and singles if you like history, reggae, and a Bob Marley fan.",
          "If you are a reggae fan and particularly a Bob Marley fan, you must visit this museum in Kingston. It was the home in which he and his family lived and is interesting to see. You tour the home with a guide and their photos and documents to see. In the end there's a 10 minute",
          "Don't get me wrong I absolutely love bob Marley. But the tour was absolutely boring, too much talking not enough interesting facts. More music could have been played rather than the guests having to sing.",
          "I had a whistle-stop tour of the museum in the midst of a business meeting. It's a simple place but interesting as a place of calm and kindness in the middle of Trench Town.",
          "Myself and wife enjoyed the museum and the food in the restaurant. We got to see one of Bob Marley's son during our tour that was the highlight of our trip. The experience was good to see an iconic celebrity house and a piece of history in Jamaica. We are grateful of this",
          "This museum certainly satisfies my soul. One Love, if only everyone has this message, the world would be a better place. With thanks to our guide Oshawne, you have our respect, you were amazing. Thank you... Respect.",
          "If your visiting Jamaica this is a must do well worth a visit reggae music and much more you won't be disappointed",
          "Well organised tour. Guides friendly & fun, ensures guest having fun. Attraction being refreshed frequently.",
          "We had such a great time visiting Bob Marley's house in Kingston. The murals around the house are beautiful. Be sure to take plenty of pictures there because you can't take any inside. Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable and entertaining. The tour took about an hour and 20",
          "This is a must visit place when you visit Kingston, Jamaica. I would strongly recommend that you take the structured tour; and ask for Desmond- he made it very memorable and peppered his talks with BMW renditions, with a groovy melodic rustic singing voice. We've been on many",
          "Awesome tour and the tour guides are excellent... ask for tour guide fuzzy he is warm and informative... after the tour I had some brownie and kept flying extra high... very good trip",
          "Excellent vacation stop. Great staff. Great food and beverages at the snack bar. Great murals on the walls in the garden area. A must see on your visit to Kingston.",
          "Boring, If you are old enough to remember when Bob Marley and the Wailers toured in the 70\u2019s there is nothing for you here. You can skip this museum. You know the history.",
          "Very much enjoyed our tour. our guide Nick was very friendly and knowledgeable. It was awesome to see where Bob lived and see all the memorabilia threw out the museum. As a huge Bob Marley fan this was the high light of my trip this year to Jamaica",
          "They have guided tours into the house, you cannot walk inside yourself. But the tour is good and this is a must visit if you are in Kingston.",
          "everything you want to know about Bob Marley and family. well organized and complete gift shop too. live tour guide, takes about 1.5 hours. won't allow any photos from inside the house, but outside is ok. there was a musician outside showing guests how to use the instruments",
          "Bob Marley Museum is a place you don't want to miss on your trip! Filled with memorabilia of the late reggae artiste, one can only reflect on a period gone by and wonder what it must have been like living there. After all, this was his home, now commercialized. My experience has",
          "I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. Primarily because of the vibe from the handsome tour guides. They had jokes and kept things up beat ... without the expertise of the right tour guides its just a house with random marley things.",
          "Definitely worth the money, very informative, our guide Iries Sue made the tour a million times better with her energy and facts. It's a must if your in Kingston!",
          "From setting foot on to the property I felt overwhelmed, this is a place Bob Marley, ate, slept, spent family time, played soccer and wrote and recorded music. It was educational and the guide tried to get everyone in our small and intimate group involved. Don't worry if you",
          "What a great guide. The young lady showing us around made the experience so authentic and real. We as a group joined her in the songs, shared the ups and downs of Bob Marley and our knowledge was so greatly improved. It was as though the man was still there. This is of course",
          "Was really educational and fun.. Enjoyed the tour so much... Only problem was, I couldn't take my phone inside",
          "This was a cool place to visit, not because it was like GraceLand, but because it was a real look into how Bob Marley really lived. Basically it was a \"Stoners Crash Pad\" not in a bad way but that it screamed free spirit. Our tour guide was a \"Rasta\" guy with long dreadlocks",
          "Being an airline employee we have won the prestigious JD Power award twelve years in a row for best low cost airline. We took the trophy to Jamaica and what better way to rep JA than the Bob Marley Museum. Being Jamaican I thought I knew a lot about Bob but this trip proved me",
          "This was the house where Bob Marley lived in his artist days and also used as his record studio, house I well kept and the tour guides do a good job taking you around Bobs life in the house, as well as the stories that happened to him while living there.",
          "a very special wonderful place a piece of history at its best and the legend himself lives on, the tour guides are very good and know there history about bob Marley, you can buy cds and bob Marley gifts , not going to reveal all apart from say go and check it out yourself you",
          "We had the best tour guide ever! He was funny, enjoyable and really knew his stuff. The grounds are beautiful, the house amazing and one of the best experiences by far. You will not be disappointed.",
          "We enjoyed this tour since we were living in Jamaica during the life and times of Bob Marley. The tour was quite interesting with a gift shop at the end of the tour where you can buy t-shirts and hats and other memorabilia.",
          "The museum which is set up in the Kingston home of Bob Marley is exciting and interesting. I got the chance to see hands-on how he lived, wrote music and played.",
          "A must see if you come to Kingston. All one would expect in a museum celebrating the great legacy of The Legend. Book the tour for the best experience.",
          "If you are a reggae fan you will feel the vibes of the house, visiting the mini studio that Bob used for rehearsals is a mystic experience. Only downside is not being allowed to take pictures.",
          "The Bob Marley Museum is a lot of fun. Take the tour. It's $25 USD per person. They do take credit cards. Get to see his house. Learn a lot about him and his life's ups and downs. Very interesting person. He represents Jamaica well. The tour guides are so nice and sing as well.",
          "This will only be interesting if you a Bob Marley fan and/or a fan of his family's music. I have been wanting to visit this place since I was teenager so I really enjoyed the tour. On the way out we found Julian Marley hanging out in the parking lot, what an exciting surprise!!",
          "Went to the museum with my husband. The tour guide was very informative and friendly. We even learned the his children still use the studio.",
          "I spent two weeks exploring part of Jamaica and my visit to the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston was one of the highlights of the trip. As I waited for the museum tour to begin, I wandered around the grounds admiring and photographing vivid murals that showed aspects of Bob",
          "Well, even not being a luxury house or a fancy neighborhood this nice house now is a museum for the world famous and most influential reggae music icon. The atmosphere there is just something magic",
          "I visited Bob Marley Museum for the first time in 2016. To begin with, the staff there is extremely warm and friendly. The thing that struck me the most though, is how much you can learn on your visit there, and how simple they have laid out the museum for visitors. I will tell",
          "i gotta say i learnt so much on this tour, our guide ricky was fun, knowledgeable constantly making us laugh. walking the halls standing in the rooms, special spots that bob liked was an experience like no other, at the end of the tour we got to watch a little mini movie which",
          "This was a great tour and would be interesting to people who don't really know Bob Marley's music. Our tour guide (all done in small group escorted tours) was fantastic and sang songs along the way. He stayed with us for over two hours even though he could have rushed us",
          "I visited Kingston while on vacation in Montego Bay, Jamaica and took the tour of the Bob Marley Museum. This was his home from 1975 - 1981. I fell in love all over again with Bob Marley and his music! I thought I knew everything about Bob Marley, but I certainly did not! Our",
          "My guide was fantastic! Very informative, fun and enthusiastic! The museum was very interesting. Being a massive fan I already knew a lot, but learnt heaps more than I expected. This is my favourite museum I've been to! A must if you're visiting Kingston!",
          "Visited the Bob Marley Museum while in Jamaica in January 2017. The tour was very enlightening and entertaining. All aspects of Bob Marley's musical life was on display and discussed by the Tour Guide. There was even a short film at the end of the tour with messages from the",
          "this place is mad but in a good way, guides all stoned smoking spliffs , get go in his house and see his tomb can take photographs except for tomb , so much fun music playing , must see if a fan",
          "The museum is great but I wasn't impressed so much by the tour guide as a little OTT and pushed what seemed like their own angle on the contents rather than what was actual, However a trip to Kingston cant be had without this visit.",
          "The museum was pretty cool, however I don't like that it's a guided tour as the entrance is pretty expensive and you don't really get enough time to look at everything because the guide pushes you through to the next room before you have a chance. They also sing during the tour",
          "Visited Bob Marley Museum late January 2017. We were met by a polite lady who ushered us to the office/reception area where we were given information on the tour. We had just missed the timed group tour so had to wait half an hour for the next. A very warm and excited lady",
          "As a huge Bob and Reggae fan, this was a treat for us. Our tour guide, Iris, was so knowledgeable, energetic and passionate. She made our time there what it was. The rooms are full of interesting artifacts from his life. The highlight for us was the recording studio and the",
          "Visited the museum yesterday - on Bob Marley's birthday. What a festival! Lively music pumping from the stage. A lot of people enjoying the atmosphere but not too crowded. My group of friends and I circulated around the outdoor craft booths and stopped into the museum gift shop",
          "You can't go to Kingston without a visit to Hope Road and see where the legendary Robert Nesta Marley lived .... yeah the tour is quite expensive, yeah it's a bit cringe in parts ... but it's so worth it. Interesting, great vibes and I could have just jumped in that hammock and",
          "They were great! Stop by even if you're not going to the museum. The tour guide was great, young light skin guy with dreads..he was great. The juice bar was amazing. The workers were very nice. The smoothies were great! No sugar added, all raw ingredients.",
          "Nice place to visit if you are a Bob Marley fan but be warned, the folks that work there see him as more than a good singer and more even than a national icon, the roots of his Rastafarian beliefs permeates the place and its laborers. Yet the history, music, background info and",
          "I'm not a huge fan but visited here as part of a tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable but our group was large so sometimes we couldn't hear some of the information. The museum is well kept and organised and it was so nice to see Bob's home and many of his original possessions.",
          "Fabiola tour of the Bob Marley Museum ! Loved it and learned so much Well worth the $25 admission fee Our guide was amazing. Very knowledgeable and fun!",
          "Not a Bob Marley fan but I was in Kingston and thought to swing by. The tour lasts about 1h15: it's cool to see his house and hear his story but the house really doesn't have much to see. Many rooms are empty with news articles plastered on the walls. Unless you are in Kingston",
          "My favourite stop of my trip to Jamaica. Oshane (hope I got that right) was a wonderful tour guide, very lively and informative. Adding extra spunk and interest. Left feeling very inspired.",
          "Unfortunately we found our visit to Bob Marley's Museum really disappointing. We booked the trip via Thomson, the bus ride took 3 hours from Lucia and the driver was extremely dangerous. When we arrived we were forced to wait to go to the toilet whilst we waited for people to",
          "Good fun afternoon visiting the museum, tour guide SUPER vibrant, regularly breaking into song. Informatiive & interesting.",

          "I had a great time there. The tour guide Shaun was very knowledgeable and fun. Very authentic and filled with cultural references. When they told us it would take an hour and twenty minutes I thought Id be board halfway through but I was not. It was great to see where Bob",
          "One of the most expensive museums ever on this globe: we were two adults and two small kids and we had to pay more than 50 USD! You are told that the guided tour lasts approximately 1h20. What you are not told is that the last half hour is entirely dedicated to watching YouTube",
          "Visited with the family, the tour lasted about 2 hours in total, we all enjoyed the tour. You get taken round with a guide who is a singer, he got us all singing as we went round Bob Marley's house which was great fun. The guide gave us a detailed biography of Bob's career and",

          "There aren't really many tourist attractions in Kingston itself, so the Bob Marley Museum is a must see. I'm not a massive fan, but he is such a key figure in Jamaica I wanted to go. You can't just wander the house yourself, it is a guided tour and that actually is the best bit!",
          "You aren't allowed to take pictures inside the house, but you were allowed on the grounds outside which had a lot to photograph. It was a small cute house with tons of items to carry on the memory of Bob Marley and his family. What really made the tour was our guide Shanese.",
          "So, I'm pretty clueless about Bob Marley and it was great education for me. I did not know he was shot. I did not know any of his story. Very neat hearing about a celebrity and his life and rise to the top. If you like history, you may enjoy it. Or if you enjoy reggae and",
          "The museum is jam packed with history and memorabilia of Bob Marley, his family and the Wailers. The tour is guided so it was possible to ask questions and the guide we had was very knowledgeable. In most places it's possible to take photos. There's a cinema where as part of",

          "I admit I don't know much about Bob Marley. But I do appreciate great achievement, vision, and creativity and Marley definitely had all of that. To achieve what he did, coming from the ghetto of a developing country is truly phenomenal. Enjoyed being able to walk through his",
          "Pictures are not allowed to be taken inside. Cameras and cellphones have to given at the entrance. Parking for free but very limited space. Cafe was unorganized. Guides were on duty but no headsets in use. They were screaming all time. We were really disappointed",
          "One of the thing to do in Jamaica is to see this place - Bob Marley's house/Museum. It's a relatively modest house with Bob Marley's award in the bottom floor and almost empty upper level. The museum itself was modest but the guide (forgot her name)made it very interesting.",
          "Visited here on Saturday December 17 2016. My young 4 year old nephew is absolutely obsessed with the Marley's and so had to take him here for his week in Jamaica. Our tour guide Desmond was absolutely amazing and did a great job and he was also friendly with the kids which",

          "I think the best part of this tour was being in the actual sound booth where Bob Marley recorded his greatest hits and seeing the actual stairs in his house that he would run up and down each day for his daily work outs. Its amazing that the kitchen in his house is so tiny. The",

          "Was quite surprised. It was my first experienced being offered drugs. The guide was very informative dispute being high but that actually made it authentic. Not knowing much about Bob Marley except his music it was very interesting to see where he came from and about his life.",

          "Yes it is a tourist trap: overpriced, commercialized and very impersonal. Within 1hr20m you stand outside again and you've been rushed through a very biased small part of the story However, the bob Marley story is very inspiring and a genuine Jamaican hero. The building",

          "I was living in Jamaica at the time and had been driving past this museum every day on the way to work, from the outside it didn't look much, just another high wall in the middle of a very busy part of Kingston. But I am glad that I paid a visit, and looked behind that bland",
          "The entire faculty, from the grounds to the house, and the theater are beautifully maintained. The tour is incredibly informative and fun. I also liked that on the hot, humid day that I visited, the air conditioning works very well. You can't take photos inside, but there are",
          "I booked the trip through the resort so I don't remember the company it was with. But they were great and the tour was great. We stopped for Jamaican jerk chicken lunch at a local spot and also stopped for shopping. The tour and visit to bob Marleys home was everything we could",
          "Bob Marley's last home is converted into the museum. It has been well preserved down to the location where bullets pierced walls during an attempted assassination of Bob Marley. The tour guide made this tour come alive. He sang and shared lots of details on Bob's life. There is",
          "While I loved his music, the price of admission and the prohibition against photography seemed just too much. Painted pictures in the courtyard and a statue of Bob satisfied me. I left satisfied with just this peek while saving money in the process.",
          "really cool to be shown around bob's house and our guide was very witting and charming. given i had just finished reading marlon james' 'a brief history of seven killings', it was quite something to see the bullet holes. i would definitely recommend this tour, even if it was a",

          "Great fun, courteous staff, i will be going back",

        "wiki": "The Atlantic slave trade, transatlantic slave trade, or Euro-American slave trade involved the transportation by slave traders of enslaved African people, mainly to the Americas. The slave trade regularly used the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage, and existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The vast majority of those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were people from Central and West Africa, who had been sold by other West Africans, or by half-European \"merchant princes\" to Western European slave traders (with a small number being captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids), who brought them to the Americas. Except for the Portuguese, European slave traders generally did not participate in the raids because life expectancy for Europeans in sub-Saharan Africa was less than one year during the period of the slave trade (which was prior to the development of quinine as a treatment for malaria). The South Atlantic and Caribbean economies were particularly dependent on labour for the production of sugarcane and other commodities. This was viewed as crucial by those Western European states that, in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were vying with each other to create overseas empires.The Portuguese, in the 16th century, were the first to engage in the Atlantic slave trade. In 1526, they completed the first transatlantic slave voyage to Brazil, and other Europeans soon followed. Shipowners regarded the slaves as cargo to be transported to the Americas as quickly and cheaply as possible, there to be sold to work on coffee, tobacco, cocoa, sugar, and cotton plantations, gold and silver mines, rice fields, the construction industry, cutting timber for ships, in skilled labour, and as domestic servants. The first Africans kidnapped to the English colonies were classified as indentured servants, with a similar legal standing as contract-based workers coming from Britain and Ireland. However, by the middle of the 17th century, slavery had hardened as a racial caste, with African slaves and their future offspring being legally the property of their owners, as children born to slave mothers were also slaves (partus sequitur ventrem). As property, the people were considered merchandise or units of labour, and were sold at markets with other goods and services.\n\nThe major Atlantic slave-trading nations, ordered by trade volume, were the Portuguese, the British, the Spanish, the French, the Dutch, and the Danish. Several had established outposts on the African coast where they purchased slaves from local African leaders. These slaves were managed by a factor, who was established on or near the coast to expedite the shipping of slaves to the New World. Slaves were imprisoned in a factory while awaiting shipment. Current estimates are that about 12 million to 12.8 million Africans were shipped across the Atlantic over a span of 400 years. The number purchased by the traders was considerably higher, as the passage had a high death rate with approximately 1.2\u20132.4 million dying during the voyage and millions more died in seasoning camps in the Caribbean after arrival to the New World. Millions of slaves also died as a result of slave raids, wars and during transport to the coast for sale to European slave traders. Near the beginning of the 19th century, various governments acted to ban the trade, although illegal smuggling still occurred. In the early 21st century, several governments issued apologies for the transatlantic slave trade.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Atlantic travel ===\nThe Atlantic slave trade developed after trade contacts were established between the \"Old World\" (Afro-Eurasia) and the \"New World\" (the Americas). For centuries, tidal currents had made ocean travel particularly difficult and risky for the ships that were then available. Thus, there had been very little, if any, maritime contact between the peoples living in these continents. In the 15th century, however, new European developments in seafaring technologies resulted in ships being better equipped to deal with the tidal currents, and could begin traversing the Atlantic Ocean; the Portuguese set up a Navigator's School (although there is much debate about whether it existed and if it did, just what it was). Between 1600 and 1800, approximately 300,000 sailors engaged in the slave trade visited West Africa. In doing so, they came into contact with societies living along the west African coast and in the Americas which they had never previously encountered. Historian Pierre Chaunu termed the consequences of European navigation \"disenclavement\", with it marking an end of isolation for some societies and an increase in inter-societal contact for most others.Historian John Thornton noted, \"A number of technical and geographical factors combined to make Europeans the most likely people to explore the Atlantic and develop its commerce\". He identified these as being the drive to find new and profitable commercial opportunities outside Europe. Additionally was the desire to create an alternative trade network to that controlled by the Muslim Ottoman Empire of the Middle East, which was viewed as a commercial, political and religious threat to European Christendom. In particular, European traders wanted to trade for gold, which could be found in western Africa, and also to find a maritime route to \"the Indies\" (India), where they could trade for luxury goods such as spices without having to obtain these items from Middle Eastern Islamic traders.Although many of the initial Atlantic naval explorations were led by Iberians, members of many European nationalities were involved, including sailors from Portugal, Spain, the Italian kingdoms, England, France and the Netherlands. This diversity led Thornton to describe the initial \"exploration of the Atlantic\" as \"a truly international exercise, even if many of the dramatic discoveries were made under the sponsorship of the Iberian monarchs\". That leadership later gave rise to the myth that \"the Iberians were the sole leaders of the exploration\".\n\n\n=== European slavery in Portugal and Spain ===\nBy the 15th century, slavery had existed in the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain) of Western Europe throughout recorded history.  The Roman Empire had established its system of slavery in ancient times. Since the fall of the Roman Empire, various systems of slavery continued in the successor kingdoms of the peninsula into the early modern era of the Atlantic slave trade.\n\n\n=== African slavery ===\n\nSlavery was prevalent in many parts of Africa for many centuries before the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade. There is evidence that enslaved people from some parts of Africa were exported to states in Africa, Europe, and Asia prior to the European colonization of the Americas.The Atlantic slave trade was not the only slave trade from Africa, although it was the largest in volume and intensity. As Elikia M'bokolo wrote in Le Monde diplomatique:\n\nThe African continent was bled of its human resources via all possible routes. Across the Sahara, through the Red Sea, from the Indian Ocean ports and across the Atlantic. At least ten centuries of slavery for the benefit of the Muslim countries (from the ninth to the nineteenth) ... Four million enslaved people exported via the Red Sea, another four million through the Swahili ports of the Indian Ocean, perhaps as many as nine million along the trans-Saharan caravan route, and eleven to twenty million (depending on the author) across the Atlantic Ocean.\nAccording to John K. Thornton, Europeans usually bought enslaved people who were captured in endemic warfare between African states. Some Africans had made a business out of capturing Africans from neighboring ethnic groups or war captives and selling them. A reminder of this practice is documented in the Slave Trade Debates of England in the early 19th century: \"All the old writers ... concur in stating not only that wars are entered into for the sole purpose of making slaves, but that they are fomented by Europeans, with a view to that object.\" People living around the Niger River were transported from these markets to the coast and sold at European trading ports in exchange for muskets and manufactured goods such as cloth or alcohol. However, the European demand for slaves provided a large new market for the already existing trade. While those held in slavery in their own region of Africa might hope to escape, those shipped away had little chance of returning to Africa.\n\n\n=== European colonization and slavery in West Africa ===\n\nUpon discovering new lands through their naval explorations, European colonisers soon began to migrate to and settle in lands outside their native continent. Off the coast of Africa, European migrants, under the directions of the Kingdom of Castile, invaded and colonised the Canary Islands during the 15th century, where they converted much of the land to the production of wine and sugar. Along with this, they also captured native Canary Islanders, the Guanches, to use as slaves both on the Islands and across the Christian Mediterranean.As historian John Thornton remarked, \"the actual motivation for European expansion and for navigational breakthroughs was little more than to exploit the opportunity for immediate profits made by raiding and the seizure or purchase of trade commodities\". Using the Canary Islands as a naval base, Europeans, at the time primarily Portuguese traders, began to move their activities down the western coast of Africa, performing raids in which slaves would be captured to be later sold in the Mediterranean. Although initially successful in this venture, \"it was not long before African naval forces were alerted to the new dangers, and the Portuguese [raiding] ships began to meet strong and effective resistance\", with the crews of several of them being killed by African sailors, whose boats were better equipped at traversing the west African coasts and river systems.By 1494, the Portuguese king had entered agreements with the rulers of several West African states that would allow trade between their respective peoples, enabling the Portuguese to \"tap into\" the \"well-developed commercial economy in Africa ... without engaging in hostilities\". \"Peaceful trade became the rule all along the African coast\", although there were some rare exceptions when acts of aggression led to violence. For instance, Portuguese traders attempted to conquer the Bissagos Islands in 1535. In 1571 Portugal, supported by the Kingdom of Kongo, took control of the south-western region of Angola in order to secure its threatened economic interest in the area. Although Kongo later joined a coalition in 1591 to force the Portuguese out, Portugal had secured a foothold on the continent that it continued to occupy until the 20th century. Despite these incidents of occasional violence between African and European forces, many African states ensured that any trade went on in their own terms, for instance, imposing custom duties on foreign ships. In 1525, the Kongolese king Afonso I seized a French vessel and its crew for illegally trading on his coast.Historians have widely debated the nature of the relationship between these African kingdoms and the European traders. The Guyanese historian Walter Rodney (1972) has argued that it was an unequal relationship, with Africans being forced into a \"colonial\" trade with the more economically developed Europeans, exchanging raw materials and human resources (i.e. slaves) for manufactured goods. He argued that it was this economic trade agreement dating back to the 16th century that led to Africa being underdeveloped in his own time. These ideas were supported by other historians, including Ralph Austen (1987). This idea of an unequal relationship was contested by John Thornton (1998), who argued that \"the Atlantic slave trade was not nearly as critical to the African economy as these scholars believed\" and that \"African manufacturing [at this period] was more than capable of handling competition from preindustrial Europe\". However, Anne Bailey, commenting on Thornton's suggestion that Africans and Europeans were equal partners in the Atlantic slave trade, wrote:\n\n[T]o see Africans as partners implies equal terms and equal influence on the global and intercontinental processes of the trade. Africans had great influence on the continent itself, but they had no direct influence on the engines behind the trade in the capital firms, the shipping and insurance companies of Europe and America, or the plantation systems in Americas. They did not wield any influence on the building manufacturing centers of the West.\n\n\n== 16th, 17th and 18th centuries ==\n\nThe Atlantic slave trade is customarily divided into two eras, known as the First and Second Atlantic Systems. Slightly more than 3% of the enslaved people exported from Africa were traded between 1525 and 1600, and 16% in the 17th century.\nThe First Atlantic system was the trade of enslaved Africans to, primarily, South American colonies of the Portuguese and Spanish empires. During the first Atlantic system, most of these traders were Portuguese, giving them a near-monopoly. Initially the slaves were transported to Seville or Canary Islands, but from 1525 slaves were transported directly from the island Sao Tom\u00e9 across the Atlantic to Hispaniola. Decisive was the Treaty of Tordesillas which did not allow Spanish ships in African ports. Spain had to rely on Portuguese ships and sailors to bring slaves across the Atlantic. Around 1560 the Portuguese began a regular slave trade to Brazil. From 1580 till 1640 Portugal was temporarily united with Spain in the Iberian Union. Most Portuguese contractors who obtained the asiento between 1580 and 1640 were conversos. For Portuguese merchants, many of whom were \"New Christians\" or their descendants, the union of crowns presented commercial opportunities in the slave trade to Spanish America.Until the middle of the 17th century Mexico was the largest single market for slaves in Spanish America. While the Portuguese were directly involved in trading enslaved peoples to Brazil, the Spanish empire relied on the Asiento de Negros system, awarding (Catholic) Genoese merchant bankers the license to trade enslaved people from Africa to their colonies in Spanish America. Cartagena, Veracruz, Buenos Aires, and Hispaniola received the majority of slave arrivals, mainly from Angola. This division of the slave trade between Spain and Portugal upset the British and the Dutch who invested in the British West Indies and Dutch Brazil producing sugar. After the Iberian union fell apart, Spain prohibited Portugal from directly engaging in the slave trade as a carrier. According the Treaty of Munster the slave trade was opened for the traditional enemies of Spain, losing a large share of the trade to the Dutch, French and English. For 150 years Spanish transatlantic traffic was operating at trivial levels. In many years, not a single Spanish slave voyage set sail from Africa. Unlike all of their imperial competitors, the Spanish almost never delivered slaves to foreign territories. By contrast, the British, and the Dutch before them, sold slaves everywhere in the Americas.The Second Atlantic system was the trade of enslaved Africans by mostly English, French and Dutch traders and investors. The main destinations of this phase were the Caribbean islands Cura\u00e7ao, Jamaica and Martinique, as European nations built up economically slave-dependent colonies in the New World. In 1672 the Royal Africa Company was founded; in 1674 the New West India Company became deeper involved in slave trade. From 1677 the Compagnie du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, used Gor\u00e9e to house the slaves. The Spanish proposed to get the slaves from Cape Verde, located closer to the demarcation line between the Spanish and Portuguese empire, but this was against the WIC-charter\". The Royal African Company, usually refused to deliver slaves to Spanish colonies, though they did sell them to all comers from their factories in Kingston, Jamaica and Bridgetown, Barbados. In 1682 Spain allowed governors from Havana, Porto Bello, Panama, and Cartagena, Colombia to procure slaves from Jamaica.\n\nBy the 1690s, the English were shipping the most slaves from West Africa. By the 18th century, Portuguese Angola had become again one of the principal sources of the Atlantic slave trade. After the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, as part of the provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), the Asiento was granted to the South Sea Company. Despite the South Sea Bubble the British maintained this position during the 18th century, becoming the biggest shippers of slaves across the Atlantic. It is estimated that more than half of the entire slave trade took place during the 18th century, with the British, Portuguese and French being the main carriers of nine out of ten slaves abducted in Africa.  Meanwhile, it became a business for privately owned enterprises, reducing international complications. After 1790, by contrast, captains typically checked out slave prices in at least two of the major markets of Kingston, Havana, and Charleston, South Carolina (where prices by then were similar) before deciding where to sell. For the last sixteen years of the transatlantic slave trade, Spain was, indeed, the only transatlantic slave-trading empire.Following the British and United States' bans on the African slave trade in 1808, it declined, but the period after still accounted for 28.5% of the total volume of the Atlantic slave trade.  Between 1810 and 1860, over 3.5 million slaves were transported, with 850,000 in the 1820s.A burial ground in Campeche, Mexico, suggests slaves had been brought there not long after Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s completed the subjugation of Aztec and Mayan Mexico in the 16th century. The graveyard had been in use from approximately 1550 to the late 17th century.\n\n\n=== Triangular trade ===\n\nThe first side of the triangle was the export of goods from Europe to Africa. A number of African kings and merchants took part in the trading of enslaved people from 1440 to about 1833. For each captive, the African rulers would receive a variety of goods from Europe. These included guns, ammunition, and other factory-made goods. The second leg of the triangle exported enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas and the Caribbean Islands. The third and final part of the triangle was the return of goods to Europe from the Americas. The goods were the products of slave-labour plantations and included cotton, sugar, tobacco, molasses and rum. Sir John Hawkins, considered the pioneer of the British slave trade, was the first to run the Triangular trade, making a profit at every stop.\n\n\n=== Labour and slavery ===\n\nThe Atlantic slave trade was the result of, among other things, labour shortage, itself in turn created by the desire of European colonists to exploit New World land and resources for capital profits. Native peoples were at first utilized as slave labour by Europeans until a large number died from overwork and Old World diseases. Alternative sources of labour, such as indentured servitude, failed to provide a sufficient workforce.\nMany crops could not be sold for profit, or even grown, in Europe. Exporting crops and goods from the New World to Europe often proved to be more profitable than producing them on the European mainland. A vast amount of labour was needed to create and sustain plantations that required intensive labour to grow, harvest, and process prized tropical crops. Western Africa (part of which became known as \"the Slave Coast\"), Angola and nearby Kingdoms and later Central Africa, became the source for enslaved people to meet the demand for labour.The basic reason for the constant shortage of labour was that, with much cheap land available and many landowners searching for workers, free European immigrants were able to become landowners themselves relatively quickly, thus increasing the need for workers.Thomas Jefferson attributed the use of slave labour in part to the climate, and the consequent idle leisure afforded by slave labour: \"For in a warm climate, no man will labour for himself who can make another labour for him. This is so true, that of the proprietors of slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labour.\" In a 2015 paper, economist Elena Esposito argued that the enslavement of Africans in colonial America was attributable to the fact that the American south was sufficiently warm and humid for malaria to thrive; the disease had debilitating effects on the European settlers. Conversely, many enslaved Africans were taken from regions of Africa which hosted particularly potent strains of the disease, so the Africans had already developed natural resistance to malaria. This, Esposito argued, resulted in higher malaria survival rates in the American south among enslaved Africans than among European labourers, making them a more profitable source of labour and encouraging their use.\n\n\n=== African participation in the slave trade ===\n\nAfricans played a direct role in the slave trade, selling their captives or prisoners of war to European buyers. The prisoners and captives who were sold were usually from neighbouring or enemy ethnic groups. These captive slaves were considered \"other\", not part of the people of the ethnic group or \"tribe\"; African kings held no particular loyalty to them. Sometimes criminals would be sold so that they could no longer commit crimes in that area. Most other slaves were obtained from kidnappings, or through raids that occurred at gunpoint through joint ventures with the Europeans. But some African kings refused to sell any of their captives or criminals. King Jaja of Opobo, a former slave, refused to do any business with the slavers.According to Ipsen, Africans, namely Ghana, also participated in the slave trade through intermarriage, or cassare, meaning \"to set up house\". It is derived from the Portuguese word \"casar\", meaning \"to marry\". Cassare created political and economic bonds between European and African slave traders. Cassare was a pre-European practice used to integrate the \"other\" from a differing African tribe. Powerful West African groups used these marriages as an alliance used to strengthen their trade networks with European men by marrying off African women from families with ties to the slave trade. Early on in the Atlantic slave trade, these marriages were common. The marriages were even performed using African customs, which Europeans did not object to, seeing how important the connections were.\n\n\n=== European participation in the slave trade ===\nAlthough Europeans were the market for slaves, Europeans rarely entered the interior of Africa, due to fear of disease and fierce African resistance. In Africa, convicted criminals could be punished by enslavement, a punishment which became more prevalent as slavery became more lucrative. Since most of these nations did not have a prison system, convicts were often sold or used in the scattered local domestic slave market.\n\nIn 1778, Thomas Kitchin estimated that Europeans were bringing an estimated 52,000 slaves to the Caribbean yearly, with the French bringing the most Africans to the French West Indies (13,000 out of the yearly estimate). The Atlantic slave trade peaked in the last two decades of the 18th century, during and following the Kongo Civil War. Wars among tiny states along the Niger River's Igbo-inhabited region and the accompanying banditry also spiked in this period. Another reason for surplus supply of enslaved people was major warfare conducted by expanding states, such as the kingdom of Dahomey, the Oyo Empire, and the Asante Empire.\n\n\n=== Slavery in Africa and the New World contrasted ===\n\nForms of slavery varied both in Africa and in the New World. In general, slavery in Africa was not heritable\u2014that is, the children of slaves were free\u2014while in the Americas, children of slave mothers were considered born into slavery. This was connected to another distinction: slavery in West Africa was not reserved for racial or religious minorities, as it was in European colonies, although the case was otherwise in places such as Somalia, where Bantus were taken as slaves for the ethnic Somalis.The treatment of slaves in Africa was more variable than in the Americas. At one extreme, the kings of Dahomey routinely slaughtered slaves in hundreds or thousands in sacrificial rituals, and slaves as human sacrifices were also known in Cameroon. On the other hand, slaves in other places were often treated as part of the family, \"adopted children\", with significant rights including the right to marry without their masters' permission. Scottish explorer Mungo Park wrote:\n\nThe slaves in Africa, I suppose, are nearly in the proportion of three to one to the freemen. They claim no reward for their services except food and clothing, and are treated with kindness or severity, according to the good or bad disposition of their masters ... The slaves which are thus brought from the interior may be divided into two distinct classes\u2014first, such as were slaves from their birth, having been born of enslaved mothers; secondly, such as were born free, but who afterwards, by whatever means, became slaves. Those of the first description are by far the most numerous ...\nIn the Americas, slaves were denied the right to marry freely and masters did not generally accept them as equal members of the family. New World slaves were considered the property of their owners, and slaves convicted of revolt or murder were executed.\n\n\n=== Slave market regions and participation ===\n\nThere were eight principal areas used by Europeans to buy and ship slaves to the Western Hemisphere. The number of enslaved people sold to the New World varied throughout the slave trade. As for the distribution of slaves from regions of activity, certain areas produced far more enslaved people than others. Between 1650 and 1900, 10.2 million enslaved Africans arrived in the Americas from the following regions in the following proportions:\nSenegambia (Senegal and the Gambia): 4.8%\nUpper Guinea (Guinea-Bissau, Guinea and Sierra Leone): 4.1%\nWindward Coast (Liberia and Ivory Coast): 1.8%\nGold Coast (Ghana and east of Ivory Coast): 10.4%\nBight of Benin (Togo, Benin and Nigeria west of the Niger Delta): 20.2%\nBight of Biafra (Nigeria east of the Niger Delta, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon): 14.6%\nWest Central Africa (Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola): 39.4%\nSoutheastern Africa (Mozambique and Madagascar): 4.7%Although the slave trade was largely global, there was considerable intracontinental slave trade in which 8 million people were enslaved within the African continent. Of those who did move out of Africa, 8 million were forced out of Eastern Africa to be sent to Asia.\n\n\n=== African kingdoms of the era ===\nThere were over 173 city-states and kingdoms in the African regions affected by the slave trade between 1502 and 1853, when Brazil became the last Atlantic import nation to outlaw the slave trade. Of those 173, no fewer than 68 could be deemed nation states with political and military infrastructures that enabled them to dominate their neighbours. Nearly every present-day nation had a pre-colonial predecessor, sometimes an African empire with which European traders had to barter.\n\n\n==== Ethnic groups ====\nThe different ethnic groups brought to the Americas closely correspond to the regions of heaviest activity in the slave trade. Over 45 distinct ethnic groups were taken to the Americas during the trade. Of the 45, the ten most prominent, according to slave documentation of the era are listed below.\nThe BaKongo of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola\nThe Mand\u00e9 of Upper Guinea\nThe Gbe speakers of Togo, Ghana, and Benin (Adja, Mina, Ewe, Fon)\nThe Akan of Ghana and Ivory Coast\nThe Wolof of Senegal and the Gambia\nThe Igbo of southeastern Nigeria\nThe Mbundu of Angola (includes both Ambundu and Ovimbundu)\nThe Yoruba of southwestern Nigeria\nThe Chamba of Cameroon\nThe Makua of Mozambique\n\n\n== Human toll ==\nThe transatlantic slave trade resulted in a vast and as yet unknown loss of life for African captives both in and outside the Americas. \"More than a million people are thought to have died\" during their transport to the New World according to a BBC report. More died soon after their arrival. The number of lives lost in the procurement of slaves remains a mystery but may equal or exceed the number who survived to be enslaved.The savage nature of the trade led to the destruction of individuals and cultures. The following figures do not include deaths of enslaved Africans as a result of their labour, slave revolts, or diseases suffered while living among New World populations. Historian Ana Lucia Araujo has noted that the process of enslavement did not end with arrival on Western Hemisphere shores; the different paths taken by the individuals and groups who were victims of the Atlantic slave trade were influenced by different factors\u2014including the disembarking region, the kind of work performed, gender, age, religion, and language.Patrick Manning estimates that about 12 million slaves entered the Atlantic trade between the 16th and 19th century, but about 1.5 million died on board ship. About 10.5 million slaves arrived in the Americas. Besides the slaves who died on the Middle Passage, more Africans likely died during the slave raids in Africa and forced marches to ports. Manning estimates that 4 million died inside Africa after capture, and many more died young. Manning's estimate covers the 12 million who were originally destined for the Atlantic, as well as the 6 million destined for Asian slave markets and the 8 million destined for African markets. Of the slaves shipped to The Americas, the largest share went to Brazil and the Caribbean.\n\n\n=== African conflicts ===\n\nAccording to Kimani Nehusi, the presence of European slavers affected the way in which the legal code in African societies responded to offenders. Crimes traditionally punishable by some other form of punishment became punishable by enslavement and sale to slave traders. According to David Stannard's American Holocaust, 50% of African deaths occurred in Africa as a result of wars between native kingdoms, which produced the majority of slaves. This includes not only those who died in battles but also those who died as a result of forced marches from inland areas to slave ports on the various coasts. The practice of enslaving enemy combatants and their villages was widespread throughout Western and West Central Africa, although wars were rarely started to procure slaves. The slave trade was largely a by-product of tribal and state warfare as a way of removing potential dissidents after victory or financing future wars. However, some African groups proved particularly adept and brutal at the practice of enslaving, such as Bono State, Oyo, Benin, Igala, Kaabu, Asanteman, Dahomey, the Aro Confederacy and the Imbangala war bands.In letters written by the Manikongo, Nzinga Mbemba Afonso, to the King Jo\u00e3o III of Portugal, he writes that Portuguese merchandise flowing in is what is fueling the trade in Africans. He requests the King of Portugal to stop sending merchandise but should only send missionaries. In one of his letters he writes:\n\nEach day the traders are kidnapping our people\u2014children of this country, sons of our nobles and vassals, even people of our own family. This corruption and depravity are so widespread that our land is entirely depopulated. We need in this kingdom only priests and schoolteachers, and no merchandise, unless it is wine and flour for Mass. It is our wish that this Kingdom not be a place for the trade or transport of slaves ...\nMany of our subjects eagerly lust after Portuguese merchandise that your subjects have brought into our domains. To satisfy this inordinate appetite, they seize many of our black free subjects ... They sell them. After having taken these prisoners [to the coast] secretly or at night ... As soon as the captives are in the hands of white men they are branded with a red-hot iron.\nBefore the arrival of the Portuguese, slavery had already existed in the Kingdom of Kongo. Afonso I of Kongo believed that the slave trade should be subject to Kongo law. When he suspected the Portuguese of receiving illegally enslaved persons to sell, he wrote to King Jo\u00e3o III in 1526 imploring him to put a stop to the practice.The kings of Dahomey sold war captives into transatlantic slavery; they would otherwise have been killed in a ceremony known as the Annual Customs. As one of West Africa's principal slave states, Dahomey became extremely unpopular with neighbouring peoples. Like the Bambara Empire to the east, the Khasso kingdoms depended heavily on the slave trade for their economy. A family's status was indicated by the number of slaves it owned, leading to wars for the sole purpose of taking more captives. This trade led the Khasso into increasing contact with the European settlements of Africa's west coast, particularly the French. Benin grew increasingly rich during the 16th and 17th centuries on the slave trade with Europe; slaves from enemy states of the interior were sold and carried to the Americas in Dutch and Portuguese ships. The Bight of Benin's shore soon came to be known as the \"Slave Coast\".King Gezo of Dahomey said in the 1840s:\n\nThe slave trade is the ruling principle of my people. It is the source and the glory of their wealth ... the mother lulls the child to sleep with notes of triumph over an enemy reduced to slavery ...\nIn 1807, the UK Parliament passed the Bill that abolished the trading of slaves. The King of Bonny (now in Nigeria) was horrified at the conclusion of the practice:\n\nWe think this trade must go on. That is the verdict of our oracle and the priests. They say that your country, however great, can never stop a trade ordained by God himself.\n\n\n=== Port factories ===\nAfter being marched to the coast for sale, enslaved people were held in large forts called factories. The amount of time in factories varied, but Milton Meltzer states in Slavery: A World History that around 4.5% of deaths attributed to the transatlantic slave trade occurred during this phase. In other words, over 820,000 people are believed to have died in African ports such as Benguela, Elmina, and Bonny, reducing the number of those shipped to 17.5 million.\n\n\n=== Atlantic shipment ===\n\nAfter being captured and held in the factories, slaves entered the infamous Middle Passage. Meltzer's research puts this phase of the slave trade's overall mortality at 12.5%. Their deaths were the result of brutal treatment and poor care from the time of their capture and throughout their voyage. Around 2.2 million Africans died during these voyages, where they were packed into tight, unsanitary spaces on ships for months at a time. Measures were taken to stem the onboard mortality rate, such as enforced \"dancing\" (as exercise) above deck and the practice of force-feeding enslaved persons who tried to starve themselves. The conditions on board also resulted in the spread of fatal diseases. Other fatalities were suicides, slaves who escaped by jumping overboard. The slave traders would try to fit anywhere from 350 to 600 slaves on one ship. Before the African slave trade was completely banned by participating nations in 1853, 15.3 million enslaved people had arrived in the Americas.\nRaymond L. Cohn, an economics professor whose research has focused on economic history and international migration, has researched the mortality rates among Africans during the voyages of the Atlantic slave trade. He found that mortality rates decreased over the history of the slave trade, primarily because the length of time necessary for the voyage was declining. \"In the eighteenth century many slave voyages took at least 2\u00bd months. In the nineteenth century, 2 months appears to have been the maximum length of the voyage, and many voyages were far shorter. Fewer slaves died in the Middle Passage over time mainly because the passage was shorter.\"Despite the vast profits of slavery, the ordinary sailors on slave ships were badly paid and subject to harsh discipline. Mortality of around 20%, a number similar and sometimes greater than those of the slaves, was expected in a ship's crew during the course of a voyage; this was due to disease, flogging, overwork, or slave uprisings. Disease (malaria or yellow fever) was the most common cause of death among sailors. A high crew mortality rate on the return voyage was in the captain's interests as it reduced the number of sailors who had to be paid on reaching the home port.The slave trade was hated by many sailors, and those who joined the crews of slave ships often did so through coercion or because they could find no other employment.\n\n\n=== Seasoning camps ===\nMeltzer also states that 33% of Africans would have died in the first year at the seasoning camps found throughout the Caribbean. Jamaica held one of the most notorious of these camps. Dysentery was the leading cause of death. Around 5 million Africans died in these camps, reducing the number of survivors to about 10 million.\n\n\n== Diseases ==\nMany diseases, each capable of killing a large minority or even a majority of a new human population, arrived in the Americas before 1492. They include smallpox, malaria, bubonic plague, typhus, influenza, measles, diphtheria, yellow fever, and whooping cough. During the Atlantic slave trade following the discovery of the New World, diseases such as these are recorded as causing mass mortality.Evolutionary history may also have played a role in resisting the diseases of the slave trade. Compared to African and Europeans, New World populations did not have a history of exposure to diseases such as malaria, and therefore, no genetic resistance had been produced as a result of adaptation through natural selection.Levels and extent of immunity varies from disease to disease. For smallpox and measles for example, those who survive are equipped with the immunity to combat the disease for the rest of their life in that they cannot contract the disease again. There are also diseases, such as malaria, which do not confer effective lasting immunity.\n\n\n=== Smallpox ===\nEpidemics of smallpox were known for causing a significant decrease in the indigenous population of the New World. The effects on survivors included pockmarks on the skin which left deep scars, commonly causing significant disfigurement. Some Europeans, who believed the plague of syphilis in Europe to have come from the Americas, saw smallpox as the European revenge against the Natives. Africans and Europeans, unlike the native population, often had lifelong immunity, because they had often been exposed to minor forms of the illness such as cowpox or variola minor disease in childhood. By the late 16th century there existed some forms of inoculation and variolation in Africa and the Middle East. One practice features Arab traders in Africa \"buying-off\" the disease in which a cloth that had been previously exposed to the sickness was to be tied to another child's arm to increase immunity. Another practice involved taking pus from a smallpox scab and putting it in the cut of a healthy individual in an attempt to have a mild case of the disease in the future rather than the effects becoming fatal.\n\n\n== European competition ==\nThe trade of enslaved Africans in the Atlantic has its origins in the explorations of Portuguese mariners down the coast of West Africa in the 15th century. Before that, contact with African slave markets was made to ransom Portuguese who had been captured by the intense North African Barbary pirate attacks on Portuguese ships and coastal villages, frequently leaving them depopulated. The first Europeans to use enslaved Africans in the New World were the Spaniards, who sought auxiliaries for their conquest expeditions and labourers on islands such as Cuba and Hispaniola. The alarming decline in the native population had spurred the first royal laws protecting them (Laws of Burgos, 1512\u201313). The first enslaved Africans arrived in Hispaniola in 1501. After Portugal had succeeded in establishing sugar plantations (engenhos) in northern Brazil c. 1545, Portuguese merchants on the West African coast began to supply enslaved Africans to the sugar planters. While at first these planters had relied almost exclusively on the native Tupani for slave labour, after 1570 they began importing Africans, as a series of epidemics had decimated the already destabilized Tupani communities. By 1630, Africans had replaced the Tupani as the largest contingent of labour on Brazilian sugar plantations. This ended the European medieval household tradition of slavery, resulted in Brazil's receiving the most enslaved Africans, and revealed sugar cultivation and processing as the reason that roughly 84% of these Africans were shipped to the New World.\n\nAs Britain rose in naval power and settled continental North America and some islands of the West Indies, they became the leading slave traders. At one stage the trade was the monopoly of the Royal Africa Company, operating out of London. But, following the loss of the company's monopoly in 1689, Bristol and Liverpool merchants became increasingly involved in the trade. By the late 17th century, one out of every four ships that left Liverpool harbour was a slave trading ship. Much of the wealth on which the city of Manchester, and surrounding towns, was built in the late 18th century, and for much of the 19th century, was based on the processing of slave-picked cotton and manufacture of cloth. Other British cities also profited from the slave trade. Birmingham, the largest gun-producing town in Britain at the time, supplied guns to be traded for slaves. 75% of all sugar produced in the plantations was sent to London, and much of it was consumed in the highly lucrative coffee houses there.\n\n\n== New World destinations ==\nThe first slaves to arrive as part of a labour force in the New World reached the island of Hispaniola (now Haiti and the Dominican Republic) in 1502. Cuba received its first four slaves in 1513. Jamaica received its first shipment of 4000 slaves in 1518. Slave exports to Honduras and Guatemala started in 1526.\nThe first enslaved Africans to reach what would become the United States arrived in July 1526 as part of a Spanish attempt to colonize San Miguel de Gualdape. By November the 300 Spanish colonists were reduced to 100, and their slaves from 100 to 70. The enslaved people revolted in 1526 and joined a nearby Native American tribe, while the Spanish abandoned the colony altogether (1527). The area of the future Colombia received its first enslaved people in 1533. El Salvador, Costa Rica and Florida began their stints in the slave trade in 1541, 1563 and 1581, respectively.\nThe 17th century saw an increase in shipments. Africans were brought to Point Comfort \u2013 several miles downriver from the English colony of Jamestown, Virginia \u2013 in 1619. The first kidnapped Africans in English North America were classed as indentured servants and freed after seven years. Virginia law codified chattel slavery in 1656, and in 1662 the colony adopted the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, which classified children of slave mothers as slaves, regardless of paternity.\nBy 1802, Russian colonists noted that \"Boston\" (U.S.-based) skippers were trading African slaves for otter pelts with the Tlingit people in Southeast Alaska.\nNotes: \n\nThe number of Africans who arrived in each region is calculated from the total number of slaves imported, about 10,000,000.\nIncludes British Guiana and British Honduras\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economics of slavery ==\n\nIn France in the 18th century, returns for investors in plantations averaged around 6%; as compared to 5% for most domestic alternatives, this represented a 20% profit advantage. Risks\u2014maritime and commercial\u2014were important for individual voyages. Investors mitigated it by buying small shares of many ships at the same time. In that way, they were able to diversify a large part of the risk away. Between voyages, ship shares could be freely sold and bought.By far the most financially profitable West Indian colonies in 1800 belonged to the United Kingdom. After entering the sugar colony business late, British naval supremacy and control over key islands such as Jamaica, Trinidad, the Leeward Islands and Barbados and the territory of British Guiana gave it an important edge over all competitors; while many British did not make gains, a handful of individuals made small fortunes. This advantage was reinforced when France lost its most important colony, St. Domingue (western Hispaniola, now Haiti), to a slave revolt in 1791 and supported revolts against its rival Britain, in the name of liberty after the 1793 French revolution. Before 1791, British sugar had to be protected to compete against cheaper French sugar.\nAfter 1791, the British islands produced the most sugar, and the British people quickly became the largest consumers. West Indian sugar became ubiquitous as an additive to Indian tea. It has been estimated that the profits of the slave trade and of West Indian plantations created up to one-in-twenty of every pound circulating in the British economy at the time of the Industrial Revolution in the latter half of the 18th century.\n\n\n== Effects ==\n\nHistorian Walter Rodney has argued that at the start of the slave trade in the 16th century, although there was a technological gap between Europe and Africa, it was not very substantial. Both continents were using Iron Age technology. The major advantage that Europe had was in ship building. During the period of slavery, the populations of Europe and the Americas grew exponentially, while the population of Africa remained stagnant. Rodney contended that the profits from slavery were used to fund economic growth and technological advancement in Europe and the Americas. Based on earlier theories by Eric Williams, he asserted that the industrial revolution was at least in part funded by agricultural profits from the Americas. He cited examples such as the invention of the steam engine by James Watt, which was funded by plantation owners from the Caribbean.Other historians have attacked both Rodney's methodology and accuracy. Joseph C. Miller has argued that the social change and demographic stagnation (which he researched on the example of West Central Africa) was caused primarily by domestic factors. Joseph Inikori provided a new line of argument, estimating counterfactual demographic developments in case the Atlantic slave trade had not existed. Patrick Manning has shown that the slave trade did have a profound impact on African demographics and social institutions, but criticized Inikori's approach for not taking other factors (such as famine and drought) into account, and thus being highly speculative.\n\n\n=== Effect on the economy of West Africa ===\n\nNo scholars dispute the harm done to the enslaved people but the effect of the trade on African societies is much debated, due to the apparent influx of goods to Africans. Proponents of the slave trade, such as Archibald Dalzel, argued that African societies were robust and not much affected by the trade. In the 19th century, European abolitionists, most prominently Dr. David Livingstone, took the opposite view, arguing that the fragile local economy and societies were being severely harmed by the trade.\nBecause the negative effects of slavery on the economies of Africa have been well documented, namely the significant decline in population, some African rulers likely saw an economic benefit from trading their subjects with European slave traders. With the exception of Portuguese-controlled Angola, coastal African leaders \"generally controlled access to their coasts, and were able to prevent direct enslavement of their subjects and citizens\". Thus, as African scholar John Thornton argues, African leaders who allowed the continuation of the slave trade likely derived an economic benefit from selling their subjects to Europeans. The Kingdom of Benin, for instance, participated in the African slave trade, at will, from 1715 to 1735, surprising Dutch traders, who had not expected to buy slaves in Benin. The benefit derived from trading slaves for European goods was enough to make the Kingdom of Benin rejoin the trans-Atlantic slave trade after centuries of non-participation. Such benefits included military technology (specifically guns and gunpowder), gold, or simply maintaining amicable trade relationships with European nations. The slave trade was, therefore, a means for some African elites to gain economic advantages. Historian Walter Rodney estimates that by c.1770, the King of Dahomey was earning an estimated \u00a3250,000 per year by selling captive African soldiers and enslaved people to the European slave-traders. Many West African countries also already had a tradition of holding slaves, which was expanded into trade with Europeans.\nThe Atlantic trade brought new crops to Africa and also more efficient currencies which were adopted by the West African merchants. This can be interpreted as an institutional reform which reduced the cost of doing business. But the developmental benefits were limited as long as the business including slaving.Both Thornton and Fage contend that while African political elite may have ultimately benefited from the slave trade, their decision to participate may have been influenced more by what they could lose by not participating. In Fage's article \"Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Context of West African History\", he notes that for West Africans \"... there were really few effective means of mobilizing labour for the economic and political needs of the state\" without the slave trade.\n\n\n=== Effects on the British economy ===\n\nHistorian Eric Williams in 1944 argued that the profits that Britain received from its sugar colonies, or from the slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean, contributed to the financing of Britain's industrial revolution. However, he says that by the time of the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, and the emancipation of the slaves in 1833, the sugar plantations of the British West Indies had lost their profitability, and it was in Britain's economic interest to emancipate the slaves.Other researchers and historians have strongly contested what has come to be referred to as the \"Williams thesis\" in academia. David Richardson has concluded that the profits from the slave trade amounted to less than 1% of domestic investment in Britain. Economic historian Stanley Engerman finds that even without subtracting the associated costs of the slave trade (e.g., shipping costs, slave mortality, mortality of British people in Africa, defense costs) or reinvestment of profits back into the slave trade, the total profits from the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to less than 5% of the British economy during any year of the Industrial Revolution. Engerman's 5% figure gives as much as possible in terms of benefit of the doubt to the Williams argument, not solely because it does not take into account the associated costs of the slave trade to Britain, but also because it carries the full-employment assumption from economics and holds the gross value of slave trade profits as a direct contribution to Britain's national income. Historian Richard Pares, in an article written before Williams' book, dismisses the influence of wealth generated from the West Indian plantations upon the financing of the Industrial Revolution, stating that whatever substantial flow of investment from West Indian profits into industry there occurred after emancipation, not before. However, each of these works focus primarily on the slave trade or the Industrial Revolution, and not the main body of the Williams thesis, which was on sugar and slavery itself. Therefore, they do not refute the main body of the Williams thesis.Seymour Drescher and Robert Anstey argue the slave trade remained profitable until the end, and that moralistic reform, not economic incentive, was primarily responsible for abolition. They say slavery remained profitable in the 1830s because of innovations in agriculture. However, Drescher's Econocide wraps up its study in 1823, and does not address the majority of the Williams thesis, which covers the decline of the sugar plantations after 1823, the emancipation of the slaves in the 1830s, and the subsequent abolition of sugar duties in the 1840s. These arguments do not refute the main body of the Williams thesis, which presents economic data to show that the slave trade was minor compared to the wealth generated by sugar and slavery itself in the British Caribbean.Karl Marx, in his influential economic history of capitalism, Das Kapital, wrote that \"... the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signaled the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production\". He argued that the slave trade was part of what he termed the \"primitive accumulation\" of capital, the 'non-capitalist' accumulation of wealth that preceded and created the financial conditions for Britain's industrialisation.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\n\nThe demographic effects of the slave trade is a controversial and highly debated issue. Although scholars such as Paul Adams and Erick D. Langer have estimated that sub-Saharan Africa represented about 18 percent of the world's population in 1600 and only 6 percent in 1900, the reasons for this demographic shift have been the subject of much debate. In addition to the depopulation Africa experienced because of the slave trade, African nations were left with severely imbalanced gender ratios, with females comprising up to 65 percent of the population in hard-hit areas such as Angola. Moreover, many scholars (such as Barbara N. Ramusack) have suggested a link between the prevalence of prostitution in Africa today with the temporary marriages that were enforced during the course of the slave trade.Walter Rodney argued that the export of so many people had been a demographic disaster which left Africa permanently disadvantaged when compared to other parts of the world, and it largely explains the continent's continued poverty. He presented numbers showing that Africa's population stagnated during this period, while those of Europe and Asia grew dramatically. According to Rodney, all other areas of the economy were disrupted by the slave trade as the top merchants abandoned traditional industries in order to pursue slaving, and the lower levels of the population were disrupted by the slaving itself.\nOthers have challenged this view. J. D. Fage compared the demographic effect on the continent as a whole. David Eltis has compared the numbers to the rate of emigration from Europe during this period. In the 19th century alone over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas, a far higher rate than were ever taken from Africa.Other scholars accused Walter Rodney of mischaracterizing the trade between Africans and Europeans. They argue that Africans, or more accurately African elites, deliberately let European traders join in an already large trade in enslaved people and that they were not patronized.As Joseph E. Inikori argues, the history of the region shows that the effects were still quite deleterious. He argues that the African economic model of the period was very different from the European model, and could not sustain such population losses. Population reductions in certain areas also led to widespread problems. Inikori also notes that after the suppression of the slave trade Africa's population almost immediately began to rapidly increase, even prior to the introduction of modern medicines.\n\n\n=== Legacy of racism ===\n\nWalter Rodney states:\n\nThe role of slavery in promoting racist prejudice and ideology has been carefully studied in certain situations, especially in the USA. The simple fact is that no people can enslave another for four centuries without coming out with a notion of superiority, and when the colour and other physical traits of those peoples were quite different it was inevitable that the prejudice should take a racist form.\nEric Williams argued that \"A racial twist [was] given to what is basically an economic phenomenon. Slavery was not born of racism: rather, racism was the consequence of slavery.\"Similarly, John Darwin writes \"The rapid conversion from white indentured labour to black slavery... made the English Caribbean a frontier of civility where English (later British) ideas about race and slave labour were ruthlessly adapted to local self-interest...Indeed, the root justification for the system of slavery and the savage apparatus of coercion on which its preservation depended was the ineradicable barbarism of the slave population, a product, it was argued, of its African origins\".\n\n\n== End of the Atlantic slave trade ==\n\nIn Britain, America, Portugal and in parts of Europe, opposition developed against the slave trade. Davis says that abolitionists assumed \"that an end to slave imports would lead automatically to the amelioration and gradual abolition of slavery\". In Britain and America, opposition to the trade was led by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and establishment Evangelicals such as William Wilberforce. Many people joined the movement and they began to protest against the trade, but they were opposed by the owners of the colonial holdings. Following Lord Mansfield's decision in 1772, many abolitionists and slave-holders believed that slaves became free upon entering the British isles. However, in reality slavery continued in Britain right up to abolition in the 1830s. The Mansfield ruling on Somerset v Stewart only decreed that a slave could not be transported out of England against his will.Under the leadership of Thomas Jefferson, the new state of Virginia in 1778 became the first state and one of the first jurisdictions anywhere to stop the importation of slaves for sale; it made it a crime for traders to bring in slaves from out of state or from overseas for sale; migrants from within the United States were allowed to bring their own slaves. The new law freed all slaves brought in illegally after its passage and imposed heavy fines on violators. All the other states in the United States followed suit, although South Carolina reopened its slave trade in 1803.Denmark, which had been active in the slave trade, was the first country to ban the trade through legislation in 1792, which took effect in 1803. Britain banned the slave trade in 1807, imposing stiff fines for any slave found aboard a British ship (see Slave Trade Act 1807). The Royal Navy moved to stop other nations from continuing the slave trade and declared that slaving was equal to piracy and was punishable by death. The United States Congress passed the Slave Trade Act of 1794, which prohibited the building or outfitting of ships in the U.S. for use in the slave trade. The U.S. Constitution barred a federal prohibition on importing slaves for 20 years; at that time the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves prohibited imports on the first day the Constitution permitted: January 1, 1808.\n\n\n=== British abolitionism ===\nWilliam Wilberforce was a driving force in the British Parliament in the fight against the slave trade in the British Empire. The British abolitionists focused on the slave trade, arguing that the trade was not necessary for the economic success of sugar on the British West Indian colonies. This argument was accepted by wavering politicians, who did not want to destroy the valuable and important sugar colonies of the British Caribbean. The British parliament was also concerned about the success of the Haitian Revolution, and they believed they had to abolish the trade to prevent a similar conflagration from occurring in a British Caribbean colony.On 22 February 1807, the House of Commons passed a motion 283 votes to 16 to abolish the Atlantic slave trade. Hence, the slave trade was abolished, but not the still-economically viable institution of slavery itself, which provided Britain's most lucrative import at the time, sugar. Abolitionists did not move against sugar and slavery itself until after the sugar industry went into terminal decline after 1823.At the same time, although without mutual consultation, the United States abolished the slave trade the same year, but not its internal slave trade which became the dominant character in American slavery until the 1860s. In 1805 the British Order-in-Council had restricted the importation of slaves into colonies that had been captured from France and the Netherlands. Britain continued to press other nations to end its trade; in 1810 an Anglo-Portuguese treaty was signed whereby Portugal agreed to restrict its trade into its colonies; an 1813 Anglo-Swedish treaty whereby Sweden outlawed its slave trade; the Treaty of Paris 1814 where France agreed with Britain that the trade is \"repugnant to the principles of natural justice\" and agreed to abolish the slave trade in five years; the 1814 Anglo-Netherlands treaty where the Dutch outlawed its slave trade.\n\n\n=== Castlereagh and Palmerston's diplomacy ===\nAbolitionist opinion in Britain was strong enough in 1807 to abolish the slave trade in all British possessions, although slavery itself persisted in the colonies until 1833. Abolitionists after 1807 focused on international agreements to abolish the slave trade. Foreign Minister Castlereagh switched his position and became a strong supporter of the movement. Britain arrange treaties with Portugal Sweden and Denmark, 1810\u20131814, whereby they agreed to end or restrict their trading. These were preliminary to the Congress of Vienna negotiations that Castlereagh dominated and which resulted in a general declaration condemning the slave trade. The problem was that the treaties and declarations were hard to enforce, given the very high profits available to private interests. As Foreign Minister, Castlereagh cooperated with senior officials to use the Royal Navy to detect and capture slave ships. He used diplomacy to make search and seize agreements with all the government whose ships were trading. There was serious friction with the United States, where the southern slave interest was politically powerful. Washington recoiled at British policing of the high seas. Spain, France, and Portugal also relied on the international slave trade to supply their colonial plantations.\nAs more and more diplomatic arrangements were made by Castlereagh, the owners of slave ships started flying false flags of nations that had not agreed, especially the United States. It was illegal under American law for American ships to engage in the slave trade, but the idea of Britain enforcing American laws was unacceptable to Washington. Lord Palmerston and other British foreign ministers continued the Castlereagh policies. Eventually, in 1842 in 1845, an arrangement was reached between London and Washington. With the arrival of a staunchly anti-slavery government in Washington in 1861, the Atlantic slave trade was doomed. In the long run, Castlereagh's strategy on how to stifle the slave trade proved successful.Prime Minister Palmerston detested slavery, and in Nigeria in 1851 he took advantage of divisions in native politics, the presence of Christian missionaries, and the maneuvers of British consul John Beecroft to encourage the overthrow of King Kosoko. The new King Akitoye was a docile nonslave-trading puppet.\n\n\n=== British Royal Navy ===\nThe Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron, established in 1808, grew by 1850 to a force of some 25 vessels, which were tasked with combating slavery along the African coast. Between 1807 and 1860, the Royal Navy's Squadron seized approximately 1,600 ships involved in the slave trade and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard these vessels. Several hundred slaves a year were transported by the navy to the British colony of Sierra Leone, where they were made to serve as \"apprentices\" in the colonial economy until the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.\n\n\n=== Last slave ship to the United States ===\nThe last recorded slave ship to land on U.S. soil was the Clotilde, which in 1859 illegally smuggled a number of Africans into the town of Mobile, Alabama. The Africans on board were sold as slaves; however, slavery in the U.S. was abolished five years later following the end of the American Civil War in 1865. Cudjoe Lewis, who died in 1935, was long believed to be the last survivor of the Clotilde and the last surviving slave brought from Africa to the United States but recent research has found that two other survivors from the Clotilde outlived him, Redoshi (who died in 1937) and Matilda McCrear (who died in 1940).\nThe last country to ban the Atlantic slave trade was Brazil in 1831. However, a vibrant illegal trade continued to ship large numbers of enslaved people to Brazil and also to Cuba until the 1860s, when British enforcement and further diplomacy finally ended the Atlantic slave trade. In 1870, Portugal ended the last trade route with the Americas, where the last country to import slaves was Brazil. In Brazil, however, slavery itself was not ended until 1888, making it the last country in the Americas to end involuntary servitude.\n\n\n=== Economic motivation to end the slave trade ===\nThe historian Walter Rodney contends that it was a decline in the profitability of the triangular trades that made it possible for certain basic human sentiments to be asserted at the decision-making level in a number of European countries\u2014Britain being the most crucial because it was the greatest carrier of African captives across the Atlantic. Rodney states that changes in productivity, technology, and patterns of exchange in Europe and the Americas informed the decision by the British to end their participation in the trade in 1807. In 1809 President James Madison outlawed the slave trade with the United States.Nevertheless, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri argue that it was neither a strictly economic nor moral matter. First, because slavery was (in practice) still beneficial to capitalism, providing not only an influx of capital but also disciplining hardship into workers (a form of \"apprenticeship\" to the capitalist industrial plant). The more \"recent\" argument of a \"moral shift\" (the basis of the previous lines of this article) is described by Hardt and Negri as an \"ideological\" apparatus in order to eliminate the sentiment of guilt in western society. Although moral arguments did play a secondary role, they usually had major resonance when used as a strategy to undercut competitors' profits. This argument holds that Eurocentric history has been blind to the most important element in this fight for emancipation, precisely, the constant revolt and the antagonism of slaves' revolts. The most important of those being the Haitian Revolution. The shock of this revolution in 1804, certainly introduces an essential political argument into the end of the slave trade, which happened only three years later.However, both James Stephen and Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux wrote that the slave trade could be abolished for the benefit of the British colonies, and the latter's pamphlet was often used in parliamentary debates in favour of abolition. William Pitt the Younger argued on the basis of these writings that the British colonies would be better off, in economics as well as security, if the trade was abolished. As a result, according to historian Christer Petley, abolitionists argued, and even some absentee plantation owners accepted, that the trade could be abolished \"without substantial damage to the plantation economy\". William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville argued that \"the slave population of the colonies could be maintained without it.\" Petley points out that government took the decision to abolish the trade \"with the express intention of improving, not destroying, the still-lucrative plantation economy of the British West Indies.\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== African diaspora ===\n\nThe African diaspora which was created via slavery has been a complex interwoven part of American history and culture. In the United States, the success of Alex Haley's book Roots: The Saga of an American Family, published in 1976, and Roots, the subsequent television miniseries based upon it, broadcast on the ABC network in January 1977, led to an increased interest and appreciation of African heritage amongst the African-American community. The influence of these led many African Americans to begin researching their family histories and making visits to West Africa. For instance, for the essence of the role played by Bono Manso in the Atlantic slave trade, a road sign has been raised for Martin Luther King Jr Village at Manso, presently in Bono East region of Ghana. In turn, a tourist industry grew up to supply them. One notable example of this is through the Roots Homecoming Festival held annually in the Gambia, in which rituals are held through which African Americans can symbolically \"come home\" to Africa. Issues of dispute have however developed between African Americans and African authorities over how to display historic sites that were involved in the Atlantic slave trade, with prominent voices in the former criticising the latter for not displaying such sites sensitively, but instead treating them as a commercial enterprise.\n\n\n=== \"Back to Africa\" ===\n\nIn 1816, a group of wealthy European-Americans, some of whom were abolitionists and others who were racial segregationists, founded the American Colonization Society with the express desire of sending African Americans who were in the United States to West Africa. In 1820, they sent their first ship to Liberia, and within a decade around two thousand African Americans had been settled there. Such re-settlement continued throughout the 19th century, increasing following the deterioration of race relations in the Southern states of the US following Reconstruction in 1877.\n\n\n=== Rastafari movement ===\nThe Rastafari movement, which originated in Jamaica, where 92% of the population are descended from the Atlantic slave trade, has made efforts to publicize the slavery and to ensure it is not forgotten, especially through reggae music.\n\n\n=== Apologies ===\n\n\n==== Worldwide ====\nIn 1998, UNESCO designated 23 August as International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. Since then there have been a number of events recognizing the effects of slavery.\nAt the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa, African nations demanded a clear apology for slavery from the former slave-trading countries. Some nations were ready to express an apology, but the opposition, mainly from the United Kingdom, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and the United States blocked attempts to do so. A fear of monetary compensation might have been one of the reasons for the opposition. As of 2009, efforts are underway to create a UN Slavery Memorial as a permanent remembrance of the victims of the Atlantic slave trade.\n\n\n==== Benin ====\nIn 1999, President Mathieu Kerekou of Benin (formerly the Kingdom of Dahomey) issued a national apology for the role Africans played in the Atlantic slave trade. Luc Gnacadja, minister of environment and housing for Benin, later said: \"The slave trade is a shame, and we do repent for it.\" Researchers estimate that 3 million slaves were exported out of the Slave Coast bordering the Bight of Benin.\n\n\n==== France ====\nOn 30 January 2006, Jacques Chirac (the then French President) said that 10 May would henceforth be a national day of remembrance for the victims of slavery in France, marking the day in 2001 when France passed a law recognising slavery as a crime against humanity.\n\n\n==== Ghana ====\nPresident Jerry Rawlings of Ghana apologized for his country's involvement in the slave trade.\n\n\n==== Netherlands ====\nAt a UN conference on the Atlantic slave trade in 2001, the Dutch Minister for Urban Policy and Integration of Ethnic Minorities Roger van Boxtel said that the Netherlands \"recognizes the grave injustices of the past.\" On 1 July 2013, at the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the Dutch West Indies, the Dutch government expressed \"deep regret and remorse\" for the involvement of the Netherlands in the Atlantic slave trade. The Dutch government has remained short of a formal apology for its involvement in the Atlantic slave trade, as an apology implies that it considers its own actions of the past as unlawful, and could lead to litigation for monetary compensation by descendants of the enslaved.\n\n\n==== Nigeria ====\nIn 2009, the Civil Rights Congress of Nigeria has written an open letter to all African chieftains who participated in trade calling for an apology for their role in the Atlantic slave trade: \"We cannot continue to blame the white men, as Africans, particularly the traditional rulers, are not blameless. In view of the fact that the Americans and Europe have accepted the cruelty of their roles and have forcefully apologized, it would be logical, reasonable and humbling if African traditional rulers ... [can] accept blame and formally apologize to the descendants of the victims of their collaborative and exploitative slave trade.\"\n\n\n==== Uganda ====\nIn 1998, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda called tribal chieftains to apologize for their involvement in the slave trade: \"African chiefs were the ones waging war on each other and capturing their own people and selling them. If anyone should apologise it should be the African chiefs. We still have those traitors here even today.\"\n\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nOn 9 December 1999, Liverpool City Council passed a formal motion apologizing for the city's part in the slave trade. It was unanimously agreed that Liverpool acknowledges its responsibility for its involvement in three centuries of the slave trade. The City Council has made an unreserved apology for Liverpool's involvement and the continual effect of slavery on Liverpool's black communities.On 27 November 2006, British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a partial apology for Britain's role in the African slavery trade. However African rights activists denounced it as \"empty rhetoric\" that failed to address the issue properly. They feel his apology stopped shy to prevent any legal retort. Blair again apologized on 14 March 2007.On 24 August 2007, Ken Livingstone (Mayor of London) apologized publicly for London's role in the slave trade. \"You can look across there to see the institutions that still have the benefit of the wealth they created from slavery,\" he said, pointing towards the financial district, before breaking down in tears. He said that London was still tainted by the horrors of slavery. Jesse Jackson praised Mayor Livingstone and added that reparations should be made.\n\n\n==== United States ====\nOn 24 February 2007, the Virginia General Assembly passed House Joint Resolution Number 728 acknowledging \"with profound regret the involuntary servitude of Africans and the exploitation of Native Americans, and call for reconciliation among all Virginians\". With the passing of that resolution, Virginia became the first of the 50 United States to acknowledge through the state's governing body their state's involvement in slavery. The passing of this resolution came on the heels of the 400th-anniversary celebration of the city of Jamestown, Virginia, which was the first permanent English colony to survive in what would become the United States. Jamestown is also recognized as one of the first slave ports of the American colonies. On 31 May 2007, the Governor of Alabama, Bob Riley, signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" for Alabama's role in slavery and apologizing for slavery's wrongs and lingering effects. Alabama is the fourth state to pass a slavery apology, following votes by the legislatures in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.On 30 July 2008, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution apologizing for American slavery and subsequent discriminatory laws. The language included a reference to the \"fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow\" segregation. On 18 June 2009, the United States Senate issued an apologetic statement decrying the \"fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery\". The news was welcomed by President Barack Obama.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n==== Academic books ====\n\n\n==== Academic articles ====\n\n\n==== Non-academic sources ====\nRevealing Histories, Remembering Slavery.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVoyages: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database\nQuick guide: The slave trade \u2013 BBC News\nSlave Trade and Abolition of slavery \u2013 Teaching resources at Black History 4 Schools\nBritish documents on slave holding and the slave trade, 1788\u20131793",

        "wiki": "Hatley Park National Historic Site is located in Colwood, British Columbia, in Greater Victoria. It is the site of Hatley Castle, a Classified Federal Heritage Building. Since 1995, the mansion and estate have been used for the public Royal Roads University. From the 1940s to 1995, it was used for the Royal Roads Military College, a naval training facility.\nThe extensive grounds of the historic site have formal gardens, former farmland, and trails through mature stands of first and second-growth forest, including large Douglas fir and western red cedar.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Hatley Castle and Gardens ===\nIn 1906, B.C.'s Lieutenant Governor, James Dunsmuir, who was of Scottish descent, purchased the property.  He and his wife Laura commissioned the renowned Canadian architect Samuel Maclure to build a 40-room mansion in the Scottish baronial style; the Tudor revival style was popular in the Edwardian period. The Dunsmuirs created many beautiful formal gardens using the services of renowned American garden designers Franklin Brett and George D. Hall of Boston, Massachusetts. The Dunsmuirs named their estate \"Hatley Park\", in the tradition of British and European private estates. The castle became a landmark and was occupied by descendants of the Dunsmuir family until the last years of the Great Depression.\nFollowing the death of Laura Dunsmuir in 1937 the estate was sold to the Government of Canada in 1939. The government sold off some of the land and during five days in June 1939, \"Maynard & Sons\" conducted a public auction of the mansion's contents totaling 927 lots. In 2008, the 100th anniversary of Hatley Castle was celebrated.\nA Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada plaque reads:\n\nHatley Park. This superb example of an Edwardian park was laid out for James and Laura Dunsmuir in the early 20th century. At its centre stands a Tudor Revival mansion, whose picturesque design is enhanced by a rich array of decoration and fine craftmanship. The grounds, featuring a variety of native and exotic vegetation, unfold from formal gardens to recreational spaces, farmlands and forests. Acquired by the Canadian armed forces in 1940, Hatley Park evolved to meet the needs of Royal Roads Military College in a manner that has preserved its essential Edwardian character.\nThe Royal Roads Military College band consisting of 15 pipers and drummers and 30 brass-and-reed musician recorded an LP in 1983\u20131984. Petty Officer First Class Gabby R. Bruner, RRMC bandmaster from 1979 to 1985, composed \"Hatley Park\" as the official quick march for the RRMC and \"Dunsmuir Castle\" for the Visit of Queen Elizabeth to RRMC in 1983.\n\n\n=== Planned royal residence ===\nAt the outbreak of World War II, contingency plans were made for King George VI, his wife Queen Elizabeth, and their two daughters, princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, to reside in Canada in the event of an invasion of Britain. The family's primary options were stately homes in England, but Victoria, BC was the backup site in case German troops reached the Midlands. (See Coats Mission.)\nThe federal Crown-in-Council purchased Hatley Castle in 1940 for use as the King's royal residence. The Royal Family and government decided against their leaving the UK during the war, and the family stayed in London.\n\n\n=== Royal Roads Military College ===\nThe Canadian government adapted the mansion as a naval training facility.  From 1948 it was known as the Royal Roads Military College.  It is named for the Royal Roads body of water, which forms the entrance into Esquimalt Harbour from the Strait of Juan de Fuca, lying to the east of the facility. The military college was closed in 1995 and the estate leased to the Province of British Columbia.  That same year, the castle and grounds were designated a National Historic Site of Canada.In September 1995, Royal Roads University was opened as a public, degree-granting university.  It leases the campus from the Department of National Defence for $1 per year. The university manages all stewardship responsibilities related to the site, including site management, operations, heritage preservation and restoration, and educating the public about the site's history and natural resources.\n\n\n== Hatley Gardens ==\nIn 1912, the Dunsmuirs engaged the American landscape architects Franklin Brett and George D. Hall of Boston, students of Frederick Law Olmsted, to develop a landscape for the entire site. They prepared a classic design for an Edwardian park that included the overall layout for the entire property. The plan organized the estate into four distinct landscape zones, progressing from a series of nine formal 'garden rooms' near Hatley Castle, to recreational spaces, then to agricultural lands, and finally to the forest surrounding the estate.\nDuring the Dunsmuir era, approximately 100 gardeners and groundskeepers tended the estate. During the years when the cadets attended Royal Roads Military College, the Department of National Defence employed approximately 50 gardeners and groundskeepers to maintain the property; a testimony to their commitment to retain the integrity of the estate.\nToday, Royal Roads University employs five full-time gardeners, one arborist, a garden curator, seven seasonal gardeners and groundskeepers, and one manager to tend to the entire 565-acre (2.29 km2) estate, including the formal gardens.\nAs the university does not receive any federal, provincial or municipal funding to maintain the site, the gardeners must make choices about the areas that can be best presented. They have made the Japanese, Rose and Italian gardens the showcase areas of the property.\n\n\n=== Admission fees controversy ===\nIn June 2006, citing the unfunded costs of heritage preservation (estimated to require an infusion of $20 million over the next decade for a capital program), the university started charging admission fees to its main heritage gardens, an area that makes up less than five per cent of the 565-acre (2.29 km2) campus. This prompted some public controversy. After delays to the plan to include parking and admission in an omnibus fee, RRU changed the fee structure to garden-only admission, i.e., $8 for adults from the original cost of $12 per adult. It also introduced a $15 four-month summer garden pass for residents of Greater Victoria, in addition to the free pass offered to residents of Colwood.\n\n\n== Use in TV and film ==\nHatley Castle is shown in the Smallville television series as Luthor Mansion, the estate belonging to Lex Luthor.\nThe interior of the castle was used for the Osborn Estate in Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man Trilogy\nThe castle has been featured in two series of X-Men related media as Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.\nThe 1996 television film Generation X\nThe X-Men film series, starting from 2003's X2: X-Men United and including X-Men: The Last Stand, Deadpool, and Deadpool 2. Elements of Hatley Castle's exterior influenced the new versions of Xavier's school in X-Men: Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse, and Dark Phoenix.\nThe castle is the house of Hubert, dog protagonist of The Duke.\nIt was used in the 1997 film, Masterminds as Shady Glen School, supposedly a private elementary school in California.\nThe castle was used in MacGyver TV series. In the second episode of season 5, \"The Legend of the Holy Rose, part 2\", as a hideout for the episode's villain.\nIn the TV series Seven Days, episode 9 of season 2, \"Love and Other Disasters\", the castle is used as a home for a royal family and a place for a royal wedding.\nIn the series Poltergeist: The Legacy, Hatley Castle was the headquarters of the San Francisco legacy.\nMany scenes of Fierce People (2004) were filmed in the interior and exterior of Hatley Castle. It was used as the stately home of the rich family clan of Ogden C. Osborne.\nThe ending scenes of The Changeling (1979) were filmed inside Hatley Castle.\nBig Time Movie, based on the TV series Big Time Rush, was filmed on some parts of the property for its 2011 release.\nShown in the Arrow television series as Queen Mansion, home of Oliver Queen and his family.\nShown in the Witches of East End television series as Home of Gardiner family.\nShown in The Killing television series as St. George's military academy.\nShown in the Disney movie Descendants (2015), Descendants 2 (2017), and Descendants 3 (2019) as Auradon Prep, the school for the children of Disney fairy tale characters.\nShown in the TV series The Dead Zone.\nShown in the Fox TV series Bones in the season 11 episode \"The Promise in the Palace\" as the Magic Palace.\nFeatured in the 2018 film The Professor.\nHosted the Starting Line of The Amazing Race Canada 6.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\nThe Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings lists nine recognized buildings and one classified building on the grounds of the Hatley Park National Historic Site.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHatley Park, Greater Victoria\n\n\n== References ==\n\nInformation about Hatley Gardens copied with permission from Hatley Park website\n\n\n== External links ==\nHatley Park Website\nRoyal Roads University",

          "Another longed for excursion...and to really think if I could have managed this one... There are steps..(a lot of them!!) from the beach...happy enough to climb the steps slowly..and look over the side to the falls below from the viewing platforms. Looked a lot of fun... OK its",
          "Was a free excursion with our stay at Couples. Very crowded as there were 2 cruise ships in the port the day we visited",
          "The falls were fun to see and climb. They seemed a little commercialized, though. The guides were excellent, and the falls are beautiful!",
          "My friend and I went to Dunn\u2019s River Falls and had the best time. We went with a group of people we didn\u2019t know and ended up meeting some great people. You hold hands as you go up the falls with strangers when you start out but then soon become friends with them. You really get",
          "The snorkling was great for beginners. Be prepared for a fairly physical walk up the vertical face of the waterfall. The trip back to Ochi is an absolute blast. Bring your dancing shoes.",

          "I liked the overall experience. The only thing i would say is you dont get to go on your own pace. It was all very fast and kind of rushed. They link you with a group of people (for safety) which isnt a problem but it would have been nice to lounge around a bit. The beach at the",
          "Fantastic experience! All the guides are friendly and they don\u2019t rush you. I was nervous for how treacherous this would be, but it was not bad at all. Bring your water shoes and best of all, find a catamaran to take you there!!",
          "During our visit to Jamaica my wife and I climbed Dunn\u2019s River Falls. The falls flow direct into the Caribbean Sea. We arrived as part of a group but you can walk the falls individually. I would say the group is better because you get the help of a guide who knows every inch of",
          "A must do when visiting Jamaica. It takes approx 45mins with a guide who helps you to climb the falls safely and brings fun to the adventure. There are exit points throughout the climb so if you find it difficult you can exit early and follow a path by the side of the falls. I\u2019m",
          "Dunn\u2019s Falls was great - had a blast and highly recommend- but the Nexus tour service wasted a lot of time first going into town to go to a \u201cshop\u201d - probably an hour wasted on that. Then they decided to take special lunch orders which caused up to have to stop again while 2",
          "I didn't actually go up but my husband did - not bad for a 70yr old! He really enjoyed it although the water was cold. He had a superb guide in Big Foot and they were laughing all the way even after being submerged as one point. they go up in groups and hold hands all the way.",
          "Worth the money spent! You could just buy the falls. $23 for adults. We bought an all day package. I would just buy the falls if I could do it again. The guide was amazing. You could never do this in the US. It is a little dangerous. But listen to your guide and stay close to",
          "We planned this carefully to make it memorable and relaxing. We arrived at 9am which is when they open and smart to beat the crowds. Find out if there is a day when cruise ships do not visit and that's the best day to visit again to avoid the crowds. If you can hire a guide just",
          "Amazing day as long as you don't mind getting wet. Climb up the water fall and then walk back down the path. Make sure you have swim shoes with you. Such a good experience, and great photo opportunities.",
          "Well. I went there with my mother and my sister. The journey begins at the beach where you start climbing up the falls. You need to wear water shoes (or sneakers if you don't have those, I used a pair of old sneakers and it was okay) and I recommend you to have both hands free",
          "Everyone who I know who has been here had said that if you go to Jamaica,then you have got to go to these falls. It was a great experience from start to finish.Our excursion was to climb the falls only and not visit the rest of the park so I can't comment on that. We had a great",

          "Climbing the falls was a lot of fun for my group of six people. The tour guides are extremely friendly and you feel like they really care when they are taking your pictures and recording your experience. After you are finished, they try to sell you a picture as well as a",

          "This was so much fun, I doubted that I should attempt, but our wonderful guide, Floyd, made sure I safely made it to the top. He was so great at helping the entire way up, he really cared for everyone. Floyd and the photographer Patrick were both so helpful. A must do!",
          "Had a rough start of the day, at the tour departure tent which was way too small for the number of people from the cruise ship they were stuffing into a tent with little to no air movement. But now let\u2019s talk abut the positive, lots of fun at Dunn River Falls.",
          "Beautiful place to explore and have fun. They do kind of want to rush you through, but you can do more exploring at the end on your own.",
          "The highlight of our Jamaica trip in Ocho Rios! Love the hand in hand strategy, truly great experience. I also like the fact that there were exit stops if you think you can no longer make it to the top and finish it. The video and picture they are selling to document your",

          "the falls themselves are spectacular. but be warned its not as easy as other reviews have stated you need to be fit and sure of foot and if you fall and hurt yourself as I did, do not expect any help AT ALL from any of the guides or other employees. there is a first aid station",
          "My husband and I had a great time climbing the falls. As others have said, make sure you buy the waterproof pouch ($10.00) for your phone. You can take picture with the camera in the pouch. Our guide took some great pictures of us. In addition, bring your own water shoes,",

          "This is definitely a great experience for everyone. They clearly take the $$ they collect and spend it on improving the grounds for everyone. First, you do NOT need a guide. It gets a little confusing, but the reality is that you can walk down a very high quality walkway,",
          "One of my favourite places in the world. Always visit every time I\u2019m in Jamaica. The falls are great to climb and I just love the sound of the rushing waters. Sadly the beach has been eroded over the last few years but there\u2019s still a beach area nonetheless. There\u2019s also a",

We were hesitant at first because we know it\u2019s a big tourist sight and we thought it\u2019d be crowded (it was) however it wasn\u2019t awful.

          "The water is super cold but refreshing right when you get in at the bottom. We've always done the catamaran from sandals to the falls and there's a snorkeling adventure after the climb. The falls are beautiful and a bit challenging, especially if they grab you and take you up",
          "Absolutely beautiful water falls and a lot of fun to climb. Just too crowded and probably not the safest place for little kids. The hecklers at the exit were obnoxious. I would give it a 5 star if only for the Falls.",
          "Had a great time at Dunn's River Falls. If we had known before, would have planned to spend more time at their park and beach area. You have to buy tickets to get in, but guides work of tips. Our guide took our photographs as well using our phone, and he was very careful to not",
          "Well it\u2019s one of the most talked out things to do on the Island, But was it worth it? Luckily enough of us we were based at the Moon Palace on Ocho Rios which is just 10 mins drive from Dunn\u2019s River Falls. On arrival you are taken straight to get your wristbands and walked",
          "Took the shuttle to Dunn\u2019s river falls. Nice driver. Great guide. Great experience. Very easy climb. Must have water shoes. Tip required. Money for locker. Not for seniors or the very young. As you can either over exert yourself or not be strong enough to get through the",
          "My wife, twin daughters almost 8 yrs old and I successfully completed this climb. One of my daughter lost one of her water shoe at the start of the climb but she still managed to do it with the other shoe and one bare feet! :). Our guide 'Big Belly' was very helpful and",
          "We were with a tour guide. It was really great to go up to the top. You need swimmingsuit because you will have some placed where you can jump in the water. It is a little bit of work to climb and it\u2019s slippery. You need also water shoes.",
          "We had friends recommend this excursion so we took it. It was so much fun. Lunch was included. The boat ride to Dunn's River Falls was fun and informative. If you are the daring type, hike UP the waterfalls. You won't be disappointed. Tight fitting watershoes are a must! Go and",
          "Put on some sturdy water shoes and hike up the Falls. A great way to cool off when the rest of the island is 95 degrees. Half the time you are holding hands in a chain which minimizes the chance of falling. I bought the video as a great memory for my son and me.",
          "its worth visiting the falls and climbing up the guides are great and the falls are beautiful there are several exits if you get tired its a wet and wonderful day.",
          "Such a great attraction if you find yourself in the Ocho Rios area of Jamaica! Our transfer to Dunn\u2019s River Falls was around 20 min from Beaches Resort Ocho Rios. We organized a private transfer & arrived at 9:30, before the crowds, on the Sunday before Christmas! We were",
          "Very enjoyable. The guide paid careful attention to our safely while climbing the falls. You will get wet. Wear wet shoes with good grip (available locally at $10). Best not to carry anything. Use a waterproof cover if using a mobile camera. You could avoid climbing the falls",
          "This place was awesome... fun and beautiful. Had a great day here. Only negative is the constant expectation of tips by guides...we already paid for trip but they literally stare at you until you give them cash tips. Everyone here has their hand out.",
          "Exhilarating! Be prepared to get totally soaked climbing up the falls. A feeling of accomplishment when you reach the top. I did it on my own with a sure footed guide who 'saved my life' a number of times. Well worth doing!!",
          "The whole thing is fun. Water crashing down, climbing up to the highest heights. But you could easily die, and that, i\u2019m afraid, is the cold hard truth.",
          "We visited Dunne's River Falls this week and had a blast! In my opinion this place is a must see while you are in Jamaica. It's a 10 minute bus ride from the town of Ocho Rios. The grounds between parking and entrance to the park are beautiful. It's in the Jamaican rain",
          "water is cold as hell. but fun to walk through the falls and the tour guys try to make it fun and enjoyable",
          "We are a family of 6 with 4 adult children (18-26). The tours from the cruise ship were very expensive for a large family. So after some research - I found Tours by Locals. We had a terrific time with our tour guide , Cyrian. The private tour was actually cheaper than the",
          "Took a trip to Dunn\u2019s river falls what a awesome place it\u2019s a must do on the list of trips. Shaun my guide across the falls was brilliant very patient and reassuring and took some fantastic photos for me.",

          "I had a great time while climbing the falls at Dunn's River. It was very safe and organized and the guides were very helpful. The rocks weren't slippery at all which made it easy for my family and I to quickly climb to the top. While climbing the falls, there are also mini",
          "Great visit. Tour guides and videographer were great. Fun tour up the falls. Just watch the locals at the end and do not pay full price for anything!!",
          "At the bottom of the fall, one needs to go under a ciment bridge about 4 feet high, crouching and fighting the rushing water. I am surprised that they let this go. Could be dangerous. Also running the fall should be for young, strong people. Ok but not really worth the trouble.",
          "At first sight it is slightly daunting, but the guides do a fantastic job of helping you climb the falls, you have to have water shoes and the rocks are not even slightly slippery. You will get wet so taking a camera is not advised. The falls are close to the main highway so",
          "Looking up, it's almost hard to believe you're about to scale these water falls, but the guides are superb & up you go !!! They show you where to step & where not to, you actually get quite good traction on the limestone, it's really not slippery at all. The current is strong",
          "There will be a photographer following along and requesting poses at each \"falls\" of everyone in your group - which they sell you at the end. Get there early to avoid lots of waiting - both to start and then all along the climb.",
          "I was at Dunn\u2019s River Falls about 30 years ago and it was covered with vendors selling souvenirs and mainly pot. Very aggressive vendors that really took away from the fun and beauty of the falls. I was happy to see that it is much cleaner and organized now and still a fun",
          "Went to fall as one of Disney Cruise excursions (Dunn River/Jerk Chicken lunch). The ride to the fall from port is about an hour. As most excursions are, the process to get to your bus and to destination is typical, hurry up and wait. Once you arrive you are given bands and",
          "Hand an amazing and refreshing time with friends as we climb the Dunn\u2019s River Falls. The guide was fun and made the climb funny. A must for all visiting Jamaica.",
          "Did an excursion when at the RIU Montego Bay. It began with snorkeling in the ocean followed by climb on the falls. You will get head to toe wet doing this activity. Great if you like climbing and adventure. Nnothing really special about this. The party on boat afterwards was",
          "We had a great time on this trip...it is not for the faint of heart and I would say you need to be in pretty decent shape to climb...swim shoes are a must!! I am a bit scared of heights and so this was a bit daunting at times for me. About half way up the falls there is a spot",
          "Signed up for the excursion from a cruise ship. Headed out with 4 friends and others from our ship. The weather was perfect and the falls great! Plan to get wet, as that is a huge part of the fun. An incredible experience. We were guided which made the climb more enjoyable,",
          "The only way to do Dunns River Falls, Is by a package tour, Where loads of people all go there as a group, and climb up from the beach. BUT If you are overweight, unfit. Achy joints, get out of breath DON'T GO As its really a tough climb going against the force of the water,",
          "Just an awesome way to experience garden, river & beach. The kids had a ball, grandma was able to manage the experience. I feel proud of Jamaica for Dunns River.",

          "We had a fun time but you are rushed through. It cost $25 and takes less than an hour. Get there really early, we got there 9am just before the tours started arriving there was just a couple of other people so it was nice and quiet. When we had finished the place was packed. You",
          "Amazing. We had a tour guide so was safe. Would recommend having one as they tell you were safe to climb etc. Such a huge fall. Didn't expect it to be so big. Worth every penny.",
          "This is a must if you go to Jamaica!!! We booked an excursion to visit the falls it was much more fun than we expected!! Water shoes and a waterproof case are a must!!! You need to be careful if you have small children as you can fall easily. But other than that is a great",
          "Firstly, you will need water shoes. Secondly, your guide will expect a tip for guiding you up the waterfalls without breaking your neck. Thirdly, follow the white signs to the exit after you have reached the top. The red exit signs have been placed around the place to lead you",
          "We did this quiet a few years back it was fantastic very good fun meet lots of people good experience to be fair good tour guides and lovely music enjoy",
          "My husband and I climbed alone, just paid $25 for each ticket, rented a lock to keep our belongings and ready for fun. Great experience. If you going in a cruise just take a taxi it's only 3 miles away from the port and they charged only $5, some guys ask for $20 wich its",
          "What a negative experience .... a tourist track.... thousands of tourist...nothing natural anymore and very expensive...you have to pay for not only entrance \u20ac30 but also for locker and special shoes . Standing in line to climb up the waterfall..",
          "Me and my partner did this excursion and booked through our hotel so we could go to the falls and 9 mile on the same day . The falls are absolutely breath taking and something you definitely need to visit if coming to Jamaica. As we booked a trip through our hotel we had a guide",
          "The Dunn\u2019s river was beyond beautiful. It was defiantly an aspect you will be proud of yourself for accomplishing. If you go with the right group it will be fantastic. My picked my excursion thru my hotel and the ride was good. Be prepared to tip! The only aspect i didn\u2019t enjoy",
          "Really enjoyed climbing Dunn\u2019s River Falls. There were a ton of people when I went, so it was a little messy with getting into a group with a tour guide and a videographer. You start holding hands for a human chain and the tour guide leads you up the falls. The energy of both",
          "The best time and experience of our lives. The staff was so friendly and helpful with climbing the falls. The videographer made the climb fun as well. Make sure you watch for the holes you wouldn\u2019t want to spring your ankle. We would definitely do this again",
          "Like all my other reviews about Ocho Rios adventures, this one again is a must do but this one is like the FIRST must do. I had read in my research that in the tour the guide usually does a boring human chain and wraps it up. However, it actually went very well for us thanks to",
          "You can't beat this rivet fall. We're have done it a few times and always enjoyed it. Though some parts are slippery. It takes awhile to get to the top but a great experience. Definitely recommend.",
          "This has been on my bucket list for years and while visiting Jamaica on a recent cruise chose to book this excursion through our cruise line. It was well organised. A bit of hanging about when we got there the a walk right down to the beach. The guides a skilled and important",
          "We traveled with a family, including 3.5 year old. Hence, we were apprehensive about going to this attraction. However, the guide made is so easy and fun for us. My younger one enjoyed the most. I had to carry her at few places where water was more than her height, but she had",
          "I was worried about this trip but actually had a great time and got to the top. I did however slip on the rocks and hurt my foot, which is still hurting now I am home, but hey I suppose health and safety isn't a strong point although the guide tries hard to steer you it is",
          "Wow! Climbing the Falls is definitely the highlight of our trip to Jamaica! It is well organized and the staff know exactly where to direct your step and complete the climb. Though it is a bit of a challenge in places, and the force of the water can be pretty strong, being",
          "I initially thought why would I want to walk down a hill to climb some rocks that I had to purchase water shoes for but I can tell you that this was one of most enjoyable things I have ever done and everyone needs to experience this at least once in your life.",
          "Staff friendly and polite, really need to be at a reasonable fitness, if you have any previous leg or hip injuries or heart conditions forget it.",
          "Highly recommend this activity it might look daunting but is very doable by any age with basic mobility. We had a fun family outing here!",
          "We took a tour at Dunn's River Falls through our resort. It was included in our package and we all had a great time. Stewart was our guide and he was awesome! He brought us through the rigorous more difficult climb which was great because the majority of our crowd was younger",
          "The climb of Dunn\u2019s waterfall was amazing from the sea. Definitely something to check off your bucket list!",
          "We took the falls guided tour with snorkeling booze cruise which was a blast! Beautiful, but best to go with a guide because it's slippery.",
          "Went on a TUI cameraman trip which included visiting the falls. My partner and I decided to walk up the steps rather than climb the falls. I was rather concerned to note that some people did not realise how difficult the climb would be. Had it not been for the excellent guides I",
          "Had a great time hiking with Michael. He was an awesome guide. Fabian took great pictures and videos. The made the experience one to remember",
          "If you visit Jamaica you must do this trip, it is excellent and much fun. The guides are great and make this trip memorable.",
          "I would highly recommend not bringing little children to climb up the entire falls. Definitely bring water shoes and go with a guide from the park. Extremely beautiful and refreshing. Definitely worth the experience of the climb.",
          "This adventure is not for anyone that is not very sure footed. The \"pathway\" up the river can be tricky and slippery. On a hot day the water from the falls is a welcome relief from the heat. This is a very popular thing to do here for tourist, especially for cruise boat tours",
          "We drove from Montego Bay, entrance fee $25 us dlls per person, $5 big locker. We were scared but once you are there it is easy to clim. There is some pre-make steps on the water that you can follow and get to the top easy but careful. There is guides that you can follow as",
          "Good tour, DONT go through their little market when exiting. Rude pushy people that want to sell you junk",
          "I'm always a bit disheartened when I pull up to a waterfall and it is all built up and has clearly been turned in to a touristy money making machine. But Dunn's River falls is still a blast to climb! You can be obedient and get sucked in to a group that goes with a guide or",
          "Great experience. The falls are not slippery with slime. They are rough like sandpaper. I was told they routinely scrub the slime off. There is a expert way to climb the falls. And we always found a beginner route. If you are with a group this is a great team building",
          "You need to be in somewhat of decent shape to do the full climb but this experience was beautiful and I would do it again. We had a great tour guide. If you go make sure to wear tight fitting beach shoes with good grip. The water is freezing cold and I usually hate cold water",
          "Dunn\u2019s river falls and hike is gorgeous. The water cascading off the rocks is beautiful to see. Was very refreshing as well. It was a great time and I would definitely recommend it. I wish however there was an option to choose easy climb or challenging climb. We took a very",
          "We absolutely loved this excursion. The previous reviews I read did not really mention that we were climbing 600 ft up the waterfalls! Well--- my parents are 72 and 80 and I was a little nervous. Nonetheless, they did it! Everyone was so nice about it and helped one another!",
          "Staff at the falls was very friendly. And the guide who took us to the walk on the falls was very professional and knew what he was doing. My daughter and everyone had a good time. Must visit place!",
          "Be sure you wear beach shoes and a bathing suit. You are going to get wet, but getting wet was never more fun. Some of the rocks can be slippery, but the experience far outweighs any danger - it's simply a fun trek up the Falls!",
          "OK, the reason for the comment. People from our group borrowed a pair of nice water shoes. They left early and gave Big Junior (the guy who walked us in and would walk us out to the proper bus) the water shoes and Big Junior would certainly hold on to the shoes and pass them on",
          "A fun adventure and if you don't want to walk up falls there are stairs overlooking the area. Unfortunately we arrived by boat did not bring money and they do hound you for tips. They will follow you back to the boat to get a tip. It is a fun activity. They take a lot of",
          "There's a reason why Dunn's River Falls is a must-see on this island, it's definitely a miracle of nature. I go to Jamaica at least one time a year and always visit the Falls remember if you have a Jamaican ID bring it It'll save you a lot of money to enter.",
          "Had a fabulous day, went there by Catamaran, walked to the top of the falls with a great guide, topped off with some dancing and rum punch on the way back :-)",
          "I have always wanted to see Dunn River Falls because I am a big Bob Marley fan. It turns out I could not climb the falls because I broke my back this summer and I am still recovering. My husband and best friend climbed the falls and had a really good time. Even though I could",
          "I can't believe I did it! I was overwhelmed but the guide and my group were so supportive. This was so much fun and finishing was the icing on the cake. If you're thinking about doing it stop and just do it.",
          "Guides were very helpful in navigating the tough areas. Would recommend starting early before the cruise ships unload. The beach area was clean.",
          "Good clean fun. Hold hands and hike to the top of a wonderful, many-layered waterfall. Great fun. Again, the only negative thing is that these sites invite far too many tourists, making the visit far less appealing because of crowds, etc.",
          "Dunn\u2019s River Falls is a fun day out. Actually walking up the falls is not for the faint hearted. The guides make it fun and keep you on track. It can get extremely busy when the cruise ships are in. You need tip money for your guide. Beautiful place \ud83d\ude0a",
          "As seniors with balance issues we decided to walk the 185 steps down and up that Parallel the falls. We enjoyed them just as well. You have to pace yourself. They have places on the way that you can stop, observe and take pictures. It is beautiful even on a drizzly rainy day.",
          "My husband and I visited Dunn's River falls our anniversary trip to Jamaica and we were blown away by the beauty, fun and excitement. A must do when in Jamaica! There were folks of all ages in our group and the guides were great in making sure that we all had fun and were safe.",
          "Get a cab from the cruise terminal to the park. The staff at the port told us that it is USD12 each for a return trip. After she left us with the van driver, the driver said it is USD12 one way. He eventually agreed that it is USD12 each for a round trip after I asked him to",
          "I was all in for this adventure and was not disappointed. You can sign up and go with a guide or, for the more adventurous and able, do it yourself. You climb a rock and boulder based water fall gaining from 600 to 800 feet in elevation. Lockers for your stuff are available",
          "Dunn's River Falls is definitely a must when traveling to Jamaica!!! I was kind of nervous and scared at first, but a special thanks to our Tour guide Dennis for helping me and my friends make it through! You were awesome!!!! :)",
          "Prepare yourself to spend a full day here. It is definitely worthy and you can enjoy the fall rise as many times as you want. When cruises arrive in Ochi, the attraction is packed, however it gets super quite after 2:30-3pm and you may find yourself enjoining the falls lonely.",
          "The falls climb was the most amazing trip and our tour guides from Yardi Tours Denise, Orville and BIG DADDY took the best care of us and made the climb awesome. Purchase the video its the best memory.",
          "We were told that Dunn's River Falls was a must see while in Montego Bay and they were SO right! This place is fabulous, very fun and not to be missed! It was low season so the crowds were minimal. Two small negatives: the guides pretty much expect tips (I had no problem with",
          "What an amazing time at this acctration in Jamaica, well worth a visit, Try to do this when there is no ship in port as this can get very busy, We had P.Henry as our guide and her was brilliant, Told is the height of the falls what films we could see it in and so much more, A",
          "Had a great time at the falls, Beautiful beach at the bottom of the falls, we had a great guide helping us with the climb, water was cool and refreshing on such a hot day. One not to miss, Thoroughly enjoyed the falls. Just watch out when you are coming out to go back to your",
          "The walk up the falls is cool. Everyone who visits Jamaica should do it once and start at the ocean. The problem is the time we went was very very crowded. If you could go at sometime when it was empty it would be assume.",
          "This completes the trip. The best set up climbing and coming down . Holding hands with strangers and making new friends while having fun at the same time. Enjoy it.",
          "Very impressive waterfall paved by Limestone. A lot of fun to have the wet track and walking through the waterfalls. An activity you must see and do when visiting Jamaica.",
          "This place is amazing from start to finish!! Climbing up a waterfall/waterfalls always been a dream of mine and the party of 4 who went were all blown away by this!! Yes is very commercialised and can get very busy, my advice go as early as you can!! We arrived by coach and as",
          "We climbed the falls and also zip lined over the falls. Both were amazing other than the overbearing guides who were actually rude about their tip.",
          "This was a lot of fun but it was very busy. Like I\u2019m talking many many people at once being guided up this waterfall. Might have just been a busy time when I went (February). The staff were great though, very funny and always made sure you were safe and everyone was having fun.",
          "Our excursion to Dunn's River Falls was an amazing lifetime adventure. We had an amazing guide helping us traverse the falls safely. It was a beautiful scenic day where we got to experience climbing to the top of a natural sloping waterfall.",
          "Been there many times over the years! One of the most beautiful places in Jamaica! You can swim in the ocean and then climb the falls and hang out in the natural pools! This is a must!!",
          "This was complimentary with our stay at couples Sans souci and we absolutely loved it! Must see in Jamaica!",
          "Too many people climbing at once, all moving in a chain (holding hands) and this makes the climb too slow. The best experience is to climb your own path through the falls even though this is ever so slightly more difficult.",
          "Guide was awesome, but works for tips. Not as hard to climb as you think Water shoes are a must. We did this as part of an excursion , great day!",
          "Three 59 year old and a 62 year old. Had the most amazing day out at the dunns falls. Didn't for a minute think we would make it to the top. It was such good fun. People who you had never met before helping you and you helping them. It has really helped me to believe you can",
          "The falls are beautiful, no doubt about it. However, if you are looking for a place to enjoy at your pace this is not it. This is full of people from cruise ships and elsewhere on this island. There are other spots on the island with beautiful waterfalls where you can make it",
          "It is a great adventure climbing the falls. The souvenir shops are very insistent. The guide from the falls was pretty rude when asking for a tip. Bring water shoes and just a towel.",
          "Beautiful and fun excursion. Bring your water shoes and some cash for the guides they do a good job. It could be a 5 star activity if it wasn\u2019t so busy and rushed. It was a slightly controlled chaos. It is worth the trip but especially if you can go from the resort. Not a",
          "We had been to Dunns River back in the 90s and had a good time, the end of the falls was still VERY pushy for sales, back then and now. BUT the guide \"DJ\" was fantastic. He made the trip worth it. We took some friends who had never been and they also enjoyed the day.",
          "Multiple cruise ships on the island and the falls were very crowded. It\u2019s still breathtaking and the experience is fun.",
          "And I'm not talking about the river. I'm talking about afterwards. The river itself is breathtaking. Beautiful, sun-dappled falls, a challenging climb, cool mountain waters and helpful guides make this an unforgettable experience. The trip to Dunn River is worth it just for the",
          "FUN - but the Dunn's River guides for the climb was way too money hungry.... If they didn't got 'wet' money after the climb the walked too the boat and waited for the tip money, from all the guest..... CRAZY !",

          "Dunns River Falls is an exhilarating and energetic climb up one of nature's marvels. This is a must see attraction if you visit Jamaica!!",

          "We booked the Dunn\u2019s River Falls trip through Tui and it was very well organised and had a brilliant day. Our guide made the group all involved and got to experience the natural slide which is a must do. We got all the way to the top and loved every minute of it. The guides will",
          "I really enjoyed Dunn's river falls. My friends didn't want to climb so I went in the group alone but you make friends fast because you're all in it together. Lots of climbing and you will be soaked but its worth it. Make sure you wear water shoes!!",
          "This was my second time at Dunn\u2019s River Falls and it was as wonderful as I remember. The water is cool so you\u2019ll get that initial shock. It does require a bit of physical activity but it\u2019s such a rewarding climb. There are several groups climbing so there are pauses at various",

          "Me and my wife took an excursion here, before the nine mile tour. It\u2019s very well managed and pure fun. Don\u2019t forget to take some water shoes and we invested in a waterproof wallet for our phones. Very good",
          "So much fun! This is definitely not something I would normally do, but it was awesome! The guides are super helpful and fun. Be prepared to tip both guides and the photographers... I'm sure it isn't request, but it is expected and deserved! They work hard. The vendors in the",
          "We booked this excursion which was combined with Mystic Mountain (separate review).Each group gets its own guide and a videographer. As the group makes its way up the falls, the videographer is filming, while the guide makes sure no one gets hurt. They keep the trek up the",

          "Wonderful experience and a very challenging climb up the waterfalls. Not suitable for young children or elderly. There's some areas where you can dip into the water and have some fun. Time to complete 1 hour approximately.",
          "Climbing the falls was completely exhilarating. I can't swim, so I was nervous about slipping or going underwater at first, but our tour guide Tammy (literally) held my hand up the tricky parts and everyone there was relaxed and having a \u2026",
          "Dunn\u2019s River Falls and Jamaican Bob Sled is a \u201cmust see\u201d while in Ocho Rios Jamaica.  You take a nice chair lift (ski lift) up the side of a mountain to the Jamaican Bob Sled ride.  The ride is self controlled through the jungle. It is \u2026",
          "The scenery is always amazing to look at. The water is cold and feels good against the skin. The staff there is okay, not sure about the tour guides though  but to the look of it they seem to be professional",
          "Worth the wild. Very thrilling. Recommend to take water shoes and bathing suit. There are lockers you can you rent to leave personal belongings. Good tip: to capture unforgettable experience bring your own waterproof pouch for your mobile device. You can also purchase one on site for ten dollars.",
          "Amazing place! I love the botanical park. It is to the left before entering. There is a craft market prior to entrance also where you can pick up towels, a waterproof case for your phone, or other amazing items. The river falls was amazing \u2026",
          "The number 1 Water Falls in Jamaica. It's not just a falls, it has a water park and shopping area. Not to mention delicious food shops.... After climbing the Falls the beautiful Ocean is there for your enjoyment.",
          "Dunn's River is a classic vacation spot in Jamaice. It can be extremely fun if you go there with the right company. The best part about it is definitely the falls so if you go there with no intention of climbing the falls that is 50% of the \u2026",
          "We did this with a 6 & 8 year old. Lots of fun! Water shoes is a must. They do sell them there for 10$! They video record you when ypu go up and you can buy the DVD after if you want for 40$. The guides are good. You hold hands which seems like the hardest part!",
          "The world famous Dunn\u2019s River is a must do when you come to Jamaica! The waterfalls can be climbed by most healthy persons and its ideal for outings, especially during the hot summer months. I think the rates are a bit to high, especially for non-Jamaicans, so hopefully, the Athourities will look into that aspect of things.",
          "A lot of upgrades were made to the park over the years. It\u2019s very affordable. It is always better to use a local ID or else u will be paying a higher price to get in. Still sea urchins in the beach area, for spiked once. Love climbing the \u2026",
          "Fun, swimmed in the ocean.\nWe climbed up the falls through big river rocks. Super fun experience, definitely will come back.",
          "Really great experience, but you want to go first thing in the morning.  Bring water shoes.  If you don't want to walk in the water you can walk on the side.  Just be prepared to strip down to your bathing suit before you get off the bus!",
          "This place is BEAUTIFUL! Anyone who is in Ocho Rios, and has the opportunity, should definitely attempt the climb. And ask for Floyd! He's an awesome guide and will take amazing pics for you!",
          "I really enjoyed this place.",
          "The beach was awesome, crystal clear water, beach is clean. The falls...magnificent!!!",
          "I have been visiting this place from a child. I go with my children now. Still love it!",
          "Very pretty, well kept park, with river and falls. Locals cooling off in the water. Very scenic. You can see quite a ways in several different directions. The park and guide handled our cruise ship group well, keeping us informed and \u2026",
          "What can say? It's a must visit while in JA. I drove 2.5 hrs my last day in JA and it was worth it. I climbed the falls. Walked around the tranquility garden. On your way out you may be attacked by local vendors trying to make a sale. \u2026",
          "On a tour from a cruise .\n10 minutes from the port .\nThe Jamaican tour and her ' all is good   Yea man\".\nAt the falls you have a wait for your tickets ...\nThen for your guide .\nOur guide was PAUL...... EXCELLENT and very helpful. Attentive with the group .\nThe crawling up the falls are great experience.",
          "Great morning or afternoon out. If you want sunshine go in the morning as Ocho Rios tends to cloud over after lunch.\n\nIt's a wonderful experience climbing from sea level to the top and my 6 year old Grandson managed it with the help of a \u2026",
          "This tour guide named Hawthorne is the absolute best. As a Jamaican i heard horror stories of tour guides not wanting to escort their fellow Jamaicans but the man was very knowledgeable,  caring and attentive.  I climed to the top of the \u2026",
          "Beautiful place, many activities and facilities available. There is a small beach area, a tranquility garden, a water park, zip lining, shops and restaurants and also the Dunn's River Falls. I have only rated 4 stars because the water park \u2026",
          "Very peaceful. You can sit on the beach and relax. The atmosphere was that of tranquility on a nice breeze filled afternoon. We went on a Wednesday, not sure of the peacefulness and tranquility maybe different on the weekend.",
          "I loved this place it was a fun bonding experience I had with my family. It was extremely fun to climb a water fall and our guide was very attentive. It was an amazing experience and I would definitely recommend it to others!",
          "It was amazing to climb the falls. I didn't think I was capable but the guides were super supportive and helpful. I enjoyed every minute of the climb even when I was scared out of my mind. I would definitely do it again. This is a great team activity",
          "Dunn River is a great place and refreshing with the cold clear water. You can enjoy the beach at the same. However, usd25 per entrance is too much. If u have local id or working id, you can get jmd1000 for entrance.",
          "Loved it.  Came in on a cruise ship but didn't take the tour.  Walked out to the street and caught a ride over.  3 of us $20 total for the ride.  Cost of admission to the park was $25 and we rented a locker for $5.  We walked past all the \u2026",
          "This was amazing. The water was cold, but you don't pay this any mind, as to how fun it was. Jamaica in general was perfect, and this made it ten times better. You get to take pictures in the water, and climb up the falls as one big human chain. I highly recommend this location, and I can't wait to go back.",
          "It was a Breath taking and mind blowing experience",
          "Especially during COVID it feels like you rent the entire place. So relaxing",
          "Affordable for locals, and food can be brought in which is a plus! Not many activities but the waterfalls is enough for me. Please ensure to walk with a valid Jamaican ID to get in at Jamaican rates they are annoyingly strict with that.",
          "Great place to spend a few hours! You start at the bottom of the fall and work your way up to the top. In-between hiking up the fall you can splish and splash in the water. I would recommend this for kids over 10. My sister brought her \u2026",
          "The experience was amazing despite the COVID rules which is well implemented and I love the new protocol Dunns River is on top of the new normal. Guys just take ur mask.. \nThey have so many hand washing station which makes you feel much safer. Trust me I'll be back with my family.",
          "Place clean friendly staff it's fun to climb the falls with caution n use green or crown rocks dark ones are slippery",
          "Something my mom and i shared and we met great people on the way. I loved it.",
          "Great fun day this was   the falls are not really that hard to climb  but can be a little slippery under foot in parts  best to wear swim shoes",
          "Very nice place and friendly staffs",
          "Absolutely a family place. Massage from the Waterfall is a treat for the body",
          "The falls are really great. Nice paths up the falls them selves and the rock has high friction, so you are safe barefoot. You don't need a guide unless you want some backstories and simple guidance up the falls. \n\nBut, the lines for tickets \u2026",
          "Fun and refreshing!!!\n$25 plus locker fee.  You can climb as much as you like.  Not difficult, even went barefoot.  Just go slow and steady and you will love it.\nAlso the beach is decent enough to swim and hangout.",
          "Beautiful natural attraction. Climbing the falls was amazing but definitely not for those who have mobility issue. My agile 70 year old parents were able to do the whole climb though. Only issue was with the aggressive salespeople in their craft market.",
          "This was a beautiful hike up the falls. I wish there were a few more opportunities for sliding and \u201cfree climbing\u201d but that\u2019s my only complaint. Shout out to Cavett 23 - the whole staff was great!",
          "Great place to relax and have fun with family n frens",
          "The falls itself is nice.  However it is a tourist TRAP!  Wish we had went outside of the group booking and be sure to bring a waterproof camera if you wish to take photos.  You will get wet walking the falls!  They force you to use their \u2026",
          "Natural wilderness site with amazing fresh river water! It is a tourist site with the usual gift shops however the site and safety is there for your enjoyment. The Falls had too much power for our 4 and 6 year old. As parents we never felt \u2026",
          "Had a wonderful time! Good showers and changing rooms. The kiddies area is also great. Lots of shops for souvenirs and crafts. There were persons who walked the beach and took orders for meals. The wedding spot is beautiful. Please remember to walk with your  Jamaican identification",
          "Lots of fun! At first I wasn't sure how hard it would be but it was fine. We didn't go with the guided tour but still enjoyed it and found the walk up easy enough to figure out.",
          "Was surprised by the amount of people there. However, very well organized with congenial staff that helped out to the max to keep everything moving quickly but without giving anyone a rushed feeling. \nNot for the physically disabled or those with young children.\nHad a blast and exceeded my expectations. Would highly recommend.",
          "Nice hike and fun. Be prepared to use muscles you haven'ts worked in years. Although you are with a group (if you pay for a guide) strangers will not help you hike lol. The video that they try to sell you in the end is cute so work it to \u2026",
          "We always visit Dunns river when we are in Jamaica. Its family fun. It can be a challenge for someone who has mobility issues as it's a long was down to the base of the falls and to access the ocean . They have a kids water play area at the \u2026",
          "I have been there a few times and yes I have climbed the fall and never fell. The tour guides are great. Adventure seekers will love this\u2764",
          "Great place. My wife, I and a few friends climbed the falls and loved it. It's not as hard as it looks. You will definitely need the grip shoes",
          "Good time. Amazing experience and the guides made it so much fun!",
          "Best attraction in Jamaica, personally I suggest booking this through Chukka party boat, which includes snorkeling, The party boat, and a stop at Jimmy buffett's Margaritaville in ocho Rios. \n\nBRING WATER SHOES. Climbing the falls is really \u2026",
          "A fun Excursion to do when you're on the island of Jamaica. Definitely not for someone who is not physically fit enough to climb a mountain. Was a bit frightened at certain times but I was able to make it up it was exhilarating and it \u2026",
          "The experience was phenomenal.   Ziplining - O'Shane and Jamie were awesome guides that made a somewhat scary experience a lot of fun.  I can hardly wait to return.  Jamaica is BEAUTIFUL.  The water - both fresh water and the ocean have healing properties.  Already planning a return visit.",
          "This was a fun adventure even though we walked it. I wasn't sure if my knees could handle the climb but it appeared to be doable as you are in a large group. Definitely something you must try.",
          "Beautiful falls. I never considered my self as not pretty able bodied. But steep paths concrete steps should be explained better. Also the crowds were horrible seemed very disorganized. And 50 or more people in human chains holding hands \u2026",
          "It was amazing and there are alot of fun features at Dunn's River Falls",
          "I have to go back to finish the climb ! Loved it",
          "An awesome experience, and our tour guide KC was excellent. Very fun and helpful. Only negative was the end having to walk through the \"gift shop\" area. Be prepared for very aggressive salespeople.",
          "Dunn's River Falls and Park located in Ocho Rios, St Ann is the perfect place for a family getaway. The journey there is very scenic. \nOn my trip there in April of 2017, my family and I had a splendid time climbing the falls. We almost \u2026",
          "Nice place to chill out",
          "They could really use an ATM. Also, be careful if you have back issues. I didn't climb the falls but walked along and saw quite a few people find hidden holes and take pretty good falls.",
          "Great as always... covid protocols  being observed.",
          "This place is good for your soul!! We were lucky enough to go when there was no cruise ship full of tourists that day so it was  especially lovely. It looks a bit intimidating to do the full climb,but do it anyway! It takes away all the stress of life and is an experience like nothing else. Absolutely stunning and beautiful.",
          "Nice place to chill. Very beautiful scenery, and the tranquility is worth the cover charge. Wish beach itself was bigger, however it was very clean. The climbing of the falls is really the main attraction, but once you're a water and/or nature lover, you won't be disappointed with here.",
          "Awesome tour guide. Lots of fun",
          "Best waterfall experience ever! My family came here to enjoy the beach and the waterfall before we drove inland. It was beautiful and so much fun! The beach was beautiful, clean with no trash, no seaweed! The waterfall was so much fun to \u2026",
          "Awesome experience. Was really fun to climb the falls. Don't skimp out and attempt it without a guide on your first go-through. Helpful to know where the safest path up the falls is.",
          "A must do on your trip to Jamaica. Bring your water shoes and prepare for a thrill and exciting day of rock climbing. Got the beach for the  kids.  Was so amazing, I choose this place to propose to my now fiance. She said yes!!! Thanks Dunn's River Fall",
          "Overcrowded by tourists, but still place to see. You dont need to go thtough the water, you can see the same from pathway next to it.",
          "Really nice place. It has great potential.  However,  the walk down to beach is killer. They need some carts or something",
          "As good as usual. Only slight drawback is that you have to wait for a group of 20 for a guide to lead a group. Did it on our own. Was great fun. Remember to visit the tranquility gardens.",
          "Overall climbing of the falls and the experience was great. The securities were polite and helpful when asking directions where to go. 10 dollars US for local and 30 dollars US for persons who are not from Jamaica.",
          "Absolutely thrilling experience. The overall scenery, the experience and customer service cannot be beaten. The guides were very helpful and they made sure nobody gets hurt or slips down the fall. Just make sure to buy 2 things before you \u2026",
          "So much fun. And the guides making it so easy to climb. They tell you where to go for every step. Amazing place",
          "This was one of the excursions at our Resort. We really enjoyed the waterfalls in our guide was awesome. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the area. Just be careful they'll run you through a shopping area at the end of the \u2026",
          "This was fun and definitely plan on getting soaked.  Definitely worth doing.  It is quite the workout.\n\nThe locals are very pushy for tips which sort of puts a downer on the experience.",
          "We went to Dunn's River Falls as part of a cruise excursion and had a great time. This is definitely not for the mobility challenged but it was fun and beautiful! We had good guides and they were good at keeping us safe. The bottom half is \u2026",
          "Irresistible! Thrill and adrenaline rush to climb the falls. One of many visits, but this with extended family. A great place to visit while in Jamaica.",
          "Love it but best to go during the week",
          "pretty cool to climb up a water fall. mus be fairly agile. I would not recommend to bring small children.  everyone holds hands at certain parts.  they allow you to stop and they will take pictures for you.",
          "What an amazing time we had, ziplining and the waterfall hike. Loved all the people helping and encouraging each other.  Will definitely be back someday. Love   Jamaica  man.",
          "A must see and do if you are visiting Jamaica.  You will enjoy it. Tip: if you plan to climb the falls it's a MUST to have water shoes. At first I did not have them because they were out of season where I live but was fortunate to find them \u2026",
          "Wonderful experience whenever I am there",
          "Zip lining was cool . Zipline guides were great.  \n\nFor the falls. \n\nDon't go with tour group. Take a taxi. Its 5 min from the dock.\n\nPlan to get wet.\n\nBring waterproof case for phone.\n\nGo early morning. There are 10k people on that river by noon. \n\nDon't buy the video. Terrible quality. \n\nBring 50.00 in cash.",
          "Total body workout if you do it right. Wonderful place.",
          "A must do with the family, my 11 and 7 yearold boys had a blast literally walking UP the waterfalls. Great fun, experience and memories. Highly recommend the catamaran ride in.",
          "Finally had the courage to climb the falls",
          "Incredible excursion. If your hotel offers it, I highly recommend it. Can be managed for any level of activity/fitness.",
          "Beautiful, went at a time where it wasn't busy/full of tourists. The beach at the bottom of the falls is amazing. A must",
          "Amazing experience! Bring water shoes or you can\u2019t climb and a waterproof bag as they provide picture/photo ops and will even help take pics for you. DO NOT stop to talk to anyone at the market on the walk out. They willharras you and try \u2026",
          "This was just awesome and so much fun! Everyone should experience at least once.",
          "Nice and clear water. Most of the guides are friendly and funny lads. Definitely a great experience to visit this place!",
          "Very nice series of waterfalls, although very busy in the afternoon!\nBest come early to make the most of it, and be sure to check the schedule of cruise ships arriving, as those days are busier.\n\nIf you want to take any pictures, bring a waterproof case for you phone/camera.",
          "Dunn's River was quite an experience. I can see why its such a tourist attraction for my country! I climbed the river from the beach to the definite top and it was an amazing experience, the rocks and the water, the nature.It was just over all an indulged ambiance that I'd definitely love to visit again.",
          "The park grounds are very clean and has lots of scenic views of the falls. Many places to sit and talk or rest while on the grounds. The amenities are modern and clean. The falls are just the sight, the tour guides very helpful and a must see attraction. The beach is lacking though and leaves a bit to want.",
          "Dunn's River Falls is a nice outdoor climb. We went and did it without a guide. If you are in reasonable shape and climb carefully, you don't need a guide. I recommend checking it out if you are in Jamaica. Do not feel pressured to buy things at the gift shop. A simple no thank you usually works.",
          "The line in front was an hour long in the hot sun!!! Only bad part but played a huge role in the review! The park itself is amazing!!! The water in the falls is freezing cold and it comes rushing down fast!!! Best done in water shoes for \u2026",
          "Amazing hike up the middle of the falls.",
          "Absolutely breathtaking, fantastic wonder of nature!!! A must see, also Roger the guide and Curtis the videographer was outstanding, made the experience even better. When you go there ask for them and say the couple with baby sent you\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udcaf\u270a\ud83c\udffe",
          "What a unique and incredible experience. I won\u2019t spoil much, but if you\u2019re visiting Jamaica, this is an absolute must. Shout out to Brian, Clarke, and Ricardo who made our tour of Dunn\u2019s River Falls both exciting and memorable!",
          "The best tourist attraction in the Ocho Rios area. All of the vendors are in one market area and no one bothers you to buy anything throughout the rest of the park. You are free to climb the Falls as many times as you like or enjoy the beach and the gardens.",
          "New experience. Extremely beautiful place and friendly people. I jumped off a rock into water for the first time ever and got water in my ear. One of the tour guides helped relieve my symptoms in his attempt to remove the water.",
          "This is a great family thing to do. I am afraid of water and heights and I was able to do this. The guides are excellent and they sure have fun. I felt I was in good hands. We went with a group which include the passes but I did notice that \u2026",
          "Best time of my life.",
          "Awsome lifetime experience!! At the first, it may look challenging but as you climb through precautions, it will be totally worth it. Lots of great spots from whirlpool to small waterfall area for scenic experience. We made the whole climb in 1 hour with plenty of picture spot. Loved it!!!",
          "Amazing time! Started from the bottom of the falls and hiked up all the way to the end. It\u2019s somewhat hard navigating through the rocks but worth it at the end. A must see and do!",
          "A breathtaking excursion. A perfect blend of adventure, peace and exhilaration! I overcame an extreme fear of water during this experience. I will never forget my time here in Jamaica. I have to bring my children back.",
          "It's very nice but it's definitely a walkon the rocks with the cold water coming down on the rock. Also the guides are very nice and very helpful. If you can walk up the rocks you have to get water shoes to walk on the rocks and you will be \u2026",
          "This was a great experience I would definitely do it again. Our tour guides were very helpful as well.",
          "This is a fun and physical activity. After walking down the stairs to the bottom of the falls, you go up the falls in the water. The water is rushing past your feet and very cold. The guide was fantastic. He guided us past the areas where \u2026",
          "We had a lot of fun walking up the falls. We went on a guided tour so we had to stick with our approximately 20 person group, but it was still a great experience. If I were to go again though I would want to enjoy ascending at my own pace \u2026",
          "Great fun and a must do but I wish they gave you more time or allow you to explore on your own.",
          "Great adventure. Paul, the tour guide is knowledgeable so follow his instructions. \nAsk questions about the DVD they offer on the tour because they give one the impression that the tour been recorded as a movie but instead they are poor \u2026",
          "A bit over priced.\nBut lovely experience. Brace yourself for all of the vendors trying to convince you to buy from them.\n\nThere was a lovely beach at the bottom if you don't wish to climb the falls.",
          "Ok but not spectacular. Gids are friendly, beautiful place",
          "It was a fun climb upstream, you definitely need water-shoes and no flip flops, or you will slip and fall. If you are fit then you don\u2019t need a guide just enjoy the climb and be cautious with your steps. I also recommend a stroll in the garden close by the staff will offer you fresh coconuts for a tip.",
          "Really enjoyed climbing the falls. It was a very fun and unique experience and would recommend. Make sure you have water shoes or strappy sandals to climb in and your swimsuits are on nice and tight. Also I recommend a good water proof case \u2026",
          "Great tour. Be ready to climb and get wet! PS, you can take the climb by yourself, but it is more fun with the guides.",
          "Tranquil picturesque breath taking one of the places to visit in ocho Rios Jamaica I would say go when it's not  holidays but if u don't mind lots of ppl I say it's good all year through definitely visit",
          "The falls is as beautiful as ever. The beach is much closer to the shore than I remembered it to be the last time I visited a year ago. The only downfall for me is that the kiddies section was deconstructed. My daughter was really \u2026",
          "Fun place beautiful view the whole way we had a big crowd sadly cuz of the cruise ship docked as well. But our tour guide was awesome and he was great at helping us with e really getting our footing and taking pictures and also helping every1 in general. I would go again very nice staff and people who work there",
          "Lovely view for a nature-loving person. Polite tour guides, who are also cheerful. Would definitely visit again.",
          "Dunn's River Falls was fun. My kids really liked it. I found the photographers very annoying and pushy. They rush you and then constantly want you to stop for pictures or video as they sell them for $8/each. At the end the photographer \u2026",
          "Very nice relaxing waterfall beach and very excitin\u2026\u2026",
          "This is a MUST DO!! LOVE IT SO AMAZING",
          "Definitely one my highlights of the trip. It's not a excursion for those afraid of heights or unable to climb. It's a real workout and quite exhilarating if you're up for a challenge.",
          "2nd time there, it is amazing! Love to do it again.",
          "I'm sure the guides would have been great, but know that it is possible to do it with out a guide/group if you are fit and comfortable with difficult terrain. We actually climbed it twice before the guided group who entered before us completed it.",
          "The falls are beautiful.  You can walk down and back up the stairs if you do not want to climb the falls.  There are two or three areas you can walk in to enjoy the water, or exit if the climb is too much.  It is shaded the entire way. \u2026",
          "It's a beautiful place and fun to climb. My son who is 8 was not a fan. Part of the climb was hard for him. The excursion was very rushed. We were yelled at and splashed in order to keep us moving at their pace.",
          "This park is amazing! We came during a cruise and didn't have enough time to spend like we wanted. I definitely recommend everyone go to see this gorgeous falls and Beach. The people here are so friendly and there are some shop set up with some of the most beautiful works of art!",
          "Keep in mind for these toures you walk through the rushing water of the falls. You can walk beside it but you have to decide that ahead of time. Dress appropriately. It's slippery but fun and challenging.",
          "One of my favourite falls love it",
          "Had a great time. We went on the chukka tour, they took us snorkeling then to the park. The river is very nice and cool and was refreshing on a hot day. There's zip lining and a board walk if you dont want to climb up the falls. Amazingly \u2026",
          "Excellent adventure. Alot easier to do than it looks. Natural steps have been carved and it not slippery. You must go to Dunn's River Falls !!",
          "Idk what all the hype is about... super touristy if you're into that you'll probably love it, if not... you can watch the whole thing from the sidelines and not partake...",
          "Lovely park, the falls is amazing. The children\u2019s splash area was a pleasant surprise. Queuing was a bit of a nightmare unless you pre-book your tickets. There is also a botanical part which unfortunately I didn\u2019t get to stroll around but I\u2019m sure would have been another treat.",
          "Stunning, unfortunately i was unable to  climb them due to walking with a stick. Really enjoyed them. Wish i could have stayed longer.",
          "Pretty neat place. Enjoyed the view and climb. Water felt great. Our guide was a really nice man and took extra care to make sure we all got up to the top safely.",
          "Beautiful and relaxing great service too",
          "The guides and the climb were wonderful. Be prepared to be wet from head to toe.  Beware of the aggressive vendors on the way out.",
          "Best place ever, so much to do! Dunn's River was an amazing group activity!!!",
          "Fun to bring ur kids",
          "The tour guides were excellent and made the excursion an awesome experience.   No complaints.",
          "Scenery is beautiful. You also get the option of the beach or the falls is you dont really like the salt water. The kiddies area is super fun, even for us adults, but it was closed when I was there recently. Hopefully they re-open it soon because it really was a plus",
          "Awesome experience. Super awesome tour guy taking us up river. Water was super cold but comfortable once wet. Will do again",
          "One  of the Most enjoyably part of our trip",
          "Well worth it! Make sure you give it a try and don't forget your water shoes.",
          "Spectacular, breathtaking and magical BUT only if you're able bodied. My husband now has significant back pain and walks with a stick so we knew we couldn't climb the falls as we'd done on previous visits. However, we hoped to get down to \u2026",
          "Great for the entire family, if you ever need to get away from the every day stress at work. Its the place to come unwine.",
          "I have been there twice and both times I enjoyed myself to limit. There was so much to do and to explore, but climbing the falls and looking down the river was the best moment of it all. It's also a prime area for tourists who visit Jamaica. A must visit \ud83d\udc4d",
          "It's a good spot for a day out either as a couple or with the entire family. It's definitely better with company. Locals get a discounted rate but be sure to take along some form of identification to verify.",
          "A great excursion.  You will need water shoes (no flip-flops or sandals.  You are hiking up a series of gorgeous waterfalls in the fast moving water and on slick rocks.  Not recommended for those with mobility issues, but otherwise a great adventure.",
          "Great place for all the family climbing the fountain a lovely chance to go & cool down,they're need wheel chair access down to the beach level has it only has steps.\nHot & cold snacks available, & lockers to lock away your belongings at the \u2026",
          "This is a fun experience.  (not for people who have difficulty climbing or who have balance issues). It is a good hike/climb to the top in the water requiring moderate agility.  It is beautiful, but it was very crowded when we were there.  Early in the day may be better.",
          "Awesome awesome, can't wait to go back. The water is chilly at the bottom but once you start  climbing you'll get use to it. Follow your guide, I strayed away a few times and fell into some holes. I can definitely see someone hurting their ankles. My only complaint is that I wish there was more to climb.",
          "Amazing!!! Its the number 1 tour in Jamaica. I just took my wife. It is definitely a good memory to climb a waterfall in jamaica",
          "Dunn's River falls is an historic sight but more so is it a place that you must see! The water falls are picturesque and therapeutic.\n\nThe falls run down to a beach area that can be very nice depending on the tide. There are good food shops \u2026",
          "Amazing I didn't  climb but husband daughter and granddaughter  did and thoroughly  enjoyed  it",
          "Lobban Legacy birthday celebration/family vacation 2019.  We had a blast!",
          "Awesome excursion! The staff was great and very helpful!",
          "Always a nice place to go for family or friends. Be prepared to get a locker (I don't remember the price but you get a fraction of the money back when you return the keys) so return the keys lol. Remember to bring your local ID for local \u2026",
          "Dunns river Falls was an awesome experience! Met some really awesome people we helped and encouraged a 75 year old brave and Awesome grandma up the 600 ft. Waterfall, and got some pictures we will never forget! Guides were so awesome too!! \u2026",
          "The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because I remember when the beach section was way more beautiful and now the sand is being washed away, other than that this place is gorgeous. The fall is still beautiful and quite and \u2026",
          "I loved this excursion it was a great challenge for me and my kids and we loved the climb and were so glad to make it to the top. It was exhilarating and amazing.",

          "Really enjoyed this excursion. The guide was very good and we made it to the top with no issues.",
          "Rip off! paid $40 for the video of someone else's trip. \nThey were very eager to take the money. No response when raised the claim.",
          "Loved it. Tour guide was amazing,  he made sure everyone was comfortable going up the falls and he also took some great pictures for our group.",
          "Group holds hands to climb up waterfall with hard sell for video recording.  On a crowded day this felt like cows being herded. Being in a human chain didn't feel that enjoyable. Hard sells for souvenirs when you try to exit through a maze of stalls and a dozen of your new \"best friends\".",
          "Absolutely beautiful. We had the option to climb the falls or walk along side it with a wooden and concrete walkway. We chose the latter due to seeing people falling and some of the injuries to various body parts. We train for long distance \u2026",
          "I've always visited Dunn's River, and every time I go there it is a wonderful experience. The thrill and fun of climbing the falls is amazing.",
          "So glad to have picked this excursion from Carnival. Fun to climb to the top of the falls. Also make sure you put your phones/cameras in a waterproof pouch you can wear. You\u2019ll definitely want to take pictures!",
          "Climbed the falls from the beach. Rocks are not slippery but I was happy with my water shoes from our beach house. Very fun, especially since we came on a day with no cruise ships in port (we checked the websites). We also took the zip line tour with Jamie and Jenson. Very safe, very fun.",
          "Great Jamaican natural wonder that needs to be visited. Be prepared that the water may feel really chilling cold at first.  But after 5 minutes or so, you will truly be embarking in the natural wonder of the spring water beating down or \u2026",
          "Muuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaah loved it, as always",
          "One day will wake up to those beautiful falls,",
          "When to celebrate my MOM 55th Birthday and my Husband 33rd which would be Sept 28th. We did enjoy it to the fullest\n It was my third time going and my first time climbinf the falls, my mom second time and my husband first time, my little bro first time. We did enjoy our self and it was worth it. I did pay the local price however.",
          "Amazing freshwater falls that tumbles down giant rocks. You slip on your water shoes and climb to the top or if you're not as daring, you can walk up the dry side and still see all of the falls. There are people there selling souvenirs and \u2026",
          "Great to see and experience climbing up the falls....Best tourist attraction..\nMUST SEE AND HAVE FUN.",
          "You get to hang out at the beach for a while before climbing then climb the falls however many times you want (skip the tour guide). Such a bargain. Beware going later in the day... we found that the power of the water got too strong later \u2026",
          "This is a great place to go. Fun climbing the falls, water is fresh cool and lovely. The beach also is cool to chill if you dont wish to climb the falls but the most fun part is the climb. Best to have family and friends to go with as it's \u2026",
          "my only regret was I came too late so could not climb a second time. Also my family were not there. But absolutely great experience.",
          "We did zip lining with Lenny #15.  I was scariest to death but him and his team took extra great care of me ensure my safety every step.  We also walked up the fall we have William #56 and Martin #40. These two guys are amazing.  Helping \u2026",
          "Visited here August last year with family. Never climbed the falls because water was too cold and i can't swim \ud83d\ude1c. Enjoyed myself in the beach tho. Would love to visit again!",
          "This is a a very fun waterfall hike. You will enjoy it. I highly recommend.  There are several exits along the way if you dont want to do the whole way. There are gift shops and cocktails for those that don't want to make the hike with you. \u2026",
          "The falls were gorgeous. We opted to go with out a guide because we were short on time and they were waiting for large groups to congregate before started the tour.  \nLeaving the Falls puts you through a maze of hawkers and tauts who were \u2026",
          "I'm older than most in our group, but I still did well. The rocks are not slippery so water shoes are all that's needed.",
          "This is a great family excursion. We had lots of fun, and the guides were helpful and entertaining.",
          "Such a fun experience! Our guide was amazing and made the experience fun while making sure we felt safe. We chose the challenging way to go which was definitely more fun but you have to be prepared to get completely soaked. Definitely \u2026",
          "Upon arriving at the falls, a guide was ready to take us down to the beach already. From there on the climbing up began and it turned out to be one of the most fun things I ever did. It's recommended to bring a waterproof phone case along \u2026",
          "Beautiful natural ponds and waterfals joining the sea. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery while climbing the waterfalls from the beach through the forest.",
          "Fun, beautiful, good vibes.",
          "Jamaica #1 tourist attractions. Simple breath taking.",
          "Great view while having lunch",
          "Amazing place to visit . Definitely was on our bucket list. Just be mindful of public holidays. Was packed with massive amount of people.",
          "Great place to visit. We walked up the waterfalls with a guide. You will be up to your waist in water going up the falls. Great experience and well worth doing. Only thing is on exit back to bus there are fake exit signs put up to lead \u2026",
          "The place is nice and safe",
          "We had a great time despite being treated very poorly by our guide as well as being harassed by the locals running the marketplace who couldn't care less if we were having a good time. All they seemed to care about was getting as much money \u2026",
          "Sight seeing park a beautiful beach and may activities including the well knoen falls",
          "It fun place for family's friends to have fun day in the sun. And then cool down ithe falls r the relaxing beach",
          "Was an AWESOME time. Our guide Tammy that we had was fabulous. Would highly recommend going again! Make sure you buy a waterproof phone case for $10 at one of the shops there-worth it for pictures!",
          "The woman at the gate was a terrible rep. She interrogated my daughter because she didnt believe her about her age. They need training and people skills. I would prefer going to another attraction and would never recommend the property..... \u2026",
          "Had a wonderful time very beautiful and clean.",
          "It's a lovely place I really enjoyed, especially being a Kenyan \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddea it was a beautiful adventure and fun",
          "Beautiful place, worth the visit \ud83d\ude09\nTip: you can walk from the cruise terminal, its a 45 min walk but very safe. To come back, there are many taxis waiting for customers (costed us 6$ for 2)",
          "It was PACKED but it was AWESOME.  You don\u2019t have to go with a guide even though it seems like you do.  You can skirt around the packs of people be guided through, much better than stopping and going! :)",
          "This place was awesome! The guides did a great job of getting us up thr waterfall safe and provided us with multiple opportunities to take some great photos! Make sure you bring water shoes, you can buy them cheaper than if you wait to buy theirs. And have a waterproof case with a strap. It will make your experience better!",
          "This is Jamaica's iconic tourist attractio  and it is worth every minute spent inside this park. We enjoyed most a climb to the top of the cascading waterfall - a challenge if not done with a proper guide. I wouldnt recommend doing it \u2026",
          "We enjoyed an uncrowded early visit on a week day. Engaging a guide, we climbed with a small group and had plenty of time for fun on the way up. We took a few pictures on our own, and also bought the photo CD. It was a bit overpriced, but \u2026",
          "Its a great place to take the entire family  there is a kids park with a slid and a lot of fun things for the kids. They also have craft shops and also a great parking lot .",
          "Its very beautiful but the photos don't make it justice. The guides are always there to help you make the climb. It's safe even for children. Very good contact with nature. The entire climb is filmed and photographed witch you can purchase \u2026",
          "Dunn's River is apart of Mystic Mountain. The WHOLE PARK IS TO FREAKING DIE FOR! We made friends out there that we still talk too till today \u2764\ufe0f",
          "This was amazing. I can't wait to go back.",
          "The river was awesome!  Unfortunately we paid $40 for the DVD and were promised that they would email the video to us as well.  Well, that never happened.",
          "There is something for everybody. Even the little babies. If you wanna be adventurous, chill, sun bathe.. it's all in one. 1 suggestion walk with your own food",
          "This trip was so much fun. I could have stayed in the water and played all day. We brought my MIL there and because of her wheelchair, she stayed on the viewing platform while we played in the water.",
          "Great time had by all. We went in November and the water was pretty cold. I'd imagine it would be even more refreshing during the summer months.",
          "It was nice but too commercialized. Everyone is trying to sell you something every step of the way and that takes away from the experience. It was quick and I felt rushed even though we were being paced. Our guide was great. Bring money for \u2026",
          "What a wonderful experience. Lots of parking, about a half hour drive from our hotel. Entrance fee was 25usd per person, from there you walk down stairs parrellel to the falls towards the beach where you can being your ascent of the waterfall which can take about half an hour.",
          "It was pretty, but very crowded. We did not climb the falls because we were with an older couple. The guide said the climb was against rapid water and 600 feet uphill.",
          "Dunn's River Falls in Ocho Rios Jamaica is the most beautiful waterfalls you'll ever see. If you like some fun and adventure in your life, try climbing to the top. It's a challenge but it's worth it. After conquering the falls, relax on the Dunns River Falls beach and soak up some of that warm Caribbean sun...",
          "Went to dunns river falls on a family holiday to Jamaica. Everyone had a brillant time climbing up the falls and then spending time together relaxing at the beach. A must do for anyone looking a challenge whilst visiting Jamaica.",
          "Dunne's River Falls has been my most visited beach and river after having gone there over 5 times. That alone tells you that I really do like it there. I've gone there during \"winter\" when the beach is extremely cold not to mention the \u2026",
          "Start on the beach where the falls of fresh water meet the ocean. Climb over 900'ft above sea level On a guided hike with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Keep your eyes out for banana trees along the route. The cool waters are refreshing and the scenery Inviting..",

          "Highly recommended. Get ready for a wet and fun climb.",

          "The falls themselves are incredible but the climb is not the easiest. Our guide was really good. I am proud to say I've done it but I wouldn't do it again because I found it too difficult.",
          "Fantastic day out. Great hike with  family and friends",
          "A Jamaican tourist spot. Firstly very careful you don't get taken for a very short but very expensive shuttle ride. $30 U.S pp for a less than 5 min shuttle from the port. Dunns falls was also $25pp to get it. The attraction was good. Have \u2026",

          "Amazing experience! I didn't want to go home when the day ended...",
          "This was such a different falls experience! Be prepared to get soaked climbing through the falls. There are various spots along the climb where you can get nice pictures.\nThere are lockers and changing rooms, but you need to bring $8 extra \u2026",
          "There\u2019s not that much to do \nThe abandoned work areas where they offered services should have a comeback like the hair braiding section\nIt\u2019s fun for like 30 minutes then you get tired\nI like that they added a zipline though.",
          "We just love this place",
          "Is an absolute nust do when in Jamaica.  Best day on our cruise.",

          "I had a blast here, it was a bit crowded for my taste, but that's what you get for going to a tourist destination. I had a lot of fun climbing the waterfall and the guides were helpful and nice as well. Some of the people in the shops were \u2026",
          "Been here twice.  And going back again.",
          "The falls are beautiful, but the experience of climbing them in a large group of people felt very touristy. Basically you form a human chain the whole time.",
          "Beautiful and simply the best",

          "Don't go with a tour. Get Joe cool taxi to take you and buy a $20 pass there. You'll save so much",
          "It's all about the falls... \nThe numerous steps down to the beach is not for the faint-hearted.  Once you are physically fit the falls are a must do, for those who aren't you are left with a deeply eroded beach with a few picnic tables. \u2026",
          "They really care about you and having a wonderful marvelous fantastic vacation and this lady right here went way out of her way to get me balloons a 3 and a 0 for my daughter's 30th birthday she got it on her own time I want to thank her she he really helped and made the birthday surprise we will be seeing you next year",

          "This was my first visit to Jamaica and to Dunns River.  And it was a big hustle at the beginning but I totally enjoyed the experience. I like the fact that they are 2 or 3 different exit points in case it's too intense. I'll definitely recommend you going to visit... and I'll go again.",

The tour guide made sure they made it up as safely as his own parents.  Holding them almost 90% of the time.  It was beautiful and worth every dollar and every minute!",

          "Climbing the falls was fun and amazing. Beach is ok. It's a bit pricey but I think worth it.",
          "Good experience, but didn't realize this was man-made. Thought this was a natural waterfall. Still a fun experience!",
          "There are 2 sides to the Falls- the big one that you have to pay for, and the smaller one not too far down the road. We ended up exploring both sides on different days. I do not recommend either for those who are out of shape or overweight. \u2026",
          "Loved climbing falls. The guides that take you up expect a tip from everyone when you done..they will hunt you down  for it. Didn't appreciate that at all. I paid to get in.",

          "Great experience! A little extra on the haggling when trying to leave, being that the way they lead you out is through a \"market\" that goes to the exit. Otherwise it's the renowned Dunn's River Falls! Lack of the 5th star is the exit.",
          "What an experience if u vacay here plz make it a must DO!The water was very clear and the falls were raging as u do the incline this is an adrenaline rush.U have the choice to have a guide escort u. Souvenir was also available for purchase.",
          "Beautiful place. We went on the catamaran excursion and this is one of the places it took us.",

          "Amazing place. Falls are fun and not to hard to climb. We went without guide. I recommend water shoes. They do push you lots to buy at the shops. But keep walking and say no thank you. No need to be rude to them. They are just trying to make a living. Pushy. But still very nice people",
          "Ignore people trying to sell you things and it's fantastic. Walk down to the beach and start there, the rest was very refreshing and worth the fee.",

          "Unless you've done this before go with a group. Although all information is given before you get there, buy beach/water/surf shoes. There is plenty of opportunity to do so when you're there anyway. \n\nIf you wish to take pictures, put in a \u2026",

          "A must go. We almost didn't do it because we prefer food over exercise. Don't let that stop you. Definitely a stop to make. Tie it in with a Bob Marley tour if your in Montego Bay as they are in a similar direction. We tied it in the a catamaran cruise, but the Falls made the trip worth it!!!",

          "Dunn's River Falls is the spot to visit in Ocho Rios. Lots of fun and adventure. The waterfall runs briskly and isn't nearly as gentle as it seems when you see a photo or video. Wearing aqua shoes is a must and bring a change of clothes if \u2026",

I've tried both ways each has its advantages and disadvantages. At the end of the climb you can go back to the bottom and sit/ play by the beach.",
          "It was so much fun",
          "Water shoes needed. Very nice place and the scenes of the fall is just awsome. The best part is climbing the falls to the top. The beach is beautiful and well kept and the water is refreshing and blue. \nStaff is good however some might need retraining on how to deal with locals.",
          "We went to Dunns and also to YS Falls in St. Elizabeth Parish.  Either way you'll want to arrive early to have more peace and quiet if there is such a thing.  Take the guided tour if you have any apprehension about climbing a waterfall. \u2026",

The only draw back was when leaving the park you get bombarded with small stands of people selling you souvenirs. They are polite and if you are respectful to them they will be the same. They had really nice souvenirs there though!",
          "Amazing.\ud83e\udd17. Only issue was buying tickets at the venue. Long lines however to fix this you can buy presold tickets. Climbing the falls was terrific. They sell water shoes. They have lockers for rent, changing rooms and ample space to park. And the views and scenery are spectacular",

          "So much fun",
          "At $23 an adult, this attractive series of falls is a tourist trap. I saw no one at the falls who was not part of a tour group, driven there on tour buses--a captive audience from the nearby cruise ships or hotels. I would recommend \u2026",

          "The hike was super fun and it was definitely a unique experience. I have never been anywhere like this before. You will definitely need to bring water shoes since the rocks are wet and can be slippery. Unfortunately the only way to get the photos that the videographer is taking during the hike is to purchase the 40 USD DVD.",

Even though we waited for a few, I appreciated that the tour was free and the guide was super helpful and experienced!

        "wiki": "Jamaica ( (listen)) is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea. Spanning 10,990 square kilometres (4,240 sq mi) in area, it is the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles and the Caribbean (after Cuba and Hispaniola). Jamaica lies about 145 kilometres (90 mi) south of Cuba, and 191 kilometres (119 mi) west of Hispaniola (the island containing the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic); the British Overseas Territory of the Cayman Islands lies some 215 kilometres (134 mi) to the north-west.\nOriginally inhabited by the indigenous Arawak and Ta\u00edno peoples, the island came under Spanish rule following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494. Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity, and the Spanish thus forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers. The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England (later Great Britain) conquered it, renaming it Jamaica. Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants. The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations. Beginning in the 1840s, the British began utilising Chinese and Indian indentured labour to work on plantations. The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962.With 2.9 million people, Jamaica is the third-most populous Anglophone country in the Americas (after the United States and Canada), and the fourth-most populous country in the Caribbean. Kingston is the country's capital and largest city. The majority of Jamaicans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, with significant European, East Asian (primarily Chinese), Indian, Lebanese, and mixed-race minorities. Due to a high rate of emigration for work since the 1960s, there is a large Jamaican diaspora, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The country has a global influence that belies its small size; it was the birthplace of the Rastafari religion, reggae music (and associated genres such as dub, ska and dancehall), and it is internationally prominent in sports, most notably cricket, sprinting and athletics.Jamaica is an upper-middle income country with an economy heavily dependent on tourism; it has an average of 4.3 million tourists a year. Politically it is a Commonwealth realm, with Elizabeth II as its queen. Her appointed representative in the country is the Governor-General of Jamaica, an office held by Patrick Allen since 2009. Andrew Holness has served as Prime Minister of Jamaica since March 2016. Jamaica is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with legislative power vested in the bicameral Parliament of Jamaica, consisting of an appointed Senate and a directly elected House of Representatives.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe indigenous people, the Yamaye (also known as the Ta\u00edno), called the island Xaymaca in an Arawakan language, meaning the \"Land of Wood and Water\" or the \"Land of Springs\".Colloquially, Jamaicans refer to their home island as the \"Rock\". Slang names such as \"Jamrock\", \"Jamdown\" (\"Jamdung\" in Jamaican Patois), or briefly \"Ja\", have derived from this.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nHumans have inhabited Jamaica from as early as 4000\u20131000 BC. Little is known of these early peoples. Another group, known as the \"Redware people\" after their pottery, arrived circa 600 AD, followed by the Arawak\u2013Ta\u00edno circa 800 AD, who most likely came from South America. They practised an agrarian and fishing economy, and at their height are thought to have numbered some 60,000 people, grouped into around 200 village headed by caciques (chiefs). The south coast of Jamaica was the most populated, especially around the area now known as Old Harbour.Though often thought to have become extinct following contact with Europeans, the Ta\u00edno in fact still inhabited Jamaica when the English took control of the island in 1655. Some fled into interior regions, merging with African Maroon communities. Today, only a tiny number of Jamaican natives, known as Yamaye, remain. The Jamaican National Heritage Trust is attempting to locate and document any remaining evidence of the Ta\u00edno.\n\n\n=== Spanish rule (1509\u20131655) ===\n\nChristopher Columbus was the first European to see Jamaica, claiming the island for Spain after landing there in 1494 on his second voyage to the Americas. His probable landing point was Dry Harbour, called Discovery Bay, and St. Ann's Bay was named \"Saint Gloria\" by Columbus, as the first sighting of the land. He later returned in 1503; however, he was shipwrecked and he and his crew were forced to live on Jamaica for a year whilst waiting to be rescued. One and a half kilometres west of St. Ann's Bay is the site of the first Spanish settlement on the island, Sevilla, which was established in 1509 by Juan de Esquivel but abandoned around 1524 because it was deemed unhealthy. The capital was moved to Spanish Town, then called St. Jago de la Vega, around 1534 (at present-day St. Catherine). Meanwhile, the Ta\u00ednos began dying in large numbers, either from introduced diseases to which they had no immunity, or from enslavement by the Spanish. As a result, the Spanish began importing slaves from Africa to the island. Many slaves managed to escape, forming autonomous communities in remote and easily defended areas in the interior of Jamaica, mixing with the remaining Taino; these communities became known as Maroons. Small numbers of Jews also came to live on the island. By the early 17th century it is estimated that no more than 2,500\u20133,000 people lived on Jamaica.\n\n\n=== Early British period ===\n\nThe English began taking an interest in the island and, following a failed attempt to conquer Santo Domingo on Hispaniola, Sir William Penn and General Robert Venables led an invasion of Jamaica in 1655. Battles at Ocho Rios in 1657 and the Rio Nuevo in 1658 resulted in Spanish defeats; in 1660 the Maroons began supporting the English and the Spanish defeat was secured.When the English captured Jamaica, the Spanish colonists fled after freeing their slaves. Many slaves dispersed into the mountains, joining the already established maroon communities. During the centuries of slavery, Maroons established free communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica, where they maintained their freedom and independence for generations. Meanwhile, the Spanish made several attempts to re-capture the island, prompting the British to support pirates attacking Spanish ships in the Caribbean; as a result piracy became rampant on Jamaica, with the city of Port Royal becoming notorious for its lawlessness. Spain later recognised English possession of the island with the Treaty of Madrid (1670). As a result, the English authorities sought to reign in the worst excesses of the pirates.In 1660, the population of Jamaica was about 4,500 white and 1,500 black. By the early 1670s, as the English developed sugar cane plantations worked by large numbers of slaves, black Africans formed a majority of the population. The Irish in Jamaica also formed a large part of the island's early population, making up two-thirds of the white population on the island in the late 17th century, twice that of the English population. They were brought in as indentured labourers and soldiers after the conquest of 1655. The majority of Irish were transported by force as political prisoners of war from Ireland as a result of the ongoing Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Migration of large numbers of Irish to the island continued into the 18th century.A limited form of local government was introduced with the creation of the House of Assembly of Jamaica in 1664; however, it represented only a tiny number of rich plantation owners. In 1692, the colony was rocked by an earthquake that resulted in several thousand deaths and the almost complete destruction of Port Royal.\n\n\n=== 18th\u201319th centuries ===\n\nDuring the 1700s the economy boomed, based largely on sugar and other crops such as coffee, cotton and indigo. All these crops were worked by black slaves, who lived short and often brutal lives with no rights, being the property of a small planter-class. A large slave rebellion, known as Tacky's War, broke out in 1760 but was defeated by the British. During this period the British also attempted to consolidate their control over the island by defeating the Maroons, who continued to live in the interior under leaders such as Cudjoe and Queen Nanny. The First Maroon War (1728 \u2013 1739/40) ended in stalemate, as did a second conflict in 1795\u201396; however, as a result of these wars many Maroons were expelled to Nova Scotia and, later, Sierra Leone.By the beginning of the 19th century, Jamaica's dependence on slave labour and a plantation economy had resulted in black people outnumbering white people by a ratio of almost 20 to 1. Although the British had outlawed the importation of slaves, some were still smuggled in from Spanish colonies and directly. While planning the abolition of slavery, the British Parliament passed laws to improve conditions for slaves. They banned the use of whips in the field and flogging of women; informed planters that slaves were to be allowed religious instruction, and required a free day during each week when slaves could sell their produce, prohibiting Sunday markets to enable slaves to attend church. The House of Assembly in Jamaica resented and resisted the new laws. Members, with membership then restricted to European-Jamaicans, claimed that the slaves were content and objected to Parliament's interference in island affairs. Slave owners feared possible revolts if conditions were lightened.\n\nThe British abolished the slave trade in 1807, but not the institution itself. In 1831 a huge slave rebellion, known as Baptist War, broke out, led by the Baptist preacher Samuel Sharpe. The rebellion resulted in hundreds of deaths, the destruction of many plantations, and resulted in ferocious reprisals by the plantocracy class. As a result of rebellions such as these, as well as the efforts of abolitionists, the British outlawed slavery in its empire in 1834, with full emancipation from chattel slavery declared in 1838. The population in 1834 was 371,070, of whom 15,000 were white, 5,000 free black; 40,000 'coloured' or free people of color (mixed race); and 311,070 were slaves. The resulting labour shortage prompted the British to begin to \"import\" indentured servants to supplement the labour pool, as many freedmen resisted working on the plantations. Workers recruited from India began arriving in 1845, Chinese workers in 1854. Many South Asian and Chinese descendants continue to reside in Jamaica today.Over the next 20 years, several epidemics of cholera, scarlet fever, and smallpox hit the island, killing almost 60,000 people (about 10 per day). Nevertheless, in 1871 the census recorded a population of 506,154 people, 246,573 of which were males, and 259,581 females. Their races were recorded as 13,101 white, 100,346 coloured (mixed black and white), and 392,707 black. This period was marked by an economic slump, with many Jamaicans living in poverty. Dissatisfaction with this, and continued racial discrimination and marginalisation of the black majority, led to the outbreak of the Morant Bay rebellion in 1865 led by Paul Bogle, which was put down by Governor John Eyre with such brutality that he was recalled from his position. His successor, John Peter Grant, enacted a series of social, financial and political reforms whilst aiming to uphold firm British rule over the island, which became a Crown Colony in 1866. In 1872 the capital was transferred from Spanish Town to Kingston.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n\nIn 1907 Jamaica was struck by an earthquake \u2014 this, and the subsequent fire, caused immense destruction in Kingston and the deaths of 800\u20131,000 people.Unemployment and poverty remained a problem for many Jamaicans. Various movements seeking political change arose as a result, most notably the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League founded by Marcus Garvey in 1917. As well as seeking greater political rights and an improvement for the condition of workers, Garvey was also a prominent Pan-Africanist and proponent of the Back-to-Africa movement. He was also one of the chief inspirations behind Rastafari, a religion founded in Jamaica in the 1930s that combined Christianity with an Afrocentric theology focused on the figure of Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia. Despite occasional persecution, Rastafari grew to become an established faith on the island, later spreading abroad.\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s hit Jamaica hard. As part of the British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u201339, Jamaica saw numerous strikes, culminating in a strike in 1938 that turned into a full-blown riot.\nAs a result, the British government instituted a commission to look into the causes of the disturbances; their report recommended political and economic reforms in Britain's Caribbean colonies. A new House of Representatives was established in 1944, elected by universal adult suffrage. During this period Jamaica's two-party system emerged, with the creation of the Jamaican Labour Party (JLP) under Alexander Bustamante and the People's National Party (PNP) under Norman Manley.Jamaica slowly gained increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. In 1958 it became a province in the Federation of the West Indies, a federation of several of Britain's Caribbean colonies. Membership of the Federation proved to be divisive, however, and a referendum on the issue saw a slight majority voting to leave. After leaving the Federation, Jamaica attained full independence on 6 August 1962. The new state retained, however, its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations (with the Queen as head of state) and adopted a Westminster-style parliamentary system. Bustamante, at the age of 78, became the country's first prime minister.\n\n\n=== Post-independence era ===\n\nStrong economic growth, averaging approximately 6% per annum, marked the first ten years of independence under conservative JLP governments; these were led by successive Prime Ministers Alexander Bustamante, Donald Sangster (who died of natural causes within two months of taking office) and Hugh Shearer. The growth was fuelled by high levels of private investment in bauxite/alumina, tourism, the manufacturing industry and, to a lesser extent, the agricultural sector. In terms of foreign policy Jamaica became a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, seeking to retain strong ties with Britain and the United States whilst also developing links with Communist states such as Cuba.\n\nThe optimism of the first decade was accompanied by a growing sense of inequality among many Afro-Jamaicans, and a concern that the benefits of growth were not being shared by the urban poor, many of whom ended up living in crime-ridden shanty towns in Kingston. This, combined with the effects of a slowdown in the global economy in 1970, led to the voters electing the PNP under Michael Manley in 1972. Manley's government enacted various social reforms, such as a higher minimum wage, land reform, legislation for women's equality, greater housing construction and an increase in educational provision. Internationally he improved ties with the Communist bloc and vigorously opposed the apartheid regime in South Africa. However, the economy faltered in this period due to a combination of internal and external factors (such as the oil shocks). The rivalry between the JLP and PNP became intense, and political and gang-related violence grew significantly in this period.By 1980, Jamaica's gross national product had declined to some 25% below its 1972 level. Seeking change, Jamaicans voted the JLP back in in 1980 under Edward Seaga. Firmly anti-Communist, Seaga cut ties with Cuba and sent troops to support the US invasion of Grenada in 1983. The economic deterioration, however, continued into the mid-1980s, exacerbated by a number of factors. The largest and third-largest alumina producers, Alpart and Alcoa, closed; and there was a significant reduction in production by the second-largest producer, Alcan. Reynolds Jamaica Mines, Ltd. left the Jamaican industry. There was also a decline in tourism, which was important to the economy. Owing to rising foreign and local debt, accompanied by large fiscal deficits, the government sought International Monetary Fund (IMF) financing, which was dependent on implementing various austerity measures. These resulted in strikes in 1985 and a decline in support for the Seaga government, exacerbated by criticism of the government's response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988. Having now de-emphasised socialism and adopting a more centrist position, Michael Manley and the PNP were re-elected in 1989.The PNP went on to win a string of elections, under Prime Ministers Michael Manley (1989\u20131992), P. J. Patterson (1992\u20132005) and Portia Simpson-Miller (2005\u20132007). During this period various economic reforms were introduced, such as deregulating the finance sector and floating the Jamaican dollar, as well as greater investment in infrastructure, whilst also retaining a strong social safety net. Political violence, so prevalent in the previous two decades, declined significantly. In 2007 the PNP were defeated by the JLP, ending 18 years of PNP rule; Bruce Golding became the new prime minister. Golding's tenure (2007-2010) was dominated by the effects of the global recession, as well as the fallout from an attempt by Jamaican police and military to arrest drug lord Christopher Coke in 2010 which erupted in violence, resulting in over 70 deaths. As a result of this incident Golding resigned and was replaced by Andrew Holness in 2011; Holness was defeated in the 2011 Jamaican general election, which saw Portia Miller-Simpson return to power, but Holness began a second term after winning the 2016 Jamaican general election.\nIndependence, however widely celebrated in Jamaica, has been questioned in the early 21st century. In 2011, a survey showed that approximately 60% of Jamaicans believe that the country would have been better off had it remained a British colony, with only 17% believing it would have been worse off, citing as problems years of social and fiscal mismanagement in the country.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nJamaica is a parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy. The head of state is the Queen of Jamaica (currently Elizabeth II), represented locally by the Governor-General of Jamaica. The governor-general is nominated by the Prime Minister of Jamaica and the entire Cabinet and then formally appointed by the monarch. All the members of the Cabinet are appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the prime minister. The monarch and the governor-general serve largely ceremonial roles, apart from their reserve powers for use in certain constitutional crisis situations. The position of the monarch has been a matter of continuing debate in Jamaica for many years; currently both major political parties are committed to transitioning to a Republic with a President.Jamaica's current constitution was drafted in 1962 by a bipartisan joint committee of the Jamaican legislature. It came into force with the Jamaica Independence Act, 1962 of the United Kingdom parliament, which gave Jamaica independence.The Parliament of Jamaica is bicameral, consisting of the House of Representatives (Lower House) and the Senate (Upper House). Members of the House (known as Members of Parliament or MPs) are directly elected, and the member of the House of Representatives who, in the governor-general's best judgement, is best able to command the confidence of a majority of the members of that House, is appointed by the governor-general to be the prime minister. Senators are nominated jointly by the prime minister and the parliamentary Leader of the Opposition and are then appointed by the governor-general.The Judiciary of Jamaica operates on a common law system derived from English law and Commonwealth of Nations precedents. The court of final appeal is the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, though during the 2000s parliament attempted to replace it with the Caribbean Court of Justice.\n\n\n=== Political parties and elections ===\n\nJamaica has traditionally had a two-party system, with power often alternating between the People's National Party (PNP) and Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). The party with current administrative and legislative power is the Jamaica Labour Party, with a one-seat parliamentary majority as of 2016. There are also several minor parties who have yet to gain a seat in parliament; the largest of these is the National Democratic Movement (NDM).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nJamaica is divided into 14 parishes, which are grouped into three historic counties that have no administrative relevance.In the context of local government the parishes are designated \"Local Authorities\". These local authorities are further styled as \"Municipal Corporations\", which are either city municipalities or town municipalities. Any new city municipality must have a population of at least 50,000, and a town municipality a number set by the Minister of Local Government. There are currently no town municipalities.\nThe local governments of the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrews are consolidated as the city municipality of Kingston & St. Andrew Municipal Corporation. The newest city municipality created is the Municipality of Portmore in 2003. While it is geographically located within the parish of St. Catherine, it is governed independently.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nThe Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) is the small but professional military force of Jamaica. The JDF is based on the British military model with similar organisation, training, weapons and traditions. Once chosen, officer candidates are sent to one of several British or Canadian basic officer courses depending on the arm of service. Enlisted soldiers are given basic training at Up Park Camp or JDF Training Depot, Newcastle, both in St. Andrew. As with the British model, NCOs are given several levels of professional training as they rise up the ranks. Additional military schools are available for speciality training in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom.The JDF is directly descended from the British Army's West India Regiment formed during the colonial era. The West India Regiment was used extensively by the British Empire in policing the empire from 1795 to 1926. Other units in the JDF heritage include the early colonial Jamaica Militia, the Kingston Infantry Volunteers of WWI and reorganised into the Jamaican Infantry Volunteers in World War II. The West Indies Regiment was reformed in 1958 as part of the West Indies Federation, after dissolution of the Federation the JDF was established.The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) comprises an infantry Regiment and Reserve Corps, an Air Wing, a Coast Guard fleet and a supporting Engineering Unit. The infantry regiment contains the 1st, 2nd and 3rd (National Reserve) battalions. The JDF Air Wing is divided into three flight units, a training unit, a support unit and the JDF Air Wing (National Reserve). The Coast Guard is divided between seagoing crews and support crews who conduct maritime safety and maritime law enforcement as well as defence-related operations.The role of the support battalion is to provide support to boost numbers in combat and issue competency training in order to allow for the readiness of the force. The 1st Engineer Regiment was formed due to an increased demand for military engineers and their role is to provide engineering services whenever and wherever they are needed. The Headquarters JDF contains the JDF Commander, Command Staff as well as Intelligence, Judge Advocate office, Administrative and Procurement sections.In recent years the JDF has been called on to assist the nation's police, the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF), in fighting drug smuggling and a rising crime rate which includes one of the highest murder rates in the world. JDF units actively conduct armed patrols with the JCF in high-crime areas and known gang neighbourhoods. There has been vocal controversy as well as support of this JDF role. In early 2005, an Opposition leader, Edward Seaga, called for the merger of the JDF and JCF. This has not garnered support in either organisation nor among the majority of citizens. In 2017, Jamaica signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\n\n== Geography and environment ==\n\nJamaica is the third largest island in the Caribbean. It lies between latitudes 17\u00b0 and 19\u00b0N, and longitudes 76\u00b0 and 79\u00b0W. Mountains dominate the interior: the Don Figuerero, Santa Cruz, and May Day mountains in the west, the Dry Harbour Mountains in the centre, and the John Crow Mountains and Blue Mountains in the east, the latter containing Blue Mountain Peak, Jamaica's tallest mountain at 2,256 m. They are surrounded by a narrow coastal plain. Jamaica only has two cities, the first being Kingston, the capital city and centre of business, located on the south coast and the second being Montego Bay, one of the best known cities in the Caribbean for tourism, located on the north coast. Kingston Harbour is the seventh-largest natural harbour in the world, which contributed to the city being designated as the capital in 1872. Other towns of note include Portmore, Spanish Town, Savanna la Mar, Mandeville and the resort towns of Ocho R\u00edos, Port Antonio and Negril.Tourist attractions include Dunn's River Falls in St. Ann, YS Falls in St. Elizabeth, the Blue Lagoon in Portland, believed to be the crater of an extinct volcano, and Port Royal, site of a major earthquake in 1692 that helped form the island's Palisadoes tombolo.Among the variety of terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems are dry and wet limestone forests, rainforest, riparian woodland, wetlands, caves, rivers, seagrass beds and coral reefs. The authorities have recognised the tremendous significance and potential of the environment and have designated some of the more 'fertile' areas as 'protected'. Among the island's protected areas are the Cockpit Country, Hellshire Hills, and Litchfield forest reserves. In 1992, Jamaica's first marine park, covering nearly 15 square kilometres (5.8 sq mi), was established in Montego Bay. Portland Bight Protected Area was designated in 1999. The following year Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park was created, covering roughly 300 square miles (780 km2) of a wilderness area which supports thousands of tree and fern species and rare animals.\nThere are several small islands off Jamaica's coast, most notably those in Portland Bight such as Pigeon Island, Salt Island, Dolphin Island, Long Island, Great Goat Island and Little Goat Island, and also Lime Cay located further east. Much further out \u2013 some 50\u201380 km off the south coast \u2013 lie the very small Morant Cays and Pedro Cays.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in Jamaica is tropical, with hot and humid weather, although higher inland regions are more temperate. Some regions on the south coast, such as the Liguanea Plain and the Pedro Plains, are relatively dry rain-shadow areas.Jamaica lies in the hurricane belt of the Atlantic Ocean and because of this, the island sometimes suffers significant storm damage. Hurricanes Charlie and Gilbert hit Jamaica directly in 1951 and 1988, respectively, causing major damage and many deaths. In the 2000s (decade), hurricanes Ivan, Dean, and Gustav also brought severe weather to the island.\n\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\n\nJamaica's climate is tropical, supporting diverse ecosystems with a wealth of plants and animals. Its plant life has changed considerably over the centuries; when the Spanish arrived in 1494, except for small agricultural clearings, the country was deeply forested. The European settlers cut down the great timber trees for building and ships' supplies, and cleared the plains, savannas, and mountain slopes for intense agricultural cultivation. Many new plants were introduced including sugarcane, bananas, and citrus trees.Today, however, Jamaica is now the home to about 3,000 species of native flowering plants (of which over 1,000 are endemic and 200 are species of orchid), thousands of species of non-flowering flora, and about 20 botanical gardens, some of which are several hundred years old. Areas of heavy rainfall also contain stands of bamboo, ferns, ebony, mahogany, and rosewood. Cactus and similar dry-area plants are found along the south and southwest coastal area. Parts of the west and southwest consist of large grasslands, with scattered stands of trees.\nJamaican's fauna, typical of the Caribbean, includes highly diversified wildlife with many endemic species. As with other oceanic islands, land mammals are mostly several species of bats of which at least three endemic species are found only in Cockpit Country, one of which is at-risk. Other species of bat include the fig-eating and hairy-tailed bats. The only non-bat native mammal extant in Jamaica is the Jamaican hutia, locally known as the coney. Introduced mammals such as wild boar and the small Asian mongoose are also common. Jamaica is also home to about 50 species of reptiles, the largest of which is the American crocodile; however, it is only present within the Black River and a few other areas. Lizards such as anoles, iguanas and snakes such as racers and the Jamaican boa (the largest snake on the island), are common in areas such as the Cockpit Country. None of Jamaica's eight species of native snakes is venomous.Jamaica is home to about 289 species of birds of which 27 are endemic including the endangered black-Billed parrots and the Jamaican blackbird, both of which are only found in Cockpit Country. It is also the indigenous home to four species of hummingbirds (three of which are found nowhere else in the world): the black-billed streamertail, the Jamaican mango, the Vervain hummingbird, and red-billed streamertails. The red-billed streamertail, known locally as the \"doctor bird\", is Jamaica's National Symbol. Other notable species include the Jamaican tody and the Greater flamingo,One species of freshwater turtle is native to Jamaica, the Jamaican slider. It is found only on Jamaica and on a few islands in the Bahamas. In addition, many types of frogs are common on the island, especially treefrogs. Beautiful and exotic birds, such as the can be found among a large number of others.\nJamaican waters contain considerable resources of fresh-and saltwater fish. The chief varieties of saltwater fish are kingfish, jack, mackerel, whiting, bonito, and tuna. Fish that occasionally enter freshwater and estuarine environments include snook, jewfish, mangrove snapper, and mullets. Fish that spend the majority of their lives in Jamaica's fresh waters include many species of livebearers, killifish, freshwater gobies, the mountain mullet, and the American eel. Tilapia have been introduced from Africa for aquaculture, and are very common. Also visible in the waters surrounding Jamaica are dolphins, parrotfish, and the endangered manatee.Insects and other invertebrates are abundant, including the world's largest centipede, the Amazonian giant centipede. Jamaica is the home to about 150 species of butterflies and moths, including 35 indigenous species and 22 subspecies. It is also the native home to the Jamaican swallowtail, the western hemisphere's largest butterfly.\n\n\n=== Aquatic life ===\nCoral reef ecosystems are important because they provide people with a source of livelihood, food, recreation, and medicinal compounds and protect the land on which they live. Jamaica relies on the ocean and its ecosystem for its development. However, the marine life in Jamaica is also being affected. There could be many factors that contribute to marine life not having the best health. Jamaica's geological origin, topographical features and seasonal high rainfall make it susceptible to a range of natural hazards that can affect the coastal and oceanic environments. These include storm surge, slope failures (landslides), earthquakes, floods and hurricanes. Coral reefs in the Negril Marine Park (NMP), Jamaica, have been increasingly impacted by nutrient pollution and macroalgal blooms following decades of intensive development as a major tourist destination. Another one of those factors could include tourist, being that Jamaica is a very touristy place the island draws people to travel here from all over the world. The Jamaican tourism industry accounts for 32% of total employment and 36% of the country's GDP and is largely based on the sun, sea and sand, the last two of these attributes being dependent on healthy coral reef ecosystems. Because of Jamaica's tourism, they have developed a study to see if the tourist would be willing to help financially to manage their marine ecosystem because Jamaica alone is unable to. The ocean connects all the countries all over the world, however, everyone and everything is affecting the flow and life in the ocean. Jamaica is a very touristy place specifically because of their beaches. If their oceans are not functioning at their best then the well-being of Jamaica and the people who live there will start to deteriorate. According to the OECD, oceans contribute $1.5 trillion annually in value-added to the overall economy. A developing country on an island will get the majority of their revenue from their ocean.\n\n\n=== Pollution ===\nPollution comes from run-off, sewage systems, and garbage. However, this typically all ends up in the ocean after there is rain or floods. Everything that ends up in the water changes the quality and balance of the ocean. Poor coastal water quality has adversely affected fisheries, tourism and mariculture, as well as undermining biological sustainability of the living resources of ocean and coastal habitats. Jamaica imports and exports many goods through their waters. Some of the imports that go into Jamaica include petroleum and petroleum products. Issues include accidents at sea; risk of spills through local and international transport of petroleum and petroleum products. Oil spills can disrupt the marine life because the chemicals that are being spilled that should not be there. Oil and water do not mix. Unfortunately oil spills is not the only form of pollution that occurs in Jamaica. Solid waste disposal mechanisms in Jamaica are currently inadequate. The solid waste gets into the water through rainfall forces. Solid waste is also harmful to wildlife, particularly birds, fish and turtles that feed at the surface of the water and mistake floating debris for food. For example, plastic can be caught around birds and turtles necks making it difficult to eat and breath as they begin to grow causing the plastic to get tighter around their necks. Pieces of plastic, metal, and glass can be mistaken for the food fish eat. Each Jamaican generates 1 kg (2 lbs) of waste per day; only 70% of this is collected by National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) \u2014 the remaining 30% is either burnt or disposed of in gullies/waterways.\n\n\n=== Environmental policies ===\nThere are policies that are being put into place to help preserve the ocean and the life below water. The goal of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) is to improve the quality of life of human communities who depend on coastal resources while maintaining the biological diversity and productivity of coastal ecosystems. Developing an underdeveloped country can impact the oceans ecosystem because of all the construction that would be done to develop the country. Over-building, driven by powerful market forces as well as poverty among some sectors of the population, and destructive exploitation contribute to the decline of ocean and coastal resources. Developing practices that will contribute to the lives of the people but also to the life of the ocean and its ecosystem. Some of these practices include: Develop sustainable fisheries practices, ensure sustainable mariculture techniques and practices, sustainable management of shipping, and promote sustainable tourism practices. As for tourism, tourism is the number one source of foreign exchange earnings in Jamaica and, as such is vital to the national economy. Tourist typically go to countries unaware of issues and how they impact those issues. Tourist are not going to be used to living in a different style compared to their own country. Practices such as: provide sewage treatment facilities for all tourist areas, determine carrying capacity of the environment prior to planning tourism activities, provide alternative types of tourist activities can help to get desired results such as the development of alternative tourism which will reduce the current pressure on resources that support traditional tourism activities. A study was conducted to see how tourist could help with sustainable financing for ocean and coastal management in Jamaica. Instead of using tourist fees they would call them environmental fees. This study aims to inform the relevant stakeholders of the feasibility of implementing environmental fees as well as the likely impact of such revenue generating instruments on the current tourist visitation rates to the island. The development of a user fee system would help fund environmental management and protection. The results show that tourists have a high consumer surplus associated with a vacation in Jamaica, and have a significantly lower willingness to pay for a tourism tax when compared to an environmental tax. The findings of the study show that the \"label\" of the tax and as well as the respondent's awareness of the institutional mechanisms for environmental protection and tourism are important to their decision framework. Tourist are more willing to pay for environmental fees rather than tourist tax fees. A tax high enough to fund for environmental management and protection but low enough to continue to bring tourist to Jamaica. It has been shows that if an environmental tax of $1 per person were introduced it would not cause a significant decline in visitation rates and would generate revenues of US$1.7M.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Ethnic origins ===\n\nJamaica's diverse ethnic roots is reflected in the national motto 'Out of Many One People'. Most of the population of 2,812,000 (July 2018 est.) are of African or partially African descent, with many being able to trace their origins to the West African countries of Ghana and Nigeria. Other major ancestral areas are Europe, South Asia, and East Asia. It is uncommon for Jamaicans to identify themselves by race as is prominent in other countries such as the United States, with most Jamaicans seeing Jamaican nationality as an identity in and of itself, identifying as simply being 'Jamaican' regardless of ethnicity. A study found that the average admixture on the island was 78.3% Sub-Saharan African, 16.0% European, and 5.7% East Asian. Another study in 2020 showed that Jamaicans of African descent represent 76.3% of the population, followed by 15.1% Afro-European, 3.4% East Indian and Afro-East Indian, 3.2% Caucasian, 1.2% Chinese and 0.8% other.The Jamaican Maroons of Accompong and other settlements are the descendant of African slaves who fled the plantations for the interior where they set up their own autonomous communities. Many Maroons continue to have their own traditions and speak their own language, known locally as Kromanti.Asians form the second-largest group and include Indo-Jamaicans and Chinese Jamaicans. Most are descended from indentured workers brought by the British colonial government to fill labour shortages following the abolition of slavery in 1838. Prominent Indian Jamaicans include jockey Shaun Bridgmohan, who was the first Jamaican in the Kentucky Derby, NBC Nightly News journalist Lester Holt, and Miss Jamaica World and Miss Universe winner Yendi Phillips. The southwestern parish of Westmoreland is famous for its large population of Indo-Jamaicans. Along with their Indian counterparts, Chinese Jamaicans have also played an integral part in Jamaica's community and history. Prominent descendants of this group include Canadian billionaire investor Michael Lee-Chin, supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyson Beckford, and VP Records founder Vincent \"Randy\" Chin.\nThere are about 20,000 Jamaicans who have Lebanese and Syrian ancestry. Most were Christian immigrants who fled the Ottoman occupation of Lebanon in the early 19th century. Eventually their descendants became very successful politicians and businessmen. Notable Jamaicans from this group include former Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga, Jamaican politician and former Miss World Lisa Hanna, Jamaican politicians Edward Zacca and Shahine Robinson, and hotelier Abraham Elias Issa.\nIn 1835, Charles Ellis, 1st Baron Seaford gave 500 acres of his 10,000 acre estate in Westmoreland for the Seaford Town German settlement. Today most of the town's descendants are of full or partial German descent.The first wave of English immigrants arrived to the island 1655 after conquering the Spanish, and they have historically being the dominant group. Prominent descendants from this group include former American Governor of New York David Paterson, Sandals Hotels owner Gordon Butch Stewart, United States Presidential Advisor and \"mother\" of the Pell Grant Lois Rice, and former United States National Security Advisor and Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice. The first Irish immigrants came to Jamaica in the 1600s as war prisoners and later, indentured labour. Their descendants include two of Jamaica's National Heroes:  Prime Ministers Michael Manley and Alexander Bustamante. Along with the English and the Irish, the Scots are another group that has made a significant impact on the island. According to the Scotland Herald newspaper, Jamaica has more people using the Campbell surnames than the population of Scotland itself, and it also has the highest percentage of Scottish surnames outside of Scotland. Scottish surnames account to about 60% of the surnames in the Jamaican phone books. The first Jamaican inhabitants from Scotland were exiled \"rebels\". Later, they would be followed by ambitious businessmen who spent time between their great country estates in Scotland and the island. As a result, many of the slave owning plantations on the island were owned by Scottish men, and thus a large number of mixed-race Jamaicans can claim Scottish ancestry. High immigration from Scotland continued until well after independence. Today, notable Scottish-Jamaicans include the businessman John Pringle, former American Secretary of State Colin Powell, and American actress Kerry Washington.\n\nThere is also a significant Portuguese Jamaican population that is predominantly of Sephardic Jewish heritage; they are primarily located in the Saint Elizabeth Parish in southwest Jamaica. The first Jews arrived as explorers from Spain in the 15th century after being forced to convert to Christianity or face death. A small number of them became slave owners and even famous pirates. Judaism eventually became very influential in Jamaica and can be seen today with many Jewish cemeteries around the country. During the Holocaust Jamaica became a refuge for Jews fleeing persecution in Europe. Famous Jewish descendants include the dancehall artist Sean Paul, former record producer and founder of Island Records Chris Blackwell, and Jacob De Cordova who was the founder of the Daily Gleaner newspaper.In recent years immigration has increased, coming mainly from China, Haiti, Cuba, Colombia, and Latin America; 20,000 Latin Americans reside in Jamaica. In 2016, the Prime Minister Andrew Holness suggested making Spanish Jamaica's second official language. About 7,000 Americans also reside in Jamaica. Notable American with connection to the island include fashion icon Ralph Lauren, philanthropist Daisy Soros, Blackstone's Schwarzman family, the family of the late Lieutenant Governor of Delaware John W. Rollins, fashion designer Vanessa Noel, investor Guy Stuart, Edward and Patricia Falkenberg, and iHeart Media CEO Bob Pittman, all of whom hold annual charity events to support the island.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nJamaica is regarded as a bilingual country, with two major languages in use by the population. The official language is English, which is \"used in all domains of public life\", including the government, the legal system, the media, and education. However, the primary spoken language is an English-based creole called Jamaican Patois (or Patwa). The two exist in a dialect continuum, with speakers using a different register of speech depending on context and whom they are speaking to. 'Pure' Patois, though sometimes seen as merely a particularly aberrant dialect of English, is essentially mutually unintelligible with standard English and is best thought of a separate language. A 2007 survey by the Jamaican Language Unit found that 17.1 percent of the population were monolingual in Jamaican Standard English (JSE), 36.5 percent were monolingual in Patois, and 46.4 percent were bilingual, although earlier surveys had pointed to a greater degree of bilinguality (up to 90 percent). The Jamaican education system has only recently begun to offer formal instruction in Patois, while retaining JSE as the \"official language of instruction\".Additionally, some Jamaicans use one or more of Jamaican Sign Language (JSL), American Sign Language (ASL) or the indigenous Jamaican Country Sign Language (Konchri Sain). Both JSL and ASL are rapidly replacing Konchri Sain for a variety of reasons.\n\n\n=== Emigration ===\n\nMany Jamaicans have emigrated to other countries, especially to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada. In the case of the United States, about 20,000 Jamaicans per year are granted permanent residence. There has also been emigration of Jamaicans to other Caribbeans countries such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guyana, and The Bahamas. It was estimated in 2004 that up to 2.5 million Jamaicans and Jamaican descendants live abroad.Jamaicans in the United Kingdom number an estimated 800,000 making them by far the country's largest African-Caribbean group. Large-scale migration from Jamaica to the UK occurred primarily in the 1950s and 1960s when the country was still under British rule. Jamaican communities exist in most large UK cities. Concentrations of expatriate Jamaicans are quite considerable in numerous cities in the United States, including New York City, Buffalo, the Miami metro area, Atlanta, Chicago, Orlando, Tampa, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Hartford, Providence and Los Angeles. In Canada, the Jamaican population is centred in Toronto, with smaller communities in cities such as Hamilton, Montreal, Winnipeg, Vancouver and Ottawa. Jamaican Canadians comprise about 30% of the entire Black Canadian population.A notable though much smaller group of emigrants are Jamaicans in Ethiopia. These are mostly Rastafarians, in whose theological worldview Africa is the promised land, or 'Zion', or more specifically Ethiopia, due to reverence in which former Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie is held. Most live in the small town of Shashamane about 150 miles (240 km) south of the capital Addis Ababa.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\n\nWhen Jamaica gained independence in 1962, the murder rate was 3.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the lowest in the world. By 2009, the rate was 62 per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest in the world. Gang violence became a serious problem, with organised crime being centred around Jamaican posses or 'Yardies'. Jamaica has had one of the highest murder rates in the world for many years, according to UN estimates. Some areas of Jamaica, particularly poor areas in Kingston, Montego Bay and elsewhere experience high levels of crime and violence.However, there were 1,682 reported murders in 2009 and 1,428 in 2010. After 2011 the murder rate continued to fall, following the downward trend in 2010, after a strategic programme was launched. In 2012, the Ministry of National Security reported a 30 percent decrease in murders. Nevertheless, in 2017 murders rose by 22% over the previous year.Many Jamaicans are hostile towards LGBT and intersex people, and mob attacks against gay people have been reported. Numerous high-profile dancehall and ragga artists have produced songs featuring explicitly homophobic lyrics. Male homosexuality is illegal and punishable by prison time.\n\n\n=== Major cities ===\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nChristianity is the largest religion practised in Jamaica. About 70% are Protestants; Roman Catholics are just 2% of the population. According to the 2001 census, the country's largest Protestant denominations are the Church of God (24%), Seventh-day Adventist Church (11%), Pentecostal (10%), Baptist (7%), Anglican (4%), United Church (2%), Methodist (2%), Moravian (1%) and Plymouth Brethren (1%). Bedwardism is a form of Christianity native to the island, sometime view as a separate faith. The Christian faith gained acceptance as British Christian abolitionists and Baptist missionaries joined educated former slaves in the struggle against slavery.The Rastafari movement has 29,026 adherents, according to the 2011 census, with 25,325 Rastafarian males and 3,701 Rastafarian females. The faith originated in Jamaica in the 1930s and though rooted in Christianity it is heavily Afrocentric in its focus, revering figures such as the Jamaican black nationalist Marcus Garvey and Haile Selassie, the former Emperor of Ethiopia. Rastafari has since spread across the globe, especially to areas with large black or African diasporas.Various faiths and traditional religious practices derived from Africa are practised on the island, notably Kumina, Convince, Myal and Obeah.Other religions in Jamaica include Jehovah's Witnesses (2% population), the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith, which counts perhaps 8,000 adherents and 21 Local Spiritual Assemblies, Mormonism, Buddhism, and Hinduism. The Hindu Diwali festival is celebrated yearly among the Indo-Jamaican community.There is also a small population of about 200 Jews, who describe themselves as Liberal-Conservative. The first Jews in Jamaica trace their roots back to early 15th-century Spain and Portugal. Kahal Kadosh Shaare Shalom, also known as the United Congregation of Israelites, is a historic synagogue located in the city of Kingston. Originally built in 1912, it is the official and only Jewish place of worship left on the island. The once abundant Jewish population has voluntarily converted to Christianity over time. Shaare Shalom is one of the few synagogues in the world that contains sand covered floors and is a popular tourist destination.\n\nOther small groups include Muslims, who claim 5,000 adherents. The Muslim holidays of Ashura (known locally as Hussay or Hosay) and Eid have been celebrated throughout the island for hundreds of years. In the past, every plantation in each parish celebrated Hosay. Today it has been called an Indian carnival and is perhaps most well known in Clarendon where it is celebrated each August. People of all religions attend the event, showing mutual respect.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThough a small nation, Jamaican culture has a strong global presence. The musical genres reggae, ska, mento, rocksteady, dub, and, more recently, dancehall and ragga all originated in the island's vibrant, popular urban recording industry. These have themselves gone on to influence numerous other genres, such as punk rock (through reggae and ska), dub poetry, New Wave, two-tone, reggaeton, jungle, drum and bass, dubstep, grime and American rap music. Some rappers, such as The Notorious B.I.G., Busta Rhymes, and Heavy D, are of Jamaican descent.\nBob Marley is probably the best known Jamaican musician; with his band The Wailers he had a string of hits in 1960s\u201370s, popularising reggae internationally and going on to sell millions of records. Many other internationally known artists were born in Jamaica, including Millie Small, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Gregory Isaacs, Half Pint, Protoje, Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer, Big Youth, Jimmy Cliff, Dennis Brown, Desmond Dekker, Beres Hammond, Beenie Man, Shaggy, Grace Jones, Shabba Ranks, Super Cat, Buju Banton, Sean Paul, I Wayne, Bounty Killer and many others. Bands that came from Jamaica include Black Uhuru, Third World Band, Inner Circle, Chalice Reggae Band, Culture, Fab Five and Morgan Heritage.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nThe journalist and author H. G. de Lisser (1878\u20131944) used his native country as the setting for his many novels. Born in Falmouth, Jamaica, de Lisser worked as a reporter for the Jamaica Times at a young age and in 1920 began publishing the magazine Planters' Punch. The White Witch of Rosehall is one of his better-known novels. He was named Honorary President of the Jamaican Press Association; he worked throughout his professional career to promote the Jamaican sugar industry.\nRoger Mais (1905 \u2013 1955), a journalist, poet, and playwright wrote many short stories, plays, and novels, including The Hills Were Joyful Together (1953), Brother Man (1954), and Black Lightning (1955).Ian Fleming (1908 \u2013 1964), who had a home in Jamaica where he spent considerable time, repeatedly used the island as a setting in his James Bond novels, including Live and Let Die, Doctor No, \"For Your Eyes Only\", The Man with the Golden Gun, and Octopussy and The Living Daylights. In addition, James Bond uses a Jamaica-based cover in Casino Royale. So far, the only James Bond film adaptation to have been set in Jamaica is Doctor No. Filming for the fictional island of San Monique in Live and Let Die took place in Jamaica.\nMarlon James (1970), novelist has published three novels: John Crow's Devil (2005), The Book of Night Women (2009) and A Brief History of Seven Killings (2014), winner of the 2015 Man Booker Prize.\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nJamaica has a history in the film industry dating from the early 1960s. A look at delinquent youth in Jamaica is presented in the 1970s musical crime film The Harder They Come, starring Jimmy Cliff as a frustrated (and psychopathic) reggae musician who descends into a murderous crime spree. Other notable Jamaican films include Countryman, Rockers, Dancehall Queen, One Love, Shottas, Out the Gate, Third World Cop and Kingston Paradise. Jamaica is also often used as a filming location, such as the James Bond film Dr. No (1962), Cocktail (1988) starring Tom Cruise, and the 1993 Disney comedy Cool Runnings, which is loosely based on the true story of Jamaica's first bobsled team trying to make it in the Winter Olympics.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe island is famous for its Jamaican jerk spice, curries and rice and peas which is integral to Jamaican cuisine. Jamaica is also home to Red Stripe beer and Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee.\n\n\n=== National symbols ===\n(From the Jamaica Information Service)\nNational bird: red-billed streamertail (also called doctor bird) (a hummingbird, Trochilus polytmus)\nNational flower \u2013 lignum vitae (Guiacum officinale)\nNational tree: blue mahoe (Hibiscus talipariti elatum)\nNational fruit: ackee (Blighia sapida)\nNational motto: \"Out of Many, One People.\"\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nSport is an integral part of national life in Jamaica and the island's athletes tend to perform to a standard well above what might ordinarily be expected of such a small country. While the most popular local sport is cricket, on the international stage Jamaicans have tended to do particularly well at track and field athletics.Jamaica has produced some of the world's most famous cricketers, including George Headley, Courtney Walsh, and Michael Holding. The country was one of the venues of 2007 Cricket World Cup and the West Indies cricket team is one of 10 ICC full member teams that participate in international Test cricket. The Jamaica national cricket team competes regionally, and also provides players for the West Indies team. Sabina Park is the only Test venue in the island, but the Greenfield Stadium is also used for cricket. Chris Gayle is the most renowned batsman from Jamaica currently representing the West Indies cricket team.\n\nSince independence Jamaica has consistently produced world class athletes in track and field. In Jamaica involvement in athletics begins at a very young age and most high schools maintain rigorous athletics programs with their top athletes competing in national competitions (most notably the VMBS Girls and Boys Athletics Championships) and international meets (most notably the Penn Relays). In Jamaica it is not uncommon for young athletes to attain press coverage and national fame long before they arrive on the international athletics stage.\nOver the past six decades Jamaica has produced dozens of world class sprinters including Olympic and World Champion Usain Bolt, world record holder in the 100m for men at 9.58s, and 200m for men at 19.19s. Other noteworthy Jamaican sprinters include Arthur Wint, the first Jamaican Olympic gold medalist; Donald Quarrie, Elaine Thompson double Olympic champion from Rio 2016 in the 100m and 200m, Olympic Champion and former 200m world record holder; Roy Anthony Bridge, part of the International Olympic Committee; Merlene Ottey; Delloreen Ennis-London; Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the former World and two time Olympic 100m Champion; Kerron Stewart; Aleen Bailey; Juliet Cuthbert; three-time Olympic gold medalist; Veronica Campbell-Brown; Sherone Simpson; Brigitte Foster-Hylton; Yohan Blake; Herb McKenley; George Rhoden, Olympic gold medalist; Deon Hemmings, Olympic gold medalist; as well as Asafa Powell, former 100m world record holder and 2x 100m Olympic finalist and gold medal winner in the men's 2008 Olympic 4 \u00d7 100 m. American Olympic winner Sanya Richards-Ross was also born in Jamaica.\nJamaica has also produced several world class amateur and professional boxers including Trevor Berbick and Mike McCallum. First-generation Jamaican athletes have continued to make a significant impact on the sport internationally, especially in the United Kingdom where the list of top British boxers born in Jamaica or of Jamaican parents includes Lloyd Honeyghan, Chris Eubank, Audley Harrison, David Haye, Lennox Lewis and Frank Bruno, Donovan \"Razor\" Ruddock, Mike Tyson, and Floyd Mayweather Jr., whose maternal grandfather is Jamaican.Association football and horse-racing are other popular sports in Jamaica. The national football team qualified for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Horse racing was Jamaica's first sport. It was brought in the 1700s by British immigrants to satisfy their longing for their favorite pastime back at home. During slavery, the Afro-Jamaican slaves were considered the best horse jockeys. Today, horse racing provides jobs for about 20,000 people including horse breeders, groomers, and trainers. Also, several Jamaicans are known internationally for their success in horse racing including Richard DePass, who once held the Guinness Book of World Records for the most wins in a day, Canadian awards winner George HoSang, and American award winners Charlie Hussey, Andrew Ramgeet, and Barrington Harvey. Also, there are hundreds of Jamaicans who are employed in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom as exercise riders and groomers.Race car driving is also a popular sport in Jamaica with several car racing tracks and racing associations across the country.The Jamaica national bobsled team was once a serious contender in the Winter Olympics, beating many well-established teams. Chess and basketball are widely played in Jamaica and are supported by the Jamaica Chess Federation (JCF) and the Jamaica Basketball Federation (JBF), respectively. Netball is also very popular on the island, with the Jamaica national netball team called The Sunshine Girls consistently ranking in the top five in the world.Rugby league has been played in Jamaica since 2006.\nThe Jamaica national rugby league team is made up of players who play in Jamaica and from UK based professional and semi professional clubs (notably in the Super League and Championship). In November 2018 for the first time ever, the Jamaican rugby league team qualified for the Rugby League World Cup after defeating the USA & Canada. Jamaica will play in the 2021 Rugby League World Cup in England.According to ESPN, the highest paid Jamaican professional athlete in 2011 was Justin Masterson, starting pitcher for the baseball team Cleveland Indians in the United States.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe emancipation of the slaves heralded the establishment of an education system for the masses. Prior to emancipation there were few schools for educating locals and many sent their children off to England to access quality education. After emancipation the West Indian Commission granted a sum of money to establish Elementary Schools, now known as All Age Schools. Most of these schools were established by the churches. This was the genesis of the modern Jamaican school system.\nPresently the following categories of schools exist:\n\nEarly childhood \u2013 Basic, infant and privately operated pre-school. Age cohort: 2 \u2013 5 years.\nPrimary \u2013 Publicly and privately owned (privately owned being called preparatory schools). Ages 3 \u2013 12 years.\nSecondary \u2013 Publicly and privately owned. Ages 10 \u2013 19 years. The high schools in Jamaica may be either single-sex or co-educational institutions, and many schools follow the traditional English grammar school model used throughout the British West Indies.\nTertiary \u2013 Community colleges; teachers' colleges, with the Mico Teachers' College (now The MICO University College) being the oldest, founded in 1836; the Shortwood Teachers' College (which was once an all-female teacher training institution); vocational training centres, colleges and universities, publicly and privately owned. There are five local universities: the University of the West Indies (Mona Campus); the University of Technology, Jamaica, formerly The College of Art Science and Technology (CAST); the Northern Caribbean University, formerly West Indies College; the University of the Commonwealth Caribbean, formerly the University College of The Caribbean; and the International University of the Caribbean.Additionally, there are many community and teacher training colleges.\nEducation is free from the early childhood to secondary levels. There are also opportunities for those who cannot afford further education in the vocational arena, through the Human Employment and Resource Training-National Training Agency (HEART Trust-NTA) programme, which is opened to all working age national population and through an extensive scholarship network for the various universities.\nStudents are taught Spanish in school from the primary level upwards; about 40\u201345% of educated people in Jamaica knows some form of Spanish.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nJamaica is a mixed economy with both state enterprises and private sector businesses. Major sectors of the Jamaican economy include agriculture, mining, manufacturing, tourism, petroleum refining, financial and insurance services. Tourism and mining are the leading earners of foreign exchange. Half the Jamaican economy relies on services, with half of its income coming from services such as tourism. An estimated 4.3 million foreign tourists visit Jamaica every year. According to the World Bank, Jamaica is an upper-middle income country that, like its Caribbean neighbours, is vulnerable to the effects of climate change, flooding, and hurricanes. In 2018, Jamaica represented the CARICOM Caribbean Community at the G20 and the G7 annual meetings. In 2019 Jamaica reported its lowest unemployment rate in 50 years.Supported by multilateral financial institutions, Jamaica has, since the early 1980s, sought to implement structural reforms aimed at fostering private sector activity and increasing the role of market forces in resource allocation Since 1991, the government has followed a programme of economic liberalisation and stabilisation by removing exchange controls, floating the exchange rate, cutting tariffs, stabilising the Jamaican dollar, reducing inflation and removing restrictions on foreign investment. Emphasis has been placed on maintaining strict fiscal discipline, greater openness to trade and financial flows, market liberalisation and reduction in the size of government. During this period, a large share of the economy was returned to private sector ownership through divestment and privatisation programmes. The free-trade zones at Kingston, Montego Bay and Spanish Town allow duty-free importation, tax-free profits, and free repatriation of export earnings.Jamaica's economy grew strongly after the years of independence, but then stagnated in the 1980s, due to the heavy falls in price of bauxite and fluctuations in the price of agriculture. The financial sector was troubled in 1994, with many banks and insurance companies suffering heavy losses and liquidity problems. According to the Commonwealth Secretariat, \"The government set up the Financial Sector Adjustment Company (Finsac) in January 1997 to assist these banks and companies, providing funds in return for equity, and acquired substantial holdings in banks and insurance companies and related companies,.. but it only exasperated the problem, and brought the country into large external debt. From 2001, once it had restored these banks and companies to financial health, Finsac divested them.\" The Government of Jamaica remains committed to lowering inflation, with a long-term objective of bringing it in line with that of its major trading partners.In 1996 and 1997 there was a decrease in GDP largely due to significant problems in the financial sector and, in 1997, a severe island-wide drought (the worst in 70 years) and hurricane that drastically reduced agricultural production. In 1997 and 1998, nominal GDP was approximately a high of about 8 percent of GDP and then lowered to 4\u00bd percent of GDP in 1999 and 2000. The economy in 1997 was marked by low levels of import growth, high levels of private capital inflows and relative stability in the foreign exchange market.Recent economic performance shows the Jamaican economy is recovering. Agricultural production, an important engine of growth increased to 5.5% in 2001 compared to the corresponding period in 2000, signalling the first positive growth rate in the sector since January 1997. In 2018, Jamaica reported a 7.9% increase in corn, 6.1% increase in plantains, 10.4% increase in bananas, 2.2% increase in pineapples, 13.3% increase in dasheen, 24.9% increase in coconuts, and a 10.6% increase in whole milk production. Bauxite and alumina production increased 5.5% from January to December 1998, compared to the corresponding period in 1997. January's bauxite production recorded a 7.1% increase relative to January 1998 and continued expansion of alumina production through 2009 is planned by Alcoa. Jamaica is the fifth-largest exporter of bauxite in the world, after Australia, China, Brazil and Guinea. The country also exports limestone, of which it holds large deposits. The government is currently implementing plans to increase its extraction.A Canadian company, Carube Copper Corp, has found and confirmed, \"...the existence of at least seven significant Cu/Au porphyry systems (in St. Catherine).\" They have estimated that, \"The porphyry distribution found at Bellas Gate is similar to that found in the Northparkes mining district of New South Wales, Australia (which was) sold to China in 2013 for US$820 million.\" Carube noted that Jamaica's geology, \"... is similar to that of Chile, Argentina and the Dominican Republic \u2013 all productive mining jurisdictions.\" Mining on the sites began in 2017.Tourism, which is the largest foreign exchange earner, showed improvement as well. In 1999 the total visitor arrivals was 2 million, an increase of 100,000 from the previous year. Since 2017, Jamaica's tourism has risen exponentially, rising to 4.3 million average tourists per year. Jamaica's largest tourist markets are from North America, South America, and Europe. In 2017, Jamaica recorded a 91.3% increase in stopover visitors from Southern and Western Europe (and a 41% increase in stopover arrivals from January to September 2017 over the same period from the previous year) with Germany, Portugal and Spain registering the highest percentage gains. In 2018, Jamaica won several World Travel Awards in Portugal winning the \"Chairman's Award for Global Tourism Innovation\", \"Best Tourist Board in the Caribbean\" \"Best Honeymoon Destination\", \"Best Culinary Destination\", \"World's Leading Beach Destination\" and \"World's Leading Cruise Destination\". Two months later, the Travvy Tourism Awards held in New York City, awarded Jamaica's Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett, with the inaugural Chairman's Award for, \"Global Tourism Innovation for the Development of the Global Tourism Resilience and Crisis Management Centre (GTRCM)\". Bartlett has also won the Pacific Travel Writer's Association's award in Germany for the, \"2018 Best Tourism Minister of the Year\".Petrojam, Jamaica's national and only petroleum refinery, is co-owned by the Government of Venezuela. Petrojam, \"..operates a 35,000 barrel per day hydro-skimming refinery, to produce Automotive Diesel Oil; Heavy Fuel Oil; Kerosene/Jet Fuel, Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), Asphalt and Gasoline.\" Customers include the Power industry, Aircraft refuelers, and Local Marketing companies. On 20 February 2019, the Jamaican Government voted to retake ownership of Venezuela's 49% share.Jamaica's agricultural exports are sugar, bananas, cocoa, coconut, molasses oranges, limes, grapefruit, rum, yams, allspice (of which it is the world's largest and \"most exceptional quality\" exporter), and Blue Mountain Coffee which is considered a world renowned gourmet brand.Jamaica has a wide variety of industrial and commercial activities. The aviation industry is able to perform most routine aircraft maintenance, except for heavy structural repairs. There is a considerable amount of technical support for transport and agricultural aviation. Jamaica has a considerable amount of industrial engineering, light manufacturing, including metal fabrication, metal roofing, and furniture manufacturing. Food and beverage processing, glassware manufacturing, software and data processing, printing and publishing, insurance underwriting, music and recording, and advanced education activities can be found in the larger urban areas. The Jamaican construction industry is entirely self-sufficient, with professional technical standards and guidance.Since the first quarter of 2006, the economy of Jamaica has undergone a period of staunch growth. With inflation for the 2006 calendar year down to 6.0% and unemployment down to 8.9%, the nominal GDP grew by an unprecedented 2.9%. An investment programme in island transportation and utility infrastructure and gains in the tourism, mining, and service sectors all contributed this figure. All projections for 2007 show an even higher potential for economic growth with all estimates over 3.0% and hampered only by urban crime and public policies.In 2006, Jamaica became part of the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME) as one of the pioneering members.The global economic downturn had a significant impact on the Jamaican economy for the years 2007 to 2009, resulting in negative economic growth. The government implemented a new Debt Management Initiative, the Jamaica Debt Exchange (JDX) on 14 January 2010. The initiative would see holders of Government of Jamaica (GOJ) bonds returning the high interest earning instruments for bonds with lower yields and longer maturities. The offer was taken up by over 95% of local financial institutions and was deemed a success by the government.Owing to the success of the JDX program, the Bruce Golding-led government was successful in entering into a borrowing arrangement with the IMF on 4 February 2010 for the amount of US$1.27b. The loan agreement is for a period of three years.In April 2014, the Governments of Jamaica and China signed the preliminary agreements for the first phase of the Jamaican Logistics Hub (JLH) \u2013 the initiative that aims to position Kingston as the fourth node in the global logistics chain, joining Rotterdam, Dubai and Singapore, and serving the Americas. The Project, when completed, is expected to provide many jobs for Jamaicans, Economic Zones for multinational companies and much needed economic growth to alleviate the country's heavy debt-to-GDP ratio. Strict adherence to the IMF's refinancing programme and preparations for the JLH has favourably affected Jamaica's credit rating and outlook from the three biggest rating agencies. In 2018, both Moody's and Standard and Poor Credit ratings upgraded Jamaica's ratings to both \"stable and positive\" respectively.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nThe transport infrastructure in Jamaica consists of roadways, railways and air transport, with roadways forming the backbone of the island's internal transport system.\n\n\n==== Roadways ====\n\nThe Jamaican road network consists of almost 21,000 kilometres (13,000 mi) of roads, of which over 15,000 kilometres (9,300 mi) is paved. The Jamaican Government has, since the late 1990s and in cooperation with private investors, embarked on a campaign of infrastructural improvement projects, one of which includes the creation of a system of freeways, the first such access-controlled roadways of their kind on the island, connecting the main population centres of the island. This project has so far seen the completion of 33 kilometres (21 mi) of freeway.\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nRailways in Jamaica no longer enjoy the prominent position they once did, having been largely replaced by roadways as the primary means of transport. Of the 272 kilometres (169 mi) of railway found in Jamaica, only 57 kilometres (35 mi) remain in operation, currently used to transport bauxite. On 13 April 2011, a limited passenger service was resumed between May Pen, Spanish Town and Linstead.\n\n\n==== Air transport ====\n\nThere are three international airports in Jamaica with modern terminals, long runways, and the navigational equipment required to accommodate the large jet aircraft used in modern and air travel: Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston; Ian Fleming International Airport in Boscobel, Saint Mary Parish; and the island's largest and busiest airport, Sir Donald Sangster International Airport in the resort city of Montego Bay. Manley and Sangster International airports are home to the country's national airline, Air Jamaica. In addition there are local commuter airports at Tinson Pen (Kingston), Port Antonio, and Negril, which cater to internal flights only. Many other small, rural centres are served by private airstrips on sugar estates or bauxite mines.\n\n\n==== Ports, shipping and lighthouses ====\n\nOwing to its location in the Caribbean Sea in the shipping lane to the Panama Canal and relative proximity to large markets in North America and emerging markets in Latin America, Jamaica receives much traffic of shipping containers. The container terminal at the Port of Kingston has undergone large expansion in capacity in recent years to handle growth both already realised as well as that which is projected in coming years. Montego Freeport in Montego Bay also handles a variety of cargo like (though more limited than) the Port of Kingston, mainly agricultural products.\nThere are several other ports positioned around the island, including Port Esquivel in St. Catherine (WINDALCO), Rocky Point in Clarendon, Port Kaiser in St. Elizabeth, Port Rhoades in Discovery Bay, Reynolds Pier in Ocho Rios, and Boundbrook Port in Port Antonio.\nTo aid the navigation of shipping, Jamaica operates nine lighthouses. They are maintained by the Port Authority of Jamaica, an agency of the Ministry of Transport and Works.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\n\nJamaica depends on petroleum imports to satisfy its national energy needs. Many test sites have been explored for oil, but no commercially viable quantities have been found. The most convenient sources of imported oil and motor fuels (diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel) are from Mexico and Venezuela.\nJamaica's electrical power is produced by diesel (bunker oil) generators located in Old Harbour. Other smaller power stations (most owned by the Jamaica Public Service Company, the island's electricity provider) support the island's electrical grid including the Hunts Bay Power Station, the Bogue Power Station, the Rockfort Power Station and small hydroelectric plants on the White River, Rio Bueno, Morant River, Black River (Maggotty) and Roaring River. A wind farm, owned by the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica, was established at Wigton, Manchester.Jamaica has successfully operated a SLOWPOKE-2 nuclear reactor of 20 kW capacity since the early 1980s, but there are no plans to expand nuclear power at present.Jamaica imports approximately 80,000 barrels (13,000 m3) of oil energy products per day, including asphalt and lubrication products. Just 20% of imported fuels are used for road transportation, the rest being used by the bauxite industry, electricity generation, and aviation. 30,000 barrels/day of crude imports are processed into various motor fuels and asphalt by the Petrojam Refinery in Kingston.Jamaica produces enormous quantities of drinking alcohol (at least 5% water content), most of which appears to be consumed as beverages, and none used as motor fuel. Facilities exist to refine hydrous ethanol feedstock into anhydrous ethanol (0% water content), but as of 2007, the process appeared to be uneconomic and the production plant was idle.\n\n\n=== Communication ===\n\nJamaica has a fully digital telephone communication system with a mobile penetration of over 95%.The country's two mobile operators \u2013 FLOW Jamaica (formerly LIME, bMobile and Cable and Wireless Jamaica) and Digicel Jamaica have spent millions in network upgrades and expansion. The newest operator, Digicel was granted a licence in 2001 to operate mobile services in the newly liberalised telecom market that had once been the sole domain of the incumbent FLOW (then Cable and Wireless Jamaica) monopoly. Digicel opted for the more widely used GSM wireless system, while a past operator, Oceanic (which became Claro Jamaica and later merged with Digicel Jamaica in 2011) opted for the CDMA standard. FLOW (formerly \"LIME\" \u2013 pre-Columbus Communications merger) which had begun with TDMA standard, subsequently upgraded to GSM in 2002, decommissioned TDMA in 2006 and only utilised that standard until 2009 when LIME launched its 3G network. Both operators currently provide islandwide coverage with HSPA+ (3G) technology. Currently, only Digicel offers LTE to its customers whereas FLOW Jamaica has committed to launching LTE in the cities of Kingston and Montego Bay, places where Digicel's LTE network is currently only found in, in short order.\nA new entrant to the Jamaican communications market, Flow Jamaica, laid a new submarine cable connecting Jamaica to the United States. This new cable increases the total number of submarine cables connecting Jamaica to the rest of the world to four. Cable and Wireless Communications (parent company of LIME) acquired the company in late 2014 and replaced their brand LIME with FLOW. FLOW Jamaica currently has the most broadband and cable subscribers on the island and also has 1 million mobile subscribers, second to Digicel (which had, at its peak, over 2 million mobile subscriptions on its network).\nDigicel entered the broadband market in 2010 by offering WiMAX broadband, capable of up to 6 Mbit/s per subscriber. To further their broadband share post-LIME/FLOW merger in 2014, the company introduced a new broadband service called Digicel Play, which is Jamaica's second FTTH offering (after LIME's deployment in selected communities in 2011). It is currently only available in the parishes of Kingston, Portmore and St. Andrew. It offers speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s down, 100 Mbit/s up via a pure fibre optic network. Digicel's competitor, FLOW Jamaica, has a network consisting of ADSL, Coaxial and Fibre to the Home (inherited from LIME) and only offers speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. FLOW has committed to expanding its Fibre offering to more areas in order to combat Digicel's entrance into the market.\nIt was announced that the Office and Utilities Regulations (OUR), Ministry of Science, Technology, Energy and Mining (MSTEM) and the Spectrum Management Authority (SMA) have given approval for another mobile operator licence in January 2016. The identity of this entrant was ascertained on 20 May 2016, when the Jamaican Government named the new carrier as Symbiote Investments Limited operating under the name Caricel. The company will focus on 4G LTE data offerings and will first go live in the Kingston Metropolitan Area and will expand to the rest of Jamaica thereafter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndex of Jamaica-related articles\nList of Jamaicans\nOutline of Jamaica\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGovernmental detailsGovernment of Jamaica\nJamaica at the Royal Family website\nOfficial website of the Jamaica Information Service\nThe Cabinet Office of the Government of Jamaica\nChief of State and Cabinet MembersGeneral information\"Jamaica\".

          "I love this place! Its very beautiful and tranquil with lots of tropical flora and fauna. It is location on either side of the A3 and if you walk across the street to the east side of the road, it leads to the serene and warm waters of Tom\u2019s River, which was especially great",
          "A beautiful oasis in the hills. On one side of the road are the beautifully manicured gardens and on the other the cool waters of the river. The drive to this attraction was quite scenic and not very far from the City of Kingston. A must do if you are in the area.",

        "wiki": "For the pier in Kingston upon Hull, see Victoria Pier, Kingston upon HullThe Victoria  Pier was a pier in the seaside resort of Colwyn Bay, Wales. Despite dismantlement since May 2018, much of the metalwork remains and retains the legal status of a grade-II listed structure. Plans for a partial re-build in 2019 have been made by the pier's owner, Conwy County Borough Council.\nDesigned by Maynall and Littlewoods the pier opened in 1900 and was extended in 1903 to the length of 227m. The first two pavilions built on the pier burnt down along with a bijou theatre. The third pavilion was built in 1934 and significantly extended and altered in the 1970s to allow for nightclub and amusement arcade entertainments. From the late 1980s the pier began to decline with the seaward portion of the pier being closed due to its poor state of repair. The condition of the pier and the entertainments continued to decline until 2008 when it closed permanently. A long-standing legal wrangle between the previous private owner and the council ensued. By 2013 the pier was in danger of collapse and a local community group attempted to secure funding for a rebuilding programme which failed. In 2017, part of the pier collapsed onto the beach below, dangerous sections of the pier were dismantled and a new plan to create a shortened pier were agreed upon by the council and a charitable trust representing the community interest.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nDesigned by Maynall & Littlewoods of Manchester, Colwyn Bay's Victoria Pier was one of the later British piers to be built, with construction starting in June 1899 by the Salford firm of William Brown & Sons. Many of the pier's components were pre-fabricated, and manufactured by the Widnes Iron Foundry. Its official opening was on 1 June 1900, when the architect, Mr. Littlewood, handed a golden key to the pier's owners. As first constructed, the pier was just 316 ft (96m) long and 40 ft (12m) wide, comprising a timber promenade deck with seating and railings along its length, and a 2,500 seat pavilion in the Moorish Revival style. The pavilion was set to the right of the deck, with a walkway allowing access to the pier-head to the left. The pavilion's main entrance was flanked on one side by a flower shop and, on the other, by a coffee lounge and cake shop. Inside, the pavilion boasted a large balcony which extended around three sides of the auditorium and a full orchestra pit. In 1903, the Victoria Pier Company decided to extend the neck to a length of 750 ft (227m) to facilitate outdoor theatrical performances. The pier featured intricate cast iron balustrades, manufactured by the Widnes Iron Foundry, and similar balustrade designs can be found at Mumbles Pier, and formerly at Grand Pier, Weston-super-Mare and Morecambe's Central and West End Piers.\n\n\n== First and second pavilion buildings ==\n\nA 600-seat 'Bijou' theatre was built at the pier head in 1917 for the purposes of light entertainment. The first pavilion building was completely destroyed by fire in 1922. The Victoria Pier Company suffered serious financial difficulties after the fire. As a result, Colwyn Bay Urban District Council purchased the pier and work began immediately to rebuild the pavilion. In July 1923, the second pavilion was opened, at a cost of \u00a345,000. Unfortunately, disaster struck again on 16 May 1933, when the second pavilion was destroyed by fire, followed, on 28 July 1933, by a fire that destroyed the Bijou Theatre.\n\n\n== Third pavilion ==\nColwyn Bay Urban District Council set about rebuilding, and the third pavilion was opened on Tuesday 8 May 1934 at a cost of \u00a316,000, but the Bijou Theatre was never rebuilt. The pavilion was designed by architect Stanley Davenport Adshead, and the rebuilding also involved constructing a cast iron covered walkway, extending to the pavilion, as well as a bandstand in the south-east corner of the pavilion section of the pier. Increasing usage of the pier led the council to introduce a twopenny toll (free after 6pm) in 1936, which included the price of a deckchair and listening to the band. The purpose of the toll, said the council, was to prevent 'indiscriminate lounging on the pier'. In the pavilion, Ernest Binns presented 'The Colwyn Follies', with seats at two shillings, and one shilling and sixpence.\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, the pier began a period of gentle decline. In 1953, the pavilion's tearoom, which had been a year-round meeting place for forty years, started closing for the winter. In 1956, the line-up of entertainment in the pavilion was as follows: Monday: bingo, Tuesday: wrestling, Wednesday: amateur talent show, Thursday: old-time dancing, Friday: popular dance, Saturday: young people's dance. 1958 saw the end of the summer variety shows in the pavilion. In 1959, the variety shows were replaced by a small orchestra of six musicians; over 20,000 people paid nine pence each that year to attend the afternoon concerts, with another 10,000 attending in the evenings.\nBy 1961, falling audiences forced the council to reduce the orchestra to three musicians. 1962 saw the council admit defeat for live performances and install pre-recorded orchestral music. The pier saw minor refurbishment and repairs in 1964, and a small amusement arcade was built at the seaward end. Both the amusements and the bandstand were removed in the 1970s.\n\n\n== 1970s modernisation ==\nIn 1968, ownership of the pier passed from the local council to Entam Leisure, a division of Trust House Forte, for just \u00a359,000. Entam Leisure decided that the pier needed modernisation to prosper. This involved building the Golden Goose Amusements in a large new modern building on the pier neck, the opening of the Golden Fry Restaurant in the old tearooms, and the conversion of the pavilion into the Dixieland Showbar. As part of this work, the ornate Moorish toll booths at the entrance to the pier were removed to create an open aspect to the pier entrance. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Dixieland Showbar hosted many live concerts, featuring groups/acts such as Motorhead, The Damned, Siouxsie & The Banshees, Elvis Costello, Slade, The Specials, Cockney Rejects and Black Flag. In 1979, the pier was sold again, this time to Rhyl-based leisure operators, Parker's Leisure. They converted the Dixieland Showbar into CJ's Nightclub and built an extension onto the front of the Golden Goose Amusements, to create a larger entrance/amusements area.\n\n\n== Decline ==\n1987 saw the entire seaward end of the pier being closed to the general public, on grounds of safety. In 1991, Parkers Leisure closed down their amusement and disco businesses on the pier. Vandals attacked the pier after the closure, smashed most of the windows in the former Golden Goose Amusements, and broke into the pavilion to set fire to it. In 1993, Colwyn Borough Council gave permission to demolish the pavilion and seaward end of the pier, but the work was never carried out.\nAugust 1994 saw new hope for the beleaguered pier, as marine engineer Mike Paxman bought it and stated he intended to restore it to its former glory. Paxman carried out work to repair the pier's decking and subdivided the former Golden Goose Amusements building into several smaller business, including a bar, cafe, shops and amusements, which opened on 1 April 1996. He also intended to reopen the pavilion as a nightclub, but did not have sufficient funding to do so. During this time, the pier featured prominently in the Hetty Wainthropp Investigates episode \"Childsplay\", broadcast in January 1998. Paxman eventually put the pier up for sale in 2003, by advertising it on auction site eBay but it failed to sell.\nOn 11 December 2003, the pier was bought by Cambridgeshire businessman Steve Hunt, who sold his house to fund the \u00a3100,000 purchase price. He reopened the pier on Saturday 17 January 2004 and announced his intention to gradually restore the decaying structure. He has a particular interest in restoring the pier's Art Deco pavilion, built in 1933.\nIn 2008, the entrance building housed a fishing tackle shop, cafe, bar (which was extended, refurbished and renamed 'Oddities' for the 2008 season) and a selection of amusement machines. The pavilion was home to various special events, such as the successful annual art exhibition. A small section of the pier neck was open to the public, mainly housing an outdoor seating area for the bar. The main area of the pier neck was closed to the general public, but was open for fishing, subject to the purchase of a permit.\n\n\n== Closure ==\n\nThe pier closed at the end of July 2008, as a result of a bankruptcy order made against the owner, Steve Hunt, by Conwy County Borough Council in respect of unpaid business rates. Hunt attempted to have the bankruptcy order annulled but with no success and the pier remained closed to the public.\nA documentary, entitled Pier Pressure, was shown on BBC2 Wales in December 2008; the film followed Steve Hunt's attempts to rescue and restore the Victoria Pier over a one-year period.\n\n\n== Regeneration attempts ==\n \nIn 2012, Conwy County Borough Council bought the Pier from the Receivers, Royce Peeling Green and intended to grant a lease to a local community group if they were successful. In late March 2012, Conwy Borough Council announced they would put in a request for lottery funding to be used to save the pier. However, the request was denied and the structure still lay in a bad state, with fencing blocking people from being able to go under the pier for health and safety reasons. In 2013, the Pier regeneration had a new lease of life, thanks to a local community group, who formed a third sector company called Colwyn Bay Shore Thing. The company, in partnership with the local authority, were successful in a Round 1 grant application to the Heritage Lottery fund. However, it was denied in Round 2 in 2015. The Lottery Fund stated that a large part of the denial was the council's refusal to support or back the Round 2 application on cost grounds. After the refusal, the council announced they were going ahead with plans to delist and demolish the pier. Following a huge public outcry, CADW Welsh Heritage refused planning permission for demolition. \n\n\n== Phase one of Restoration Plans ==\nThe final 45 metres of the seaward end were destroyed in a series of collapses, first on the 1 February 2017, and the second on the 23 February. \nOn 2 March 2017, a council meeting agreed to support phase 1, which includes an initial shortened pier and new pavilion put forward by the Colwyn Victoria Pier Trust. The dangerous seaward section of the pier, representing around half of its length, was removed in March 2017. An area of decking to the south of the pavilion, part of which was also in a state of collapse, was also dismantled at this time. The council then applied for planning consent to remove the remaining buildings and dismantle and store the pier, with the long term aim in working with the Victoria Pier Trust to reinstate the listed structure in the future. \nDismantling of the pavilion began in February 2018 and the pier had been dismantled (and, in part, stored) by May 2018. The final piece of the pier was dismantled on 15 May 2018 with the final site clearance completed in June 2018. Planning has now been passed for phase 1 of the restoration work to begin. Conwy Council will be rebuilding the 1st part of the pier, of an area exactly covering the former site of the Golden Goose amusements building: a length of approximately 40 metres. Following the completion of this stage, in partnership with Conwy Council, the Victoria Pier Trust will apply for grants to rebuild phase 2, which will be to rebuild the remaining part of the Pier, restored from storage. A new Pavilion, however, will be built and the design will be available for public consultation. Phase one of the Truncated Pier will be built by October 2019. Contractors for the restoration work and rebuilding are currently being selected and the finances have already been secured. The Art Deco murals created by Eric Ravilious and Mary Adshead in 1934, from inside the pavilion, have all been successfully removed and are currently awaiting restoration.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nGeoffrey Edwards Colwyn Bay 1934-1974 Colwyn Borough Council 1984.",

        "wiki": "Spanish Town is the capital and the largest town in the parish of St. Catherine in the historic county of Middlesex, Jamaica. It was the Spanish and British capital of Jamaica from 1534 until 1872. The town is home to numerous memorials, the national archives, and one of the oldest Anglican churches outside England (the others are in Virginia, Maryland, and Bermuda).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Spanish settlement of Villa de la Vega was founded by governor Francisco de Garay in 1534 as the capital of the colony. Later, it was also called Santiago de la Vega or St. Jago de la Vega. Indigenous Taino had been living in the area for approximately a millennium before this, but this was the first European habitation on the south of the island.\nWhen the English conquered Jamaica in 1655, they renamed the settlement as Spanish Town. Since the town was badly damaged during the conquest, Port Royal took on many administrative roles and functioned as an unofficial capital during the beginning of English rule. By the time Port Royal was devastated by an earthquake in 1692, Spanish Town had been rebuilt and was again functioning as the capital. Spanish Town remained the capital until 1872, when the seat of the colony was moved to Kingston.\nKingston had been founded in the aftermath of the 1692 earthquake. By 1755, serious rivalry from lobbyists caused increasing speculation about the continued suitability of Spanish Town as the capital. In 1836, Governor Lionel Smith observed that \"the capital was in ruins, with no commercial, manufacturing and agricultural concern in operation.\" To worsen the situation, following the Morant Bay Rebellion of 1865, Sir John Peter Grant ordered the removal of the capital in 1872 to Kingston. As a larger port, it had come to be considered the natural capital of the island.  After the seat of government was relocated, Spanish Town lost much of its economic and cultural vitality.\n\n\n== Points of interest ==\nBuilt on the west bank of the Rio Cobre, the town lies thirteen miles from Kingston on the main road.  Its history was shaped by two significant colonial periods: Spanish rule from 1534\u20131655 and the English from 1655\u20131872. After that the capital was relocated to Kingston. The Anglican Church took over the 16th century cathedral.\nThe historic architecture and street names mark the colonial history, such as Red Church and White Church streets, symbolic of the Spanish chapels of the red and white cross, as well as Monk Street, in reference to the monastery that once stood nearby. Nugent and Manchester streets were named for the British Colonial Governors, George Nugent and William Montagu, 5th Duke of Manchester. King Street runs past the King's House, the governor's residence, and Constitution Street, near to the Square, refers to the island's former administrative centre. Regency buildings in the town centre include the Rodney Memorial flanked by two guns from the French ship Ville de Paris (1764), and the fa\u00e7ade of the Old King's House, which was the residence of the governor until 1872.\n\n\n=== Old Iron Bridge ===\n\nSpanish Town is the site of an early cast-iron bridge, designed by Thomas Wilson and manufactured by Walker and Company of Rotherham, England. Spanning the Rio Cobre, the bridge was erected in 1801 at a cost of \u00a34,000. Its four arched ribs are supported on massive masonry abutments. After the abutments deteriorated, endangering the structure, it was listed in the 1998 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund.A restoration project began in 2004, with funding provided by American Express through World Monuments Fund. Progress was slow until 2008, when a renewed restoration effort was made. A first phase of restoration was completed in April 2010, when the repair of the abutments allowed the bridge to be reopened for the public. More recently, violence in the area has prevented the bridge from achieving the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Today ==\nIn 2009 the population of Spanish Town was estimated to be about 160,000. The population of Spanish Town, like the rest of the St. Catherine, has been growing rapidly.\nIt is sometimes referred to colloquially as \"Spain\" or \"Prison Oval\" within Jamaica. The latter nickname is a reference to the cricket pitch or oval located just outside the St. Catherine District Prison, where some inmates can get a limited view of the sport through their cell windows. Association football is also played at the Prison Oval; Rivoli United F.C. is the major team.\nThe town had one of the first Spanish cathedrals to be built in the New World, constructed around 1525. Many Christian denominations have churches or meeting halls in the town, including a Roman Catholic church and Wesleyan, Baptist and Seventh-day Adventist chapels. There is also a mosque.Standing untouched in character is a historic alms-house, public hospital, and a penal institution built in the eighteenth century. The town contains a factory that manufactures dyes from logwood, a salt factory, and a rice processing plant. In the neighbourhood are five large sugar estates, a milk condensary, and a large textile mill.\n\n\n== Government and infrastructure ==\nThe Rio Cobre Juvenile Correctional Centre of the Department of Correctional Services, Jamaica is located in Spanish Town.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nSpanish Town is on the main A1 (Kingston to Lucea) and A2 (Spanish Town to Savanna-la-Mar) roads. It is well served by buses, mini buses and taxis, which operate from the Spanish Town Transport Hub.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe now disused Spanish Town railway station formerly provided access to four lines:\n\nKingston to Montego Bay\nSpanish Town to Ewarton\nBog Walk to Port Antonio\nLinstead to New WorksThe station opened in 1845 and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica's railways abruptly ceased.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nBlackbeard (Edward Teach), British pirate\nYohan Blake, sprinter, attended school in Spanish Town\nDavian Clarke, sprinter\nChronixx, singer\nChevelle Franklyn, gospel reggae singer, born in Tawes Pen, Spanish Town\nCornel Chin-Sue, Footballer\nRajiv Maragh, Jockey\nUriah Hall, mixed martial artist, born in Spanish Town\nAndrew Holness, politician, Prime Minister of Jamaica\nGrace Jones, singer and actress, born in Spanish Town\nDiana King, reggae singer, born in Spanish Town\nKoffee, reggae singer/rapper, born in Spanish Town\nJermaine Lawson, cricketer\nAmelia Lewsham, \"White Negress\" born in Spanish Town in the 1740s\nPrince Far I, reggae deejay, born in Spanish Town\nBunny Shaw, Jamaican woman footballer\nAlfred Valentine, cricketer\nMicheal Ward, British actor, born in Spanish Town\nPrecious Wilson, soul singer, born in Spanish Town\n\n\n== Notable incidents ==\nThe famous pirate Calico Jack and his crew were hanged in Santiago de la Vega in 1720 following a trial conducted by the governor, Sir Nicholas Lawes.\nDanish singer Natasja Saad died in a car crash near the city on 24 June 2007.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe band The Spanishtonians, also known as The Spanish Town Skabeats, best known for their hit song \"Stop That Train\", are named after the city.The location has also been referenced by Charlotte Bront\u00eb in her 1847 novel Jane Eyre, in which Mr Rochester's wife, Bertha Mason had originated from Spanish Town. This location and the characterisation of Bertha was further explored by Jean Rhys in her 1966 retelling of Jane Eyre, Wide Sargasso Sea.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\nJames Robertson, Gone is the Ancient Glory, Spanish Town Jamaica 1534\u20132000, Kingston, Jamaica: 2005.\nParish Information",

        "wiki": "The Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds (often shortened to Soo Greyhounds) are a major junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League. The Greyhounds play home games at the GFL Memorial Gardens. The present team was founded in 1962 as a team in the Northern Ontario Hockey Association. The Greyhounds name has been used by several ice hockey teams based in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, since 1919.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nThe first Greyhounds team formed in 1919, playing in the now defunct Upper-Peninsula League. The team's coach was George MacNamara. He suggested the team be called the Greyhounds since, \"a greyhound is much faster than a wolf.\" That reference was to the already established rival club, the Sudbury Wolves.A couple of seasons later, the Greyhounds switched to the Northern Ontario Hockey Association Senior \"A\" division. The team won the Senior A championship in 1921, 1923, 1924 and 1925. The 1924 Greyhounds also won the Allan Cup, becoming the only team from Sault Ste. Marie to do so. In October 1925, the club received an offer from New York to play as the Knickerbockers in the Eastern Amateur Hockey League. The Greyhounds joined the Central Amateur Hockey Association, a division of the United States Amateur Hockey Association for the 1925\u201326 season. After the season, several players joined the professional ranks and the team folded.\nIn 1929, a junior Greyhounds team was organized, competing in the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League. The juniors won the league championship four consecutive years from 1928 to 1931, and added a fifth title in 1942. Junior hockey in Sault Ste. Marie came to an abrupt end in 1945, when the Gouin Street Arena was destroyed by fire.\nThe senior Greyhounds team was revived in 1948. The new team played out of a temporary home at Pullar Stadium, in Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan, U.S.A., until the Memorial Gardens opened in 1949. The senior Greyhounds won the NOHA championship four times, in 1950, 1951, 1952 and 1955. This team folded, along with the league, after the 1958\u201359 season.\n\n\n== Modern era ==\nThe current Greyhounds Junior A franchise was founded in 1962 as a member of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League. The team's founders were Angelo Bumbacco, Lloyd Prokop, Phil Suraci, Pat Esposito and Bill Kelly. The Greyhounds played for ten seasons in the NOJHL. They were extremely successful, never having a losing season, and winning the league championship three times. In 1972, the Greyhounds entered the Ontario Hockey Association as a Major Junior A expansion team. The original directors were joined by Frank Caputo and Frank Sarlo.\n\n\n=== Wayne Gretzky 1977\u201378 ===\nIn 1977, the Sault Ste.Marie Greyhounds picked a 16-year-old Wayne Gretzky, standing at 5 ft 8 in (173 cm) and weighing 155 pounds (70 kg), with the third pick in the Ontario Midget Draft. He was still small in stature, but would have a big impact on the game.\nGretzky requested to wear # 9 for his idol Gordie Howe, but that number was already taken by teammate Brian Gualazzi. Gretzky then chose # 14 instead. After a few games, coach Muzz MacPherson suggested wearing two nines would be better than one. From that season on, Gretzky always wore the legendary # 99.In 63 games that year, he set the Greyhounds all-time record, scoring 70 goals and had 112 assists for a total of 182 points. Gretzky would have won the scoring title, except for a 192-point season by Bobby Smith. Gretzky was awarded the Emms Family Award as the rookie of the year, and the William Hanley Trophy as most gentlemanly player.\n\n\n=== Memorial Cup, 1985 ===\nAfter winning the OHL championship, the Greyhounds travelled to Shawinigan, Quebec to compete in the Memorial Cup tournament, for the national junior hockey title. The Greyhounds played against the host team Shawinigan Cataractes, the QMJHL champion Verdun Junior Canadiens, and the WHL champion Prince Albert Raiders.\nThe Greyhounds were led by future NHLers, Jeff Beukeboom, Chris Felix, Derek King, Wayne Presley, Bob Probert and Rob Zettler. Leading scorers in the regular season were Wayne Groulx, Graeme Bonar and Sault Ste. Marie native Mike Oliverio.\nThe Greyhounds won the first game on May 11 in Shawinigan versus the home team, by a score 4-3, in front of 3,276 fans. Televising games from the Ar\u00e9na Jacques Plante in Shawinigan proved difficult due to roof support pillars around the ice surface. After two games in Shawinigan, the remainder of the tournament was played in the Centre Marcel Dionne in Drummondville, Quebec.\nThe Greyhounds won their first game in Drummondville 6-3 over Verdun, with two goals from Derek King. Their first loss of the tournament came in game three, losing 8-6 to the Prince Albert Raiders. With the loss, the Cataractes, Raiders and Greyhounds would all finish the round-robin with two wins and a loss. Shawinigan earned a spot in the finals on best goals for and against difference, with Sault Ste. Marie and Prince Albert to have a rematch in the semi-final game. On May 16, the Greyhounds lost again to the Raiders.\n\n\n=== Memorial Cup, 1991 ===\nThe Greyhounds season of 1990\u201391 marked an incredible turnaround from seventh place the season before, to finishing first place and winning the Emms division. General manager Sherwood Bassin put together pieces for coach Ted Nolan to win. Bassin was awarded Bill Long Award for distinguished service to the OHL, was named both the OHL Executive of the Year, and the CHL Executive of the Year in 1991.The Greyhounds swept both playoff series and earned a second round bye to reach the OHL finals against the defending champions, the Oshawa Generals. The J. Ross Robertson Cup finals had many subplots due to the big trade between the clubs in the previous season. Added to the mix was Joe Busillo, an overager picked up from Oshawa, who won the Memorial Cup with the Generals the previous year. Fans from the Soo were still very bitter towards Eric Lindros, who was now the captain of the Generals. The Soo crowd loudly jeered Lindros every time he was on the ice during the championship series. The Greyhounds upset the heavily favoured defending champions in a six-game series, winning the last game on home ice.\nThe Greyhounds were led in scoring by Colin Miller, Tony Iob, Trevor Koopmans, and future NHLers Adam Foote and tough guys Bob Boughner, and Denny Lambert. Other members to move onto the NHL included Drew Bannister, Ralph Intranuovo, Brad Tiley and goaltenders Kevin Hodson and Mike Lenarduzzi.\nThe 1991 Memorial Cup was hosted by the QMJHL in Quebec City at the Colis\u00e9e de Qu\u00e9bec. Their opponents would be the WHL champion Spokane Chiefs, and the QMJHL finalists Drummondville Voltigeurs and the champion Chicoutimi Saguen\u00e9ens. The Greyhounds did not win a game in the tournament, but gained valuable experience for next season.\n\n\n=== Memorial Cup, 1992 ===\nThe 1991\u201392 Greyhounds repeated as winners of the Emms division. Sault Ste. Marie earned a first round bye in the playoffs, then defeated the Kitchener Rangers and Niagara Falls Thunder to return to the league finals. The Greyhounds won their third J. Ross Robertson Cup by defeating their northern counterparts, the North Bay Centennials in a seven-game series.\nThe Greyhounds were led by captain Rick Kowalsky, and in scoring by Jarrett Reid's 53 goals and also had two players with 100 point seasons, Colin Miller and Ralph Intranuovo. The Soo also gained a midseason boost and more toughness, acquiring future NHLer Chris Simon in a trade with the Ottawa 67's.\nThe 1992 Memorial Cup was hosted by the WHL in Seattle, Washington at the Seattle Center Coliseum. Their opponents would be the WHL champion Kamloops Blazers, the QMJHL champion Verdun Coll\u00e8ge Fran\u00e7ais, and the host Seattle Thunderbirds.\nThe Greyhounds reversed their fortunes of the previous Memorial Cup, winning all three games of the round-robin, advancing directly to the tournament finals. Their opponent in the finals would be the Kamloops Blazers. The Greyhounds came back from an early 3-0 deficit 15 minutes into the game to tie the score at 3-3. Kamloops scored early in the third period for a 4-3 lead. Chris Simon then tied the game for Sault Ste. Marie with four minutes remaining to play. The game looked to be headed for overtime, until Kamloops' Zac Boyer scored on a breakaway with 14.6 seconds remaining to seal the victory for the Blazers.\n\n\n=== Memorial Cup, 1993 ===\nIn the 1992\u201393, the Greyhounds won their third consecutive Emms division title. They narrowly beat out the Detroit Junior Red Wings by having more wins in the regular season despite both teams earning 81 points. The OHL revived the idea of a Super Series from six years previous to determine which team would host the Memorial Cup of 1993. The Greyhounds assured themselves of a third consecutive trip to the Memorial Cup, by sweeping the series versus the Leyden division champion Peterborough Petes. Jarret Reid led Sault Ste. Marie in scoring through the playoffs, with 19 goals and 16 assists in 18 games.\nAfter the Super Series ended, the regular playoffs started. Sault Ste. Marie earned the first round bye, then defeated the Owen Sound Platers and the Junior Red Wings to reach the finals against the Petes. This time, the Petes prevailed 4 games to 1, spoiling the Greyhounds chances of a third consecutive J. Ross Robertson Cup. Joining the Greyhounds and Petes in the Memorial Cup would be the WHL champion Swift Current Broncos and the QMJHL champion Laval Titan.\nThe Greyhounds and the Petes both finished the Memorial Cup round-robin with two wins and a loss. Sault Ste. Marie earned a berth in the finals by having beaten the Petes in the round robin. The two teams would meet again in the tournament finals, playing in front a hometown crowd of 4,757 spectators at the Memorial Gardens on May 23. Sault Ste. Marie led 3-0 after the first period, and held on to win their first Memorial Championship, beating the Petes 4-2. The victory party continued on Queen St. late into the evening.\n\n\n=== Recent years ===\nThe Greyhounds followed up their Memorial Cup winning season with a strong 1993\u201394 campaign finishing second place in the division. The Soo reached the semi-finals, but lost the Junior Red Wings in six games. After the season, coach Ted Nolan departed for the Hartford Whalers.\nThe following 1994\u201395 season, the Greyhounds finished last place in the league during a rebuilding season. In attempt to generate more sales, the Greyhounds redesigned their logo. It proved to be unpopular with the fans, and the team discontinued its use after the 1998\u201399 season, and went back to the classic logo.\nCentre Joe Thornton was the 1995\u201396 OHL rookie of the year and was the first player in the history of the franchise to be drafted first overall in the NHL Entry Draft. He was selected by the Boston Bruins.\nIn the 2001\u201302 season, former Greyhound defenceman Craig Hartsburg took over as head coach after coaching stints in the NHL. Hartsburg was named the OHL coach of the year that season, then left the team to join the coaching staff of the Philadelphia Flyers.\nReplacing Hartsburg was former Greyhound netminder, and part-owner of the team, John Vanbiesbrouck. Vanbiesbrouck was forced to resign as coach during the season as a result of racist comments he had made about team captain, Trevor Daley. Hartsburg returned as coach midway through the 2004\u201305 season.\nAfter playing at the Sault Memorial Gardens from 1962 to 2006, the Greyhounds moved into their new home, the Steelback Centre, for the 2006\u201307 season. In June 2008, the arena was renamed The Essar Centre, following the purchase of naming rights by Essar Steel Algoma.\nIn the 2007\u201308 OHL season, the Greyhounds had their best regular season since 1985, going 44\u201318\u20132\u20134, with a long undefeated streak to begin the year. The Greyhounds also had their longest post season run since 1994, making it to the conference finals before losing to the Kitchener Rangers in five games.\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, assistant coach Denny Lambert assumed head coaching duties after Craig Hartsburg left to become head coach of the NHL's Ottawa Senators. Assistant coach Toots Kovacs also left the team and was replaced by Mike Stapleton and Nick Warriner. The Greyhounds missed the playoffs for the first time since 2004.\nAfter several trades in the organization have shown a shift to rebuilding the team, Dave Torrie (General Manager), took over head coaching duties with the firing of Denny Lambert in January 2011. Later that same year Dave Torrie was also relieved of his duties and replaced with Kyle Dubas as general manager. The fans also welcomed back Mike Stapleton as new Head Coach for next season, but was fired and replaced on December 3, 2012 by Sheldon Keefe.\nAfter the 2014\u201315 OHL season, the Greyhounds had taken the Hamilton Spectator Trophy while setting a franchise record in regular season points. During the 2015 playoffs, the Greyhounds had their run ended by Connor McDavid and the Erie Otters in the Western Conference Finals. After one of the teams best seasons, head coach Sheldon Keefe had signed with the Toronto Marlies of the AHL.\nOn July 10, 2015, Drew Bannister was named head coach of the Greyhounds. He would leave after the 2017\u201318 season to become the head coach of the San Antonio Rampage in the AHL. Bannister had led the Hounds to an overall 136\u201350\u201313\u20135 record, two West Division titles, and was named OHL and CHL coach of the year in 2018.\n\n\n== Championships ==\nWhile in the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League, the Greyhounds won the McNamara Trophy as playoff champions in 1967, 1970, and 1972. The Greyhounds were also regular season champions six times and playoff finalists 4 times.\nThe Greyhounds also joined the Oshawa Generals and Peterborough Petes as the only OHL teams to make three consecutive appearances in the Memorial Cup. Since joining the OHL, Sault Ste. Marie has won a total of 8 division titles, five Hamilton Spectator Trophy titles, three J. Ross Robertson Cup titles, and one Memorial Cup title.\n\n\n== Coaches ==\nTerry Crisp was twice voted the OHL Coach of the Year, winning the Matt Leyden Trophy in 1982-83 and 1984-85. Craig Hartsburg won the award in 2001-02. Most recently Drew Bannister won the award in 2017-18.\nList of coaches with multiple seasons in parentheses.\n\n\n== Players ==\nSince Sault Ste. Marie joined the OHA in 1972, the Greyhounds have sent 77 alumni onto play in the NHL. Three of those (Paul Coffey, Ron Francis and Wayne Gretzky) have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\n\n=== Select recent NHL draft picks ===\n2013 - Darnell Nurse, 1st Round, (7th overall) EDM; Tyler Ganly, 6th Round (156th overall) CAR; Mitchell Dempsey, 7th Round (210th overall) BOS\n2014 - Jared McCann, 1st Round, (24th overall) VAN; Brandon Halverson, 2nd Round, (59th overall) NYR; Michael Bunting, 4th Round, (117th overall) ARI; Kyle Jenkins, 7th Round, (87th overall) CAR\n2015 - Zachary Senyshyn, 1st Round (15th overall) BOS; Blake Speers, 3rd Round (67th overall) NJ; Colton White, 4th Round (97th overall) NJ; Gustav Bouramman, 7th Round (201st overall) MIN\n2016 - Boris Katchouk, 2nd Round (44th overall) TB; Jack Kopacka, 4th Round (93rd overall) ANA; Tim Gettinger, 5th Round (141st overall) NYR\n2017 - Morgan Frost, 1st Round (27th overall) PHI; Conor Timmins, 2nd Round (32nd overall) COL; Matthew Villalta, 3rd Round (72nd overall) LA\n2018 - Barrett Hayton, 1st Round (5th overall); Rasmus Sandin, 1st Round (29th overall) TOR; Mac Hollowell, 4th Round (118th overall) TOR\n2019 - Jacob LeGuerrier, 5th Round (126th overall) MTLRetired numbers\n\n\n=== Award winners ===\n\n\n=== Hockey Hall of Fame members ===\nThere are six members of the Hockey Hall of Fame that have played for a team known as the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. Bill Cook and Bun Cook played for the Greyhounds of the Northern Ontario Hockey Association (NOHA) between 1921\u20131925. Bill Cook was inducted in 1952, while Bun wasn't inducted until 1995 in the defunct Veteran category. Tony Esposito played for the Greyhounds of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League (NOJHL) during the 1962\u201363 season, and was inducted into the Hall in 1988.\nThe current junior Greyhounds have three alumni inducted into Hockey Hall of Fame.

Black and silver trim were added in the late 1980s, as well as four stars above the logo. Sault Ste. Marie has used their classic red circle logo with the running greyhound for all but three seasons of their existence.\nFrom 1996 to 1999 the Greyhounds redesigned their logo (inset right), to what became known by fans as the \"Ugly Dog\" or \"Snoopy\" logo. Due to public backlash and a fan petition for its removal, the team discontinued its use and went back to the classic logo. For the 2009-10 switchover to the Reebok Edge jersey system, the Greyhounds returned to their classic jerseys from the 1970s and early 80s, including removing black & silver from their logo. In 2013, the team switched to jerseys identical to those of the NHL's Detroit Red Wings.\nThe Greyhounds have used third jerseys since 2006, when the team introduced a black third jersey with a \"Soo Greyhounds\" script logo, as well as red, white, and grey trim, and stars around the waist. The jersey was slightly updated for its 2010 return after the Reebok Edge switchover, but was completely replaced in 2013 in favour of a simpler red third jersey with the running greyhound as the main logo, and a white nameplate with red lettering.\n\n\n== Arenas ==\nThe first home of the Greyhounds from 1919 to 1945 was Gouin Street Arena. The arena had wooden benches for 1,000 spectators. It was destroyed by fire in 1945. An outdoor rink at Pullar Stadium in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan was used until a new indoor facility was built. The Greyhounds returned to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan again in 1979, playing for about a month at Taffy Abel Arena on the campus of Lake Superior State University due to emergency roof repairs at the Gardens.\n\n\n=== Sault Memorial Gardens ===\n\nThe Greyhounds played home games at the Sault Memorial Gardens from 1949 to 2006. The building was named for the war veterans of World War II. The Gardens hosted Memorial Cup games in 1978 and 1993, and the OHL All-Star Game in 1979. The last game at the Gardens was played on Tuesday, March 28, 2006. Demolition of the Gardens began on April 27, 2006. All that remains of the Gardens is the Memorial Tower, which is part of \"Memorial Square\". The red beacon of the Memorial Tower was preserved and continues to be lit on game days.\n\nSault Memorial Gardens - The OHL Arena & Travel Guide\n\n\n=== GFL Memorial Gardens ===\n\nThe Greyhounds moved to the new GFL Memorial Gardens (formerly named the Steelback Centre and the Essar Centre) for the 2006\u201307 OHL season. The new arena was built in the east parking lot of the Memorial Gardens, and is the largest such centre in Northern Ontario. Its naming rights are currently held by GFL Environmental. The inaugural game was played on October 11, 2006, resulting in a 2-1 loss to the Sudbury Wolves. The 2008 OHL All-Star Classic was held at the Essar Centre during the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nEssar Centre - The OHL Arena & Travel Guide\n\n\n== Media ==\nSince the 2009\u201310 season, Greyhounds' games have been broadcast on the radio by Rock 101 in neighbouring Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, after previously airing on Q104 and CKCY. Most regular season and playoff games for the Greyhounds are broadcast on Shaw Spotlight in Sault Ste. Marie.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ice hockey teams in Ontario\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Ocho Rios (Spanish for \"Eight Rivers\") is a town in the parish of Saint Ann on the north coast of Jamaica, and is more widely referred to as Ochi by the locals. Beginning as a sleepy fishing village, Ocho Rios has seen explosive growth in the last decade to become a popular tourist destination featuring duty-free shopping, a cruise-ship terminal, world-renowned tourist attractions and several beaches and acclaimed resorts. In addition to being a port of call for cruise ships, Ocho Rios also hosts cargo ships at the Reynolds Pier for the exportation of sugar, limestone, and in the past, bauxite. The estimated population of the town in 2011 was 16 671, which is nearly 10% of the total population of St. Ann. The town is served by both the Donald Sangster International Airport (97 km west of Ocho Rios) and the Ian Fleming International Airport (17 km east of Ocho Rios). Scuba diving and other water sports are offered in the town's vicinity.\nThe name \"Ocho Rios\" is a possibly misnomer, as there are not currently eight rivers in the area. It could be a British corruption of the original Spanish name \"Las Chorreras\" (\"the waterfalls\"), a name given to the village because of the nearby Dunn's River Falls. In 2008, the attraction Mystic Mountain  opened with a bobsled experience inspired by the Jamaican bobsled team that participated in the 1988 Olympics in Calgary. The attraction received a $570-million upgrade in 2019. The North Coast Highway from the Sangster International Airport at Montego Bay to Ocho Rios has been improved since 2007 and the journey is now an hour and forty five minutes drive. On 26 August 2011, the Jamaican government announced a $21 million revitalization plan for the resort area. Since March 2016, with the opening of the North-South portion of Highway 2000 (whose North terminus is located at Mammee Bay, a suburb of Ocho Rios), driving and commute times into the nation's capital, Kingston, have gone from over 2 hours to a little under an hour. The opening of this highway has reduced traffic on the old route between Jamaica's two cities (through the town and onto Fern Gully) immensely.\nThe town has several restaurants and nightclubs, such as Margaritaville, as well as Dolphin Cove, where tourists can swim and interact with dolphins. Another major point of interest is Fern Gully, which was formed from a 1907 earthquake that destroyed one of the river beds in the area. Fern Gully stretches about 3 miles of great rocky gorge where travellers can see over 540 variety of ferns. In 1907, the British government paved over the destroyed river bed to create what is currently known as The Fern Gully Highway.\n\n\n== History ==\nOcho Rios was originally settled by the a tribe of Arawak Indians called Ta\u00edno, who had settled in Jamaica around 1,000 BCE and called the land Xamayca, meaning land of wood and water. After Christopher Columbus landed in 1494 and claimed the island for Spain, Ocho Rios was named Las Chorreras, meaning rapid rivers. The Ta\u00ednos were ultimately obliterated by disease, slavery, and war. Some also committed suicide, presumably to escape their conditions as slaves. Spain brought the first enslaved Africans to Jamaica in 1517, to work on plantations throughout Jamaica, including Ocho Rios.\nIn May 1655, British forces seized the island from the Spanish.  The English misunderstood, misinterpreted, and mispronounced the Spanish name Chorreras and called the town Ocho Rios, which sounded close enough. In 1657 and 1658 the Spanish, sailing from Cuba, failed to retake the island in fierce battles in and around Ocho Rios known as the Battle of Las Chorreras.Historically, Ocho Rios did not have any prominent role to either the English or the Spanish. It was, however, utilised by pirates who along with Port Royal, regarded it as a perfect base of operations.\nWhen slavery was officially abolished on Jamaica in the year of 1834, the town entered a period of poverty and rebirth. With colonial interests removed, the history of Ocho Rios was crafted by the newly-freed slaves, who embraced their new-found freedom and slowly turned the town into a stable and peaceful fishing village.Although plantations developed during colonial times, Ocho Rios never evolved as a fruit-shipping port of any consequence. Things began to change in the 1940s when Reynolds Jamaica Mines built the deep-water Reynolds Pier west of town. An overhead conveyor belt still carries bauxite ore 10 km from the Reynolds open-cast mines at Lydford, in the hills south of town.Nonetheless, Ocho Rios was still just a quiet village in the 1960s,e when the Jamaican government formed the St Ann Development Company (SADCo), under the direction of the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), and then began systematic development. It dredged the harbor and built a small marina, reclaimed the shore, brought in sand for Turtle Beach, and built shopping and housing complexes.In January and February 1967, Martin Luther King, Jr. stayed in Ocho Rios with his wife and two employees to draft his fourth and final book, Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?.By the early 1980s, Ocho Rios' character had been established: a meld of American-style fast-food franchises, nondescript shopping malls, an enclave of mediocre hotels in town, and more tasteful, upscale hotels a discrete distance east. The construction of Island Village, a major shopping and entertainment complex, has spruced up 'Ochi.' In 1968, the Jamaica Villa Association (JAVA) was created to represent the growing number of villas in Jamaica. Ocho Rios has seen the rise of luxury villas, with  beachfront, ocean, and mountain views.Today, Ocho Rios extends four miles between Dunn's River Falls, two miles to the west of the town centre, and the White River, two miles to the east. Almost all the development outside the centre is to the east.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe town was a shooting location during the filming Dr. No, the first James Bond film, released in 1962. The Sans Souci hotel was used as the exterior of the Blue Mountain cottage, the home of Bond villain Miss Taro. A decade later, the town was used again in a Bond film, this time 1973's Live and Let Die.James Cameron's first film, 1982's Piranha II: The Spawning, was filmed at the Mallards Beach-Hyatt Hotel in Ocho Rios, which doubled for the film's Club Elysium.\n\n\n== Resorts ==\nBeaches Resorts \u2013 Ocho Rios\nCouples Resorts \u2013 Tower Isle and Sans Souci Locations\nRooms Resorts\nRIU Hotels & Resorts\nJewel Dunn's River Resort\nMoon Palace Jamaica\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Ocho Rios travel guide from Wikivoyage\nJamaica Tourist Board Ocho Rios page\nGuava Jelly Guide \u2014 \"Shake hands with the whole of Ochi!\"",

          "We had fun swimming with the dolphins but in retrospect I wish we hadn\u2019t done it. They tell you that the dolphins could go free if they wanted to but I don\u2019t think that is true. They won\u2019t let friends take photos and then it was a ridiculous amount of money to buy your photos.",
          "It was awesome... I was terrified but our staff was very knowledgeable about the dolphins and reassured me that Sky (our dolphin for that hour) was gentle, would back off if she sensed fear and would not eat me for lunch. I only did it for my husband, who LOVES the movie Free",

          "We loved swimming with the dolphins. We got to do more than just sit in the water and let them take a picture. Our trainer was amazing! The rest of the staff was average. Many looked miserable and some were very unfriendly. The food that came with the tour was horrible so eat",
          "We was with the Dolphins for a goods 45 minutes. They are amazing and extremely well cared for in their own environment. I have to say this was the best trip of our holiday and a trip I shall never forget. We got to stroke iguanas and the parrots sit on your shoulders . Also",

          "We swam with the dolphins and it was incredible! That alone made the trip worth it to us. Now the things you should know that no one told us before hand: -Bring lots of small bills for tips (everyone expects it and we were not prepared, especially coming from an all inclusive).",

The actual swimming with the dolphins on the Royal Swim package is something we will never forget and gets \u201c5 stars\u201d.

          "I had a great time doing the dolphin encounter. Lunch was included in my tour booking (Nexus Tours). It was a 2 out of 10. A buffet of 3 items, 1 inedible, and salad. I did not have time to go through the other on property attractions. Worth the money paid.",

          "What a fantastic day my husband and I had. Ziggy and his handler oshane were a fabulous team. Oshane was great his knowledge and his professional manner made our visit a day to remember. Ziggy was such a lovely dolphin and a great sense of humour. We laughed so much still",
          "Me and my friend spent a wonderful day @ Dolphin Cove in Ocho Rios. We did hold and took pictures with the macaws, iguana, rabbits and the lovebirds. The best part was swimming with the dolphins. Zeus,the dolphin, was so funny and playful. It was emotional to be able to spend",
          "I had so much fun doing the dolphin encounter. The dolphins are very trained and did so many cool tricks for us. They took our pictures with them so it gives you something to remind you of your trip to dolphin cove. Would definitely take family and friends on this adventure.",
          "We had a blast on this day! You can easily spend several hours there! Kids (probably 7+) will enjoy this trip! There are options for snorkeling, kayaking, swimming, and visiting some Jamaica animals all included. Be aware, the lunch that is included on this tour is not very",

        "wiki": "Kingston St Mary is a village and parish in Somerset, England, situated at the southern end of the Quantock Hills 4 miles (6.4 km) north of Taunton in the Somerset West and Taunton district.  The village has a population of 921.The parish includes the hamlets of Yarford which includes the grade II Cutley Farmhouse and Fulford where Fulford House was built about 1830, which has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first part of the village name comes from the kings settlement having belonged to the kings of the West Saxons before being ceded to the Bishop of Winchester as part of the manor of Taunton Deane, with the church's dedication being added in the 20th century.The parish of Kingston was part of the Taunton Deane Hundred.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council\u2019s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\nThe village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of Taunton Deane, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Taunton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and  fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\nIt is also part of the Taunton Deane county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\nThe manor house on Lodes Lane dates from around 1560. It was originally known as Lodes and was probably built for Robert Knight whose descendants subsequently altered it.Tetton House dates from 1790 and was enlarged and mainly rebuilt in 1924-6 by Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel for H M Herbert.The Grange was built around 1862, by Sir George Gilbert Scott for Mr Steele Perkins, and was visited by the future prime minister Anthony Eden during his holidays. It was later converted into an old peoples home. It is unlikely that the Grange was built by Scott but according to letters from Scott's architect Richard Coad, Scott did 'trifling alterations to a small house for Mr Perkins'.Kingston St Mary, has long been home to a country & folk music festival located at Yarford Farm, named Yarstock.  Having run since the mid 2000s, the festival has taken on cult status in some circles.\n\n\n== Religious sites ==\nThe Church of St Mary in Kingston St Mary on the Quantock Hills dates from the 13th century but the tower is from the early 16th century and was reroofed in 1952, with further restoration 1976\u20138. It is a 3-stage crenellated tower, with crocketed pinnacles with bracketed pinnacles set at angles, decorative pierced merlons, and set back buttresses crowned with pinnacles. The decorative \"hunky-punks\" are perched high on the corners. There may be so named because the carvings are hunkering (squatting) and punch (short and thick). They serve no function, unlike gargoyles which carry off water. The churchyard includes tombs of the Warre family who owned nearby Hestercombe House.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVillage website Media related to Kingston St Mary at Wikimedia Commons",

          "We visited around noon on a weekday and were the only people using the pool. The staff were nice and turned on the water slide for my son. He loved it and proceeded to spend the next half hour going up and down the slide. It's a short boat ride to the waterfall but it is a nice",

          "We were not with our family for our first visit, but we could not help but think what a nice outing we all would enjoy. It is a little costly for US visitors($10), but one of us was a Jamaican so we received in country rates. There is a swimming pool for people who were not",

          "There is an entry fee, although i can't remember what it was, but it was reasonable. The grounds are beautiful, had a large pool and a Avery attractions. You have the option of going straight to the falls or you can lounge by or swim in the pool. We decided to go straight to",
          "Great experience. The grounds are well-kept. The pool is large; and, surrounded by lush tropical foliage. The music creates a pleasant ambiance. The walk up to the boat departure is picturesque and pleasant. The boat is manned by a friendly and fun lifeguard. The boat trip",
          "I visited this falls with friends and we had an awesome time. The experience begins while waiting to get on the 7 to 9 seat boat to take you over to the falls. The tour guides enjoy jumping off the cliff/rocks into the water while you wait your turn to go over on the boat.",

          "We were lucky enough to be taken here by a Jamaican friend of ours and are so glad he did as we would never have known about it otherwise. Mostly visited my locals, this is a great place to visit and chill our and have fun and make new friends. The boat ride into the falls and",

          "Visited Somerset Falls outside Port Antonio, what a \"Jewel in the Nile\",a real hidden gem, it was like being immersed in a real rain forrest paradise. The falls are spectacular and you get to have an up close and personal experience with them. The staff were so friendly and",
          "This was our first visit to the falls, and the experience exceeded our expectation. It is evident that management took care to renovate the complex with a 'family friendly' focus. The boat ride to the falls was by far the best part of the trip..Our guide took the time to",
          "On a island blessed with a lot of beautiful waterfalls this was cool. Boat trip was a bit different. Jump off and swim back, trust me! Kids loved it too. Told they have not too long ago reopened it and are investing in it. Great to stop off at en route to Portland from Ocho.",
          "Very beautiful. I had an awesome experience. Going up the river on the boat then getting out at the falls for a water massage. Awesome experience",
          "It was well worth the 3 hour drive from Runaway Bay. It was my friends' first time in Jamaica. Being from Jamaica myself, I had been there and needed them to experience it. The ride there was beautiful, we stopped and ate.. immersed ourselves in the culture of the locals. Ate",

          "I've always seen pictures of falls in other countries such as the Philippines and Thailand and always dreamed of going there. That is what I get for browsing through instagram. Lol. Well these falls were absolutely breathtaking. I don't feel the need to go to any of those",
          "The falls are beautiful and the guide is very nice. The place looks like it used to be bustling with food stalls and shops and it place was made with care. There are flowers everywhere and mosaic benches, just amazing surroundings. Keep in mind that the boat tour to the fall is",

          "This please is absolutely beautiful! I am so impressed at how these people have maintained this area, and I am glad they did. A group of us came, 3 adults and 3 kids (4 years, 5 years and 7 years old). I think the tour guide who took us behind the falls in the boat was named",

          "Drove from Kingston. They only accept cash. Had to drive to Port Antony and back to get cash. Front desk staff was very apologetic. Too long wait for food . Service needs improvement. Very beautiful and scenic however",
          "Swimming at Somerset Falls in the cool fresh water between the two waterfalls is one of my favorite things to do on this planet. Really, it's that amazing. I can't get enough of this place and I will return for a swim every time I'm in the Hope Bay / Port Antonio area.",

          "We traveled far to come and see this attraction. We were the only people there and the guides were awesome. We took a small boat ride to the most amazing waterfall and jumped off of rocks into beautiful blue water. It was so fun. The water was clean and beautiful. There is also",
          "Beautiful, clean, blue water. It's very cold which is great on a hot sunny day. The people who work there can take you on a boat to go into caves where you can see and go under the falls (if you want). Great place to go with friends and family.",
          "Closed for good right now. But Reach Falls is amazing. Make sure to take the guided tour while at the falls, above and below. We hired a guy on the way driving up the to the falls and got a private tour through the below area. Amazing. Wading, swimming, jumping off falls,",
          "A must do in Jamaica. After walking your way up to the waterfall area there is a boat that brought the 2 of us upto and through the falls. It is breathtaking. You get out of the boat and climb onto a giant rock and the water falls onto you as you stand in the falls you can dive",
          "We went when it only partially opened (new owners doing renovations)... It was absolutely a great time. The heavy rains made the current strong - which only added to our thrills. I hope to go back again when it is fully opened.",
          "Greeted with a warm smile, we were welcomed with open arms at Somerset Falls. Closed for over two years, the garden looked better than ever. They have the best staff, the largest swimming pool and the only garden with a water slide. Somerset is the vacation spot in Portland",
          "An out of the way falls but worth going out of the way to visit. Traveling to the falls gave you a beautiful view of the other side of Jamaica. You get to see beauty of the rolling hills, the beautiful homes and yes some not so beautiful homes, the warmth of the people and the",

          "We tried to visit Somerset Falls but sadly it was closed for refurbishment, it is in a beautiful spot of jungle and woodlands and will be great to see once it has completed it's refurbishment so do check it's open when you plan to go!",
          "It was under some renovations but the kind Supervisor let us walk through to the beautiful falls! I saw my first Jamaican Hummingbird there! It was dark blue and had 2 long beautiful tails!",
          "The grounds are under construction (and technically closed) but we were still allowed to visit. We had the opportunity to meet the 2 men overseeing the changes and learned so much about the history of the falls and their vision. While I cannot rate the official facilities due to",
          "I love many of the waterfalls in Jamaica and Somerset is my favourite. We have been there at least 4 times. It is located in the lush parish of Portland and is very small compared to say Dunn's River. The water is a bit chilly and if you like you can get a nice massage from the",
          "The water is chilly, but it's so much fun to jump and climb on waterfalls. When we went it was an absolute ghost town, they have barricades for lines and such, but we were there with only one other couple.",
          "We stopped here on the way back from The Blue Lagoon. We were beyond surprised that there was amazing waterfall all the very back of this park. Mark was our tour guide and did an amazing job showing us everything and helping us get a great massage. We'll definitely be back!",
          "We drove to Port Antonio to spend a few days. Somerset falls was on our list of attractions to visit. We arrived at about noon, only to find a cartridge paper sign notifying us of the closure! We were terribly disappointed as we did nit go to Reach falls!",
          "Pretty crowded. Not ideal if you want solace with a small group. Great visit nonetheless and the food is OK. The rafting on the other side of the premises is pretty relaxing. Great potential. Maybe needs more lifeguards on duty. My brother almost drowned. How about providing",
          "I'm not going to say the falls are a must do, but in you're in Port Antonio...why not? Overall it's a fairly small area and you'll finish up in less than an hour. Be sure to take the raft ride the locals offer down the river and have some coconut water on the way.",
          "Falls is too good, located in a cave type of place. so natural and entertaining. Can make a small boat travel to reach the falls. Nice thing is you can dive into the water of the falls.",
          "This place is closed at the moment because it is under management changes. The only way we were able to visit was because our local tour guide knew some of the workers that were there keeping up with some of the maintenance. There is a small waterpark that is no longer",
          "The Somerset Falls is beautiful but the cost is not worth the ridiculous tour for photos this should be a cafe or something where we could sit and view the falls and enjoy the surroundings, we felt after paying that this was a bit of a rip off.",
          "I really enjoyed this trip with my partner and my family. The falls is a bit up steam therefore you go on a paddle boat. There is a small fee of $700 JMD which is approximately 5 USD. It is a very lovely place to visit however it could do with some refurbishment as they had an",
          "My experience tells me that this was once a good resort that has fallen below standard. I thought that the entry fee of 4000J$ was far too high for the minimal attraction that the venue had to offer. I went on the boat ride along the falls but there was no wow moments. There",
          "After a drive of 1/2 hr, we found out it was closed. We have been there before, and was very dissapointed.",
          "the water was beautiful, took a raft thur the caves, and to the back where there was a large pool like water, coming down from the rocks we could have stayed there all day, definitely going back",

          "Nice relaxing grounds but needs upkeep. Will visit again when the environs are more attractive. Few entertainment for visitors. The boat ride n water was wonderful",
          "I had planned a day trip from Ochi to Port Antonio.Somerset Falls was on the top of my list to visit. The huge sign guiding you to Somerset Falls is clearly visible.Once we drove in, it was a disappointment to see a closed sign. The Falls will be closed until further notice.",

          "A trip to Portland recently was unforgettable, very cool parish to visit. There are so many choices of places to visit. Somerset Falls has a awesome falls, great picnic area, medium pool and access to rafting on a river nearby. I would visit there again.",
          "What an amazing day. You get so much for your money pool, boat ride to the falls and rafting. I love the staff there they spoke like Jamaicans an not Americans, which was refreshing to hear. I found the members helpfully and full of information about the parish. We ate at Little",
          "We had our family annual fun day here on Sunday August the10 th of August 2014. Lots of different activites for all age group rafting ,boat ride through the falls, pools and water slides . lots of pavillions . Our family had a great reunion lots of places to sit. Natural beauty",

          "Falls are beautiful, water is clear and cool, very refreshing if you choose to swim back to dock. Brief boat ride to falls, guides will jump or dive off surrounding rocks, not an option for tourists. Bamboo raft ride across road included in price",
          "we really loved it here. The trip through the waterfall is fantastic even if you do get soaked ! The staff were very friendly and thankfully didnt adopt those fake American accents. We also wet rafting and although it was short it was very informative. The food was really good !",
          "We took 2 boat rides @ falls, get there early before the crowds. The birds in cages weren't much to look at and the beach with black sand was a disappointment. The pool did not look too clean.",

          "These are great falls. We went here on the Christmas Eve. So, it was really quite and we had the falls to ourselves pretty much. Our three guides really took great care of us - and guided us through the water falls and ensured safety as we jumped into the pool at the base of the",
          "Took my little ones here and it was perfect for kids 6 and under. Not too many people running around and there is a nice area for them to play and splash in. There was a small water park being added when we were there so hopefully that will be complete when we head back next",

          "This place defines what Portland is all about. This is real \"Eco Tourism\". Make sure to take a trip under the falls and take a dip...IT IS FREEZINGLY COLD, but it is worth it!",
          "We did this as part of a four attraction organized tour, not sure if it's worth a trip on it's own. I did come away with some beautiful pictures and my husband had fun swimming to and jumping from the falls. If you boat instead of swim ask the driver to stop facing the falls,",

          "$10US fee to get in but worth it. Don't miss the boat ride, adventurers will not be disappointed. Wear water shoes and bring a towel. Pool and reggae music great too. Nice way to spend a day. During the week it was not busy at all. Weekends may be much busier.",
          "We went the day after a heavy rain and our Tour Guide/LifeGuard Mark took us up through the falls by swimming the whole way to the Cave that is usually a boat ride! We were able to get up on the Rock inside the cave behind the Waterfall and Mark held my hand and we jumped out",
          "Here is a very sad and drammatically touristic place to avoid!! The tickets is about 12$ USA each and paying in jamaican dollar the woman at the cash desk tried to cheat with the change!! Once inside, we were disappointed of our choise to go in because there were rubbits in",
          "The ground was well kept, some birds and small animals, the walk up to the falls was relaxing, at the top where we awaited the boat to see the hidden falls, nice swimming area for all age - swimmers and non-swimmers(like me). the boat ride to the hidden falls unassuming expect",
          "My family was on a tour to see some of the attractions in Portland. Based on the reviews on trip advisor we decided that it was a must see. We were welcomed at the entrance and someone explained what the tour of the falls would entail. We paid the entrance fee, and on arrival",
          "Happened on this place on a weekend girl's trip to the Portland area with my two beautiful Aunts and one of my many beautiful cousins. I love the Great Huts but wanted to experience more of Portland. We had hotel reservations but saw this open gate that seem to lead to a beach",
          "We arrived at the falls and paid $12 each to enter. There were hardly any people there and no one tried to sell us anything. We had a brief walk up(easy terrain) and the got to an area with a lagoon area overlooking some falls. There was a boat there to take us under the falls.",
          "Another sad little tourist attraction. The falls are undramatic, the best fun we had was swimming to the 'hidden' falls and jumping off the rock. But it was a half hour tops, and not worth the entrance fee - although we didn't pay one as unfortunately we decided to stay in the",

          "Unless you're within a very short drive don't make the trip. While the main attraction of being driven in an aluminum boat to the cave under the very small falls and then jumping into the small pool below is fun and refreshing, the rest was very disappointing. You could not",
          "We were driving from Ocho Rios to Port Antonio and Somerset Falls was right along the way. Most people visit for the day but we stayed overnight and were virtually alone (there was a night watchmen at the front). The rooms are cozy, slightly musty from being near the waterfall",
          "We really enjoyed our time at Somerset Falls. The staff is great and the buildings are really nice. We went on a little tour before going to see the falls. Because it had rained so much the previous days, it was not possible to go to the falls by boat so we decided to swim",
          "Yes, these falls are worth the trip. Maybe the highlight of our visit to Jamaica. Don't forget the short hiking trail that afford good views of the water. The bird collection near the entrance is also stunning.",
          "We visited the first week of January 2005 and we were the only family there for the first 2 hours. After a very short tour they let you swim to the falls, but they don't tell you to go through the falls to the cave. The mosquitoes were fierce but the smoke pot with burning",

Maybe it's because I was with students but I saw no falls although someone said we could swing under the falls but since no students were allowed there, the teachers were unable to get the experience as students have to be supervised.",

          "No WATER!! so no falls, but a nice life guard or guide still showed us around.",
          "The highlight was the boat ride, be sure to go on that and the water slide never gets old. Family had a great time.",
          "It was not bad but I expect it would be a lot more fun",
          "Great venue for a family trip. The falls was amazing. Venue was clean and the food was good. The cost was reasonable as well. When I got there the bathroom was clean but throughout the day it got messy.  I will definitely be going back.",

          "The actual falls are so beautiful. But the crowd was a total turnoff. Customer service needs work too",

          "Loved the water,  so blue so cool on a hot day, not over developed as yet, almost untouched, the water slide was fun.",
          "Not sure if its the time of year, but it's not worth $1500 jmd. Six of us went and we waited over 3 hours to get on the boat to the falls. However, once at the falls it was fun. We stayed at the falls for about an hour before leaving. There \u2026",

        "wiki": "John Rackham (December 26, 1682 \u2013 November 18, 1720), commonly known as Calico Jack, was an English pirate captain operating in the Bahamas and in Cuba during the early 18th century. His nickname was derived from the calico clothing that he wore, while Jack is a nickname for \"John\".\nRackham was active towards the end (1718\u20141720) of the \"Golden Age of Piracy\" which lasted from 1650 to 1730. He is most remembered for having two female crew members: Mary Read and his lover, Anne Bonny.\nRackham deposed Charles Vane from his position as captain of the sloop Ranger, then cruised the Leeward Islands, Jamaica Channel and Windward Passage. He accepted a pardon in 1719 and moved to New Providence, where he met Anne Bonny, who was married to James Bonny at the time. He returned to piracy in 1720 by stealing a British sloop and Anne joined him. Their new crew included Mary Read, who was disguised as a man at the time. After a short run, Rackham was captured by Royal Navy pirate hunter Jonathan Barnet in 1720, put on trial by Sir Nicholas Lawes, Governor of Jamaica, and was hanged in November of that year in Port Royal, Jamaica.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nLittle is known of Rackham's upbringing or early life, except for the fact that he was English and born around the year 1682. The first record of him is as quartermaster on Charles Vane's brigantine Ranger in 1718, operating out of New Providence island in the Bahamas, which was a notorious base for pirates known as the \"Pirates' republic\". Vane and his crew robbed several ships outside New York City, then encountered a large French man-of-war. The ship was at least twice as large as Vane's brigantine, and it immediately pursued them. Vane commanded a retreat from battle, claiming caution as his reason. Jack Rackham quickly spoke up and contested the decision, suggesting that they fight the man-of-war because it would have plenty of riches. In addition, he argued, if they captured the ship, it would place a much larger ship at their disposal. Of the approximately ninety-one men on the ship, only fifteen supported Vane in his decision. Vane declared that the captain's decision is considered final; however, despite the overwhelming support for Rackham's cry to fight, they fled the man-of-war.\nOn 24 November 1718, Rackham called a vote in which the men branded Vane a coward and removed him from the captaincy, making Calico Jack the next captain. Rackham gave Vane and his fifteen supporters the other ship in the fleet, along with a decent supply of ammunition and goods.\n\n\n== Captain Rackham ==\nRackham made a career of plundering small vessels close to shore once he became captain. He and his crew captured the Kingston, a small Jamaican vessel, and made it their flagship. They made several conquests in the West Indies, taking a couple of large ships off Bermuda.\nIn 1719, Rackham sailed into Nassau in the Bahamas, taking advantage of a general amnesty for pirates to obtain a royal pardon and commission from Governor Woodes Rogers. Rogers had been sent to the Bahamas to address the problem of pirates in the Caribbean who had started to attack and steal from British ships.In December, he captured the merchant ship Kingston. The Kingston had a rich cargo, and promised to be a big score for Rackham and his crew. Unfortunately for him, the Kingston had been taken within sight of Port Royal, where outraged merchants outfitted bounty hunters to go after him. They caught up with him in February 1719, while his ship and the Kingston were anchored at Isla de los Pinos off Cuba. Rackham and most of his men were on shore at the time, and they escaped capture by hiding in the woods\u2014but their ship and rich trophy were taken away.\nCaptain Charles Johnson describes how Rackham stole a sloop in his seminal 1724 book A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most notorious Pyrates. Rackham and his men were at a town in Cuba refitting their small sloop when a Spanish warship charged with patrolling the Cuban coast entered the harbour, along with a small English sloop which they had captured. The Spanish warship saw the pirates but could not get at them at low tide, so they anchored in the harbour entrance to wait for morning. That night, Rackham and his men rowed over to the captured English sloop and overpowered the Spanish guards there. As dawn broke, the warship began blasting Rackham's old ship, now empty, as Rackham and his men silently sailed past in their new prize.\nRackham and his men made their way back to Nassau, where they appeared before Governor Rogers and asked for the royal pardon, claiming that Vane had forced them to become pirates. Rogers hated Vane and chose to believe them, granting them the pardon and allowing them to stay. Their time as honest men, however, did not last long.\n\n\n== Anne Bonny ==\nWhile in port, Rackham began an affair with Anne Bonny, wife of sailor James Bonny, who was employed by Governor Rogers. James Bonny learned about the relationship and brought Anne to Governor Rogers, who ordered her whipped on charges of adultery. Rackham offered to buy Anne in a \"divorce by purchase\", because he loved her, but her husband sternly refused. This caused Anne to flee Nassau and run away with Rackham. The pair (with a new crew) escaped to sea together, voiding Rackham's pardon, by stealing a sloop belonging to John Ham. They sailed the Caribbean for two months, taking over other pirate ships. Rackham would often invite the crew of ships that he attacked to join his own. Anne became pregnant and went to Cuba to have the child.\n\n\n== Capture, trial and death ==\nIn September 1720, the Bahamas' Governor Woodes Rogers issued a proclamation declaring Rackham and his crew pirates\u2014although it was not published until October 1720.  After publication of the warrant, pirate hunter Jonathan Barnet and former pirate Jean Bonadvis started in pursuit of Rackham, who was cruising near Jamaica capturing numerous small fishing vessels and terrorizing fishermen along the northern Jamaican coastline.Rackham had come across a small vessel crewed by nine English pirates, and they joined Rackham on his ship for a bout of drinking while at anchor, during which they became intoxicated at Dry Harbour Bay in Jamaica, October 1720.  Barnet's sloop attacked Rackham's ship and captured it after a fight presumably led by Mary Read and Anne Bonny.  Rackham and his crew were brought to Spanish Town, Jamaica, in November 1720, where they were tried and convicted of piracy and sentenced to be hanged.\nRackham was executed in Port Royal on 18 November 1720, his body then gibbeted on display on a very small islet at a main entrance to Port Royal now known as Rackham's Cay.\n\n\n== Captain Rackham ==\n\n\n== Fate of his crew ==\nAnne Bonny and Mary Read both claimed to be pregnant at their trials, ten days after Rackham's execution, and so were given a temporary stay, and imprisoned at Fort Charles until the claim was proven. Read died in her cell in April 1721, most likely of fever related to childbirth. There is no historical record of Bonny's release or of her execution.George Fetherston (Master), Richard Corner (Quarter-Master), John Davis, and John Howell were executed along with Jack Rackham in Port Royal. Patrick Carty, Thomas Earl, James Dobbin and Noah Harwood were executed the next day in Kingston.\nThe day after Rackham's trial, former crew members John \"Old Dad the Cooper\" or \"Fenis\" Fenwick and Thomas Bourn (alias Brown) were separately tried and convicted for mutinies committed in mid-June 1720 off Hispaniola.Nine men who had been caught drinking with Rackham's crew (John Eaton, Edward Warner, Thomas Baker, Thomas Quick, John Cole, Benjamin Palmer, Walter Rouse, John Hanson, and John Howard) were tried and convicted on 24 January 1721. On 17 February John Eaton, Thomas Quick and Thomas Baker were executed at Gallows Point, at Port Royal, and the next day John Cole, John Howard and Benjamin Palmer, were executed at Kingston. The fate of the remaining three is unknown.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe pirate flag of a skull over crossed swords flown on the Black Pearl, in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean movies is a flag attributed to Calico Jack Rackham.  Anecdotally the crossed swords represented Anne Bonny and Mary Read, Jack's female accomplices.\nIn Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, Jack Rackham is a side character and minor antagonist who betrays Captain Edward Kenway after they capture a slave ship.\nJack Rackham is one of the major characters in the 2014 Starz television series Black Sails, portrayed by Toby Schmitz.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nNelson, James L.

It is the parish capital of St. Andrew.Half Way Tree is served by the Kingston 10 post office.In recent years, as a result of crime and violence in Downtown Kingston and Cross Roads, Half Way Tree has overtaken these areas as the central hub of the capital, Kingston and, perhaps, the busiest thoroughfare in the city. The area has become a popular location to do business in Kingston because of its central location and close proximity to Downtown Kingston, the New Kingston Business District as well as it being the transportation of hub of Kingston. The National Works Agency, for example, estimates that approximately 250,000 commute through the Half Way Tree area on a daily basis from Monday through Saturdays. In recent years, the area has become increasingly attractive as a residential neighbourhood to young professionals, again because of its proximity to where many of them work. The apartments and townhouses are located mainly on Surbiton Road, Winchester Road, Ruthven Road and Cecelio Avenue. As a result, Half Way Tree has become one of the most expensive areas in Kingston to purchase real estate: an acre of land can run as high as US$1.5 million.\nA number of prominent schools, including St Andrew High Girls' School and Holy Childhood High for Girls, are located in the heart of Half Way Tree.\nA busy shopping district, Half Way Tree is also home to the most well-known plazas and malls\u2014such as Twin Gates, Mall Plaza, Tropical Plaza, Kings Plaza, Lane Plaza, the Pavilion Mall\u2014in Kingston and Jamaica as a whole. There are also a number of prominent churches in the area such as Holy Cross Church and Webster Memorial.\n\nWhile the business and commercial areas are in the heart of Half Way Tree, the residential areas tend to be concentrated on the outer verges.\nWithin a mile of the clock tower marking the position of the old Half Way Tree is Devon House, a National Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nMay Farquharson, social worker, birth control advocate, philanthropist, and reformer\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Port Antonio is the capital of the parish of Portland on the northeastern coast of Jamaica, about 100 km (60 miles) from Kingston. It had a population of 12,285 in 1982 and 13,246 in 1991. It is the island's third largest port, famous as a shipping point for bananas and coconuts, as well as one of its most important tourist attractions, tourism being a major contributor to the town\u2019s economy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPort Antonio was a settlement first established in Spanish Jamaica, when it was known as Puerto Anton.Portland formally became a parish in 1723 by order of the Duke of Portland, the then-Governor of Jamaica after whom it is named. The existing port was to be called Port Antonio and was slated to become a naval stronghold. To that end, by 1729, the British began to build Fort George on the peninsula separating the twin East and West harbors known as the Titchfield promontory. The fort was intended to protect settlers from attacks by the Spanish from the sea, and from the Maroons (run-away slaves) who lived in the mountains.Port Antonio was a sleepy coastal town until the 1880s, when Lorenzo Dow Baker started the banana trade in Jamaica and successfully promoted Port Antonio as a destination for wealthy American travelers. \"Portie\" became a boom town. The banana trade and the tourists who came in the banana boats, was once so large that at one time, weekly sailing from Port Antonio was greater than weekly sailing from the great English port of Liverpool.The island was glamorized by Hollywood as a model of paradise in movies of the 1940s and 1950s, and in later movies such as Club Paradise and Cocktail. This image was added to by the arrival of movie star Errol Flynn in 1946 when his yacht, the Zaca washed ashore in bad weather. He subsequently bought nearby Navy Island, part of historic Fort George in Port Antonio as well as hundreds of acres of farmland along the Portland coast.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nPort Antonio features a trade-wind tropical rainforest climate under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. Like many areas with this climate type, average temperatures vary little throughout the course of the year, with average monthly temperatures roughly at 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) throughout the year. The town has a noticeably drier period from February through April, however it has no true dry season month as all 12 months on average easily exceeds 60 millimetres (2.4 in) of precipitation. Port Antonio averages a copious 3,000 millimetres (120 in) of rainfall annually.\n\n\n== Tourist destinations ==\n\nOne popular sight in this area is the Blue Lagoon, Jamaica, which owes its colour to its depth of 60 m (200 feet). Other sights include the secluded Frenchman's Cove Beach, the ruins of Folly Mansion and the historic DeMontevin Lodge. The Rio Grande, Boston Bay and Reach Falls are also close by.\nIn addition there is the Bay View Eco Resort located on a former coconut plantation and Pimento Lodge in Long Bay.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nPort Antonio is a hub for bus transport in the north east of the island.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nPort Antonio was the terminus of the now abandoned railway from Kingston via Spanish Town and Bog Walk, which was primarily built to serve the banana export trade.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe 1989 thriller film The Mighty Quinn was filmed at various locations throughout Jamaica, with the principal outdoor scenes shot in Port Antonio.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGuide to attractions and sights in Port Antonio\nA History of Portland",

To top it off, bad customer service. Only up side was the refund my group was able to get to go elsewhere.",
          "Nice park\nGreat for the kids\nWell layed out.\nDrive is kinda far but worth it",

          "Love the river here...",
          "The place needs some serious renovation and should invest in more variety in there rides. They should also have more signs along the roads, as we almost got lost",
          "We need to get our food system better than that",
          "I loved it... although there wasn't as much slides to choose from, being with friends made up for it, I'd say go as a group, the workers were good, took us around to the falls for photos, did kayaking as well. Played volleyball in the pool.",
          "Poor food service but otherwise from that it was an amazing experience for the family. Lots of fun rides go cart track was a major hit",

          "A leisure facility used by the locals, including water slides, pool, sun beds included in entrance (basic) changing facilities and a cafe. An authentic day out. The park is undergoing upgrading so it will be even better when that work is completed.",
          "Great time",

          "It was really boring there. the slides were the only thing there.....the 4 of us that went there after leaving blue hole was determined to leave if we had not paid SO MUCH MONEY TO GET IN! We just tried to find ways to enjoy our self. \u2026",
          "Was fun the grounds were clean, the staff were watchful especially of the kids, many different options to choose from and the food was delicious! Would definitely go again",
          "Lott of slide",
          "Its a hidden gem close to the border of st mary and st ann. Its isolated from the hustle and bustle of the nearest town. The staff are friendly and professional. Its a great place for families or if u jus need some time for ur self.",

          "Nice experience here.  The property needs a bit more development but I'm excited about it being in St.  Mary.  1:15 from Kgn. The slides are exhilarating and the lake for kayaking was fun.  I would recommend for a family day out",
          "Wataland was a hidden surprise to me when I got there.  I  heard about it previously but was not prepared for what I saw. Though not completely developed, there is never a dull moment on the grounds,  there is something for you to enjoy. \u2026",
          "Great",
          "Worst experience the pool is filled with slim and much at the bottom which says the water has been stagnant for some time. The pool also is not a pool it is a thick rough plastic that is placed in a hole and water is poured in. Sometimes i \u2026",
          "Nice location, property has alot of potential",

          "Great for the family. Its all about fun, fun, fun. I swear no one wanted to leave when it was time to go home. However I think the tractor riding needs supervision, it was not organized. Parking area needs extension. ",
          "Nice clean fun and safe place to be..",
          "Really good spot to chill, preferably on a weekday when its not overcrowded with people. The water was the right cool temperature to provide an ease from the summer's heat. The slide was an experience so was canoeing and the trampoline. \u2026",

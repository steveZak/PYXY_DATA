        "wiki": "The fortifications of Xi'an (Chinese: \u897f\u5b89\u57ce\u5899), also known as Xi'an City Wall, in Xi'an, represent one of the oldest, largest and best preserved Chinese city walls. It was built under the rule of the Hongwu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang as a military defense system. It exhibits the \"complete features of the rampart architecture of feudal society\". It has been refurbished many times since it was built in the 14th century, thrice at intervals of about 200 years in the later half of the 1500s and 1700s, and in recent years in 1983. The wall encloses an area of about 14 square kilometres (5.4 sq mi)\nThe  Xi'an City Wall is on the tentative list of UNESCO's World Heritage Site under the title \"City Walls of the Ming and Qing Dynasties\". Since 2008, it is also on the list of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of the People's Republic of China. Since March 1961, the Xi'an City Wall is a heritage National Historical and Cultural Unit.\n\n\n== Location ==\nXi'an City Wall is located in the urban district of Xi'an City, which at one time was an imperial city during the periods of the Sui and Tang dynasties. It is situated at the end of the ancient Silk Road.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nZhu Yuanzhang, the first Emperor of the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), was advised by Zhu Sheng, a sage, to build a fortified high wall around the city, create storage facilities for food and then establish his empire by unifying all the other states. Following the hermit's advice, Zhu established the Ming dynasty, and then built a highly fortified wall over a previously existing palace wall of the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907). He started building the Xian City Wall, as the capital of northwestern Shaanxi Province in 1370. He incorporated the ancient fortified embankments built by the Sui and Tang dynasties by including them in the wall's western and southern parts, enlarging the eastern and northern parts. The edifice was built over an eight-year period and was well maintained during both the Ming dynasty, and the Qing dynasty, which followed.The wall was initially built solely from tamped earth. During the Longqing Emperor's period (1568) the wall was strengthened by laying blue bricks on the top and exterior faces of the earthen walls. During the reign of Qianlong of the Qing dynasty (1781), the wall was enlarged; drainage features, crenels and other modifications were made; and the structure as it is now seen came into existence. By the end of the Qing dynasty rule, the structure had begun to deteriorate. In a limited degree the Republican Authorities carried out maintenance of the wall, which was in a poor state. In the first decade of the 20th century, the wall's defense system was considered to be of strategic importance, even though demolishing of similar walls in other regions of the country was undertaken following the 1911 Revolution. In 1926, the wall was attacked with bombs by enemy forces resulting in serious structural damage, but the city within the wall was not affected. During the Second World War, when the Japanese carried out air bombings from 1937 to 1940, the residents built around 1,000 bunkers, as anti-aircraft shelters within the wide base (thickness of more than 15 metres (49 ft)) of the wall. A few escape openings were also made through the wall as passageways. Even later, new gates to allow traffic through the Xian Wall were constructed during the Republican rule.According to the Shenboo Atlas of 1933, in the 1930s most people lived within the perimeter of the Xi'an Wall but still there were a lot of unoccupied open areas. Among the visitors who came to see the Xian Wall were American captain (later general) Stilwell in 1922 and the Czech sinologist Jaroslav Pr\u016f\u0161ek (1906\u20131980) in 1933. In 1983, the administration of the Xi'an municipality carried out more renovations and additions to the wall. At that time, the Yangmacheng tower, the Zhalou sluice tower, the Kuixinglou dipper tower, the Jiaolou corner tower and the Dilou defense tower were all refurbished; the crumbling parts of the rampart were changed into gates; and the moat was restored. In May 2005, all of Xi'an's ramparts were inter-connected.The  Xi'an City Wall was proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of the People's Republic of China in 2008. UNESCO included the site in the tentative List of World Heritage Sites under the title \"City Walls of the Ming and Qing Dynasties\" as a cultural heritage designee under Criterion iii & iv. In March 1961, the Xi'an City Wall was fully approved as a heritage site as a National Historical and Cultural Town.Michelle Obama, the first lady of the United States, visited the Xi'an City Wall on 24 March 2014, describing it as \"a wall that has withstood war and famine and the rise and fall of dynasties\".\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nThe Xi'an Wall is rectangular in shape and has a total length of 14 kilometres (8.7 mi), with almost all stretches subjected to some kind of restoration or rebuilding. Along the top of the wall is a walkway, which would typically take four hours to cover. It is built in the Chinese architecture style. As a defense fortification, it was constructed with a moat, drawbridges, watch towers, corner towers, parapet walls and gate towers. The wall is 12 metres (39 ft) in height with a width of 12\u201314 metres (39\u201346 ft) at the top and base width of 15\u201318 metres (49\u201359 ft). Ramparts are built at intervals of 120 metres (390 ft), projecting from the main wall. There are parapets on the outer side of the wall, built with 5,984 crenels, which form \"altogether protruding ramparts\". There are four watch towers, located at the corners and the moat that surrounds the wall has a width of 18 metres (59 ft) and depth of 6 metres (20 ft). The area within the wall is about 36 square kilometres (14 sq mi), enclosing the small area of 14 square kilometres (5.4 sq mi) occupied by the city.\n\nThe southern embrasured watchtower constructed in 1378, was destroyed by fire in 1926 during the civil war of 1926, and was restored in September 2014. This was done after a careful historical review of documents related to the historical features that existed before it was damaged. The other three watchtowers forming the northern, eastern and western gates of the wall were also examined during the planning phase of the modifications done for the South Tower. They were modified, without affecting the integrity of the wall, by an encompassing hall offering protection to the structures by using steel, wood work and the ancient-type tiles and bricks structure. Major gates have ramp access except the South Gate which has entry outside the walls.There is an \"Archery Tower\", which provides security to one of the four gates of the Xi'an wall. Created as a large trap-like chamber, capped by a tower filled with windows, it gave an advantageous position for archers to shoot arrows (in the initial years of building the wall) and later cannonballs at the opposing revolutionary forces. In the event that the enemy was able to breach the walls through the main gate they would become trapped in the small chamber that faced yet another gate and thus be easy targets for the defending troops.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLynn, Anne Wien (2013).

          "A must see when in China. Should be on everyone's bucket list. Get there early, like most sites. Head directly to the main pit. Follow up with other pits, and museum afterwards. To get there take the metro. Then one has the option, of tour \u2026",
          "More expensive attraction than most in China and you need to pay for tickets in cash.\nThe crowds are large and often go around in groups so descend on one exhibit all the same time. Chinese people have no problem shoving you, no English \u2026",
          "Amazing sculpture and located in a HUGE area. Spring time would be a perfect time to explore this area",
          "First time visiting even though we came in the coldest time. Worth to be here for kids and family! We hired a local guide as we are groups of mixed nationalities and she explained the history of the emperor and how the terracotta were built \u2026",

          "The Terra-cotta Army Museum is a must see location when u are in China. I will teen it as 2nd best experience after the Great Wall. Located east of historic Xi\u2019an city. The museum has three pits with pit 1 being the largest. The layout is \u2026",
          "The mausoleum itself is just a stone with some engraving. Not that spectacular. The park around the site is nice and compared to the terracotta army not crowded. That is especially nice at the various archeological sites where you can also see some cotta figures. There\u2019s a free shuttle bus going between the two sites.",
          "A remarkable site. Truly a deserving eighth wonder of world. Each warrior is different in facial expressions, a remarkable feat. The effort done to preserve the historical site is commendable. One must not leave without seeing the chariots located in the third exhibit.",
          "very impressive. the entrance ticket only costs 120yuan. Going there during weekday and early morning is much better.",
          "Stunning historical and cultural discovery worth the visit",

          "It is far from the city but the place is very amazing. If u love a china history. Dont miss to visit here.",
          "Worth to visit but be aware of the expensive entrance fee. To get to Lishan Cable car, you need to pay other ticket fee. This place is big and you need to walk around to see everything. The cable car ride was nice. Make sure to visit on weekdays and not during holiday season. It will be crowded with local tourist",

          "Wow! It is amazingly spctacular. I really don\u2019t know how to express my feeling in words. It is a must-see site in Xi\u2019an. It takes about 90 RMB to hire a tour guide to tell you everything about here. Arrive here earlier and get ready to enjoy the breathtaking antiques.",

          "This is a fantastic place, it took me two hours to see everything with a private guide. However I went during non peak season January 2020 3rd week where i was told from my guide only 6000 people per day compared to 100000 during summer \u2026",
          "One dream comes true",

          "Need I say more, you'll need to be able to walk a ways and bring your own toilet paper. You've been warned. Now the cool part, this is amazing to say the least and still under archaeological excavation and restoration. Three large buildings full of antiquity!",

          "A must visit! Great empire of Qin",
          "Visited on a day trip from xian city, we came in the off season and Avoided the insane crowds of people! Still pretty busy inside the pits. Pit number 1 is the main pit and largest with the iconic sights. Pits 2 and 3 show different classes \u2026",
          "I don't know if there are words to explain how amazing this place is. It's a must visit in a lifetime, absolutely. If you want to avoid crowds arriving at 7.30 and being the first to enter is enough, large groups usually arrive at 9.30. The \u2026",
          "Amazing, bucket list place! Don\u2019t buy the souvenirs at the arrivals area. They were liars because they said they were the only souvenir shop and that I would not have a chance to go that way upon exiting. Their prices were also way higher. \u2026",
          "This was an unbelievable experience. We took a small tour from Xian. Set up by the hostel. Definitely made it easy to navigate. Were able to get the whole story of the farmer. Definitely a whole day event. If you go into the gift shop you \u2026",

          "Rich in historic legacy  but too crowded",
          "A must-visit despite the crowd and the commercialisation that inevitably accompanies such places. There are 3 pits and the biggest and most visited is pit no. 1. It may not be a bad idea to start with the quieter pits 2 or 3 and end up with pit 1. Sorry, my bad - there is hardly a quiet moment amongst the throngs of visitors.",
          "I'll be honest I got a little emotional walking into this place it's fulfilled a dream of mine to go here",

          "Dating back to the 1300s, these warriors are worth a visit. A short trip of 2 days should be enough to cover the museum and also get a flavor of Xi'an's muslim streets, the great mosque and the city wall.\nThe museum is an hour's drive from \u2026",
          "Good market outside. but the price of souvenir quite different at indoor and outdoor. outdoor is very cheaper. Be careful when you buy early",
          "Well maintained facility and cool background information.  Pay the extra fee and get the in ear translation.",
          "Amazing place. A must see in China",
          "A must see place. Simply a beautiful place that will leave you speechless.\n\nThe area consists of 5 pitches which one can admire. Some pitches shows the army, some only parts of the army and some horses.\n\nThere is also a \"hospital\" (as they call it) where archeologic repair broken parts.",
          "It was a good museum. It had stuff",
          "The Terracotta Warriors just blew my mind. Looking at them, travel back to time, imagine how they were made... it's just unbelievable. These clay warriors are just standing there, but you will feel the glory of the Qin Emperor...through \u2026",
          "Because of was zo crowded i cold not der evert tv hing the way i wanted.  That and the guide  that  spoke english that could not be understood are the only to negative  points",
          "World Wonder, no question, only complaint is so many people, understandable though.",
          "This museum needs more publicity.  Very interesting",
          "Good to see but we didn't spend to much time there. Unfortunately pretty repetitive and overcrowded, even by Chinese standards ;)",

          "Amazing place has to be seen.",
          "Wonderful historical site. Plenty of educational and cultural values. Great for making photos, learning, passing valuable time, also with children. It was very crowded when we visited. The toilets were horrible though.",
          "One word.... History",
          "Super cool place to visit. It is a giant area with a neat history. Very informative and mind blowing!",
          "It is a must seeing and worthy going place.\nBy the way, there are always crowded people.",
          "This is the Emperor Qinshihuang's mausoleum site museum,so amazing to look the history behind this terracota warrior",
          "This clay army is quite impressive.... If you can Beat few Millions People to see it. This place is absolutely overcrowded.",
          "Worth the 7000 mile trip. Looks just like it does in the history books. Would recommend to avoid going on a Chinese holiday as it can get amazingly crowded.",
          "Big bunch of pottery people isn't it",
          "Interesting views",
          "This was indescribable. Awsome",

          "Amazing... No words..",
          "AMAZING!! If you ever go to China do not the Terrra Cotta Warriors exhibit!  Its absolutely BREATHTAKING!",
          "An amazing experience, worth seeing this 2000 year old wonder. It's a popular attraction, lots of people, sometimes just need to be patient to get a good viewing position or to take a photo. However, it's worth the hassle and people. Make sure to see all 3 buildings.",
          "A must-go if you are in Xi'an. Very unique experience and interesting history.",
          "Once in a lifetime experience to see this in person and the sheer number of statues in this place is mind blowing experience. Wonderful to see..",
          "Nice archeological experience but very crowded ! I suggest visiting pit 1 just before closing (I think 5:00 pm) to really appreciate the visit. Even if there are smaller pit 2 and pit 3 are also interesting. Be careful, the museum can be a bit stressful when crowded and you have small kids.",
          "A well preserved monuments.   Terracotta army is amazing",
          "Great souvenirs. Interesting history.",
          "Huge complex, some stretching out of the expirience. All in all impressive",
          "Pretty good place to learn about history if you learn before hand",
          "Love it! Terracotta warriors, the afterlife army-guardians of one of the greatest Chinese emperors, the one that unified all China ;) and also, who happens to have a pyramid-shaped hill / tomb with a mercury artificial river inside. He surely brings fear and respect still to many..",
          "Very beautiful and breath taking but the amount of people on that small site is really ruining the experience\n\nBut still is a must see!!!",
          "This is the first and really only reason to visit Xian. We learn about this place from ancient history class in grade school, take the opportunity to see history for yourself. It\u2019s still an active archialogical site and very cool. It\u2019s on \u2026",
          "A nice garden area around the site of the Mausoleum but needs more explanation and better signing to make it really worthwhile addition to a visit to  Xian.",
          "Gigantic. This was on my basketlist. Love it.",
          "My wife and I went for our honeymoon, absolutely amazing!  The history of the cite is incredible, to think that they were undiscovered for such a long time.\n\nI would recommend it to anyone touring China, my only tip would be not to bother \u2026",
          "Glad I finally got to see this! Always wanted to see it, and it was not disappointing. Spectacular to see all those thousands of statues, each one unique. A plus is that further digging and restoration work are still being done on site, \u2026",
          "I guess you could say they're all stoned?\n\nget it, clay is made of like crushed up stones and minerals.",
          "If you have an opportunity to visit this place, please do. Also, our tour guide is providing valuable background information.",

          "Well worth the effort to get to.",
          "Guide is really worth getting, or you'll miss out! Was here in November, wish I brought an umbrella! Easy to get here with bus! A bit of a walk through to the actual site from the bus stop - that's where the umbrella \ud83c\udf02 would have been good to have!",
          "Must place to go if you want to understand the history of China.",
          "So impressive to see these thousands of warriors standing through ages in order to protect the first Emperor of China tomb. The site is really crowded and it takes about 1 hour to come form Xi'an by bus.",
          "Amazing place where you can feel free to walk and discover the history about this beitiful place... I got there travelling by public transpirtation, around 1 hour from Xian",
          "History relived here...  An exemplar of great Chinese culture",
          "If you are in Xi'an go visit it but don't go to Xi'an just for that. The pictures on the Internet are exactly what you gonna see. The city Xi'an itself is more interesting. The Army is not that overwhelming because you can't really get near the soldiers.",
          "This has been on my list for years. Seeing photos is nothing like seeing it in person! Highly recommend if you are in the area. As you walk in, many tour guide companies will say you can't go in without a guide. They are lying. You don't \u2026",
          "I recommend that you go with a guide and enjoy the stories they share.  otherwise it would just be a stroll in a park experience. I",
          "Incredible, impressive, must see.",
          "Very interesting! Love the history",
          "The army started marching, doing cartwheels, fighting and telling jokes. It was pretty lit and I definitely recommend because if you go on Tuesdays, Emperor Qin Shi Huang will visit and hand out free cash.",
          "The Terracotta Army is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210\u2013209 BCE with the purpose of protecting the emperor in his afterlife.",

          "Wow.....  But really hot in summer.",
          "Traditionnaly, after a sip of chineses wine,\nWe broke our cups.\nVery interesting tradition of drinking.\nNot sure this custom dated back to\nQui shi emperor",
          "Nice place to understand the orign of today's china",
          "A really enjoyable day trip from downtown Xi'an. It takes about 1 hour bus ride to get to the gate. Take the local 306 bus from the old train station it ends at the park. Bus cost 8\u00a5each one way. We hired a personal Guide at the gate who spoke pretty good English for 150\u00a5 for about 3 hour tour, well worth it.",
          "One of the most important sites in China, and a UNESCO site of course.",
          "Unique world heritage - must see",

          "Still amaze with this place eventhough i already been here twice",
          "Entrance area , full of food eateries , almost of them low to medium quality. Bad air, hi pollution. Please prepare your masks",

          "It is great historical location",
          "Fabulous historical place, I really got fun",
          "Ok after seeing this recreated by modern Hi-Tech movies it's kind of a let down. The movie's do a marvelous job putting everything into place.\nThe assignment as a worker here was a death sentence. One way ticket. They have discovered names signed on the warriors legs. A way to leave your mark on the big blue marble.",
          "Nice to see such an import and well known monument, but it's not that exciting to be honest. It's easy getting there with bus from the railway station, \u00a5 8-10 per trip. The entrence if the site is \u00a5 150 (\u00a5 75 for students).",
          "I dont know why",
          "It's worth seeing. Much much larger than I thought",
          "If you visit China... this is a must see!",
          "Amazing to see the terracotta army, very busy though so be prepared to walk slow or push though.",
          "A lovely place filled with history going backs so many years!",
          "One of the great wonders of the world. The Terracotta Army. You cannot visit Qin Shi Huang \u2018s tomb itself which is actually some distance away.\n\nFlocked with tourists; don\u2019t come at peak season. Still worth it though regardless. Truly amazing.",
          "It's good, but Qin Shu Huang is dead...",
          "Fasinating experience in person.",
          "Good place to visit",
          "Entrance and ticketing was hard to find. Way too many people. They should consider having some traffic control. Air conditioning was also poor (or was there any?). 5 stars tough because it's amazing.",
          "Finally got the chance to see first time the infamous Terracotta Army. The museum held more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses, and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which remained buried in the pits near Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum.",
          "Historic, breathtaking and impressive!  This should be on everyone's list of sites to visit if possible.  Having a tour guide, or a friend who is immersed in the historical details of Emperor Qinshihuang's reign and especially the story \u2026",
          "Amazing place! My high expectations of this place were exceeded. Fantastic!",
          "This is the best place if tourist to learn about china history. There are 5 pit stop and each pit stop have their own story. You can hire tourist guide that available at there. The charge are 150 - 200 yuan per head. Depends on the guide. Come early if you do not want to be rushing when in there. The place quite huge.",
          "This is one of those places where you have to be there to see it for yourself. So much have been written about it and the only justice you can do is to be there to appreciate how much effort is needed to build it. However, be prepared to \u2026",
          "That place is must visit in China.. use bus from railways station of Xian city to reach that place for 15 Yuan only..",
          "Extraordinary!!! Amazing site! I arrange a taxi for 400 rmb to go and back to hotel. I paid extra 200 rmb for a exclusive local guide in the site. Cheaper option for group of 4 people.",
          "Good architecture. Good views and well-maintained facility.\nThis is a very good place to learn history or simply for sight-seeing",
          "Seeing the real thing was sort of interesting, but not really that much better than flipping through pictures online.",
          "One of the great wonders of the world, the terracotta warriors are a sight worth seeing for anyone interested in the history of China or the world. Found first in only 1974, the Chinese authorities continue to find enormous quantities of historical artefacts locked in these burial grounds",
          "Great attraction site but not that spectacular. A must-see with not much excitement.",
          "Very amazing site to see. It wasn't until I got home and started to closely look at my pictures when I truly appreciated the work that must of gone into everything. Like all the spots in China, this was a very clean place to visit.",
          "Amazing man made",
          "Make sure you go early.\n\nYou've traveled this far to see the Terracotta Army (warriors).\n\nlike all things in China, tourist traps everywhere.\n\nPit one is the most impressive and where you see most of the photo opportunities. There will be people with selfie sticks out everywhere from the local Chinese tour groups.",

          "A beautiful museum to visit and it is very  informative about history and the process of restoration",
          "This is a good place but dont expect to see Angkor or Mont Saint Michel or Machu Pichu. This is NOT of the same magnitude. True, This is extraordinary by the way the soldiers were assembled and what they represent but the park organization \u2026",
          "The crowd makes this vast army difficult to perceive but you can still get a glimpse of the power one man had in ancient times.",
          "This place worth to visit really",
          "The PRC has done a good job of excavating and preserving this national treasure. Row after row of warriors and horses lined up over a great distance.  There are the pits you walk around and over. Then a museum to get a closer look.  Highly recommended.",
          "150rmb entrance fee during high season (march-nov), opens at 830am. Go early to avoid crowds as the place can get packed by 1030am. Non holiday weekdays are the best times to visit. Amazing statues and history here.",

          "Fantastic to see the Buried Warriors but the crowds make it almost impossible to get close. There were so many people and I was pushed and shoved so much by the local tourists that it spoiled the visit. In all honesty you can see it better \u2026",

          "Amazing museum! Worth the visit. Restrooms were few and far between though, and additional services were over priced. ( for guides/recorded walkthrough). But all in all a must see. Great place for everyone to check out.",
          "Magnifuc, more than 2000 years ago",
          "Must visit in Xian. the army alone is worth this trip, but make sure you get a local guide which costs around 200 rmb (30 USD)",

        "wiki": "A pagoda is a tiered tower with multiple eaves common to  China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and other parts of Asia. Most pagodas were built to have a religious function, most often Buddhist but sometimes Taoist, and were often located in or near viharas. The pagoda traces its origins to the stupa of ancient India.Chinese pagodas (Chinese: \u5854; pinyin: T\u01ce) are a traditional part of Chinese architecture.  In addition to religious use, since ancient times Chinese pagodas have been praised for the spectacular views they offer, and many famous poems in Chinese history attest to the joy of scaling pagodas. The oldest and tallest were built of wood, but most that survived were built of brick or stone. Some pagodas were solid, and had no interior at all. Others were hollow and held within themselves an altar, with the larger frequently containing a smaller pagoda (pagodas were not inhabited buildings and had no \"floors\" or \"rooms\").  The pagoda's interior has a series of staircases that allow the visitor to ascend to the top of the building and to witness the view from an opening on one side at each story. Most have between three and 13 stories (almost always an odd number) and the classic gradual tiered eaves.In some countries, the term may refer to other religious structures. In Vietnam and Cambodia, due to French translation, the English term pagoda is a more generic term referring to a place of worship, although pagoda is not an accurate word to describe a Buddhist vihara.  The architectural structure of the stupa has spread across Asia, taking on many diverse forms as details specific to different regions are incorporated into the overall design. Many Philippine bell towers are highly influenced by pagodas through Chinese workers hired by the Spaniards.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nOne proposed etymology is from a South Chinese pronunciation of the term for an eight-cornered tower, Chinese: \u516b\u89d2\u5854, and reinforced by the name of a famous pagoda encountered by many early European visitors to China, the \"P\u00e1zh\u014du t\u01ce\" (Chinese: \u7436\u6d32\u5854), standing just south of Guangzhou at Whampoa Anchorage. Another proposed etymology is Persian butkada, from but, \"idol\" and kada, \"temple, dwelling.\"Another etymology, found in many English language dictionaries, is modern English pagoda from Portuguese (via Dravidian), from Sanskrit bhagavati, feminine of bhagavat, \"blessed\", from bhag, \"good fortune\".Yet another etymology of pagoda is from the Sinhala word d\u0101gaba which is derived from Sanskrit dh\u0101tugarbha or Pali dh\u0101tugabbha: \"relic womb/chamber\" or \"reliquary shrine\", i.e. a stupa, by way of Portuguese.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin of the pagoda can be traced to the stupa (3rd century BCE). The stupa, a dome shaped monument, was used as a commemorative monument associated with storing sacred relics.  In East Asia, the architecture of Chinese towers and Chinese pavilions blended into pagoda architecture, eventually also spreading to Southeast Asia. The pagoda's original purpose was to house relics and sacred writings. This purpose was popularized due to the efforts of Buddhist missionaries, pilgrims, rulers, and ordinary devotees to seek out, distribute, and extol Buddhist relics.These buildings (pagoda, stupa) became prominent as Buddhist monuments used for enshrining sacred relics.\n\n\n=== China ===\n\nEarliest base-structure type for Chinese pagodas were square-base and circular-base. By the 5th-10th centuries the Chinese began to build octagonal-base pagoda towers.  The highest Chinese pagoda from the pre-modern age is the Liaodi Pagoda of Kaiyuan Monastery, Dingxian, Hebei province, completed in the year 1055 AD under Emperor Renzong of Song and standing at a total height of 84 m (275 ft). Although it no longer stands, the tallest pre-modern pagoda in Chinese history was the 100-metre-tall wooden pagoda (330 ft) of Chang'an, built by Emperor Yang of Sui. The Liaodi Pagoda is the tallest pre-modern pagoda still standing, yet in April 2007 a new wooden pagoda at the Tianning Temple of Changzhou was opened to the public; this pagoda is now the tallest in China, standing at 154 m (505 ft).\n\n\n== Symbolism and geomancy ==\n\nChinese iconography is noticeable in Chinese pagoda as well as other East Asian pagoda architectures. Iconography of Han is noticeable in architecture of the Chinese Pagoda. The image of the Shakyamuni Buddha in the abhaya mudra is also noticeable in some Chinese pagodas. Buddhist iconography is also inside of the symbolism in the pagoda. In an article on Buddhist elements in Han art, Wu Hung suggests that in these tombs, Buddhist iconography was so well incorporated into native Chinese traditions that a unique system of symbolism had been developed.\nSome believed they would influence the success of young students taking the examinations for a civil service degree. When a pagoda of Yihuang County in Fuzhou collapsed in 1210 during the Song Dynasty, local inhabitants believed that the unfortunate event correlated with the recent failure of many exam candidates in the prefectural examinations for official degrees, the prerequisite for appointment in civil service. The pagoda was rebuilt in 1223 and had a list inscribed on it of the recently successful examination candidates, in hopes that it would reverse the trend and win the county supernatural favor.The image of Gautama Buddha in the abhaya mudr\u0101 is also noticeable in some Pagodas. Buddhist iconography can be observed throughout the pagoda symbolism. In an article on Buddhist elements in Han dynasty art, Wu Hung suggests that in these tombs, Buddhist symbolism was so well-incorporated into native Chinese traditions that a unique system of symbolism had been developed.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nPagodas attract lightning strikes because of their height. Many pagodas have a decorated finial at the top of the structure, and when made of metal, this finial, sometimes referred to as a \"demon-arrester\", can function as a lightning rod. Also Pagodas come in many different sizes, as some may be small and others may be large.Pagodas traditionally have an odd number of levels, a notable exception being the eighteenth century pagoda designed by Sir William Chambers at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London.\nThe pagodas in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia are very different from Chinese and Japanese pagodas. Pagodas in these countries are derived from Dravidian architecture.\n\n\n== Construction materials ==\n\n\n=== Wood ===\n\nFrom the Eastern Han Dynasty to the Southern and Northern Dynasties (c. 25\u2013589) pagodas were mostly built of wood, as were other ancient Chinese structures.  Wooden pagodas are resistant to earthquakes, however many have burnt down, and wood is also prone to both natural rot and insect infestation.\nExamples of wooden pagodas:\n\nWhite Horse Pagoda at White Horse Temple, Luoyang.\nFutuci Pagoda in Xuzhou, built in the Three Kingdoms period (c. 220\u2013265).\nMany of the pagodas in Stories About Buddhist Temples in Luoyang, a Northern Wei text, were wooden.The literature of subsequent eras also provides evidence of the domination of wooden pagoda construction in this period.  The famous Tang Dynasty poet, Du Mu, once wrote:\n\n480 Buddhist temples of the Southern Dynasties,\nuncountable towers and pagodas stand in the misty rain.The oldest extant fully wooden pagoda standing in China today is the Pagoda of Fugong Temple in Ying County, Shanxi Province, built in the 11th century during the Song Dynasty/Liao Dynasty (refer to Architecture section in Song Dynasty).\n\n\n=== Transition to brick and stone ===\n\nDuring the Northern Wei and Sui dynasties (386\u2013618) experiments began with the construction of brick and stone pagodas.  Even at the end of the Sui, however, wood was still the most common material.  For example, Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty (reigned 581\u2013604) once issued a decree for all counties and prefectures to build pagodas to a set of standard designs, however since they were all built of wood none have survived. Only the Songyue Pagoda has survived, a circular-based pagoda built out of stone in 523 AD.\n\n\n==== Brick ====\nThe earliest extant brick pagoda is the 40-metre-tall Songyue Pagoda in Dengfeng Country, Henan. This curved, circle-based pagoda was built in 523 during the Northern Wei Dynasty, and has survived for 15 centuries. Much like the later pagodas found during the following Tang Dynasty, this temple featured tiers of eaves encircling its frame, as well as a spire crowning the top. Its walls are 2.5 m thick, with a ground floor diameter of 10.6 m. Another early brick pagoda is the Sui Dynasty Guoqing Pagoda built in 597.\n\n\n==== Stone ====\nThe earliest large-scale stone pagoda is a Four Gates Pagoda at Licheng, Shandong, built in 611 during the Sui Dynasty. Like the Songyue Pagoda, it also features a spire at its top, and is built in the pavilion style.\n\n\n==== Brick and stone ====\nOne of the earliest brick and stone pagodas was a three-storey construction built in the (first) Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420), by Wang Jun of Xiangyang.  However, it is now destroyed.\nBrick and stone went on to dominate Tang, Song, Liao and Jin Dynasty pagoda construction. An example is the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda (652 AD), built during the early Tang Dynasty. The Porcelain Pagoda of Nanjing has been one of the most famous brick and stone pagoda in China throughout history.\nThe Zhou dynasty started making the ancient pagodas about 3,500 years ago.\n\n\n== De-emphasis over time ==\n\nPagodas, in keeping with the tradition of the White Horse Temple, were generally placed in the center of temples until the Sui and Tang dynasties.  During the Tang, the importance of the main hall was elevated and the pagoda was moved beside the hall, or out of the temple compound altogether.  In the early Tang, Daoxuan wrote a Standard Design for Buddhist Temple Construction in which the main hall replaced the pagoda as the center of the temple.\nThe design of temples was also influenced by the use of traditional Chinese residences as shrines, after they were philanthropically donated by the wealthy or the pious.  In such pre-configured spaces, building a central pagoda might not have been either desirable or possible.\nIn the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279), the Chan (Zen) sect developed a new 'seven part structure' for temples.  The seven parts\u2014the Buddha hall, dharma hall, monks' quarters, depository, gate, pure land hall and toilet facilities\u2014completely exclude pagodas, and can be seen to represent the final triumph of the traditional Chinese palace/courtyard system over the original central-pagoda tradition established 1000 years earlier by the White Horse Temple in 67. Although they were built outside of the main temple itself, large pagodas in the tradition of the past were still built. This includes the two Ming Dynasty pagodas of Famen Temple and the Chongwen Pagoda in Jingyang of Shaanxi Province.\nA prominent, later example of converting a palace to a temple is Beijing's Yonghe Temple, which was the residence of Yongzheng Emperor before he ascended the throne.  It was donated for use as a lamasery after his death in 1735.\n\n\n== Styles of eras ==\n\n\n=== Han Dynasty ===\nExamples of Han Dynasty era tower architecture predating Buddhist influence and the full-fledged Chinese pagoda can be seen in the four pictures below. Michael Loewe writes that during the Han Dynasty (202 BC \u2013 220 AD) period, multi-storied towers were erected for religious purposes, as astronomical observatories, as watchtowers, or as ornate buildings that were believed to attract the favor of spirits, deities, and immortals.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Sui and Tang ===\nPagodas built during the Sui and Tang Dynasty usually had a square base, with a few exceptions such as the Daqin Pagoda:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Dali kingdom ===\n\n\n=== Song, Liao, Jin, Yuan ===\nPagodas of the Five Dynasties, Northern and Southern Song, Liao, Jin, and Yuan Dynasties incorporated many new styles, with a greater emphasis on hexagonal and octagonal bases for pagodas:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ming and Qing ===\nPagodas in the Ming and Qing Dynasties generally inherited the styles of previous eras, although there were some minor variations:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Some notable pagodas ==\nTiered towers with multiple eaves:\n\nD\u00e2u Pagoda, B\u1eafc Ninh, Vietnam, built in 187.\nPashupatinath Temple, Kathmandu, Nepal built in the 5th century.\nTr\u1ea5n Qu\u1ed1c Pagoda, Hanoi, Vietnam, built in 545.\nSongyue Pagoda on Mount Song, Henan, China, built in 523.\nMireuksa at Iksan, Korea, built in the early 7th century.\nBunhwangsa at Gyeongju, Korea, built in 634.\nXumi Pagoda at Zhengding, Hebei, China, built in 636.\nDaqin Pagoda in China, built in 640.\nHwangnyongsa Wooden nine-story pagoda on Hwangnyongsa, Gyeongju, Korea, built in 645.\nPagoda at H\u014dry\u016b-ji, Ikaruga, Nara, Japan, built in the 7th century.\nGiant Wild Goose Pagoda, built in Xi'an, China in 704\nSmall Wild Goose Pagoda, built in Xi'an, China in 709.\nSeokgatap on Bulguksa, Gyeongju, Korea, built in 751.\nDabotap on Bulguksa, Gyeongju, Korea, built in 751.\nTiger Hill Pagoda, built in 961 outside of Suzhou, China\nLingxiao Pagoda at Zhengding, Hebei, China, built in 1045.\nIron Pagoda of Kaifeng, built in 1049, during the Song dynasty.\nLiaodi Pagoda of Dingzhou, built in 1055 during the Song dynasty\nPagoda of Fogong Temple, built in 1056 in Ying County, Shanxi, China.\nPizhi Pagoda of Lingyan Temple, Shandong, China, 11th century.\nBeisi Pagoda at Suzhou, Jiangsu, China, built in 1162.\nLiuhe Pagoda of Hangzhou, built in 1165, during the Song dynasty.\nIchij\u014d-ji, Kasai, Hy\u014dgo, Japan, built in 1171.\nThe Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, built between 1402 and 1424, a wonder of the medieval world in Nanjing, China.\nTsui Sing Lau Pagoda in Ping Shan, Hong Kong, built in 1486.\nDragon and Tiger Pagodas in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, built in 1976.\nSeven-storey Pagoda in Chinese Garden at Jurong East, Singapore, built in 1975.\nPazhou Pagoda on Whampoa (Huangpu) Island, Guangzhou (Canton), China, built in 1600.\nPagoda of the Celestial Lady, in Hu\u1ebf, Vietnam, built in 1601.\nPalsangjeon, a five-story pagoda at Beopjusa, Korea built in 1605.\nT\u014d-ji, the tallest wooden structure in Kyoto, Japan, built in 1644.\nNyatapola at Bhaktapur, Kathmandu Valley built during 1701\u20131702.\nThe Great Pagoda at Kew Gardens, London, UK, built in 1762.\nReading Pagoda of Reading, Pennsylvania, built in 1908.\nKek Lok Si's main pagoda in Penang, Malaysia, exhibits a combination of Chinese, Burmese and Thai Buddhist architecture, built in 1930.\nThe pagoda of Japan Pavilion at Epcot, Florida, built in 1982.\nPagoda of Tianning Temple, the tallest pagoda in the world since its completion in April 2007, stands at 153.7 m in height.\nNepalese Peace Pagoda in Brisbane, Australia built for the World Expo '88.\nPagoda Avalokitesvara, Indonesia, tallest pagoda in Indonesia, stands at 45 meters built in 2004.Stupas called \"pagodas\":\n\nGlobal Vipassana Pagoda, the largest unsupported domed stone structure in the world.\nMingun Pahtodawgyi, a monumental uncompleted stupa began by King Bodawpaya in 1790.

          "We stayed right across from this in the Westin so trekking to the top was a must. We did it on a Sat morning and it was pretty quiet crows wise but it was wet and cold morning so this may have been a factor The climb is not too hard and good views of the city from the top.",
          "The Da Ci'en Temple just outside this pagoda have staues of Buddha that fill the building height. Don't miss the walls of a temple on the left ( as you enter the complex) depicting the life of Buddha, with jade engravings of Buddha at various stages in his life are amazing.",
          "Da Ci'en Temple is the home of Giant Wild Goose Pagoda (tilted tower). The Pagoda is one of Xi'an's landmarks. Most Chinese landmarks have a dignified appeal. Most landmarks are ancient and revered. I love the steps leading to an imposing structure. Most Xian sights are",
          "We had a guide take us trough the Temple and this was a real advantage. We had a lovely guide and explained all the history of the place. Would recommend the guided tour.",
          "great photos at night. This doesn't have have much value except for helping a tourist know where things are at. This helped me find the Muslim Quarter",
          "Clearly a very interesting site to explore. We were there when monks were praying. Be respectful not to disturb.",
          "We had an interesting guide who told us all about this pagoda. It is old but there had been a previous one before, so the area had been used as a religious place for many centuries. The pagoda is leaning slightly.",
          "This Pagoda has a long history, and is noted for celebrating the best student scholar each year. Students all over China compete annually for this honor and only one per year is selected.",
          "An impressive structure with the added bonus of plenty of other buildings to see including a number of buddhist temples.",
          "Unlike many other pagodas.. it is truly old. Very much history. They have done a nice job in building around it. so there is plenty to do",
          "We did this tour as part of the Terracotta Warriors, Tina was our guide her knowledgewas outstanding, we had an awesome time.",
          "Beautiful during the day and the night. Betty, our tour guide did an amazing job of sharing all the highlights of Xi'an, including a Chinese hamburger!",
          "Lovely buildings and an amazing, rich culture can be seen here. Loved every minute!! Just some slight problems with access. :>",
          "Local tour guide explained this is the only original pagoda built in Ming Dynasty. Brilliant architecture, art work and history.",
          "The age and condition of this building are amazing as are the views from the top. Don't miss the story of Buddha in semi-precious stones in the complex. Fascinating.",
          "It s the main pagoda and monastery is city. The site is wonderful very rich in temples, gardens, monuments Though it s crowded it remains peaceful The area around mostly this very large and super long walking avenue is just astonishing... Great urban planning, beautiful",
          "This is the temple built by Tang Xan Zeng who made his way to India and back to bring back the Buddha scriptures and teachings. There were no monkey or pig in the real deal to accompany him on his journey. I would recommend that you engage a tour guide, officially they have",
          "It was an amazing g experience. The park, the pagoda was beautiful. The story was very interesting and we now u understand how Pagodas were used. Eye d orotecti g fron evil dragons",
          "Only downside is the distance from the centre of town. Longish ride on the Metro. Lovely space on a sunny day.",
          "The goose pagoda is over-rated. I rather go to the park next to it facing the mall. There are vibrant dances in the morning and men writing calligraphy on the floor. Have a real China daily experience. And visit the BU YE CHENG across the street from the square. It lights up",
          "This tourist site is a good way to understand the Chinese Buddhism. Take an English speaking guide after you enter the site. This will give you a good explanation of the temple site, pagoda, history and religion.",
          "So gorgeous in its simplicity, and understated elegance. After seeing this, do take a stroll across the main square at night. The contrast between the quiet serenity of the pagoda and the exuberance of the streets gives one a glimpse of the variety of Xi'an",
          "Standing since the Tang Dynasty, I love the pagoda for its clean sharp lines and minimalist design. This is so in contrast to the many elaborate Buddhist structures in China. It\u2019s also located in a bustling area worth visiting. I returned at night and it was beautifully",
          "This was an included visit on a group tour from UK. We spent around an hour here which we plenty of time to see all that was on offer, but if you wanted to climb the actual Pagoda there was a queue and extra admission fee so leave more time if you want to do this as well.",
          "I went there during National Holiday Week A must see in China! A beautiful place to visit in Xian, a historical magical place. You need 2 tickets there, one to enter and one to climb the pagoda there, the beauty of the evening is very good.",
          "Very beautiful ancient architectural site! We loved touring the pagoda and enjoyed the grounds. This temple is located near many restaurants and shopping as well.",
          "The Pagoda and its surrounding park and lake represent a very peaceful escape from the hectic city. The museum provides a very comprehensive explanation of the history and function of the buildings.",
          "Now located right next to big new modern shopping centres, it does not detract from the peace and serenity of this area. Beautiful architecture and still being a working temple, you will find peace here!",
          "Climbing the pagoda was a very nice experience. I went on 246 steps to the top. And the view over the park and the city was very beautyful.",
          "I've visited this place numerous times since 2011, but NEVER on a public holiday, like today... What a nightmare. 25 minutes in a quey to buy 40 RMB entry ticket, then following the sea of people who were only interested in taking photos and stopping everywhere causing crowding",
          "Saw this striking pagoda in the morning on a very wet 15 Sept 2019. Returned in the evening to view it and the structure was amazing! There were 2 frontiers to view it (one side is near to Westin). Check out the views from both sides. I will remember that night for a long long",
          "Dazzling during the night, people dancing in the square, souvenir shops around. The tower can only be visited during the day.",
          "We had a wander round as the waterfountains are every 2 hours. We went at around 6 but the lights were not on it was just the water Fountains to music which was nice. We decided to wait and wander and get something to eat until 8 so see if the coloured water fountains were",
          "If you have been to many temples before this one can be missed as you can see it from the outside. Inside is many rooms that tell stories about history and different buddhas If you pay more you can walk inside the pagoda",
          "Certainly worth seeing while in Xian but not a world-class site. We didn't walk to the top. Great photo op from the ground, however.",
          "Another long walk around the park and pagoda. Much to see! So much history in this area and look up! Admire all the architecture",
          "More things to do first than visit this pagoda, Xian warriors or the Xian wall We went there because the hotel was very near and can go walking but if not we won't.",
          "This impressive, well preserved piece of history is yet another example of how China looks after her historic sites. Just because you are there, take the effort to walk up to the top of the very narrow very steep staircase and enjoy the view.",
          "To me it was on a par with the terracotta warriors. The pagoda is one piece of a fairly large temple. If you get into the history of the place and spend time in the various rooms and galleries it will be enormously rewarding. Parts of it are overrun with selfie takers but others",
          "My family visited there on June 24 morning. It\u2019s great and nice place in Xi\u2019an. Guide from pagoda explained their history and place details. Then showing their office with hand painted wall papers and souvenirs shop for their fund. These hand painted wall papers were expensive",
          "Lovely Pagoda to see and an interesting history. Well worth going to see, we saw this via tour guide",
          "A visit to this place is worthwhile because besides the pagoda and the exhibits, you could visit the squares around it. The exhibits include translated buddhist sutras by XuanZang.",
          "Buddhist site, which consists of the Da Ci'en Temple and the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. Beautiful complex with several halls with statues and murals. You can enter the Pagoda (for an extra 25 RMB) and climb the stairs to the top floor which has amazing views.",
          "We visited on a very hot day Easy to find with good signage and you can see the pagoda from the metro station Tickets are purchased next to the entrance Not especially busy but remember that if you wish to enter / climb the pagoda you need to purchase that as an extra",
          "Your chances of getting into the nearby museum are slim, so use your time to come see the pagoda instead.",
          "Excellent example of original Buddhist temples ,not as well decorated as others but with original features",
          "This pagoda is associated with the monk Xuanzang who is also known as Hiuen Tsang in India. It's fascinating .",
          "I've been to other Buddhist temples in China which are much more beautiful, but this one is probably the most historic since it is tied to how Buddhism originally came to China (it's a non-native religion).",
          "Decided to stop by day before a trail race just outside the city. Glad I did. The sounds from the wind chimes on every eve of each level creates a cool mood when the breeze rolls in. The scriptures are no longer here. There are good views at the top after paying a separate",
          "THs temple is big of course....but it has a few surrounding buildings which are quite interesting and beautiful. One in particular has the story of. Buddha which is well worth seeing.",
          "It was fascinating to see the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. Serene to see the Buddha and the grounds were good and peaceful.",
          "Make sure you get to see the WATER DANCE EXHIBITION - I think its only two times per day. You will love the PAGODA!!!",
          "Worth visit if spare time in Xi\u2019an. Interesting to look at Buddha shrines and walk around. Had to pay extra to go up inside the pagoda.",
          "Beautiful pagoda. You can climb up all the way to the top of it. Of course in the summer, it becomes quite an exercise in profuse sweating!",
          "I love being able to experience ancient temples in China. They amazingly seem peaceful while at the same time being lively with tourists and adherents. The story of this one is well known, and it is cool to see the monument to the story. The grounds are lovely. I also like that",
          "One of the better pagodas I have visited in China. The restored buddha and building was beautiful with spectacular timber work and gilded features is great. You can't climb the pagoda but the grounds are well maintained.",
          "Transportation to this site but to go in was an extra charge. It was worth the cost to see everything.",
          "If you have time worth a visit. Large impressive area with lots of people as usual. The history of the place was interesting too",
          "The pagoda and the gardens that surround it are beautiful. Although the courtyard buildings are recently built by donors, they make a fine job of explaining the role of Buddhism in China\u2019s history.",
          "Very nice park. Beautiful fountains with dancing waters. Historic pagoda, lot of girls traditionally dressed. Worth an hour or two.",
          "Close to the provincial museum, there's plenty to see at the Big Wild Goose Pagoda. It was built in 645 AD to house Buddhist manuscripts brought to Xi'an by a monk, Xuan Zhang, who had travelled along the Silk Road to India. Despite communist rule since 1947, surprising numbers",
          "Taking a break from work, I strolled down by the Pagoda and was not aware of the upcoming treat for that afternoon. As I approached the Pagoda, I started to hear music slowly and growing in volume. As I got closer the wate rworks started with perfect beats to the music -- it",
          "This was one of my favorites. I loved the grounds and the beautiful temples displaying Buddha. Take time to stroll around and feel the vibe .",
          "We were astounded to learn of the various earthquakes that have affected this remarkable structure. Unfortunately it is now considerably shorter than it was originally but it is still very impressive. Make time to see the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda if you visit Xi'an.",
          "Extremely busy but worth a visit. I paid extra go walk up the pagoda and it was worth it for the view and to see inside the ancient structure.",
          "Was a nice place to visit, really loved the surrounding gardens. Did not go into the actual pagoda but the houses around the side. Certainly worth a visit.",
          "It may not impress much people who don't care for history. But if you have some geography notion and understand how close you are to the desert of Gobi, things start falling to place...",
          "Big Wild Goose Pagoda (Dayanta) On the top of the pagoda, you can see a nice view in panorama. As the symbol of the old-line Xi'an, Giant Wild Goose Pagoda (also called Big Wild Goose Pagoda) is a well-preserved ancient building and a holy place for Buddhists. It is located",
          "I ended up getting some great shots of the art work on the guard railing panels around the buildings and steps. You pay a lot of money to stand in line for hours to climb mega stairs up and down to get what? An aerial view of the grounds. Bring a drone, you will get better",
          "We spent some time walking through the Big Wild Goose Pagoda and what a beautiful time we had. Very quiet and peaceful with locals practising their Thai chi, the information about the place place was good, although more signs in a English would be better, we were lucky we had a",
          "The sheer size and historical value of the dayantan pagoda is amazing. Walk inside the complex or just stare it from the distance. The plaza outside the pagoda is beautifully designed. A must visit when you are in Xian.",
          "The ancient trees and the methods of keeping them is amazing. The story of the tower is amazing. The first earth quake it split in half the next quake it joined up again. Incredible ancient architecture",
          "This was \u2018another\u2019 pagoda on our tour but the sop was interesting and in the back we had a lesson in Chinese calligraphy. You could have your name written in Chinese as a souvenir",
          "The serenity is perfect. We went between 9-30am and 10am which is the time the monks pray so we could hear their chants which was memorizing. In addition, there were many people silently praying to several of the different buddha\u2019s in the various temples and lighting incense",
          "It was interesting to visit and hear the history. It is set in a relaxing park. We also visited the museum nearby.",
          "We were warned not to bother climbing it but still climbed. No views worth having. The Pagoda is worth seeing and the tombs at the side are interesting - ask your guide to show you",
          "Striking pagoda which is lit up at night in Xian. Very popular area at night with all the city lights and plenty of street activity. Worth visiting in the early evening, great atmosphere.",

          "The attraction is a short walk from the metro station. There\u2019s s musical fountain near the pagoda. Easy access to the Metro train network makes this city attractive for tourists. This pagoda was built during WuZeTian reign. The pagoda collapsed in the 1556 earthquake and",

          "The Big Wild Goose Pagoda is a recognised symbol of Xi'an all over China and is one of the few remaining sites in the city which are truly ancient. If you don't fancy climbing the pagoda itself you can just wonder around the grounds and shrines. Be wary if approached by",

          "The history of the area makes it worth visiting and the guide showed round the grounds and explained why it survived the cultural revolution. The pagoda itself is not part of the ticket so you are asked to pay to climb it. Despite being warned it wasn\u2019t worth it we did climb a",
          "It's just another pagoda in Asia. Nothing special about this one to be honest.. We went here during the evening so you could see the lights over the pagoda. While it was a nice sight for a few seconds it wasn't jaw dropping good. Ended up just passing it.",
          "I did the economy tour (self) but there are some good signs around to give you the key messages in the history and special nature of this 6th century religious site. The oldest of its kind in China. Well worth the 65 mitre stair climb to get to the top and great city views.",
          "We didn't go into the pagoda but stayed around the temples surrounding it. It is a very tranquil place and even with the crowds and the rain it was still a lovely experience.",
          "Found this site online and it looked cool and suggested we go. My father-in-law (who is from China) had never heard of it, so it was fun to take him somewhere he hadn't visited before. There's a big park with a fountain and statues right outside that is fun as well, before you",

          "The big thing about this site to me was not what was there, its nicely done and all, but somewhat typical of other places. The big thing was how well it is maintained. Most historical and ancient sites look, well, ancient.. with paint falling off or missing and needing various",

          "Another bit of interesting history - an ancient pagoda set in the middle of a nice park. There's a danger on a tour like this, of becoming saturated by all the history, but - as always - a good guide makes places come to life. the park was good to walk around and we enjoyed",
          "It\u2019s a nice place and a volunteer local guide provides good insight to the history. Xi\u2019an has so much to see and enjoy, that I wouldn\u2019t spend more than an hour here.",

          "It's seven stories tall with steep, narrow stairs, but we made it by going slowly. If you see any Tibetan monks, stop and get out of the way! Those guys are big! Great views and a good way to orient yourself to the city.",

          "This is a must see place in Xi\u2019an. The Buddhist statues are something to be seen. There is 2 payment entries. One to get into the area still under the Buddhists and the other to climb the pagoda which belongs to the government. While we didn\u2019t have the kindest day in terms of",
          "The grounds were beautiful but other temples in China are just as beautiful at a lower admission cost. To climb the pagoda there is an additional cost as well. There is a great local noodle shop across the street from the pagoda called First Noodle Under the Sun. Great stop for",

          "If you have time visiting the pagoda is worth doing. We caught the subway there. Easy to navigate and cheap. The square and parks surrounding the pagoda are lovely and there\u2019s lots going on. The pagoda itself is serene and worth it for the photos although its stairs all the way",
          "This place is south of the city walls, about a 10 min drive from the South Wall (traffic permitting). You can also reach the area through the metro, from the WeiYi (\u7eac\u4e00\u8857) stop and walk about 15-20 minutes to the entrance. The temple compound houses a number of Buddhist relics",

          "Beautiful gardens and a peaceful area in a busy city. The Pagoda has an interesting history and has been restored after earthquake damage. If you like history I would recommend a guide to explain its importance.",
          "Compared to other temple complexes in China this it not that special. Good view from the pagoda if you like that sort of thing. Not much in the way of explanations so take a guide or good guide book.",
          "I should have done more research about this place when i went because i didnt really know what i was looking at. There is an extra fee for going into the temple which i thought was lame other than that if you are in the area it is easy to get to with a lot of places to eat near",
          "Big Wild Goose Pagoda itself is nothing special, to be honest. But what makes a difference is: the view from the top of Pagoda (really nice to see Xian from the above) and gardens. They are really nice. I am not convinced that it is fair to pay 50 RMB for entrance and additional",
          "Nice visit but 50 Rmb doesn't deserve the price , much better to invest the money on street market on backside.",
          "We did not enter the Pagoda just saw the fountain show in front of it. It is for free. You should come earlier (at least 30 minutes) to have the place in the first row. The show started at 9 p.m. (september 2018)",
          "I really enjoyed the Pagoda. A must see if you are in Xi'an! Like everything else, there is a lot of history that makes it interesting, but the details/design/architecture are amazing.",

          "Probably would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't so hot, and right at the end of our tour. It's a tall building, lots of history, I would have liked to have gone back in the evening to see it lit up but there's just not enough time in a day.",

          "This was a highlight for us, after the warriors, in Xian. Very interesting history and nice complex with lots to see. We tried to find the fountain show but couldn\u2019t (even though we could hear the music) - signs aren\u2019t that easy to find!",

          "This attraction has a lot of historical significance. Proper scriptural buddism was introduced to China through here. The place is more for the link to history than spectacular on it's own. A whole infrastructure has been built around it to maximize convenience and to make",
          "I didn't enter the pagoda as it was closed but the water fountain lights show in the north square at 9pm was epic! It's the largest of its kind in Asia. The pagoda is in the background and looks stunning with lots of back lighting. The water and lights show lasts 20 minutes.",
          "Very impressiive indeed, green and friendly, beautifully restored, we had a wonderful tour with our excellent CITS guide Laura. Easy access, comfortable visit in the heart of the old city. Highly recommended.",
          "The temple is wonderful and well worth the visit. However, special attention needs to be drawn to their \"gift shop.\" They are not selling cheap trinkets but real handicraft made by the monks of the temple. We ending up purchasing three painting after spending over an hour",
          "A serene place with various small,temples. You can't actually go inside the pagoda or the temples. It good photo opportunity of the outside. We had a calligraphy demonstration and shown art work by the monks. Interesting enough.",
          "The Great Wild Goose Pagoda is located in a large open area with plenty of space to walk around. An excellent example of the Tang Dynasty. The pagoda is a seven story structure built to store the tablets bought back by a famous monk. It is nice to walk though the adjacent",
          "My impression was to see this from a distance. Stand at Grand Gateway after walking up to the smaller pagoda. Think about how far it was for those traveling from inside the wall by horse and carriage. Back before all the land development.",
          "Good to get an insight of the religion from Robbie and my husband was brave enough to climb the tower.",
          "This is a very interesting Buddhist Pagoda. It was built around 652 and has survived. The area around the pagoda is extremely pretty. Great area to walk around and gather your thoughts. There is a giant bell that can be rung for a small fee. Nice place.",
          "There is so much history in China and it is all very interesting, if you are in Xian there are some good restaurants in the area, so visit the Pagoda and have a great lunch or dinner!",
          "Since most of the temples were destroyed during the cultural revolution, this one survived and is worth a quick visit. Check out the gift shop that sells jade items at a much better price than the government stores.",
          "A quick visit would be all I needed. Long walks to see the same were no longer very much wanted. If one has a special interest in pagodas it is certainly worth visiting but just more of the same, in my opinion.",
          "This is a very busy attraction but it was ok for us the day we visited. Be prepared to have your bags scanned and passports checked everywhere you go.",
          "Easy to get to taxi or metro. Both stop at the end of the pathway to the pagodas.It can be busy to get tickets as the office is around the other side about 10 min walk.We took and passports and asked for senior rates. We were told it was free.Not sure if this was usual for",
          "The gardens are just lovely and the Pagoda is an amazing structure. I loved listening to the bells tinkling in the breeze. I don\u2019t recommend visiting in July or August. It\u2019s was incredibly hot and full of thousands of people.",
          "It is an impressivbuilding to admirewith plenty of history. It is close to some other attractions too.",
          "The Pagoda was good to see but dont stay an extra night just to see it! The history is fantastic and the light show is cool but unlike the Terracotta army its not a must see.",
          "A small entry fee but so much to see including other areas such as the Small Wild Goose Pagoda . Tranquil gardens . Allow at least 2 hrs. More if you have time.",
          "This is a lovely park like area with pretty buildings. I especially enjoyed the souvenir stands down the street.",
          "One of the premier sites in China. You don't have to climb the Pagoda to enjoy this beautiful Buddhist temple.",
          "The offering around the Big Pagoda is a must see. The offering is incredible. This is a big show in summer. I have not enough words to explain all of it",

          "Great visit, though very hot! Gardens around shady. Lots of flights of wooden stairs to climb but view in all directions was interesting. Not too busy Kate afternoon when we arrived but if any busier would not have enjoyed climbing narrow steps",
          "I recommend going here. But I highly recommend being led around the structure by one of the guides who work there. They will explain the history, art and buildings of the Pagoda and journeys of the monks very well. Places like these need the background information to bring",
          ".another have to visit tourist spot, protected very well, even chinese visitors come to this place when they are in town.",
          "The jade screens depicting the story of Buddha was the best thing, although we were kinda temples out by that point on our trip. The worst thing was getting swarmed by high pressure sales people in the gift shop - stay away from the gift shop because it wasn't worth it.",
          "Recommend going at night. Lovely evening. Shopping available if that\u2019s what you like. This was close to our hotel so we walked but would recommend for anyone.",
          "The ticket office at the entrance only sells tickets for entry to everything except to climb the pagoda. Due to how hot the day was I chose only to walk around the grounds and look into temples which was very pleasant and as I was working only 2 blocks away it was a great way",
          "the history of this building is very interesting and the views around it are just as impressive we really enjoyed our visit here.",
          "what an amazing building... we chose the Buddhist tour guide option... there's is so much history there that you would miss the essence of what the place is all about...so it's a better option to choose this.. they have ypu opportunity to choose the best foto spots and took time",
          "Very beautiful place...was there for 21 days and still couldn\u2019t get enough. The park is home to international and local festivals (art performances) The pagodas are so beautiful at night...as you can see from the pictures. Carry an umbrella as the rains start from as early",
          "The tower standing alone by itself, when I look at the building, the old bricks showing all the history in the past thousands of years, make me think of human, we only live up to 100 years? Compared with the history, we won\u2019t be there and no one even know\ud83e\udd14",

          "The pagoda is famous and the oldest site in the town (I believe). But go at night when the surrouding area lights up under mutli-colored lights. Walked up and down the main street south of the pagoda to see various street players playing things from anxient Chinese melodies to",

          "Although our trip included many temples the Wild Goose complex was one of the more interesting. There were actual monks walking around (which you won't see at some temples) which added to the atmosphere",
          "Try to spend a bit longer & explore the grounds& the lake area , the calligraphy shop . An oasis after a v tiring day.",
          "It makes sense that Buddhism came to China at the start of the silk road. The Big Wild Goose pagoda serves as the library and most prominent building to one of the oldest Buddhist temples in China. It is a great place to visit and has an extensive park around it, which fills",

          "We were here early in the morning so it was a lovely pleasant time to walk through this area, we had a guide who was extremely knowledgeable about the history of Xian and China, this made it an even better experience. If you have the chance to visit then you should do it.",

          "With so many pagodas and temples in the area, this is one of the bigger ones and really nice, bit of a tourist trap with all the shops inside and the temptation to buy, which I admit I did purchase some nice prints, but worth it.",
          "Another place of calm in a historic area. Lots to see the bell tower and Buddhist pavilions. The pagoda you have to pay to go in and climb. It has nothing inside now. The smaller goose pagoda is better.",
          "An historical monument that is well worth a visit. It is a tough climb to the top but worthwhile as you can see the city from 4 directions. There is an excellent fountain display every hour.",
          "We got an English guide that was great! Knew so much as his Dad had brought him to the temple weekly as a child. Very interesting for history buffs - a warning he did talk us into a contribution of painting by monks but reasonable price & not a hard sell-w painting we received",
          "Big and little goose pagoda are similar, one is just taller than the other. None the less, a pleasant stroll.",
          "This is an interesting temple area - with the Big Wild Goose Pagoda at the north end. There is not much inside the buildings, but it is worth reading the story of the monk who had the pagoda built.",
          "Peaceful and away from the main road, thus was an interesting visit. I was also able to find some real espresso in a cafe onsite BUT the big surptise was the fountain display in the square to modern Chinese music. For me it was quite emotional and beautiful. I believe it only",

They\u2019re basically the Chinese imperial style but housing some wonderful and beautiful Buddha statues. For me, exceptional would be an understatement.",

          "Around 8pm in the evenings (times can be found easily online) there is a water fountain show in front of the pagoda with impressive lights and music to match. Get there a bit before to ensure a good spot to view. It lasts about 20 minutes and is wonderful to watch. Some locals",

          "We visited the Big Wild Goose Pagoda with a group. The grounds are neat but are similar to many of the other temples in China. One thing that was unique about this area was the drawing/painting class with the Monk's. I would highly recommend you set up 30 minutes with them, if",

          "We climbed the 7 floors to the top of the Pagoda. Super views from each window. The temple is used and monks go about their life. We had a guide that told us history and pointing out the interesting facts. Worthwhile site to see if you have time.",
          "Two impressive rooms, among several, were those containing full walls of jade sculpture depicting the life of the Buddha, and the room with full walls of copper engraving depicting the travels of a famous Buddhist monk. The pagoda itself is very old, and no longer open to the",

          "Beautiful temple. Cost 50rmb to entry and then 30rmb for the pagoda temple. Took 610 bus from Drum tower for 2rmb. Then 2 km walk to Temple. The entry would be good enough to see all the Buddha history and all the themes of each room. The pagoda was not worth the 30rmb",
          "It's like lots of pagodas across China, with its stairs to climb to a viewing spots along the way. There is history to the pagoda, of course. And the grounds are very nice.",

          "I went here back in June of 2016 because I heard many things about this place. I must say it is very beautiful the space in which the pagoda is in. The different buildings you enter there will be different idols where people would pray. What I did not like is when I entered the",
          "We could see this Pagoda from a distance. A great look. It also had an Indian Connection since it was one of the first Buddhist temple in China which was built by Yuen Tung after returning from India. During his India trip he embraced Buddhism.",
          "We visited here as part of a guided tour, and luckily so, as the pagoda is not accessible. We were interested to learn its story, but not to be actually allowed inside was a disappointment. The surrounding streets held some interesting shops which our local guide was able to",
          "This was a very tall pagoda with many interesting buildings around it. The buildings had many statues of Buddha in them and a history of Buddhism. In one there was a ceremony with Buddhist Monks chanting in front of a statue of Buddha.",
          "This was avery interesting outing - enjoyed it! It was a very tall pagoda and could be seen for a long way.",
          "If you have seen and know what a pagoda is like, then there is no need to waste time and effort to go there as all pagodas are the same. Even the locals that I met have commented that it\u2019s nothing inside just one tower sitting there. But if you choose go to xi an museum instead",

          "This park is a gathering place for the locals and as such the people watching and interaction if you want it makes it worthwhile. Xian was a lovely place compared to Beijing. It was still large with 9 million people but we had clear skies and happy people on Sunday in the park.",
          "This is a lovely historic place where you can learn about Buddhism. It is crazy during Golden Week/Mid-Autumn Festival. It's $15.03 USD for 2 adult tickets to get into the complex. It is extra to go into the pagoda tower itself. We didn't go because the line was insane, but",
          "This is an operating temple. It is absolutely beautiful. The monks were present in large numbers and added to the feeling of sanctidy and warmth. The pagoda has been wonderfully preserved and is quiet and peaceful.",
          "The fountain show at every night is must to go. The night view is great. Many people will come to the North Square of Wild Goose to see music fountain show every night. It only take less than $10 by taxi from city center.",

          "I guess in many cities this site wouldn't make it to first 50... but since Xi'an is so uninteresting it's a top 5 ;). Pagoda looks very poor and the park around is full of concrete. Nothing special. It could use some renovations and you cannot climb it. Additionally this",

          "After seeing both the big and small pagoda's I found this one more impressive that the little one. It may not be in such a nice/traditional setting but is more striking to the eye. Both are worth seeing but if time is limited, see this one.",
          "I have seen so many more interesting pagodas... This was rather disappointing. Besides, after paying for the ticket entrance, if you want to go inside the pagoda, you have an additional ticket. Not worth it, I can tell you.",
          "We visited this pagoda on a very wet day but it was still special, one of the best pagodas I have seen anywhere!! The complex is huge with amazing history, temple and gallery that helps to fund the temple. We had an English speaking guide who was extremely knowledgeable and who",

          "The park outside is beautiful. We paid the RMB50 to get in and the entrance was definitely not worth it. Most things are in Chinese so we were just looking and not knowing anything. Plus, as another review said, photos were restricted in many places. It was also an extra RMB30",
          "We thought the Pagoda was beautiful, but there has been heavy restorations (top two floors and outside wall) added. The building itself is practically empty and not worth the additional fee to go inside",

          "Has great cultural significance to Chinese buddhism. I would integrate it as part of a tour if given the chance or was staying a couple of days. Many photos unable to be taken out of respect of the wishes of the pagoda signs, as with many temples in China. Great park, shops and",

          "The Pagoda and accompanying temple complex is a great idea for a quiet afternoon out. Lots to see and places to walk. The Pagoda isn't included in the temples entry fee. We didn't feel it was worth the added expense but the temple was lovely and really interesting.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Great Mosque of Xi'an (Chinese: \u897f\u5b89\u5927\u6e05\u771f\u5bfa; pinyin: X\u012b \u0100n D\u00e0 Q\u012bng Zh\u0113n S\u00ec) is the largest mosque in China. It was first built in the year 742 AD. An active place of worship within Xi'an Muslim Quarter, this courtyard complex is also a popular tourist site. The majority of the mosque was built during the early Ming dynasty. It now houses more than twenty buildings in its five courtyards, and covers 12,000 square metres.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe mosque is also known as the Huajue Mosque (Chinese: \u5316\u89c9\u5df7\u6e05\u771f\u5bfa; pinyin: Hu\u00e0 Ju\u00e9 Xi\u00e0ng Q\u012bng Zh\u0113n S\u00ec), for its location on 30 Huajue Lane. It is sometimes called the Great Eastern Mosque (Chinese: \u4e1c\u5927\u5bfa; pinyin: D\u014dng D\u00e0 S\u00ec), as well, because it sits east of another of Xi\u2019an's oldest mosques, Daxuexi Alley Mosque (Chinese: \u5927\u5b66\u4e60\u5df7\u6e05\u771f\u5bfa; pinyin: D\u00e0 Xu\u00e9 X\u00ed Xi\u00e0ng Q\u012bng Zh\u0113n S\u00ec).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe mosque was constructed during the Hongwu reign of the Ming dynasty, with further additions during the Qing dynasty. Previous religious complexes (Tanmingsi and Huihui Wanshansi) are known to have stood on the same site, dating to as early as the Tang dynasty.Islam was introduced to China during the Ming Dynasty in the seventeenth century, but went into full effect during the Qing Dynasty in 1644. When trying to integrate the different groups of people, people would gravitate more towards Chinese tradition due to feelings of superiority. During the 1700s, Muslim freedom of worship was limited, the ritual slaughtering of animals were forbidden, new mosques and the pilgrimage to Mecca was prohibited in the year 1731. After the Chinese Communist Party won the Chinese Civil War the Mosque was shut down and converted into a steel factory.In 1956, the mosque was declared a Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the Shaanxi Province Level, and was later promoted to a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level in 1988.\nThe mosque is still used as a place of worship by Chinese Muslims, primarily Hui people. Just the main hall of the Great Mosque of Xi\u2019an can accommodate 1,000 people yet today a typical service only attracts around 100.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe mosque is a walled complex of five courtyards, with the prayer hall located in the fourth courtyard. Each courtyard contains a central monument, such as a gate, and is lined with greenery as well as subsidiary buildings. The first courtyard, for instance, contains a Qing dynasty monumental gate, while the fourth courtyard houses the Phoenix Pavilion, a hexagonal gazebo. Many walls throughout the complex are filled with inscriptions of birds, plants, objects, and text, both in Chinese and Arabic. Stone steles record repairs to the mosque and feature calligraphic works. In the second courtyard, two steles feature scripts of the calligrapher Mi Fu of the Song dynasty and Dong Qichang, a calligrapher of the Ming dynasty.\n\nThe Xingxin Tower is located in the third courtyard, which contains many steles form ancient times. This courtyard is for visitors to attend prayer services. The fourth courtyard has a bigger prayer hall which can seat more than a thousand people. Overall, the mosque's architecture, like the majority of Hui Chinese mosques, combines a traditional Chinese architectural form with Islamic functionality. For example, whereas traditional Chinese buildings align along a north\u2013south axis in accordance with feng shui, the mosque is directed west towards Mecca, while still conforming to the axes of the imperial city. Furthermore, calligraphy in both Chinese and Arabic writing appears throughout the complex, sometimes exhibiting a fusion of styles called Sini, referring to Arabic text written in Chinese-influenced script. Some scholars also speculate that the three-story, octagonal pagoda in the third courtyard, called the Shengxinlou or \u201cExamining the Heart Tower,\u201d originally served as the mosque's minaret, used for the call to prayer.The prayer hall is a monumentally sized timber building with a turquoise hip roof, painted dougong (wooden brackets), a six-pillared portico, and five doors. It is raised upon a large stone platform lined with balustrades. The expansive prayer hall consists of three conjoined buildings, set one behind the other. Interior ornamentation is centered on the rear qibla wall, which has wooden carvings of floral and calligraphic designs.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nIslam in China\nTimeline of Islamic history\nList of the oldest mosques in the world\nList of famous mosques\nList of mosques in China\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDescription of the Great Mosque of Xi'an\nAsian Historical Architecture: Great Mosque\nHuajuexiang Mosque in Xian (Masterpiece of Islamic Architecture)\nGreat Mosque of Xi'an (islamic-arts.org)",

        "wiki": "Xi'an (UK:  shee-AN, US:  shee-AHN; Chinese: [\u0255\u00ed.\u00e1n] (listen)), also known as Sian, is the capital of Shaanxi Province. A sub-provincial city on the Guanzhong Plain in Northwest China, it is one of the oldest cities in China, the oldest prefecture capital and one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals, having held the position under several of the most important dynasties in Chinese history, including Western Zhou, Qin, Western Han, Sui and Tang. Xi'an is the starting point of the Silk Road and home to the Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shi Huang.Since the 1980s, as part of the economic growth of inland China especially for the central and northwest regions, the city of Xi'an has re-emerged as a cultural, industrial, and educational centre of the entire central-northwest region, with many facilities for research and development, national security and space exploration. Xi'an currently holds sub-provincial status, administering 11 districts and 2 counties. As of 2018 Xi'an has a population of 12,005,600 and the Xi'an\u2013Xianyang metropolitan area a population of 12.6 million. It is the most populous city in Northwest China, as well as the third most populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Chengdu. In 2019, it was named as one of the 7 main emerging megacities, or megalopolises, in China and designated as a metropolis that also consists of areas surrounding the city itself (citation needed). According to GaWC 2020, Xi\u2019an is ranked Beta-, an increase from Gamma last year. \n\n\n== Name ==\n\"Xi'an\" is the atonal pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of its name \u897f\u5b89, which means \"Western Peace\". (The apostrophe \u2013 known in Chinese as a \u9694\u97f3\u7b26\u865f, g\u00e9y\u012bn f\u00fah\u00e0o \u2013 should be included to distinguish its pronunciation from the single syllable xian.) The name was adopted in 1369 under the early Ming dynasty. Jesuit missionaries recorded its name as \"Si-ngan\" or \"Si-ngan-fou\" from its status as the seat of a prefecture (\u5e9c, f\u01d4). This form still appears in the Latin name of the Catholic diocese of Xi'an, archidioecesis Singanensis. The name was later romanized as \"Hsi-an\" by Wade & Giles and as \"Sianfu\" or \"Sian\" by the Qing imperial post office, both of which were common until the general adoption of pinyin.\nThe area of present-day Xi'an has been the site of several important former Chinese cities. The capital of the Western Zhou were the twin cities of Feng and Hao, known collectively as Fenghao, located on opposite banks of the Feng River at its confluence with the southern bank of the Wei in the western suburbs of present-day Xi'an. The Qin capital Xianyang was erected north of the Wei during the Warring States period and was succeeded by the Western Han capital of Chang'an (\u9577\u5b89), meaning \"Perpetual Peace\", which was located south of the Wei and covered the central area of present-day Xi'an. During the Eastern Han, Chang'an was also known as Xijing (\u897f\u4eac) or the \"Western Capital\", relative to its position to the main capital at Luoyang. Under the Sui, its name became Daxing (\u5927\u8208, \"Greatly Prosperous\") in AD 581. Under the Tang, the name reverted to Chang'an in 618. Under the Mongolian Yuan dynasty (13th & 14th centuries), it held a succession of names: Fengyuan (\u5949\u5143), Anxi (\u5b89\u897f, \"Peaceful West\"), and Jingzhao (\u4eac\u5146). The Ming name \"Xi'an\" was changed back to Xijing (\"Western Capital\", as above) between 1930 and 1943.\nXi'an currently does not have a widely accepted one-character abbreviation as many other Chinese cities do. Its license plates are simply marked with \u9655A, based on the name of its province.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nXi'an has a rich and culturally significant history. The Lantian Man was discovered in 1963 in Lantian County, 50 km (31 mi) southeast of Xi'an, and dates back to at least 500,000 years before the present time. A 6,500-year-old Neolithic village, Banpo, was discovered in 1953 on the eastern outskirts of the city proper, which contains the remains of several well organized Neolithic settlements carbon dated to 5600\u20136700 years ago. The site is now home to the Xi'an Banpo Museum, built in 1957 to preserve the archaeological collection.\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nXi'an became a cultural and political centre of China in the 11th century BC with the founding of the Zhou dynasty. The capital of Zhou was established in the twin settlements of Fengjing (\u4e30\u4eac) and Haojing, together known as Fenghao, located southwest of contemporary Xi'an. The settlement was also known as Z\u014dngzh\u014du to indicate its role as the capital of the vassal states. In 770 BC, the capital was moved to Luoyang due to political unrest.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nFollowing the Warring States period, China was unified under the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) for the first time, with the capital located at Xianyang, just northwest of modern Xi'an. The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang ordered the construction of the Terracotta Army and his mausoleum just to the east of Xi'an almost immediately after his ascension to the throne.In 202 BC, the founding emperor Liu Bang of the Han dynasty established his capital in Chang'an County; his first palace, Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae, \"Perpetual Happiness\") was built across the river from the ruin of the Qin capital. This is traditionally regarded as the founding date of Chang'an. Two years later, Liu Bang built Weiyang Palace (\u672a\u592e\u5bae, \"Never Ending Palace\") north of modern Xi'an. Weiyang Palace was the largest palace ever built on Earth, covering 4.8 square kilometres (1,200 acres), which is 6.7 times the size of the current Forbidden City and 11 times the size of the Vatican City. The original Xi'an city wall was started in 194 BC and took 4 years to finish. Upon completion, the wall measured 25.7 km (15.97 mi) in length and 12 to 16 m (39.37\u201352.49 ft) in thickness at the base, enclosing an area of 36 km2 (13.90 sq mi). In the year 190, amidst uprisings and rebellions just prior to the Three Kingdoms Period, a powerful warlord named Dong Zhuo moved the court from Luoyang to Chang'an in a bid to avoid a coalition of other powerful warlords against him.\nFollowing several hundred years of unrest, the Sui dynasty united China again in 582. The emperor of Sui ordered a new capital to be built southeast of the Han capital, called Daxing. It consisted of three sections: the Imperial City, the palace section, and the civilian section, with a total area of 84 km2 (32 sq mi) within the city walls. At the time, it was the largest city in the world. The city was renamed Chang'an by the Tang dynasty. In the mid-7th century, after returning from his pilgrimage to India, the Buddhist monk Xuanzang established a translation centre for Sanskrit scriptures.\nConstruction of the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda began in 652. This pagoda was 64 m (209.97 ft) in height, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras obtained from India by Xuanzang. In 707, construction of the Small Wild Goose Pagoda began. This pagoda measured 45 m (147.64 ft) tall at the time of completion, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras by Yijing. The massive 1556 Shaanxi earthquake eventually damaged the tower and reduced its height to 43.4 m (142.39 ft).The Nestorian Stele is a Tang Chinese stele erected in 781 that documents 150 years of early Christianity in China. It is a 279 cm tall limestone block with text in both Chinese and Syriac describing the existence of Christian communities in several cities in northern China. It reveals that the initial Nestorian Christian church had met recognition by the Tang Emperor Taizong, due to efforts of the Christian missionary Alopen in 635.Chang'an was devastated at the end of the Tang dynasty in 904. Residents were forced to move to the new capital city in Luoyang. Only a small area in the city continued to be occupied thereafter. During the Ming dynasty, a new wall was constructed in 1370 and remains intact to this day. The wall measures 11.9 km (7.4 mi) in circumference, 12 m (39.37 ft) in height, and 15 to 18 m (49.21\u201359.06 ft) in thickness at the base; a moat was also built outside the walls. The new wall and moat would protect a much smaller city of 12 km2 (4.6 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn October 1911, during the Xinhai revolution, revolutionaries attacked the Manchu fort in Xi'an city. Xinhai forces stormed the fort, killing some 20,000 Manchus, therefore successfully liquidated the entire population of Manchus in Xi'an city. The Hui Muslim community of northwestern China was divided in its support for the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. The Hui Muslims of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries and the Hui Muslims of Gansu supported the Qing.  The native Hui Muslims (Mohammedans) of Xi'an joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the Manchus. Only some wealthy Manchus who were ransomed and Manchu females survived. Wealthy Han Chinese seized Manchu girls to become their slaves and poor Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women to be their wives. Young pretty Manchu girls were also seized by Hui Muslims of Xi'an during the massacre and brought up as Muslims.A British missionary who witnessed the massacre commented that \"Old and young, men and women, children alike, were all butchered... Houses were plundered and then burnt; those who would fain have laid hidden till the storm was past, were forced to come out into the open. The revolutionaries, protected by a parapet of the wall, poured a heavy, unceasing, relentless fire into the doomed Tartar (Manchu) city, those who tried to escape thence into the Chinese city were cut down as they emerged from the gates.\"In 1936, the Xi'an Incident took place inside the city during the Chinese Civil War. The incident brought the Kuomintang (KMT) and Communist Party of China to a truce in order to concentrate on fighting against the Japanese Invasion. On May 20, 1949, the Communist-controlled People's Liberation Army captured the city of Xi'an from the Kuomintang force.Xi'an made headlines for being one of the many cities where the 2012 China anti-Japanese demonstrations occurred.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nXi'an lies on the Guanzhong Plain in the south-central part of Shaanxi province, on a flood plain created by the eight surrounding rivers and streams. The city has an average elevation of 400 metres (1,312 ft) above sea level and an annual precipitation of 553 mm (21.8 in). The urban area of Xi'an is located at 34\u00b016\u2032N 108\u00b056\u2032E. The Wei River provides potable water to the city.\nThe city borders the northern foot of the Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the south, and the banks of the Wei River to the north. Hua Shan, one of the five sacred Taoist mountains, is located 100 km (62 mi) away to the east of the city. Not far to the north is the Loess Plateau.\nAt the beginning of Han dynasty, Prime Minister Zhang Liang advised the emperor Liu Bang to choose Guanzhong as the capital of the Han dynasty: \"Guanzhong Plain, which is located behind Xiao Pass and Hangu Pass, connects Long (Gansu) and Shu (Sichuan). Lands of thousand miles rich in harvest be found here, as if this place belongs to the nation of heaven.\" (\u5173\u4e2d\u5de6\u5d24\u51fd\uff0c\u53f3\u9647\u8700\uff0c\u6c83\u91ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u6b64\u6240\u8c13\u91d1\u57ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd\u4e5f) Since then, Guanzhong is also known as the 'Nation of the Heaven'.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nXi'an has a temperate climate that is influenced by the East Asian monsoon, classified under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification as situated on the borderline between a semi-arid climate (BSk) and humid subtropical climate (Cwa). The Wei River valley is characterised by hot, humid summers, cold, dry winters, and dry springs and autumns. Most of the annual precipitation is delivered from July to late October. Snow occasionally falls in winter but rarely settles for long. Dust storms often occur during March and April as the city rapidly warms up. Summer months also experience frequent but short thunderstorms. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from around the freezing mark in January to 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 14.08 \u00b0C (57.3 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 31 percent in December to 47 percent in August, the city receives 1,536 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221220.6 \u00b0C (\u22125 \u00b0F) on January 11, 1955 to 41.8 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on June 21, 1998. A highest record of 42.9 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) was registered in another station on June 17, 2006.\n\n\n=== National Time Service Centre ===\nThe Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory was established in 1966. In 1975, according to the Geodetic Origin Report of the People's Republic of China, 'in order to avoid bias in the mensuration as much as possible, the Geodetic Origin would be in central mainland China.' Lintong (\u4e34\u6f7c), a town near Xi'an was chosen. Since 1986, Chinese Standard Time (CST) was set from NTSC. The NTSC in Lintong is 36 km (22 mi) away from Xi'an.\n\nNational Time Service Centre (NTSC), the Chinese Academy of Sciences is an institute which is mainly engaged in the service and research on time and frequency. NTSC takes charge of generating and maintaining the national standard time scale, disseminating the time and frequency signals. The autonomous standard time scales of universal time and atomic time and the dissemination techniques with LF radio and HF radio were established successively during the 1970s and 1980s, which meet all the requirements for different applications on the whole, such as the scientific researches, national economy, etc.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2007 Xi'an has a population of 4.07 million.\nCompared to the census data from 2000, the population has increased by 656,700 persons to 4.05;million. In contrast, the population in 2010 has steadily increased to 8.7 million and in 2016 the population is somewhat near 9 million for permanent residents.  The population is 51.66 percent male and 48.34 percent female. Among its districts, Yanta has the largest population, with 1.08 million inhabitants.The encompassing Xi'an-Xianyang metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 12.9 million, and locally as 13,569,700, of which 5,740,000 is urban.The majority of Xi'an residents are Han Chinese, who make up 99.1 percent of the city's total population. There are around 81,500 people belonging to ethnic minorities living in Xi'an, including 50,000 Hui people.During World War II, Xi'an became a destination for many refugees from other provinces of China, especially neighboring Henan Province. Because Xi'an was far inland, the invading Japanese army only managed a few aerial assaults on the city. As a result, Xi'an suffered minimal destruction. After 1949, the national government tried to balance the development in different regions of China, and relocated a number of factories and universities from other cities to Xi'an. Modern Xi'an Jiaotong University was relocated from its original campus in Shanghai.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Xi'an has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts and 2 counties:\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nXi'an has many areas that are easily accessible on foot.

A bicycle-sharing network started operating in 2013 and today has 52,000 bikes, used by over 200,000 people per day. Taxi services are numerous, but many citizens of Xi'an still commute to work using the city's 270 official municipal bus routes serviced by a fleet of over 7,800 buses, with an average system-wide ridership of over 4 million people per day. The bus network is complemented by a rapidly expanding subway system that carries over 1.5 million commuters per day. There are more than 2 million registered automobiles in Xi'an; the growing number of personal automobiles also means traffic jams are a common urban issue.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nLine 2, running through the city from north (North Railway Station) to south (Weiqu Nan), was the first line opened to the public on September 16, 2011. Operations began on September 28, 2011. This line is 19.9 kilometres (12.4 miles) long with 17 stations. Line 1 opened on September 15, 2013.

The Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an high-speed railway also serves Xi'an. Construction work began on September 25, 2005, the railway opened for service on February 6, 2010. The railway has made air service between Zhengzhou and Xi'an uncompetitive. All passenger flights between the two cities were suspended within 48 days of start of regular high-speed rail service.\n\n\n=== Expressways ===\nXi'an currently has three ring road systems, the Second Ring road and the Third Ring road which encircle the city. These ring roads are similar to freeways, except where there are traffic signals on the Second Ring road.\nAs a tourist city, Xi'an has built expressways to Lintong, Tongchuan and Baoji, with well-maintained roads to famous scenic spots in suburban counties and to the north slope of the Qin Mountains. Since its construction in September 2007, the G5 Beijing\u2013Kunming Expressway connects Hanzhong and Xi'an through the Qinling.\n\nChina National Highway 108\nChina National Highway 210\nChina National Highway 211\nChina National Highway 312\n\n\n=== Air ===\nXi'an Xianyang International Airport (airport code: XIY) is the major airport serving the city and it is the largest airport in the northwestern part of China.

          "Because of the short free time spent in Xi'an we choose Shaanxi Museum as one of the must do experience. We were scared at the beginning seeing the long queue at the entrance but we were helped by a staff person, very nice and kind, that helped us to enter quick even without",
          "The ticket for the exhibition of Hejiacun Treasure is only 30RMB, and it also hosts most of the must-see collections of this museum! A pity the ticket for Tang\u2019s mural is 300RMB, which I think it is expensive. The museum is fine, but a bit crowded and the collections are less",
          "We were on a private tour of Xian so ur local guide got us the tickets and handed us over to the museum guide. The exhibits were nice, it is crowded but definitely much more pleasant than the terracotta museum!",
          "It is kinda troublesome to get the ticket but the exhibits in the museum make it worth while. As the place is usually crowded, do plan more time to be in the museum. Hiring a guide from the museum is a good option, as not every piece will have full detail information",
          "We tried to visit this museum, but it seemed impossible to get in if you're not Chinese. After being passed to various information counters, I was eventually informed that you need to reserve a ticket in advance on WeChat. When I mentioned that I don't have WeChat, I was told to",
          "A decent museum if you are interested in history. can get very crowded as the morning tickets are free.",
          "One of the best museum I have ever visited (and I have done quite a few...). Presentations are clear, going through the history of the region (starting with prehistoric relics which are 3-4'000 yrs old). They really did a good work in presenting world-class artefacts. The",
          "I am not a big museum person, but this one did have some pretty good displays. Logistically though it has two drawbacks. First is getting in the first place. They give out a certain number of free tickets each day but you have to get there really really early to get them.",
          "You need to make reservation to pick up free ticket from the counter. Do not think that they will make exception just because you are foreigner, trust me, they will reject your admission straight away. Make reservation through\u2026",
          "This museum can be considered as the world class history museum as it has a vast collections which have 1100 + years of history. It remarked the glory days of Tang Dynasty. The exhibited items show the Xi'an City was the major stop on the Silk Road, and influences from the",
          "This museum, although rather small, houses an exceptional collection of art and historical objects, particularly from the Tang dynasty. At that time, the city was a major stop on the Silk Road and the multi-cultural influences are very visible in the items exhibited in the",
          "Greatly inspired & educated about the different dynasties of China and the Silk Road. The exhibits were world class. It is recommended to go for the audio guide if you have time.",
          "Besides the terracotta army and Beiyuanmen street, this museum is my best souvenir of Xi'an. It's pieces are very different than other museums, many beautiful horses, double dragons, showing how the terracotta army was very colorful, etc.",
          "This museum requires a good 3-4 hours to properly explore each room. Through the various found artefacts, the museum presents a history of China going through the various dynasties in chronological order. Interesting take on what people in China\u2019s lives used to be. There are",
          "Very interesting. Two pottery jars were recently found buried that contained ~1,000 artifacts of all types. My wife and I really enjoyed the 2 hours we spent here. We had a guide that told us many stories and really helped bring the museum to life.",
          "I brought 6 high school students to this museum to get an understanding of the history of this province in particular. There is a single route to take through the museum and it is quite crowded. There are some blurbs in English at the start of each section, but labels are all in",
          "This history museum is very interesting. Different rooms showing different period of the Chinese civilization. Pottery, statue, Silk Road story,mao history... The tickets are free and they are limited to 4000 daily and you need to reserve to be lucky to get one. For foreigner",
          "There was a long long queue for the free tickets so we just paid the fare and went in. That was great too cos it have e try the the special exhibitio...the Tang Dynasty collection. No regards visiting this museum....lots to see and lots of treasures.... providing treasures",
          "I visited the museum one three different occasions, there have always been something new for me. As a Xi\u2019aner, I\u2019ve been impressed by the collections of this museum. It\u2019s worth a visit if you\u2019re a history guy and wants to know something more about the history of China, but if",
          "This museum offers free admission tickets. But people begin to form a long line early in the morning. It\u2019s better to just buy a paid ticket to a treasure exhibition which enables you see the whole museum. The collections were extensive. And a tour guide is highly recommended for",
          "There are a huge number of artefacts here, though descriptions and explanations of items could be better. Do get the special treasures ticket, which costs extra, as these are well worth seeing. The only issues are that it is very crowded - we were in low season and it was still",
          "Visited here on a cold, snowy afternoon. Extremely well organised chronologically with detailed English information boards about the various dynasties, cultural, religious and economic history over past few thousand years. Very well curated!",
          "Shaanxi is a modern museum built in the architectural style of the Tang Dynasty. Many interesting artifacts are housed here. It seems as though there were many school children working on school activities and projects when we were there. It was quite crowded on the weekend.",
          "If you need an audio guide, it is easily available at the counters for rental. There are many artifacts on display, but the crowd may be uncouthed and you may get pushed around. A little security check as you entered the museum and selfie sticks and cigarette lighters are",
          "a fantastic and impressing museum with impressing and important exhibits, which cover a wide range of generations and areas. very well presented and worthwhile visiting. in fact no visit in Xian is complete without attending a having a comprehensive tour in this museum",
          "Remember to have a passport, like everywhere in China. Not very interesting unless you like China history.",
          "This is a very popular museum for locals so is busy and there will be a queue for the tickets (which are at a booth outside the museum). Take your passport to get your free ticket. If you don't have your passport they wont give you a free ticket. But there is another way to",
          "This museum tracks the evolution of China from Shaanxi where the major empires developed originally before Beijing became the center of the country. The real strength is their coverage from prehistoric times through about 1000 ad. For those of us who are western centric it is",
          "There are 5 galleries for each of the dynasties . Most of the exhibits are pottery, parts of the architecture and jewelry . There are some English subtitles . There are also tour guides who have the microphones to narrate the exhibits . There are plaentybof toilets . There is a",
          "Very nice exhibits at the museum however it is very busy by European standards so a bit of patience is required when large groups are touring at the same time",
          "Great, comprehensive museum, but packed to the gills. Expect hordes of people. Unless you're on a super-tight budget and/or like to wait on line, pay the 30CNY for whatever the special exhibition is and skip the line.",
          "Wow! What a great museum, and a great way to learn about ancient Chinese cultures. The museum covers the history of finds in the province, dating from the Homo Erectus Lantian Man through the Tang Dynasty. There are long lines to get in for free (3,000 free entrances per day",
          "A great provincial museum. Learned and saw so much. Chang\u2019An, the ancient city that existed before Xi\u2019An during the Tang Dynasty, was great to discover here. Bring your passport, and if you are 65, the entrance fee is free, even in the special section of museum that otherwise",
          "Spending an afternoon provides a glimpse at all the dynasties using artifacts, maps and other means of explanation. Even the Revolution is covered. Very informative.",
          "I visited here during my visit to Xi'an and really enjoyed the exhibits. I went before going to see the terracotta army and the orientation provided by the museum was helpful in understanding what I was seeing later on. Almost all the exhibits had some English explanation,",
          "The size of this museum is just right, there are collections of high historic and artistic value which take me a day to see them all. Many are true masterpieces, displayed with explanations in Chinese and English, divided in sections according to dynasties which makes sense to",
          "Not sure why we couldn\u2019t get in. We had booked our tour months in advance and put the Shaanxi History Museum on our itinerary. Our CTS tour guide said the wait would be long and even if we waited in line, it would not be a guarantee to get in. We arrived early in the",
          "As others say, get your tickets early. We had a second tour guide who went ahead to get them for us. The museum was packed. Moving around was difficult, very loud, and good luck getting photos without 20 people in them. Some exhibits had English descriptions, but most did not.",
          "This museum was a great introduction to the history of the region and helped to associated the various ruling dynasties with the arts and crafts of their periods. It was amazing to see how advanced they were relative to the west during some of times. The crowds were heavy as",
          "I was told by my Beijing fiends that this IS the place to visit in Xi\u2019an to learn about the local history so we went. We came around 11:00AM, in the middle of Chinese October holidays... Imagine how big were the queues, even for 30 RMB. Also I realized that even for 30 you need",
          "I could not go into the museum because the queue to purchase the entrance tickets was already 100m at 10am.And its off peak season.Maybe you need to join a tour to get a ticket easily.",
          "The Shaanxi History Museum provides a good overview of the Chinese culture development. However, it was rather crowded and hard to get to read the description of the exhibits.",
          "Pick your day and time carefully. There are free tickets available on a limited basis each day, but the line is crazy. Better to pay 30 RMB (about 5 USD) and reduce your wasted time. Exhibits are well labeled in English and generally well organized. But the crowds ruined it.",
          "There are loads of museum at Xian, you should visit all of them. The tour can be easily understood by Guide. This museum again shows you the history of China. You can enter with entry fees and you can enter here free as well and there is a long queue for free entrance.",
          "This is one of the most impressive history museums I have ever visited. Museum professionals who are sophisticated about the subtle yet effective use of technology did a splendid job of making the past come alive. 5000 years of history are hard to compress in one building but",
          "Make sure you arrange your own English guide for this museum. You will be immensely lucky to secure the few English audio guides they have and a visit to the guided tour yielded no luck either. The guided tour would have cost 400 Yuan for all the exhibits. Still they aren't able",
          "The 30 yuan entrance seems reasonable until you realise others can get in for free but they wait long. It is not a large museum but is well curated. The displays, from Neolithic to. more recent times speak for themselves. Displays ends approximately around Tang dynasty. Very",
          "I queued for 1 hour (2.30pm to 3.30pm ) to buy a 30rmb entrance ticket (which also gave me access to a special exhibit). The queuing time passed fast and they provided shelter from the sun. Once inside, the museum was filled with a lot people but it was still worth going as the",
          "It is possible to book a slot to visit this museum, as otherwise you are waiting out side forever, and in Summer it is baking hot. They didn't have any English audio guides when I was there, so a lot of the artefacts weren't appreciated so much, but nice to see. The masses",
          "As a history buff I found myself enthralled in China but missing the artifact component to it all. Everywhere up till this point had been buildings and tombs. The Shaanxi History Museum filled in the gap beautifully. Xi'an had been the capital of China for much of antiquity",
          "Due to the enormous crowd we would have had to wait at leastm2'hoursmto get into the museum.mthis was the case with most of themtourmvuses somwemgave it a miss.",
          "OK, I am not a museum person but there were two issues with this museum. It was insanely busy for a start. Far too many people in here to enjoy the experience. Also the artefacts were somewhat lifeless outside their natural context. Much better time spent elsewhere in Xian",
          "No English tour guides available and insanely crowded. It looked like some of the exhibits might have been interesting but we would have had to fight our way through to see any of them! Don\u2019t bother",
          "We were not really impressed with this location. Although there was a few interesting exhibits it seem to us to be more of a shopping destination. The best part of this stop was that there was cold air conditioning so we could get out of the 99 degree heat.",
          "Stood in line for 3 hours. Apparently issuing tickets was suspended multiple times while I was in the queue. I still saw hordes of people walking inside, so I'm not sure how that works. Still ended up being busy inside. People shoving each other everywhere. Information was",
          "If you visited the terracota warriors and do not pay a visit to the museum you will be missing a lot. Many amazing and interesting art crafts as well as statues",
          "Excellent overview of the Chinese dynasties! Beautiful sculpture! Can be crowded with school groups but can also find areas to get away from the crowds..Well planned and pleasant atmosphere.",
          "Shaanxi province is where it all began in China and this museum is well worth the visit. It is free and located near the Da Yan Ta (Wild Goose Pagoda) Park south of the ancient inner city wall of Xi'an. It is on Xiao Zhai Dong Lu (Xiao Zhai East Road) just east of the metro Line",
          "History buffs get ready! The museum houses an excellent collection of artifacts from different dynasties in China. Be prepared to take a slow walk through and be amazed at the intricate details in the pottery, building carvings, tombs, statues, etc Photography is allowed.",
          "This is a nicely designed modern museum. It\u2019s just the right size to navigate in a couple of hours. There is a smLl gift shop.",
          "The line was long and we had to wait for 90 min total, but it was worth it. Great history of the area which was essentially the beginnings of the entire country. Perhaps 80% of displays had English descriptions. Highly recommend it. We spent 3 hours here and it was barely",
          "The day we went it was extremely crowded which made it awful. It was loud, many school groups did not mind their manners. The exhibits on the terracotta warriors was good, but tough to enjoy with so many people. The other exhibits were closed or boring on the day we went. The",
          "It\u2019s got almost everything, one place you got to come and see so many different emperor even one and only woman emperor, it\u2019s has so much display you will need lots of time go through.",
          "All about the history of ancient China - in one place. Do get an audio or guided tour - it's worth it as it enriches your experience...there are so many stories to tell...You gain a better understanding of ancient chinese history and will appreciate the history of the terracotta",
          "Xi\u2019an shows the diversity of Chinese history, combining different cultures from both east and Muslim cultures. Unlike the imposing Beijing with empirical flavor, Xi\u2019an is more of real deep history and creativeness. Many things are \u2018never thought it could be Chinese\u2019 stuff",
          "This was included as part of our two day tour of Xi'an. We would not have normally planned this visit but our guide took us here. It was certainly worthwhile.The museum houses over 370,000 items, including murals, paintings, pottery, coins, as well as bronze, gold, and silver",
          "Tells you about the Xian history, imagine it has been the capital for several dynasties and emperors, there is alot of history to be explained and you can see it all here. They say that the Subway was delayed because they kept digging up relics everytime and had to stop",
          "Xi'an is a Chinese city full of history for more than 3000 years. So you are attracted to this city, chances are you come here because of its history. Then this museum is the place you must visit because it contains excellent collections and elegantly shows you the history of",
          "Pay the ticket to get in early ( our guide did it for us and told us many things about the special exhibit). The museum is very crowded, you may have to wiggle your way closer to some pieces. However, if this doesn't bother you and you have patience to read all the explanations",
          "This city was one of the six capitals of ancient China and they have some amazing artifacts from all times of Chinese history. It is kind of overwhelming, and there are lots of people there. Don't expect to see everything, but you are appreciate some excellent things and",
          "LOTS to see here and the displays were very well done with good English explanations. Even the young kids enjoyed it. Well worth a few hours to learn and absorb!",
          "The Shaanxi History Museum has a great history of China; but, if you arrive late, it gets packed! I wish the museum would limit the number of guests! It's tough to see anything once it gets busy. Arrive here right at opening.",
          "To avoid long queqe to purchase or take the free admin ticket , it will be good to reach there before 8am. It was a very good place to see all qing and tang dynasty in China.",
          "I was really disappointed when we arrived because the line outside was ridiculously long! It would take 1-2 hours to get in. Then I found out that was the line to get in for free. They didn't get to see the whole museum but it was free. Take my advice and pay the 30 yuan to see",
          "We expected more. The free tickets are not worth waiting for. If you have not seen one of the other museums of this nature it might be exciting.",
          "Easy to get to by subway, and useful in extending understanding the Terra-cotta Warriors but so crowded and signage less than optimal.",
          "The museum hands out a couple thousand tickets (probably only to Chinese nationals) every morning and afternoon. There is a very long line all the time to get the tickets. The collections are very nice. Regular exhibitions are in halls 1-3, and are accessible with the free",
          "the great famous museum in Shaanxi area, especially for the museum exploring lover, this is the right place to fulfil some knowledge about the ancient chinese historical empire which had situated in this region. this is worth for visiting place, highly recommended.",
          "There are numerous art exhibits in this museum. There's a great Buddhist section with assorted statues along with many bronzes in other areas of the museum. On the ground floor is great map of the walls of old Xi'an surrounded by the rivers that gave birth to this city. It's",
          "We stopped here as part of our tour, such a wonderful look at the amazing history of China, it was great to see how they have preserved their history and culture so that others can now experience it. A few hours could easily be spent wandering around and taking it all in.",
          "There are normally 1500 free tickets in the morning and another 1500 in the afternoon. The ticket prices are around Y30 per person, so if you can't stand the queues, then just pay to go in. There are a lot of artefacts on display, and details some of the history of China, up",
          "I love it! Many amazing bronze castings, unbelievable that it was made 2000 years ago. excellent technic. With to see! Care, no heating inside, in winter VERY cold inside.",
          "so much to see over 4 floors, beautiful building, great displays, well worth a visit, great coffee in there too,",
          "The place was packed with Chinese groups who seem to go round with a guide and will not allow people to see some of the treasures. The cabinets are all against the wall and impossible to see. The main hall is being restored which may be why it is not as well set out. Not worth",
          "I went twice to this museum, once in the afternoon and once at 9 a.m. Both times I arrived to hear announcements that all the tickets had already been given out. So I would advise arriving VERY early or at least being aware that you may be disappointed. I see no way to buy",
          "A great museum with many real artifacts. Well worth about 3 hours but be prepared for many visitors and little chance to sit for a rest.",
          "Visit the Shaanxi History Museum Shaanxi Province is one of the provinces in which Chinese culture was born, and is characterized by a unique history. In the museum you will learn about the things that have happened in the province for thousands of years, and about the culture",
          "This museum is swamped with tourists. It is so crowded that we barely saw any of the artifacts or displays. People will push you out of the way, huge groups will swarm around you, and it is very noisy. I strongly recommend you do not go to this museum.",
          "Visit the History Museum (recommended between 10:00 and 12:00): From the gate, make your way to the Shaanxi History Museum (in Chinese: \u9655\u897f \u5386\u53f2\u535a\u7269\u9986). The museum is a 10-minute drive from the gate, depending on the traffic on the roads. Shaanxi Province is one of the provinces in",
          "This museum is in a nice building and the exhibits clearly tell Xian\u2019s dynastic history. We enjoyed our visit here. There are also nice grounds around the museum and you get to see the Small Wild Goose Pagoda that had not been restored",
          "A large part of the museum is still under construction, it's very popular place to visit and the nation's favourite! To be honest you could give this a miss and spend your time elsewhere. Huge crowds of tourist, make the place very difficult to enjoy, the artefacts on display",
          "Good to see many ancient products of china and learned about a bit of Chinese history. However, way too many people that you can not see everything, and people were squashing through and talking loud all the time. No peace there at all.",
          "Some exhibitions are closed for renovations - check the re-opening dates if you would like to spend more time at the museum.",
          "The line was very long just to get into the place. Once inside, people were pushing and shoving. It was 93 degrees outside and there was no AC inside and with the amount of people, I was feeling a bit dizzy. Because of the remodeling, everyone was forced inside 2 instead of 4",
          "Really boring. Not much to see at this museum. Go to a park or the wall or the bell tower. I believe they were redoing part of the museum when we went so this may have had something to do this its lack of things to see.",
          "Now I have a limit as to how many old pots I can bear to look at but I did actually find the collections kept here pretty interesting. There were not too many from each dynasty but enough that you could follow the development of the various types of objects. There were various",
          "Beautiful grounds and buildings house an extensive collection dating back thousands of years across major dynasties. We went early and were able to avoid the later crowds. There were many English explanations which really helped us enjoy what we were viewing. Am always amazed at",
          "Can not say anything about the content of the museum as we couldn't actually see anything. and a big part was closed for renovation.",
          "My tip is to go very very early as Chinese are not early starters In order to avoid the very long wait for tickets we opted to pay to enter . This costs 30. On the day we visited , Sunday, the crowds were huge and the Chinese look and photograph everything, so you must be",
          "We had a lovely time visiting this museum which been very well setup and includes English translations. It was not crowded when we went, and is surrounded with lovely gardens to see when you have finished. Definitely well worth the visit.",
          "This was a worthwhile museum to visit, but compared to excellent museums in the world like the British Museum or London Museum of Natural History, this place does not hold a candle. Still, I would advise to pay 30 RMB to get in and avoid the line for the free tickets.",
          "This is advice about failure and your success. We are traveling in relatively low season according to the Chinese English speakers we have met. This museum opens at 8:30; we arrived as planned at 9:15 and as we stepped into line two men stepped in front of us holding signs- No",
          "Beautifully kept museum with such rich history and artifacts. Lots of people during our visit. It was helpful to see so much history and learn as much as we could.",
          "This museum like many other in China is free to enter, though it had some exclusive/pay-to-enter collections/galleries. We arrived at about 12:30, not optimal, as the queue stopped for a while during the chance of shifts. Keep that in mind if visiting. Queues can be quite",
          "If in Xian, an you enjoy museum's and have extra time the History Museum was interesting. But it was busy the day we went. Recommend if possible buy tickets in advance. Our tour guide went to a separate window, other than what the locals use. It was worth having a guide to",
          "I am a big fan of museums, but this one had a couple of issues. First, there are five sections, and three of the five were closed. Second, the crowds were unbelievable. I don't think I've ever been to a museum that was so crowded. Maybe because all the people were only in 2",
          "If you're interested in Chinese culture and history, you have to go to Xi'an. It was the capital of several important dynasties in Chinese history including Tang and Western Han. You will see amazing collections of antiques from 2000 years ago. One thing for sure, you will",

          "We went in the china new year holidays, Don\u2019t !!! It was very very busy. Due to high numbers locals the museum stop audio guides in English. However still worth the visit particularly the basement area to see the wall paintings from the tombs of the Tang period.",
          "This might be an ok museum if you read Chinese, however even so it was really badly laid out, was curated badly and didn\u2019t seem to make sense. Hit and miss English translation which led to wandering aimlessly. Don\u2019t bother if you have ever been to a museum that you thought was",
          "Free Entrance but you will need a ticket. Ticket queues are very very long though it moves quickly. When approaching the queue, just take the lane nearest the museum fence. Seniors can jump straight to the ticket counters without queuing. BRING PASSPORT/ID to claim your free",
          "It was really just a bit \"perplexing\" to me why there were \"so so many\" people at this museum (really a lot more than at the National Museum in Beijing!); yes there's a \"terracotta set\" with some human & horse figures on the first floor, but then you would just go to the \"real\"",
          "Because this is a must go for visitors, not much I need to say, but remember to bring your ID with you because this place strangely requires every visitor to have an ID",
          "Great to walk round and see thousands of exhibits uncovered mostly locally. Buy tix online and pick them up to avoid horrendous queues. A bit dark inside but eyes soon adjust. Plenty of things to see of interest and lots of English translation on the artefacts sadly nowhere",
          "The Shaanxi History Museum in Xi'an, China is a must see for anyone interested in China's glorious past.. The museum is easy to navigate. The collection contains relics from China's many Dynasty's including some Terracotta Warrior figures and tomb murals. Photos are allowed.",
          "As a foreigner, and still discovering the chinese culture, this museum is giving a very nice overview along the dynasties. A lot of nice pi\u00e8ces and treasures. Very well explained. Also free access. Just don't forget your passport.",
          "This is a nice place to spend 1.5 to 2 hours, learning more about the history of Shaanxi. I especially enjoyed the portion of the museum that is dedicated to the Silk Road connection to the middle east and Europe.",
          "If the cultural relics from Beijing have all been moved over to the Taiwan National Museum, the older relics from the older dynasties from Xi'an capital are all located here - and at much greater numbers and arguably more spectacular.",
          "This is not a very large museum and is quite manageable in half a day, but it is worth a visit. Lots of artifacts and history of the region dating back thousands of years in a very pleasant setting. It is worth getting the audio guide but most of the displays also have some",
          "This is a must see museum in some ways more impressive than the terracotta warriors museum . Make sure to obtain the audio handset . The tang special exhibition is outstanding .",

          "the most worth seeing antiques are bronze wares and chinas as well as golden wares,amazingly delicate!the ancient Chinese were so full of wisdom! you can have a glance to the long history of the country and civilization,just a tip of the iceberg!!!",
          "Do leave Xian without visiting this museum! definitely a must-see. It contained so much priceless artifacts. You'll be awe-stroked b the 2000+ yrs of history and culture. Although entry is free, but you have to queue with hundreds of locals. My advice is to pay a small fee",
          "My husband and I visited Shaanxi History Museum as part of our Nexus holiday tour. The museum itself was very interesting, however it was extremely crowded.",
          "Not a diverse museum..... I wouldn't think children would enjoy it.An indoor rainy day activity perhaps. Very crowded and difficult to get close to the exhibits, and we visited in November in the quiet time.",
          "If you want to see things at this museum, pushing is required. Sometimes I just raised my arm and took a photo to see what was in the cases, as there were too many people in the way.",
          "Well worth a visit. Security to get in very strict - no big bags and no selfie sticks at all. So if you happen to have one leave it in the lockers or you will be sent back. Inevitable queues, There are several exhibitions that you have to pay extra for but this wasn't very clear",
          "I spent four hours visiting all the four exhibition halls, except the two underground exhibition halls that required extra admission fees. I had seen some of the displayed items at the Qin Shi Huang Terracotta Warriors and Horses Exhibition in Tokyo last year. But I was glad",
          "This could be the American in me, but I find it very hard to enjoy a museum when I have to do so with hundreds of other people fighting and pushing their way to every single little item. Many times there were crowds at least ten people deep surrounding every glass display. We",
          "We visited the Shaanxi history museum after spending most of the day at the Terra-cotta warriors museum outside of town. The museum was great with the historical timelines of the area and some nice exhibits of treasure and artifacts found in the area.",
          "This was our first stop in Xian on our tour & there was alot to view & read here. They have a few actual Terracotta Warriors here so it does get you al excited when you view them. A rather large museum so allow a couple of hours here if you can go by yourself/ If you are with a",
          "They give out limited tickets so we went with a tour guide. Even so it was so crowded we could hardly get near the exhibits. Lots of great artifacts to see if you can stomach the crowds.",
          "I went early, but waited in line for 1.5hrs to get my free ticket. Tour groups could cut the line. By the time I got in the place was packed. I rented the Audio Guide but it was ineffectual because I couldn't get near enough to the exhibits to follow the commentary. What I",
          "Place is very crowded, so u have to wait abit or squeeze past lots of people to look at an exhibit sometimes. Interesting place, huge to walk around.",
          "For a regional museum this is outstanding. The emphasis is pre-Ming so don't expect fab. porcelain - but there are fine examples of Tang Sancai horses and earlier bronzes. Also of interest are Song items esp. Caladon ware.",
          "I am not an avid museum person, but I enjoyed this one! the way it was laid out and exhibited was very professional. There were a LOT of people there, so if you like to spend time at each exhibit, I suggest you allow sufficient time. Our tour guide gave us the highlights which",
          "Pay the RMB30 entrance unless you don't mind a long queue for the free tickets. This is THE ONLY museum you need to visit in the surrounding area. One museum covers all. Additional RMB300 for the Tang Dynasty Tomb Murals Hall.No pictures allowed",
          "Instead of waiting on line for the free ticket; we paid the 30RMB; its worth it. Great Tang dynasty relics and truly impressed by the priceless treasure displayed in the museum. Be advised, if you want to see some special artwork from Tang Dynasty in certain room, extra 300 RMB",
          "When visiting this place, I highly recommend you not to do it during a chinese holiday, besides I strongly suggest you to rent/hire a device/tour guide to lead you during the visit to this place; otherwise....",
          "A must see museum if you appreciate history or artwork. I was astonished to discover such complex bronze objects beautifully decorated molded 5000 years ago! Then, it goes on from dynasty to dynasty up to the pinnacle of the Tang Dynasty. It is interesting to see how they",
          "This museum is one of the best in China because it has a great collection of pottery, gold, bronze objects some 8000 years old. You will be mesmerized with the perfection and at the same time delicate drawings done in those objects: vases, cups, boxes, mirrors, kettles,",
          "This is an excellent history museum with several galleries devoted to excellent artifacts from the Ming and Qing dynasties. Features an exhibit of over a dozen Terra Cotta soldiers and horses that you can get close to for photos and studies. We were there on a particularly",
          "Incredible artifacts to see even for someone who's not a history buff by any means. Wear comfortable shoes as a bit of walking.",
          "I like the fact that the Museum exhibits take one from pre-historic times and procedes through the different periods and dynasties. One can see how their art and crafts (weapons too) developed over time. One should really go more than once as there is much to see and learn.",
          "I am not a big fan of Museums so I would not take everything I say as gospel. If your a museum lover, I am sure you would love it. Anyone who is not much into museums, give this one a miss.",
          "For a China history buff, the Shaanxi History Museum is a treasure trove. Starting from the \u84dd\u7530\u4eba era and spanning the glorious Qin, Han and Tang dynasties, the relics on display almost brought the daily (mostly royal but some commoner) living of ancient times to life. Our guide",
          "Another must see to learn more about each dynasty. A bit dark inside but easy to get used to. A guide is helpful for seeing the main attractions, but many plaques in English. This is a relaxing and informative experience.",
          "Tickets are free but I advise to preorder online and pick them up at the e-booking window. Lines are otherwise long if you don't do that. Museum is very good. I used an English audio guide. Museum itself is very good with lots of relevant extremely ancient artifacts,",
          "This museum was interesting especially the Silk Road items. Some of items were of limited value due mainly to my lack of knowledge. The museum was fairly busy with locals when we went.",
          "As I was told by my guide, Xi'an was the capital of many dynasties and the city is surrounded by innumerable imperial tombs etc. As such, the quality of the exhibits in this museum is amazing. It was sometimes hard to believe that such sophisticated items of pottery, jewelry,",
          "This museum gas an astounding collection of art and collectibles from Chinese history and one can spend a good 3 hrs and more admiring all the pieces on display. Audio guide is available and i would recommend it to visitors.",
          "Well done museum, nice audio guide which is highly recommended. Nice expose of the start of chinese culture in the area from stone age until the blossoming when the silk road opened. Hordes of chinese tourists so much busier than most museums in europe. There are free tickets",
          "For so many centuries the capital of China so the history of this Provence is very rich and it is also the history of East meets West. Since this was the capital of China it was the last stop on the Silk Road so this museum has a great collection of how this road influenced both",
          "Admission is free, but theres a limit on the tickets they dish out. Bring your passport for a free ticket! The various collections are housed in 2 wings, and very nicely laid out. I saw the ancient Wall Paintings from the various tombs and lots of ceramic ware from different",
          "A wonderful museum with a large collection of shang dynasty items extending to tang dynasty priceless antiques. Admission is free but it's better to go in the morning as the crowd is less. Be sure to rent an audio guide RMB30 (deposit is RMB100 and will be returned to you upon",
          "Shaanxi History Museum has always been the must see place when you tour Xi'an. Like the Chinese say, \" to see the real Chinese history, come to Xi'an\". It's the capital for 13 dynasties, and you can imagine what you can see in the museum here.",
          "i went here on my last day ! this museum is priceless ! god help us if place burnt down! The stuff here is equal to Egypt or Rome. Please do your self a favor and visit this museum",
          "Forget about the free tickets - cut the queue and buy tickets at Rmb 30 per person to save waiting time & avoid the heat. The exhibits were one of the best I have ever seen. The skills and craftsmanship of our Chinese ancestors were really amazing and inspiring.",
          "The museum is not so huge but they have great collection of historical artifacts from around Shaanxi. There isn't any entrance fees but you need to queue for the limited ticket either morning session or afternoon session. Rent the audio guide (counter on your right) or a tour",
          "There is so much to see in the museum. It was very crowded and noisy during our visit. Well worth a visit.",
          "There are massive collection in this musuem, should be an excellent provincial museum for Xi'an, but too many visitors every day, absolutely over-crowed and noise everywhere. Lack of control for the visitors, partly maybe because the entry tickets are free (we paid 30 Yuan per",
          "Definitely a must visit and you should try to visit this place before you go and see the Terracotta warriors pits. Great collection of several Chinese dynasties and history. Very interesting indeed. Crowded museum but I guess it was the time of the year I visited. Seriously a",
          "Probably the crowded place I visit in China, maybe because the tickets are free (only need to show your passport), there will be a queue for the tickets since they make stops on the ticket office to control the number os visitors inside the museum. The museum is well organised",
          "We arrived at 11:55 am on a Saturday. There are no tickets sold between 12 and 12:30. Queue or not, they literally stop selling tickets at 12 and you have to wait in line til 12:30. Once you're in, the museum is heaving with people and it is hard to see any of the exhibits.",
          "This museum, as reviewed by others, is over-crowded! On our first trip, we arrived at the museum around 10am, and the queue for both free and paid tickets were ridiculously long. We decided not to wait under the hot sun and left. Our second trip to the museum, we arrived after",
          "This is a wonderful modern museum of China, when I asked why the two lions in front of the museum were reversed from their normal left right arrangement, I was told because the museum was dedicated to the most successful empress of china",
          "Although this museum had many wonderful exhibits, on the day I visited there were vast crowds and it was difficult to view them. Some of the exhibit windows were four to six people deep. School vacation time is not a good time to view this museum. I know that I certainly will",
          "Free tickets lead to endless lines. Did Nit enjoy. Lots of good historical stuff for those who read Chinese. Xian museum is a much better option.",
          "This is a world class museum, full of so much fascinating history. However, do not go during holidays, it is free, so the throng of people can make it very unpleasant, particularly during the summer holidays. The ventilation system cannot cope with the over packed over heated",
          "Interesting museum but go in the afternoon, too many people in the morning. We could hardly see the exhibits because of the sea of Chinese humanity. But we made the mistake of going in the morning when there was over an hour queue even if paying for the special exhibits.",
          "I visited this place yesterday with my daughter, who is still under 2 years. She loves running around and exploring things on her own. It was just me and her. The museum is not very big in comparison to some museums in Europe. We spent about 3 hours there and visited all the",
          "We bought tickets for the special exhibit in order to avoid the queues for the main museum (they give out 4000 tickets for free per day, I believe); we got our tickets and were in the museum in 5-10 minutes. Inside the museum, we rented audioguides, which were informative. The",
          "Would be a nice museum, well set up, but too many people to see any of the displays. Very hot inside. You have to stand in line for 2 hrs to get a ticket.",
          "We spent 2 hours taking a look and you will get a good overview of the history of the region and the beginning of the Silk Rd through a beautiful collection of objects. There were interpretive signs in English and Chinese. The main thing that put us off were the vast crowds who",
          "The museum was interesting - but the crowds made it difficult to get close enough to read what we were actually seeing, and the lighting wasn't so terrific. Some very old objects and paintings- Interesting story about the Silk Road and worth a trip IF you are in Xian-",
          "A decent place though you will need a guide / audio guide. I went there with a group of four where we had no guide. The labels are in English but it hard to grasp what is and is not important",
          "If you visit Shaanxi and Xi'an you will find out that this area is deeply vetted in the history of China and the people of this great providence are also proud of their history as they belong to the Silk Road. The museum is laid out by dynasties. We had a guide who walked us",
          "This museum was a definite must see on my trip to Xi'an. I really enjoyed my visit. The museum was clearly laid out and had many English explanations. A guide is unnecessary. The best tip I got was from a previous reviewer who advised that you could skip the line up by buying a",
          "The museum offers a limited number of free tickets per day so you can book online in advance or line up on the day. The lines can be long so if you want to avoid the queues you can pay 30 RMB at the booths on the right of the square which allows you full access to all areas. The",
          "This museum is well laid out with captions for the collection written in Mandarin and English. Start downstairs and view room number 1 and see bones from Lantian man. Beautiful old earthenware are displayed as well as vessels and relics from 5000-3000 BC. Then go upstairs and",
          "This was part of our day tour to the wall though we did spend quite a bit of time there. There was quite a lot to see and quite interesting. My 11 yo daughter got somewhat bored but she thought it was worth it.",
          "The museum takes visitors sequentially through Chinese history, starting with the Paleolithic era through the Qing Dynasty. The breadth and depth of the artifacts and quality of artwork from each time period and dynasty are breathtaking! You will need a half-day to just cover",
          "This museum is arranged in 3 areas, based on the dynasties. There are many good exhibits of artifacts that are in excellent shape. However, there are very few explanations of anything in English. Also, the museum is free and is loaded with Chinese people, who push and shove",
          "Very well organised. Good description of the artefacts. It is possible the get a good and clear idea of art and develpment in so many different dinasties.",
          "We were there on Sunday and there was no entrance fee, only our passports were registered. Beautiful displays about culture, arts and everyday life, also a great program on a rainy day. There are English descriptions in every hall so you can 'keep pace' with the information",
          "We went here in a small group (4 people) and our private tour guide. The museum was very busy with large tour groups so difficult to see everything. You would need a tour guide or the audio set as there is not much explanation of what everything is in the museum cabinets. Worth",
          "to beat the queue, simply queue in counter 3 and pay 20 yuan for the special exhibition. Go to the museum early as it will be very crowded later in the day. Visited the big goose pagoda after the museum which was 1 stop away (take bus 30 opposite the museum)",
          "I have a sightseeing there. They separate into many rooms in many floors. It is a summary of Shaanxi history before you visit the real teera cotta. It is worth to see. It has light and sound to make it interesting.",
          "A very well organised modern nuseum that showed the incredible history of early China. Lighting however was low. Exhibits were with good signage. Most interested in how future Emperors made their funeral Army far smaller/ Museum on two floors with a superb gift shop on the",
          "We visited this museum as part of an organized tour and spent about 2 hours here walking through at a leisurely pace. As it turns out, I wish we had more time. There is so much history in Xi'an and this museum walks you through each dynasty in four large galleries. Most",

          "We arrived on a Saturday morning 30 minutes before the doors opened at 8:30 but there was already a long line. Bring your passport, you'll need it to get a free ticket! It took about 50 minutes to get inside the actual museum, but it was well worth it. Minimal descriptions of",
          "Best part of the museum is that it is FREE. However, the queue is also very very long. To bypass the queue, just pay RMB20. We did not know this until a taxi driver gave us this tip. The paid entrance fee will allow you access to all their exhibits whereby the free entrance tix",
          "Went on a private guided tour- Definitely crowded. Many interesting exhibits . Lots of places to sit outside. A large comprehensive gift shop. Many additional warriors to be seen up close. If you have the time put it on the list",
          "Shaanxi has an incredibly long history and this museum does a great job of walking you through it. You can get there pretty easily on the subway. Allow time to get in. When we went, there was a long line to get in. Tickets are free if you bring your passport but you have to wait",
          "We went on a Sunday, which may have been the issue. The lines for getting free tickets were long but we did get in even for arriving after 10 am. The exhibits were superb. Lighting was low, making it sometimes difficult to read the curator's notes. We did wonder if we should",
          "We really enjoyed this museum and wished we could have spent more time. It was good to see a few of the terra-cotta warriers close up because you cannot get very close at the excavation site, aside from a few special exhibits. The pottery exhibit was good too.",
          "We were here on a tour and spent about 90 min. here; could have spent much more time, as the exhibits were very good, and gave us a good idea of the history and various artifacts. There are 130,000 fine cultural relics unearthed from tombs and capital sites of Zhou Dynasty to",
          "Spent about 3 hours here and impossible to take it all in. Wonderful displays of the Chinese culture and history and very well presented. Our time gave us a small taste of the rich history so many westerners know little about.",
          "Ted our superb guide from Allen Guo's Private Tours walked us through the museum explaining its importance in China's history. My wife and I marvelled at the ancient artefacts and art pieces here and Ted was able to tell us the significance of all that we saw, particularly the",
          "This museum was so crowded that it was impossible to enjoy or even view the displays. It appears that locals can visit free on certain days. Maybe next time I will be able to enjoy it.",
          "Would have liked more time here - loved all the exhibits from the coin collections - to the masks- to the Ming vases and a terracotta pot from 4300 BC - Yes BC",
          "A wonderful, serene museum with beautifully presented antiquities. Take your time, breath in the history. Also beautiful temple next door.",
          "This must be one of the best museums in China. It tells the Shaanxi story from ancient until modern times and has some quite sensational exhibits as well as explanations as to how Buddhism came to China. For us however, the highlight of our visit - and our rationale for going",
          "We didn't actually intend to visit this place, but we saw it on the way to another attraction and thought \"why not?\" Admission is free, but tourists have to just queue up and show ID to get the free tickets at the entrance. The museum itself isn't that big, but with 2 floors",
          "Although we had seen the ancient China exhibit at the National Museum of China in Beijing, this museum had a variety of unique collections that also helped to better understand China and other things we were seeing, especially in this province of Shaanxi (e.g., the Terra Cotta",
          "We spent a couple hours here as part of our tour of Xi'an with The China Guide. Because we were part of a tour we were able to enter the museum through a separate (no line!) entrance. The museum is divided into historical periods/dynasties. Our guide led us through the museum",
          "Xi'an used to be one of the Chinese cities UPON THE SILK ROAD TO WESTERN WORLD, centuries ago. Thus the Shaanxi Historical Museum is much too much important to visit and get a first understanding of how deep Chinese civilization was in this part of the vast country. On the other",
          "I don't think I've ever visited such a busy museum, there were people everywhere, sometimes 3 or 4 rows deep at exhibits. This can make it a little difficult to see all of the artefacts. Patience is essential, as there can be a lot of pushing. There is a good range of items",
          "To deepen your understanding of China and the amazing history of Shaanxi itself this is a must see museum. We ended up here by accident really after walking from the nearby Dayan Pagoda and decided to get out of the rain for a couple of hours. Firstly, this museum is free.",
          "Arrive at 10 on a weekday and the queue is negligible. Fabulous temporary exhibition of TEAPOTS when we visited. Very quiet, clean, excellent restaurent (Not expensive) Wished we had 2 days to spare. 4 from Downton England",
          "Great museum offering a wide display of artefacts. The real problem is the crowd (a visit on a saturday was probably not the irght thing to do...).",
          "This museum is a perfect complement to the terracotta warriors visit. It displays several examples of them, which can be observed from all angles. There is also a profusion of archaeological treasures. Do not miss it.",
          "A lovely building housing a good array of historical objects spanning the history of Xi'An. The electronic guide is worth getting for a more in depth and interesting explanation of some of the more noteworthy of displays. One of the only negatives would be the minimal air",
          "The Shaanxi History museum contains some of the most valuable collections of art from the earlier dynasties up to the Tang dynasty when the Chinese culture reached its peak and was most probably the most advanced civilizations on earth, at least in terms of refinement. We went",
          "Xi'an was the capital during the Golden Age of China, when Europe was in its Dark Ages after the fall of Rome. So much to experience and learn about.",
          "Took us a little time to find the correct line, as you look at the museum take the queues on the left and if you want to avoid a long wait to line 3 and pay( not 4, as for over 65!) An interesting museum, do before the terracotta army to give context and history, all exhibits",
          "Excellent museum with good displays and ENGLISH descriptions. They cover the broad and interesting history of this region including the Tera Cotta warriors The downside: INCREDIBLY BUSY WITH HUGE CROWDS of locals. I have never seen such a massive crowd of people making grubby",
          "I went to this museum after visiting the small goose pagoda next door and it is a pleasant museum with interesting local exhibits of Chinese culture. Free to visit and not very crowded on a weekday. Definitely combine the pagoda and museum for a good 2 hour or so total visit.",
          "You need to bring your passport and be prepared for queuing to get in at this venue popular with local folk. It opens at 10 am, might pay to be there early. Terrific range of artefacts will satisfy any history buff. Well worth a visit, but be prepared for crowds.",
          "They distribute a limited number of free tickets per day. Be ready for a really long line specially on weekends. Or you may also pay a certain amount for an immediate entry to the museum. The paid ticket allows you to enter an extra exhibit hall that is closed to free ticket",
          "Since it was free to enter, you can imagine the crowds. There is a lane to pay 20RMB (lane 3) but, the locals rather wait in line than pay to enter. Once inside, there are 3 levels, and it shows you the pottery, coins used and some history about the Tang Dynasty.",
          "If you are a foreign visitor, bring your passport and get there earlier in the morning and you could get a free ticket. It can be crowded but it is worth it. Museum has exhibits as far back as Western Zhou (1046 - 771 BC) and photos are allowed.",
          "This is a nice museum and a good way to start your visit to Xi'an. You'll get a good overview of the history of the city. Try not to get caught in the ticket line.",
          "a little less well kept than other history museums in xian, nevertheless a great museum to see the earlier part of history of china, and presented clearly in chronological order. perhaps because it's free it's more crowded than others we'd been to. hire a museum guide or an",
          "I came here on a Sunday afternoon. The tickets for exhibition rooms 1-3 are given for free so understandably there will be aqeueu. I opted to buy the RMB 20 ticket since I was told by one of the staff that includes access to the 4th room. It was very crowded inside that I",
          "Good organization with timeline through multiple Chinese dynasties. Each artifact has English description but it would have been more helpful to have better narrative signage in English. Hard to complain though about a free museum when it's pouring rain outside. Remember to",
          "Very good quality original historical items from Xian are to be found here. It requires at least half day to do justice to the collection. History buffs could spend the day. Well displayed and explained.",
          "We visited the Shanxi History Museum on our trip to Xian. We viewed three exhibit halls which started with early man and went into multiple dynastic periods, including Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang. We went on a relatively uncrowded day (according to the tour guide), but it was",
          "Let's start off by saying that China has A LOT OF HISTORY. This museum has information and artifacts dating all the way back to the first human fossils, first civilizations, and first Dynasties. The museum has physical artifacts such as pottery, glassware, bronze, and so on. We",
          "Back to the future, to understand about some of China's history. First stop, we went to the Han Dynasty's hall. All the artefacts were well preserved and well explained. They really tell you how the economic and the people lived during that period. It was a really good history",
          "The museum is free and so the queue to get in is very long and they will suspend the giving out of tickets temporarily occasionally as a measure of crowd control. They have another but shorter queue if you are willing to pay an entrance fee which is about RMB. We opted for that",
          "great museum. So much history to see on these floors throughout the building. It is layout so nicely.",
          "While the natural beauty and outdoor sculptures of China are legendary, its museums have not been well received mostly owing to poor presentation. Well, things have changed and the Shaanxi History Museum is one good example On my last day in Xi'an, and having been to the Ming",
          "Great, very rich collection spanning 10,000 years of history. This will show you samples of each period and types of items (bronze, Terracotta, porcelains... Including some renovated Terracotta warriors). But the best and most unique part is the underground gallery dedicated",
          "This museum contained a very interesting display of artifacts from the various dynasties. Each dynasty was briefly introduced in bilingual (Mandarin/English) signage, and all exhibits were descriptively labeled. I noticed they had audio tours available. The washrooms were clean",
          "Enjoyed our tour of the three galleries which gave a real insight into the Dynasty way of life our guide Nicky helped us understand and answered our questions a very interesting tour\"",
          "Me and my colleague just had 2.5h for visiting this museum and it was a good decision to do so. First: free of charge. Go to the left hand at the entrance and show your passport to get a free ticket. Go to the right hand to store some baggage (they do not take laptops) for",
          "I am in my 20s and I thought it was a little boring. It was free entry though with my passport. Huge Museum, lots to see, a section on the Twarriors! Art part was my fav but not much in that section.",
          "The museum has a lot of local and country artifacts and culture represented. It is average size and can easily be viewed in less than 2 hours. But don't expect anything overwhelming.",
          "The museum itself is very worth visiting and carries lots of exhibits. However due to free admission the queue was soooo long and it was so crowded inside that I barely could see the exhibits. Suggest to charge admission fee and to control crowd better.",

        "wiki": "The fortifications of Xi'an (Chinese: \u897f\u5b89\u57ce\u5899), also known as Xi'an City Wall, in Xi'an, represent one of the oldest, largest and best preserved Chinese city walls. It was built under the rule of the Hongwu Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang as a military defense system. It exhibits the \"complete features of the rampart architecture of feudal society\". It has been refurbished many times since it was built in the 14th century, thrice at intervals of about 200 years in the later half of the 1500s and 1700s, and in recent years in 1983. The wall encloses an area of about 14 square kilometres (5.4 sq mi)\nThe  Xi'an City Wall is on the tentative list of UNESCO's World Heritage Site under the title \"City Walls of the Ming and Qing Dynasties\". Since 2008, it is also on the list of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of the People's Republic of China. Since March 1961, the Xi'an City Wall is a heritage National Historical and Cultural Unit.\n\n\n== Location ==\nXi'an City Wall is located in the urban district of Xi'an City, which at one time was an imperial city during the periods of the Sui and Tang dynasties. It is situated at the end of the ancient Silk Road.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nZhu Yuanzhang, the first Emperor of the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), was advised by Zhu Sheng, a sage, to build a fortified high wall around the city, create storage facilities for food and then establish his empire by unifying all the other states. Following the hermit's advice, Zhu established the Ming dynasty, and then built a highly fortified wall over a previously existing palace wall of the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907). He started building the Xian City Wall, as the capital of northwestern Shaanxi Province in 1370. He incorporated the ancient fortified embankments built by the Sui and Tang dynasties by including them in the wall's western and southern parts, enlarging the eastern and northern parts. The edifice was built over an eight-year period and was well maintained during both the Ming dynasty, and the Qing dynasty, which followed.The wall was initially built solely from tamped earth. During the Longqing Emperor's period (1568) the wall was strengthened by laying blue bricks on the top and exterior faces of the earthen walls. During the reign of Qianlong of the Qing dynasty (1781), the wall was enlarged; drainage features, crenels and other modifications were made; and the structure as it is now seen came into existence. By the end of the Qing dynasty rule, the structure had begun to deteriorate. In a limited degree the Republican Authorities carried out maintenance of the wall, which was in a poor state. In the first decade of the 20th century, the wall's defense system was considered to be of strategic importance, even though demolishing of similar walls in other regions of the country was undertaken following the 1911 Revolution. In 1926, the wall was attacked with bombs by enemy forces resulting in serious structural damage, but the city within the wall was not affected. During the Second World War, when the Japanese carried out air bombings from 1937 to 1940, the residents built around 1,000 bunkers, as anti-aircraft shelters within the wide base (thickness of more than 15 metres (49 ft)) of the wall. A few escape openings were also made through the wall as passageways. Even later, new gates to allow traffic through the Xian Wall were constructed during the Republican rule.According to the Shenboo Atlas of 1933, in the 1930s most people lived within the perimeter of the Xi'an Wall but still there were a lot of unoccupied open areas. Among the visitors who came to see the Xian Wall were American captain (later general) Stilwell in 1922 and the Czech sinologist Jaroslav Pr\u016f\u0161ek (1906\u20131980) in 1933. In 1983, the administration of the Xi'an municipality carried out more renovations and additions to the wall. At that time, the Yangmacheng tower, the Zhalou sluice tower, the Kuixinglou dipper tower, the Jiaolou corner tower and the Dilou defense tower were all refurbished; the crumbling parts of the rampart were changed into gates; and the moat was restored. In May 2005, all of Xi'an's ramparts were inter-connected.The  Xi'an City Wall was proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of the People's Republic of China in 2008. UNESCO included the site in the tentative List of World Heritage Sites under the title \"City Walls of the Ming and Qing Dynasties\" as a cultural heritage designee under Criterion iii & iv. In March 1961, the Xi'an City Wall was fully approved as a heritage site as a National Historical and Cultural Town.Michelle Obama, the first lady of the United States, visited the Xi'an City Wall on 24 March 2014, describing it as \"a wall that has withstood war and famine and the rise and fall of dynasties\".\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nThe Xi'an Wall is rectangular in shape and has a total length of 14 kilometres (8.7 mi), with almost all stretches subjected to some kind of restoration or rebuilding. Along the top of the wall is a walkway, which would typically take four hours to cover. It is built in the Chinese architecture style. As a defense fortification, it was constructed with a moat, drawbridges, watch towers, corner towers, parapet walls and gate towers. The wall is 12 metres (39 ft) in height with a width of 12\u201314 metres (39\u201346 ft) at the top and base width of 15\u201318 metres (49\u201359 ft). Ramparts are built at intervals of 120 metres (390 ft), projecting from the main wall. There are parapets on the outer side of the wall, built with 5,984 crenels, which form \"altogether protruding ramparts\". There are four watch towers, located at the corners and the moat that surrounds the wall has a width of 18 metres (59 ft) and depth of 6 metres (20 ft). The area within the wall is about 36 square kilometres (14 sq mi), enclosing the small area of 14 square kilometres (5.4 sq mi) occupied by the city.\n\nThe southern embrasured watchtower constructed in 1378, was destroyed by fire in 1926 during the civil war of 1926, and was restored in September 2014. This was done after a careful historical review of documents related to the historical features that existed before it was damaged. The other three watchtowers forming the northern, eastern and western gates of the wall were also examined during the planning phase of the modifications done for the South Tower. They were modified, without affecting the integrity of the wall, by an encompassing hall offering protection to the structures by using steel, wood work and the ancient-type tiles and bricks structure. Major gates have ramp access except the South Gate which has entry outside the walls.There is an \"Archery Tower\", which provides security to one of the four gates of the Xi'an wall. Created as a large trap-like chamber, capped by a tower filled with windows, it gave an advantageous position for archers to shoot arrows (in the initial years of building the wall) and later cannonballs at the opposing revolutionary forces. In the event that the enemy was able to breach the walls through the main gate they would become trapped in the small chamber that faced yet another gate and thus be easy targets for the defending troops.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLynn, Anne Wien (2013).

          "This is no ordinary city wall. It is massive in height, width and length and completely intact, thanks also to restoration. Max visitor number of 110,000 says it all! I visited on rainy afternoon. Views of the city were generally uninspiring but there's something awesome about",
          "The walls are over 600 years old and are just over 8 miles long. The South Gate is the most impressive. Most visitors get on to the walls from here. There are two museums inside the barbican and the archery tower of the South Gate which are open to the public. You can hire",
          "My preliminary plan was to take a night walk on top of the wall. But didn't plan well. But luckily, the second morning was cool, very comfortable to take a walk. General description: weekend fun & 2nd visit & 2 friends Visit: Morning market in Xi Cang ->breakfast -> city wall",
          "The ancient city wall is cool considering the history and you will want to spend time inside the walls with the trendy restaurants, bars and Muslim quarter but being on top of the wall isn't too exciting. The Wall length is 13.7 km and there are some nice towers and views",
          "It\u2019s quite wide. And it looks doable when you are on the city wall, but unless you get there early in the day and are fit-don\u2019t try! Check when sunset is as well. I got lost from our bus group by wandering and looking-the place closed around me and I was left wandering the walls",
          "This is another must do activity when you are in Xi\u2019an. While there are 4 gates to the ancient city, the main gate where most of the activities are housed today are in the South. It is actually possible to walk on the perimeter of city walls. Total distance is around 14km. We",
          "We visited the City Wall on a tour in August 2019. The wall is a large fortress-like wall that surrounds the city. You need to climb some stairs to get up onto the wall, but once on the wall, it's like taking a stroll around the City. The entire area is paved, and has small",
          "Xian city wall is well preserved and dates back to the ming dynasty. It has many beautiful gates. Rent a bike and enjoy the city from above.",
          "The old city of Xi'an was surrounded by a stone wall which has been rebuilt to its former glory. There is a wide walkway that you can ascend to and walk completely around the old city. If you prefer you can rent bicycles (one or two person) and take a fun ride around the wall",
          "There were several entrances and exits where you could climb up to this old city wall. The view from above was awesome and beautiful. You could rent a bicycle and cycle round or walk. We chose to walk for about an hour before we exited. There was minimal shelter on top of the",
          "My husband and I enjoyed our walk along the City Wall. The view was very nice, too. We saw some wedding photos being taken, the bride in very elaborate authentic clothing.",
          "we went up on a section of the wall and explored a bit on both sides. You do get great views from the wall. We should have planned to walk around the entire perimeter and take pictures.",
          "You can walk around or rent a bicycle to go around the city wall. It takes around 2-3 hours to cycle around, inclusive of some steps to take pictures. You can return your bicycle at any rental station along the way. A must go when you are in Xian.",
          "Visit in Sept 2015. There are also performance during certain time of the day. The place is also near to Xi'an street food where you can find lots of halal food there.",
          "For me, this was a highlight for Xi'an. The wall is enormous. It can be walked, but it would take three or four hours to do the entire circuit. the most enjoyable way to see it is by bike. I was with a guide, and was only allowed 1 1/2 hours to do the circuit; it was",
          "The Xian City Wall was build centuries ago to protect the central or Old Xian city, and from the top of the wall there are very nice views of both the old and new parts of Xian. The Xian City Wall was a significant part of history - it had served as the eastern gateway for the",
          "Cold but wonderful view of the city Wall. Great to see history come to life. Such a contrast between the use inside the wall then and now. Inside are older homes now.",
          "We hired a bike which took an hour to ride around the whole wall. They had tandem bikes too but we tried it and didn't think we could manage riding it the whole way round but they let us take a photo and then swap over to regular bikes. We stopped whenever we saw a great photo",
          "Came here in November and rented a bike once I got to the city wall top. Nice views of the city along the way. Or if you have time, I saw people walking but it does cover a few miles if I recall correctly. Also saw two couples having their wedding pictures taken here. The",
          "Fourteen kilometres around the original city and wide enough for chariots (well cyclists today!). A wonderful experience to have a different view of the city, see the lookout posts and compare with Hadrian's Wall, so much later but with some similarities. The moat is currently",
          "You don't have to get on the walls from the several main gates. We got on from a small gate next to Yong Xing Fang, and then walked a bit distance to the East Gate to hire a bicycle. Cycling made a whole experience very different.",
          "The City Wall was a nice site and there are many restaurants in the area. Go at night so you can see the Bell Tower lighting",
          "Cycling on top of this wall was a really unique experience. Being at eye level with real family homes was extremely interesting (don't worry, staring/privacy don't seem to be cultural concerns in China). It really felt like a window into the past, so be sure to rent a bike and",
          "Great Wall my dad love it and u can get a coin stamp on it. U can ride bikes on it but there is a age limit.",
          "This was definitely worth visiting and walking or cycling along. Great views of Xi\u2019an. Smog was a bit intense but once we purchased masks it was much easier to handle.",
          "We stopped here as part of a tour but really should have come separately as 45 minutes on a tour is not long enough. Renting a bike for the whole 14km would be the best way to see this and they are easily available on the wall as singles and mostly tandems.",
          "I enjoyed this city wall. It's very large and they have carts that can move you a bit. Many nice vistas from the wall. You must be able to navigate steep steps.",
          "This simple tour gave us an idea how the city of xian was in its history. It's amazing how the walls were built to protect the city from invaders. you have to climb up the walls, to get a glimpse of this magnificent city, and you can have bike rides as well.",
          "The old city wall once enclosed old Xi'an, but now is just an extensive and distinctive feature of the city center. We stayed close to the main gate, where dramatic music and light shows took place every evening. The pedestrian walks along either side of the old moat were both",
          "Beautiful view of older parts of city. Wish we had more time to walk all the way around. This is a very popular place for wedding photos. We saw many different couples in different wedding style outfits; some old, some new. It was very interesting as well and added an",
          "It was an amazing trip. We took the mini Train to go around. It really worth riding on it. Every angle of the view is different. You have to take this mini train to go to every corner. Walk is possible but might take you few hrs plus energy. Can also rent a bike but still need",
          "Took almost 3 hours to go around and totally worth the experience. Feels like walking in ancient times protecting the inner city. There are interesting views in every direction. Look out for the flags and symbols which are different in the 4 sides of the walls. Would suggest",
          "Rather than trying to cover as much as practically possible of the Xi'an City Wall in a rushed manner, one way of which is to perhaps rent a bicycle, I opted for a leisurely stroll along a stretch of the Wall. Just to immerse myself into the rich cultural heritage of the ancient",
          "Of all the things we did in Xian over the few days, we visited the city wall was by far the most fun. Not as crowded as the terra-cotta warriors you can enjoy a peaceful walk along the wall with great views of the city both old and new!",
          "Really brilliant place with historical significance, the wall was in pretty bad shape last 20 to 30 years but gradually restored to its present glory. A throwback to the great days of the Ming Dynasty and another reminder of how great the city of Chang An was in ancient times.",
          "The city wall looked grand from the outside and shall be where your money stops as well. Not worth going up the wall when you can't visit the commander's block interior. A total waste of money and time",
          "I recommend go before is get dark so you have it with daylight and later in the evening with the nice lanterns. After you was on the citywall, just go down and to the small riverside there you can have a very nice evening walk with all the nice lights.",
          "The wall is quite impressive to view from the outside if you think that this structure is 600 years old.We did not walk the complete wall but spend some time on the wall to observe the views and to get the feeling of what it must have been to be a soldier doing duty on the wall.",
          "We cycled from East gate to South gate and back to East gate where we have to met our tour guide, Coco there. The view and the atmosphere is soooo nice. The cool air is so refreshing. Entrance fee RMB54 and there is a bicycle rental kiosk at each gate. You can walk, cycle or",
          "Take the MRT to Yongningmen MRT Station, come out the exit can see the South Gate in front of you. Good to be on the city wall. We took the buggy on the wall, it took about 45 minutes for a round on the wall. My children felt asleep on the buggy because too bored. Buggy stops",
          "One of the best preserved walls in China. Very well maintained. You can even hire transportation along the wall in case you don't want to walk it. Great views.",
          "We arrived at sundown, which was chilly but made for absolutely stunning pictures. A beautiful calm stroll around one side of the wall was a lovely way to end the daylight in Xi'an!",
          "Take a great walk on a great wall (not the Great Wall!). Tickets are \u00a554 per person. It\u2019s fun to walk around the wall, which is 14 kilometers in total and entirely encircles Old Xi\u2019an.",
          "Took a bit ride around wall. Cost very little. However be prepared for the 14km ride and the city suffers badly with smog so not sure of exercising like this in that position is good for you.",
          "I went during the off season and it was so enjoyable. I only biked half of it and while I feel like I probably saw most of it even though I only did half I enjoyed peacefully biking it so much I wish I had done it all. I\u2019ll go back tomorrow at night to see it lit up",
          "Go inside and explore the beautiful architecture and statues. Then take a walk along the wall to see everything going on around you. It feels like you are going back in time.",
          "Rent a bike and cycle around the City Wall is a must try, it's quite unique experience to see great view of the city in different atmosphere. It is recommended to spend a lovely afternoon, the entire wall will be 14 km and will take 2 hours, it's a worth fun bike ride!!!",
          "Some PR genius in China realized 10 or 15 years ago that ordinary, dull grey cities could be made spectacular by the strategic addition of some lights. The Xian wall was, apparently, one of the first beneficiaries. When lit up, it's a charming, magical fairy tale sight. All",
          "Make sure you leave plenty time to enjoy this visit, we had around 2 hours here but it was nowhere near long enough for us.",
          "We came here in the early morning, the air was fresh and the wall was empty. It was great to see all the Chinese style buildings, lanterns and the wall itself was magnificent. Out of 5 cities we visited in China, XiAn is the most historic, I loved it.",
          "Xi'an City Wall is lovely and is well worth a visit. Great views from the top. Walked around some of it.",
          "This is a well preserved and reconstructed wall over nine miles in length. The size and structure are mind blowing. It is a great place for a vantage point to view the city or rent a bike and cycle some of all of it.",
          "We did the cycle of the entire wall which is about 14km but flat all the way around. Great views of the city and a lovely way to spend an afternoon. I would highly recommend!",
          "We rented bikes and rode around the entire length of the wall. It was a fun experience on bikes. Allow for time if you wish to walk the entire wall. It took us a hour and a half to complete on bikes.",
          "We had a morning tour of Xian Ancient City Wall (Cheng Qiang). It symbolises the Fortifications of Xi'an. It is a UNESCO's World Heritage Site since 2008. The wall is in a rectangular shape. You can walk or embark on a tourist shuttle ride on top of the wide walls for",
          "The Xi'an City Wall is a truly impressive construction, illustrating the defensive structure of ancient Chinese cities.Viewing one section is probably sufficient as each section of the wall is the same.",
          "This is a great experience, to marvel at the building of this wall, not as spectaular as the Great Wall of course but stil really worth doing and wonderful views of the city while walking along the wall.",
          "We had let our in-country travel agent (Top China Travel) know that we are active travelers and so, on top of a bike trip in the river area outside of Yangshuo, and hiking in the hills from Ping'An to Longji, we added this to our itinerary and it ended up being one of the many",
          "We didn't have time to do the whole 13.7km of the City wall, but the views are interesting. On one side you have the old town and the other the new town. Great places for photo opportunities. There were stopping places where you swapped bikes then carry on.",
          "This 13.7km long wall is the best preserved city wall in China (according to our guide!). It was interesting to compare the older buildings within the walls to the newer buildings on the outside. The moat surrounding the walls has been made into a park area. I would have liked",
          "Takes about one hour of pedalling on their single geared bikes on a rather bumpy paved but flat surface to cover a complete circuit. But half the visitors (of all ages) seemed to have chosen this method like us. An impressive wall but not so impressive views therefrom. Nothing",
          "Versus The Great Wall of China, this is a great example of how serious they were for protection for their city.",
          "A wall that goes around the whole of Xian city centre. The views aren't great with the development of taller buildings on the inside of the city but it must have been quite a sight in the old times. We walked a little way around it.",
          "We viewed it, from our coach, at night. It was lovely to see it all lit up. We were taken there, the following morning, with our group. It was interesting to see but much more beautiful, at night.",
          "My boyfriend and I rented a tandem bike and cycled around the whole wall I was very unsure at first but we had great fun! And the tandem bike was not too difficult to ride. A great fun way to spend a few hours! This took us about 2 hours but we stopped a few times and admired",
          "My husband and I rented a tandem bike and cycled around the whole wall. It was a fun way to kill a few hours. We stopped frequently to look around and have a snack. There's not a lot to see, but its still a fun activity. Be aware that if you are old they may not let you rent",
          "Come here and rent a bike to bike around the city wall. You'll cover more ground and it's just fun! Walking will take a long time as it is actually a wall around the inner city.",
          "I have traveled to a good number of countries and i can say with out reservation that Xian is one of my favorite places I've visited hands down. So much to do both modern and historic that you could spend your whole trip to China just in Xian. No doubt about it I will return!",
          "These city walls run for 14km in a rectangular shape around old Xi'an but there are several entry and exit points so you can walk (or cyle) as much or as little of it as you like. It's a nice way to while away an hour or two without really providing anything in the way of",
          "It is nicer than the great wall. Went there twice. one time walking and the second rode a bike around the entire wall. You cant rent the bikes on the wall. Beautiful views at night as well",
          "A really beautiful surrounding the mini gardens a lovely and quaint. It is very quiet in the night hence recommend to visit at night",
          "Long and nice wall for sightseeing, and walking around the wall. Can be crowded from time to time, especially holidays.",
          "Well I am perhaps a little overreacting.But you must keep in mind that it is the only preserved city wall, in China.We were delighted.",
          "In extension is much smaller than the great wall, but is much larger for the troops It is close to the city and the parts that survived are very well conserved.",
          "The central attraction of Xi'an this wall is visited by locals and tourists alike. While the walk can be uneven it is well worth watching ones step to appreciate the history and the view. Locals are very friendly and welcoming smiles were everywhere. Huge crowds were in the busy",
          "Visited City Wall and hired two cycles for maximum time. Please note. the roading on top of wall is \"cobblestones\" and some are sealed between cobbles but majority are hard to cycle on as 'bumpy' and juddery on body. We both took our own padded cycle shorts and changed into",
          "The city walk is the oldest remaining part of Xi'an middleage . It s huge and impressive beautiful at day and night times as we went both times. If you intend to walk long way you need to know it s at least 3.5 km before you can go out . Not enough exits and entrances The",
          "My husband and I biked the Xi'an City Wall when we visited in September. We rented a bike and it took us a little under 2 hours to go the full distance of the wall. The bikes are not in fabulous shape, so make sure you free yourself of other obstacles (like a large purse) so",
          "Enjoyed very much.it was educational and gave us great eal of insight Into China's history. The soldiers were amazing",
          "We really liked this walk between the South and West gates. High enough to see everything wide enough to dwadle and take photos. Bike hire available.",
          "We've all heard of the Great Wall, but the Ancient Wall of Xian is a worthy addition to your travelling list. Get a bike and cycle the 16km perimeter along the city wall. See the bell & drum towers which were used to indicate time. Allow at least 2hrs, probably a bit more.",
          "This wall is stunning. It is completely intact and very wide. You can even hire bicycles and cycle completely around is 11 km length if you wish.",
          "The city wall was very impressive, but the buggy rides offered were only for one side of the wall. It would have been great if there was a round trip with explanation. The buggy driver was extremely impatient and unfriendly.",
          "It is incredible to see the thickness of the walls, it's most impressive. One can cycle along the wall or go on a golf cart which was fun. The view is of the city which wasn't terribly thrilling but being on the historical wall was fascinating. The buildings on the inside of",
          "Just great fun hiring an old bike and cycling between gates. A complete city wall adds to the experience. We enjoyed the views and the exercise!",
          "For 54RMB you can climb up to the top and enjoy a walk along the 9 mile wall. Great views! For free you can admire the Gates, or walk along the moat walk with its guardhouses, all spectacularly lit at night. Definitely a highlight of Xi\u2019an.",
          "Visited the wall on a Misty day...but looked like a black and white paintings with blobs of reds here and there!Fascinating!",
          "Xian is an amazing city and the old city wall is truly awesome. If you can, walk or cycle parts or as much of it as you can. Its beautiful. And if you are there in the evening, the Bell and the Drum Towers are beautifully lit up.",
          "I walked close to 3.5 hours to complete it. I couldn't find the exit when i wanted to! I didn't cycle cos it looked bumpy and the rides old. I think it looks nicer at night. And would recommend sitting the trams for 80 RMB right from the start. Some parts are really nice and",
          "Climb up to the city wall and biking around the city wall. Watch the city wall beautiful lighting effect during the night, you will never regret it.",
          "We visited the city wall after seeing the terra-cotta warriors. While there, our tour guide arranged for us to have a tai chi lesson, which was great. But there is really nothing special nor spectacular about this site.",
          "This is a must-do when in Xi'an. Even if you don't have too much time, its worth it. We had only an hour and a half, but starting from the South Gate you can go a kilometer in either direction and get a taste of the old city on one side and the new one on the other. Sandwiches",
          "Walled cities were commonplace historically bit to see a wall intact and insuch a good state of preservation is exciting. If only the walls could talk. It is possible to hire a bike and cycle along the path at the top of the wall.",
          "One of the main highlights in Xi'An. You can walk on the walls, cycle or take a mini van! We visited the walls as part of a tour (through Travel China Guide).",
          "We decided not to cycle so our guide brought us to the south gate. Late afternoon or during the golden hour, is a good time to take a stroll as you may chance upon wedding couples on photography shoots. We caught a bride, resplendent in her red Chinese wedding outfit and it",
          "When we visited the wall, unfortunately it was raining, so decided to take the large golf cart. The views of the surrounding areas and the inner city were very good, especially all of the wonderful roof lines. The wall is lit up with yellow lights following its great shape at",
          "Got to the wall which is like a very mini Great Wall. LOL We did the 10 mile bike ride around the wall which is a lot larger than one would think. Great views of the city from each rampart point. The Great Wall has thousands of irregular steps and this was mostly flat.",
          "Took recommendation and hired a bike to go round walls on. Bike was dubious but was lot of fun and could see a lot more. Walls are very impressive and beautifully lit at night",
          "Xian is one among these hundreds of endless towns in China, but it's a special one: an old chinese capital. Nearby, the Terracotta warriors show this, and in Xian it's the fantastic medieval wall around the old town. Many people use the top of the wall for walks or hikes or",
          "This 600 year old wall built to protect the old town is best visited with a tour guide. We also drove around half the wall in a buggy which is the best way to see this architecture. Worth doing whilst in Xi\u2019an.",
          "I rented a bike and rode south to north towers round trip. A tour guide suggested I do this because there\u2019s a no bike zone on the East side before you get to the south tower bike drop off. You have to walk your bikes down and around and it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle to me but it",
          "Great View and lot of cultural activity while you visit. A favorite wedding photo spot. A guide to share the history is good but for the most part, just walk around and observe the city sights and people.",
          "This is one of the main attractions at Xi'an. The walls and buildings are impressive. You can take long walks along the top of the wall with nice city views. However, that's about it. At appointed times a few warriors in traditional costume march around, but don't really do",
          "After an amazing visit of the Terracotta Warriors, Xi'an city walls were a welcome moment for me. The area is vast and I didn't expect such a long private walk. Unfortunately all of the exits were closed off. I would have liked to stop to see the Guagren lamastery and temple.",
          "The walk/climb up to the old City Wall was very interesting, with the approach subway arcade featuring many photos of visits from dignitaries around the world. From the North Tower access on the wall, you can see down the main street to the South Tower in the distance. It is",
          "It was a bit pricey, and during summer HOT! There wasn't much to do, and the smog made views during the day a little rough. The activities on the wall early and late were neat to watch _ ti chi etc.The lights at night were beautiful, though many hotels inside the city walls gave",
          "It's fun and not too crowded to cycle all the way round the walls. The bikes for hire are fine. Great views of old and new cityscapes.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. See the old town inside the wall and the massive buildings outside the wall. You can walk / bike ride or even electric cart around the wall. It\u2019s was a rainy overcast day when we went but it still was lovely to see.",
          "Unless you are just into bicycle riding there isn't much to see. The lights at night are nice enough but I guess I just missed the point.",
          "Very nice and beautiful place. Would recomnend visitors to visit the place. Try to go during autumn or winter to experience the scenery.",
          "One of those must see things, but a huge fuss about very little. We spent only about 20 minutes here - it was very hot. You an cycle along the wall, but not much to see. The Xian skyline is not that great.",
          "We had a beautyfull morning, walking on the wall, wich is 13 km long. We only made at short walk an saw many interesting things. People making gynmastik in a park. People getting their hair cut and market.",
          "We spent about an hour trying to figure out where we could up on it... then when we finally figured it out, about 9:15 p.m., found out that it closed at 9:00. Very frustrating. Maybe if we spoke Chinese it would have been much easier. The people tried to help us, but there was a",
          "This city wall has a long history and it's a must do for me. We walked only on one part of the wall from the South Gate as it is such a hot day.",
          "This is definitely worth an hour of your time if you are in Xi\u2019an. It is pleasant to walk along the walls and see the city below. It seems more relaxing than the rest of the city. Be warned there are a number of steps to walk up to see the city walls. Worth a visit",
          "Entering the gate into a square,you can walk up lots of steps to alevel walkway,very wide along the walls,decend at each ending,the views are good on a clear day viewing street life below,we spent one and a n hour here,that was enough,walking,but dodgeing electric tour",
          "Well preserved with an interesting history. A must for visiting tourists. Just stroll around or ride a bike.",
          "We started at the South Gate and walked around to the West Gate. A leisurely walk with stops for pictures took about and hour and a half. Getting a cab at the West Gate proved a bit challenging because of rush hour and construction. But we got one eventually after walking a bit.",
          "An evening walk on the night of the sponsored half marathon round the wall - very crowded - and it looked brilliant when lit up.",
          "While in Xi'an a visit to the City Wall is a must. The Wall is very well restored. I don't remember it was accessible 30 years ago when I was the very first time in Xi'an. Whenever time permits I recommend not only to take a walk on the City Wall, but to hire a bike for 3 hours.",
          "Xi an wall was lit up and I enjoyed the view from my hotel window at night (Titan Hotel). Our tour guide, Gao was very knowlegable about the history of the dynasties and told us legends of the various emperors that added so much more colour to the historical site. Through out",
          "This is really a must see even if you are in town for only 1 day. Get on top of the city wall. Its SO wide! We rode bikes (they have tandem!) around about 1/4 of the wall. So much to see from up there. Do it!",
          "Now this was a great experience. Riding a bike on the city wall was truly something unique. You can ride along the wall for a couple of stations and pay only for the distance you've ridden or you can go around the whole wall, which is not too far about 14 Km. For the non-bikers,",
          "Cycle available for rent once you are on wall - was around 35 yuan. Takes 1.5 hours for doing the full wall. If the weather is good then can be a good experience",
          "Although only a small section of the wall remains it is a must visit. You can cycle round or take a golf trolley. Compare both sides of the wall. The old with the new.",
          "am amazing insight into the culture of china and its people who have come a long way in only 30 years..",
          "The massive construction of such a fortification was way ahead of its time way back then. Interesting construction and defensive measures taken to protect the kingdom. Like everything about China, this is another example of how advanced the Chinese were and are.",
          "This is well worth a visit. There are a few steps at the start but the views and experiencing the wall are well worth it. You can hire cycles and ride the wall, we also so a small trolley going around. There was even a coffee shop up there.",
          "Very nice walk. We only walked one length of the wall but nice walk. Lovely photos. You can take a cart around rather then walking which is good if you want to go around the whole wall. Looks beautiful with all the lights at night. Cheap excursion. Toilets along the way. Took us",
          "If you\u2019re going to visit this impressive wall, give yourself enough time for either a long walk or even a bike ride round the entire length. I say this because the entrance is equivalent to six or seven pounds each l. Obviously reconstructed but this is the original wall. Great",
          "The wall is neither high nor very old, and has very little history or actually anything worth seeing about it. It\u2019s quite a nice way to see the city if you can endure the baking heat and total absence of shade but at about $11 per person it just ends up feeling like another way",
          "It is worth to rent a bicycle to ride on the walls of the ancient city. The ride is 13.74 kms and ypu will be able to see a birds eye view of the entire ancient city and what lie just outside the wall.",
          "The Xi\u2019an city wall has been beautifully restored and is must see part of any visit to the city. The walls encompass the old city and cover some 14km. You can walk or rent a bike to travel the wall. Sadly we didn\u2019t have time on this trip, but will return to walk the wall in",
          "Unlike other Chinese cities, X\u2019ian made the good decision (I think) to maintain this wall in its entirety. 14km is the length of the wall with 4 entry points being the original North, South, East and West. The city have built 13 more entry points for roads through the wall to",
          "Great morning spent cycling round the walls of Xi'an. Takes about 90 mins although you have the bikes for 3hrs.",
          "The locals call this the Ming Wall. It is massive and a guide would be helpful to interpret the military significance of parts of the wall. It is well-maintained and one can imagine how it must've been like back in the day.",
          "Xian city wall is best done at night. we toured with odynovo on a private tour. our guide fille was excellent. she suggested we see the wall at night. it was great. all the lights were on and it was amazing. we went back during the day, and it was not the same",
          "Rent a bike and ride some or all of the wall; it's a good way to get a feel for the scope of the wall, the history and to be above the city... The bikes are pretty well worn but they work.Don't forget your hat and sunscreen if you go in summer. Lots of steps and walking.",
          "Most well preserved city walls from the Ming era. Worth a walk during the day, photos of the walls at night with lights lit are spectacular.",
          "It is a good way to get a different perspective of Xi'an from above. You can rent bicycles and ride around the wall. It is large so would probably not be needed to cycle the whole way around, but it is nether less worth it. There are different watch towers and also pagodas",
          "Just returned from a 6 days trip to Xian. Stay was too long as there was no scheduled flight back. Had Mary as our guide, based on favourable review on this website. No regrets, she's friendly, chatty, knows her stuff like the back of her palm. Have visited China many times.",
          "If in Xi'an must go to the city wall. If you have a chance, ride a bicycle or rent a golf cart to tour the top of the wall.",
          "We went all around by bike. It is 14 kilometers and 12 meters tall. The views of old and new city are great.",
          "These are nicely maintained and very substantial walls. But it was very hot up there, with little shade. No one was inclined to walk far or hire a bike in that heat. But pricing! ! Almost the same as Forbidden City or the Great Wall!!! That's way way overstating their",
          "We spent about 2 hours around the south gate area. It was a blazing hot day so be prepared with hats or a brolly as there aren't that many shady areas. I thoroughly enjoyed the walk and the scenery from the wall. The views were quite magnificent.",
          "This is a great walk around the wall to do. Take your time and look around the city from height. There is a show here weekly but you need to book in for it. Subway is close by so easy to get to",
          "It takes less than 2 hours to ride a rental bike around the entire 8K of this remarkable wall. It's worth doing the whole thing to get the full appreciation of its scale and design. Be advised that halfway through you turn in your bike, walk about 1/4 mile along the wall armed",
          "We had a short walk along the wall and then hired bikes and cycled along - very easy to do and quite fun. There are places to buy a drink along the way ion a very hot day or take your own. Easy cycling (I am a 50 year old woman and not a cyclist!); flat and not very bumpy, the",
          "The last city with remaining wall. It is a sight to see and to walk on this history is amazing! There are many shops and eateries just be prepared to do a lot of walking!",
          "Most impressive set of complete city walls that I've ever seen - massively thick, allowing a three lane highway width on the top ! Hiring a bike was easy from the South Gate - charge of about 20CNY each bike - 25CNY for a tandem - for 3 hours. 100CNY (\u00a38/9USD) returnable",
          "We toured China and spent time on top of the City wall during our time in Xi'an. The wall is restored and easily walkable (or bike-able). Unfortunately for us, it had rained and all the bike rental places were closed so we could only walk. Really nice views both inside to the",
          "The walk is very nice though crowded. The ticket is expensive but worth it. There are bikers also, so sometimes difficult to walk for people on foot. There should be a lane for bikers or special hours..... There are shops around to buy coke etc...",
          "It's was my 2nd times to Xi'an. Missed to visit City Wall during my 1st visit. This time, I managed to come here, paid some $$ to fuifill my dream to cycling on City Wall. 4KM cycling journey to experience the beauty of Xi'an. Suggest you to visit there during Spring.",
          "The wall is a rectangle 14 klm and our guide told us holds a population within the wall of 17 million if you count the suburbs outside the total would be 30 million people, this is mind blowing for those of us from Australia. Well worth the climb up stairs to view this",
          "Not overly impressed with this one, as basically, it's just a perimeter wall around the city. If I had to visit it again, I would hire one of the local bikes on offer and cycle it, but apart from that, nothing special here..",
          "Just rent a bike and spend some time on the top of the walls. Enjoy the views, happy people! The ride is very easy but count with roughly 16 km.",
          "This is neat Walk the wall or get a bike on top and cycle around. If you want a helmet you had best bring your own or buy one over there Great experience and easy walk. Just check before exit points. Some of the exits are closed off",
          "Going at night would be ideal for the city lights are fantastic. But even in the afternoon, and quite hot gave us a special feel of the wall and its city surrounds. Some took a bicycle for an even more exciting experience.",
          "The wall opens st 8am. We were there right at 8. We were practically on the wall alone. It was so quiet and peaceful. They play zen music through speakers. It was a wonderful way to start my day. We also had the opportunity to see people doing morning exercises in many places",
          "The city walls are spectacular and it\u2019s easy as pie to pay the entrance fee (at the South Gate for example) then walk up and find the bike hire place (usually one at each gate). It\u2019s currently 45RMB to rent a bike for three hours (I think tandems are 90). The bikes are a bit",
          "Beijing has the Great Wall but Xi'an has the complete wall still exiting. At night when the lights come on it is really something to see. There is so much history on this wall and with the inner city still maintaining to the height standard it makes everything that much better.",
          "We road bikes on the wall and we\u2019re able to see a lot of the city. Make sure you head in the direction of the moat for the best views.",
          "My family visited there on June 23 afternoon. It\u2019s great place to seeing ancient dynasty city wall. It\u2019s one of the must visit place in Xi\u2019an.",
          "While my husband wanted to bike on the wall around its entirety, I was not up to the challenge and I think the views would have been pretty repetitive. We started at the South Gate and walked along to the East Gate. Along the way there are refreshment and bike vendors. Bikes and",
          "Loved the cycling trip and City wall . It's beautiful and very nicely maintained . The contrast between old and new city is beautifully maintained .",
          "To see if you have enough time. it is possible to rent bicycles on get up on electric buses.All the visit is almost 40 Km but you can do also only a small section",
          "The Xi'an City Wall is built around a good chunk of the city. I would highly recommend renting a bike if you plan on going around the wall. I would also recommend not going during Golden Week. This wall becomes a wall of tourist and even renting the bike becomes more of a hassle",
          "Simply Wow!!! So much history this wall has been carefully restored and is fantastic, we walked from the South Gate to the East gate and back taking in the museum, well worth the 100rmd the wall is 14 km can be walked but it was 37c on the day we were there, bike are for hire",
          "14 kms long, you can walk, bike... Pretty quiet and relaxing up there - but super hot in summer time.",
          "We walked around a little of the City Wall and we ended up taking a small golf cart trolley cart around the wall. We enjoyed our day here",
          "We took a bullet train from Beijing to Xian, 6 hrs. The next morning we were driven, 1.5 hrs. to the Warriors. MANY people, cars, traffic and noise! Not something Midwesterners from America are used to. However, this was an INCREDIBLE sight to see. We opted to hire a local",
          "Massive structure, beautifully restored. a good walk around the old city, you can hire a bicycle too if walking is too much!",
          "Love the city wall because it was not crowded when we visited. It is magnificent and well maintained. We took a ride on the tourist tram round the wall to save time. The tram stopped at various spot and towers for viewing and photo-taking. After the tram we sat down to enjoy",
          "It is a good way to get a glimpse of the city. We were supposed to cycle on the wall. The wall is wide enough and level to do so. But unfortunately it was too cold that day and we were unprepared to handle the cold so we just walked.",
          "The Xi\u2019an City Wall is a great way to see the city. You can go all the way around the city on top of the wall, there are great views everywhere. We rented bikes, a great way to experience the wall. It takes a long time to go around so the bikes are a good way to go. Make sure",
          "When you do ride a bike, make sure they air up the tires, and don't go in the heat of the day. It will take almost 3 hours to ride around the whole wall because you have to get off at one point, cross, and then come back on. There are some little vendors all across the wall,",
          "We spent a lovely morning here (our tour company TCT has also organised a Tai Chi lesson) & we would have happily spent all day to walk the length had we had more time in Xi\u2019an",
          "Xian is an ancient city and is protected by the walls around the city.You can get up there and take a stroll or rent a bicycle and cycle the whole entire surrounding of the city(very big area).It is so well preserved and in the evening ;place is lighted up :it is beautiful",
          "It is wide and offers some great views into and out of the city center. It's definitely a more mellow activity after the crowds of the Terracotta Warriors and Huaqing Palace.",
          "The whole city wall is still intact. It is fun, you can rent individual or tandem bikes and bike the whole thing, about 8 miles or so. Cost about 150 yuan per bike plus a deposit of about 50 yuan that you get back at the end. You get the bike for around 2-3 hours. It is also",
          "One of the only complete city walls and to walk on it gives a good view of the city You can rent bicycles on the wall and there are places to purchase drinks on the wall. Worth doing",
          "The walk along the city wall is amazing. The wall is so big that one easily forgets it\u2019s a wall we are walking on! Amazingly well kept and it showcased the times of the warring states in centuries past. At night it is lit up and what a spectacular scene! Well worth seeing . I",
          "Went there in Dec last year. Quite a nice view looking down at the city from the wall. However, it was way too cold to even complete 300m of distance. The chilling wind was howling and 'cut' your face. The chill went right into your bones. Even the locals couldn't take the cold!",
          "8.2 kilometres of intact city wall which you can walk or cycle around or if joining at the South Gate there a golf caddies that can take you around. Not all of the gates accessing the wall have cycles for hire",
          "Although doing this 2 hour biking around the city wall during summer is a very tiring and sweat breaking experience it is still worth it. Especially when travelling with young children, this is a nice activity. The bikes can be rented / returned at several points. The ride all",
          "Amazing to walk the City Wall. Clean and beautiful! Loved all the lanterns. At night the lights are switch on - such a pretty picture!",
          "We cycled around the city wall. I highly recommend this way of visiting the Xi'an City Wall. The perimeter is about 14 km. Along the way you pass the four main gates, and some watchtowers.",
          "Don't know how to start reviewing this place :) The fact that walls are 14 kilometers long is amazing alone, not to mention everything else there. Walls are more than 10 meters high and wide, so you can rent a bicycle and ride along, which is amazing experience! Don't miss to",
          "Group touring can be cumbersome and frustrating. Two of us skipped the arranged evening activity and took advantage of the City Wall bike rental. Peddling along the wall, we were able to observe city activity, stretch out legs and feel wind in our faces on a hot night. We were",
          "You can walk, push-bike, or ride a golf cart along the top of the wall. It's as wide as a six lane highway between the gates, and even wider at the gates and courtyards. It's an engineering masterpiece, and has to be seen to fully appreciate ancient building skills.",
          "This is so cool to go up onto this ancient city wall. Not only does it give you a beautiful view of the city, but it's a great place just to walk and view the beauty of Xi'an. I enjoyed it in the evening when it was cooler and several in our group rented bikes and biked the",
          "This is nice looking place at sunset time. The wall and drumm tower is nicely lighted. You can rent a bicycle and drive at wall.",
          "Took us a while to find the correct entry point but when we did we were very happy. Toilets were clean, signage was good and there were regular places to eat and drink. The scale of the wall is amazing. It was a very hot day so I regret that we did not come back at night as",
          "Took an evening stroll along the wall, which is well-preserved. There are several interesting night spots along the way.",
          "The best view is from outside at night , it is not really good view from the top, ridiculous expensive compared with other tourist spot around China , imagine it is almost the same price as forbidden city and the Great Wall",
          "City wall is highly impressive and an unmissable spot to visit. The view was amazing. The bicycle ride was exhilarating.",
          "This was an unexpected visit for our tour group when our itinerary needed to be adjusted due to weather that caused flight delays. We only did part of the wall (4 miles) and were given the option to ride a bike or golf cart. While I opted for the golf cart, I wish I had ridden",
          "The city wall is very wide and fairly long.There is a bike rental place and it's fun to take a ride. If you are over 60 don't tell them. Otherwise they have no insurance for you and won't let you ride!",

          "I didn\u2019t want to miss what our guide indicated is the only remaining city wall standing. It is so neat to learn about the history of why the wall was built and how. Love that you can rent bikes to traverse the whole 9 ish miles. It\u2019s a very bumpy ride though. Loved the visual",
          "We bought a ticket to go up at the South Gate. We went up around 19:00 and it wasn\u2019t too busy. The view with the sun setting was lovely. We walked around a bit until we came to the bike rentals. You\u2019ll see the bikes first, and then the ticket office is just past the bike",
          "We visited the Ancient City Wall in the late afternoon and it\u2019s unreal, we hired a bike and rode around the wall. It has some wonderful views and by the time we finished our ride it was dark and the lights were fantastic. Would recommend this place to anyone and they will have a",

          "The 4 sides of the City Wall is about 13-14km, and hire a bicycle (on top of the Wall) to go one round at leisure pace is the best way to take in the very different views all around the 4 sides or around the City. There are signs of what next to the Wall, & it's informative. It",

          "Our guide suggested a bike ride around on the old Xian City Wall. It turned out to be a highlight of our trip. The ride took about two hours but it was easy riding - flat and wide street. There were cafes and bathrooms along the way. A perfect way to see the city. Highly",
          "Travelled to Xi'an on a private tour and was taken to the City Wall. When you go onto the city wall or into the Gate House and look out, you can get a feel for the ancient Xi'an and the modern city it has become. I was lucky enough to have this attraction all to my self which",
          "This was one of the best experience in Xi\u2019an! Our group rented bikes and toad around the city wall. We stopped so much and took lots of photos because every corner had wonderful views! It was a fairly easy ride, straight and level, with a few ramps that you\u2019re supposed to walk",
          "This was a great site to see while exploring the city of Xi'an. There's lots of preserved history and it gives you a great visual of what was once there in the city of Xi'an. There are quite a bit of old buildings on the wall and different weapons they used for defense. Here",
          "Great place to visist and imagine how life would have been centuries ago with great views of the city. If possible dont miss cycling on top of the city wall. That adds a truly different pespective to the whole experince.",

          "The weather was hot and there was little shade. essential to travel with a guide so that the history of Xian can be explained if not it will just be another wall. We had little kids so could not rent bicycles to cycle around the wall. But it'll be a fun activity so try it.",
          "We approached the City Walls with some expectations from the various reviews read prior to the visit, and WOW, a picture paints a thousand words indeed. Absolutely beautiful and grand site with amazing views. The sheer size of the walls within means the vast number of visitors",
          "The city wall in Xi'an is the only complete wall left in China. It has been beautifully restored & worth the visit. We wandered a small portion as we didn't have time to walk the full circuit & it was hot! There were good information plaques to read at various points",
          "I stayed in Xi\u2019an in June and got up super early (5:40) with jet leg and went out for a run along the wall . The wall does not officially open till 8am but I followed a local through a gate at the east gate and got on the wall . Ran full loop - 9.5 miles without seeing anyone",
          "Lovely way to travel especially in the heat & a great way to enjoy the city Added bonus is that you can hire a bike (or tandem) at one gate and just return it at another - no need to cycle back or do a full circuit",
          "You can get to the wall through some very beautiful gardens. Once there, a short but steep climb up a ramp or steps, which are safer and you get to the pavillion, where there are some great views across the city. Not as impressive as the great Wall, but a good example.",
          "Rent a bike and ride the walk. Many great overviews and insights. Only takes about two hours at a leisurely pace.",
          "We visited the wall for about 1.5 hours. The bikes would have been nice to ride to see more of the wall, but we chose to just walk a bit. Worth a stop.",
          "The city wall was pretty neat! It is hard to believe that it was rebuilt 600 years ago! You can rent and ride bikes on the wall, but we decided to just walk. At night the top of the wall is beautifully lighted.",
          "The ols walls are great for a chilled walk when on a hectic tour, you can walk at your own pace, there are alot of step to the top but its well worth the climb, you can hire a bike or tandom to see more of the walls, the two towers either side are really interesting and great",

          "You can cycle round the top of the city walls in about 2 hours. The South gate area has good bars & restaurants. At night the South gate Pagodas and walls are lit up. Stunning to see the red and yellow lanterns everywhere. Well worth a visit at night.",

          "We chose to walk around the city wall of Xi'an. It covers about 15km and is the most complete city wall left in China. It is very wide and well-kept. The different buildings on the wall are interesting but the real reason to go is to walk the wall!",
          "A great day .However our tour guide didnt give us enough time to explore which was very disappointing as the group hired bikes and were really having a great time. The place itself is another example of how China operates with a great story . Another must do",
          "Not a lot to see but the history is interesting. The most complete city wall left in China. 8.5 miles around the city centre. Admission fee is 54 CNY for an adult. Bicycles can be hired to ride the full wall.",
          "It gives you a good feeling walking around the city walls in Xian which is one of the few cities in China where they still exist. It would be fun to hire a tandem and cycle around the walls but unfortunately when we visited there was a nasty wind so cycling was out of the",

          "I new that we were going to ride bicycles on this city wall. But the sheer size of it made this a real adventure. For 1,5 hours in the blistering sunshine we all were just tired. And for Dutch people who are used to cycle every day that says something. But a really beautiful",

          "Encircling the rectangled city center of Xi'an, it has totally 18 city gates, but they are not all open for visitors. Visitors can ascend the Wall from the South Gate, Small South Gate, East Gate, West Gate, North Gate, Heping Gate, Wenchang Gate and Hanguang Gate. You can",
          "The evening view is amazing. We rented a bicycle from 7pm and managed to get the day, evening and night views. It takes approximately 2 hours to cycle through all 4 sides of the wall. The surface can be quite bumpy and the rented bike had quite some resistance, hence the whole",
          "Xi'an is the :Cultural Heart\" of China. The city. comes alive at night The building pictured here is ablaze with colour after dark. What you're seeing now is another in a long line of \"tourist cell phone shots\", Bring a REAL camera and a tripod! I will try to post photos in",

          "This complete city wall is truly an experience to be had. Pay attention to the history and purpose of this wall and take your time traversing it. Look at the stones of the floor and you will see dating on some of them back to the 1800's. Enjoy the view of the surrounding city",
          "Apparently this is the only complete city wall remaining in China. If we had had more time it would have been good to walk round it more. Prettily lit up at night.",
          "This is the most complete ancient city wall in China. Entrance ticket is RMB 54. We get up from the south gate. It'll be hard to tour the whole city wall by walking. Recommended to rent a bike and it will easier.",
          "We went to the south gate of the wall where we could easily rent bikes, paying with cash (45 yuan per bike). Really great to take the tour on top of the amazing ancient city wall (14 km.). Nice views over the city. It sends you back in time and at the same time you could see",
          "We spent only an hour exploring one section of the wall, very interesting information to read about the wall and why it was built. Next visit I would consider hiring a bike to ride the perimeter.",
          "Others have written extensively but the city wall iscertainly worth the effort to visit. The south entrance is possibly the best with moat intact. We spent an hour at both the western and southern. The entire perimeter ( approx 13.7 km) is in good condition not simply keeping a",
          "We entered the wall at the West Gate at 4.30pm, and hired bikes to go around the wall. It was very easy, and self explanatory. A storm built up while we were there, and it was very dusty, but this added to the experience. Quite a long way between shelters, so beware if you get",
          "It is amazing to walk around the xian city wall and knowing it is from the Ming Dynasty times. Built around 1370. It is about 75 easy steps to the top, an easy climb and well worth it. Good view over both the old and new Xian townships. There is a pretty garden around it where",
          "Great for the entire family! The Xi'an city wall forms a barrier around the old city, it is a 13.7 kilometer rectangle and has a deep moat in front of it. The wall was used for protection and was completed by the first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty in the 1300's! There are",
          "The wall is excellent. We started the day with a Tai Chi lesson at the base of the main entrance and then spent a little time walking through the park adjoining it watching the locals, strolling, 'square' dancing, singing or playing ping pong. We then went up onto the wall",
          "The wall is huge. At least 13 kilometers around so to see it all the extra 45 rmb for 3 hours is well worth it. It is a pleasant way to avoid the crowds while riding between the North and South gates. If you rent your bike anywhere but the South Gate, you will have to turn it in",
          "Great walk or bike ride on the wall. Perfect place for photos as you look around the city of Xian. Friendly people and not as crowded as Beijing or Shanghai.",
          "It is nice that they have renovated the wll around the old city of Xian. For us it was not more than a wall with gates.",
          "Contrary to my expectations about Xi\u2019an as a \u201csmaller\u201d town in China, its a bustling city complete with 4-lane roads and large brand name stores! The wall is a nice reprieve, no vehicles allowed and a pleasant breeze. The most pleasant experience was when they refunded us for",

          "Xi'an used to exist as a smaller city with a wall with multiple gates at the end of the silk road. We were able to go through one of the gates and wander along parts of the wall. It's a cool place. On the wall you can see a huge bell that was previously used to sound alarms and",
          "Xi'an has such a long and amzing history that I was not aware of before this trip. In a sense, this was the other end of the Silk Road. I would love to come back to Xi'an for a week or two and just explore the wall, and museums and archeological sites..",
          "The thought of visiting this wall was one of the reasons for going to Xi'an, after all this is the wall that enclosed the original capital city of China and this is where the silk road started, so we are told. However, this is such an anti climax, it looks so modern it is hard",
          "Thrilled to walk on an ancient city wall that I see only in movies. Tried to imagine how it protected the city in case of invasion. Locals are lucky to have it now for recreation and enjoyment - walking, jogging, biking or simply viewing. .",
          "Cycling the city wall of Xi'an was fun - great way to get a sense of the city & its fortification. Flat cycle, comfortable bikes - didn't need gears. Well worth the effort",

          "We joined the city walls at South Gate. These are seriously substantial walls as there are a lot of steps leading up from street. Once on the wall it's really wide, like a big street, and bicycle hire is available. We found the road surface of cobblestone quite awkward to walk",
          "Xian is the old capital of China. Ancient City Wall is the best preserved city wall of China. Wonderful to stroll around or take a cycle for hire to complete the circle of 14 kilometers. The wall is 12 meters high and 18 meters wide and well maintained. While strolling you can",
          "Super easy to get around the entire wall. We rented bikes on the wall at the South Gate and did the perimeter. It was about 8.5 miles. Fun!",
          "A walk around the city wall.. A hot day. Went with a tour group but took only a few pictures of the surrounding",
          "You can spend as little or as long as you want. I had fun taking pictures of at least 3 brides there for their \"Wedding Pose\". It is another fascinating look at Chinese Customs and culture.",

The reality is, it\u2019s a 16km solid, wide, fairly well maintained castle for all intents and purposes. Think the Great Wall, but flat. We hired bikes and",

          "Take a bicycle is worth it. We really enjoy it, and in the night was amazing, we took the bicycles around 18 and stay until 21:30.",
          "This is a really nice way to see the city at a slight elevation. You can walk various sections of it and exit without having to do a full circuit. You can also cycle around it with a bike for a quicker experience. You can purchase a combination ticket for the wall and museum",
          "The city wall is a lovely place to walk, gives you a great view of the town, you can hire a bicycle to ride along the wall, a few stalls along the top, very easy to walk along and in good condition, we went with a tour, if I ever went back, would like to walk the whole wall,",
          "We went here on a very sunny day, which was super nice. Though it was during the national holidays, a lot of people. But the wall is quite big so we still had space. We decided not to walk around the whole wall, you can if you want; but it's a long walk. This is not the actual",

          "Great place, easy to walk around and look at the old fortress which is in good condition in the middle of town. Small enough to walk around/through yet it is an imposing wall to keep the city safe. The architecture is 'brutal' but significant and it is interesting that buildings",

          "An absolute blast. 14km circuit around the town wall. Basically all-flat but bumpy. You don\u2019t even need to be in good shape. Best part; you can grab a beer when you return your bike! Do it.",
          "My daughter and I cycled round the walls - it is 14 kms I think - but it is flat. The views are amazing and you can really take in the atmosphere of this amazing structure. Well worth the effort.",

          "Regarded initially as a potential demanding experience it proved to be pleasant and enjoyable. A little help from the sun, the quality of the rented bike, and a nice and serene atmosphere made the riding of the 13, 74 a thing to remember. Highly recommended",
          "We visited here on our tour, unexpected pleasant surprise. The Old City Wall is a great place to get a view of Xi'an from a different perspective. Unless you intend to walk a great portion of this wall, you will only need an hour or so to get a feel for it. Many tour groups",
          "A very impressive and massive structure, about 9 miles long and 46 feet wide. The wall has been rebuilt/reconstructed, but that doesn't take away the ancient feeling of this 600-year-old wall. The city wall is a excellent place to visit and allow yourself a couple of hours.",
          "Took a walk for about half of its length. It was crowded therefore we decided to skip the bike ride. It is was nice to see the city from the wall, however the wall itself is is quite similar except the gates. I guess you could stay away from the crowds if you go early in the",
          "Amazing way to see the city. Make sure it is not too hot as there is little shelter on top of the wall. Rent a bile and escape the crowds at the major gates. Stop for breaks along the way and bring water!",
          "The Xi'an City wall Is an amazing sight to see especially in the evenings as the sun sets and as the wall lights and lamps go on. The wall provides a beautiful opportunity to take a walk or bike ride with your friends or even solo as you enjoy scenic sights of the ancient builds",
          "The wall was much longer than I expected. If you don\u2019t have at least half day on it, you\u2019d better to hire a bicycle. We planed to walk to the next exit, it took us near one hour. Personally I don\u2019t think it is a must-see attraction, unless you do wish to see the old town in a",
          "Do the bicycle tour on the top of the wall. No traffic to contend with, and you get to look down on Xi'an from about 40 feet up. Look for the people excising in the park along the river front below you",
          "My wife and I visited Xi'an in Oct '17 and had the privilege to walk on the Old City Wall. It was so good, we had to return and so we did just a few weeks ago. This Old City Wall is so old, it is 40ft high, 12-14m wide at the top, with a 15-18m wide at the base. It is 14kms",
          "We rented bicycles to ride the 13.87 km around the top of the wall. This is a good way to get an overview of the city; you can see the old parts and the new parts and how they interact. It's also much faster than walking, leaving lots of time to see other fascinating things in",
          "Would\u2019ve liked to bike the wall but I didn\u2019t get a chance. Nicely restored wall. Impressive to see. Walk a section and take some photos",

          "The city wall is a popular place for visitors and deservedly so. It was a busy and lively place with walkers and bike riders alike. The height of the wall makes for good views and a lot is going on around the wall, with ballroom dancers and a saxophone player adding to the",
          "... Xi'an City Wall is one of the oldest, largest and best preserved in all of China ... and if that isn't a good enough reason to visit ... it's also (or it was when we were there) a serene respite from Xi'an city. Myself and teen daughter visited the almost deserted city wall",
          "We only had about 50 minutes here, and toured with our own guide as part of an SNA tour. It was very interesting! You can hire a bike and ride the wall (the walls are very wide) or you can just walk around like we did.",
          "You can rent sinlge or tandem bikes on top of the wall at most of the main gates. We rented at the south gate. You must pay to get on to the wall and then you can pay to rent bikes. I think you get up to 3 hours with the bikes, but you won't need it. it's only around 14",
          "The city wall is most impressive - very wide and you can walk or rent a bicycle and ride all the way around. Lovely views and watch towers.",
          "We were looking forward to go cycling on the city wall with our kids, as recommended in previous reviews. However, only kids from 12 years and up are allowed! This was quite a disappointment for us and the kids! Still, it is nice to take a walk there and look at the ancient",
          "We did only spent a small time hear but that was all the time you needed. There is a couple of market stalls and not much else a building and a few photo opportunity. nice to see up close part of a tour but not the great wall.",
          "We travelled with three other families all with 11 year old girls - we hired bikes and rode the wall! Note: will take 1-1.5 hrs... must be physically fit - some toilets and kiosk to buy water on the way - is pretty bumpy ride on the old original stones... so be prepared!! But",
          "We arrived in Xi'an at night and the city wall was all lit up highlighting the massive size of this structure. We visited during the day and were not disappointed as the height offered us a great view of parklands and the city within the wall as well as the novelty of seeing",
          "What a great way to while away an afternoon. The wall is quite big and long so you can either walk it or grab a bike for a nice leisurely ride around. Our guide filled us in on the history surrounding us then we all explored different areas. Give yourself at least 2 hours here",
          "This is an amazingly wide wall but the views are not spectacular. Nice for a walk or cycle as a break from the rush of the city.",
          "It was an amazingly beautiful and warm day and we decided to rent bikes. We cycled around 3/4 of the wall in about 1.5hrs and it was so cool. Lots of things to see and nice spots to take photos. There were a few photo shoots going on and loved all the girls in their red dresses,",
          "Beautiful structure , intact .Transports you in time. Extends for 7 miles around downtown , has nice view.",
          "Our tour included stop at the City Wall. Information about the construction of the wall is helpful to fully appreciate it, so if you have a guide, that will make the visit more meaningful. It's big (there are steps....there are steps everywhere in China!!!!) and there aren't",
          "Most probably the best thing to do in Xian. Recommend to hire a bike and enjoy the scenery all around. Cheap and nice.",
          "A visit to the City Wall places you at the intersection of old Xi'an and new Xi'an. We rented bikes and it took about an hour to take a leisurely trek across the top of the wall. Because of construction, we had to dismount our bikes and start again a few hundred meters away;",
          "the only totally intact walled city. Great condition and well worth the walk Ride a bike if you cant wall the 14km",
          "The city wall is a centre piece of Xi\u2019an. It is also the number 1 ring road. We visited one section only and they were also doing maintenance on part of the moat. It would have been good to hire a bike and go around the whole circuit. A magnificent testimony to those who built",
          "I went there during winter and it was desertic which was actually really beautiful. It is a huge place and I wish I had taken a bike, I think it is a good idea to do so if you want to see more of it. It\u2019s nice to go with a guide so you can learn some history out of it!",
          "One does not find a lot of city walls both large enough and in good shape enough to ride around it on a bicycle, but this one is. Its roughly a 8.5 mile trip though on what is essentially trail bikes, so its not the most comfortable ride for that long a cycling. My suggestion",
          "Six hundred years old and looking like it was built yesterday. The wall is 14 km circumference of the inner city and it looks like it can be covered by bicycles available for rent. It is clear the Chinese cherish their heritage",
          "I\u2019ve actually been to the City Wall several times throughout the year. The top of the wall is quite wide where you can rent bikes and travel the entire wall around the city. Bright colorful lights accentuate the majority of the wall with places to shop or have a snack and",
          "This is an architectural wonder and a stunning place to visit. Hard to describe just how immense and powerful these walls are. There are so well preserved that you really do get a feel for the scale and size of what it must have been like back in the day. You could spend",
          "A beautiful old city. The city wall is amazing. You can hire bikes to ride all around the wall. A must see.",
          "Now this is not the Great Wall of China, but I tell you, it feels like you're walking along a wall of a castle, which of course its not. Its a great place to walk or cycle or just sit and look over the city, depends on which side you're sitting. There is something different",
          "I really enjoyed my walk along a section of this historical wall. It was amazing to see the old city fortress up close with the modern day buildings in the background. It is like stepping back in time.",
          "Since a portion of the wall was very close to our hotel we walked over to visit it. As walls go, it was in very good condition and worth the short walk.",
          "You can rent bikes single and tandem and bike the wall. it's like 16K all the way around and allows you to get great views of the inner city. As well as the Buddist temple. A lot of wonderful places to take pictures. This wall surrounds the city....amazing You can park 2 M1",
          "The wall has been rebuilt/reconstructed, but that doesn't take away the ancient feeling surrounding the wall. If you can, look up some information ahead of time or hire a tour guide, I learned a lot of interesting history surrounding the wall and why it was rebuilt. There are",
          "Xian was ancient capital of China. It was fortification fort the palace to protect from the enemies. It was built by Hongwu Emperor Zhu.",
          "The wall runs all round the center of the city and is quite a walk. We managed half of just one portion and it was too tiring in the hot sun. Luckily, there was a stall renting bicycles that were the beefier MTB type rather than the street ones and it came in handy on the",
          "Its well worth renting a bike (45RMB) so you can cover the whole of the city walls as they are 8 miles long.",
          "Massive wall of approximately 14kms. We did a round on the wall by bike in just over an hour. One of the fastest rounds apparently, but a very nice one. Not to much to see from the wall, guess it\u2019s even better strolling the the quarters. It\u2019s the experience that leads to the",
          "The city wall around Xi'an is very impressive. It is tall and wide. So large infact that there are bicycle rentals places to ride a bike and ride around the whole thing. Even with a bike it'll take an hour or so to get around the circumference (unless you are reaching.) Each",
          "Part of the wall built during Ming dynasty is still preserved. This is obvious if you enter from south gate. During day time, it could be very hot. Remember to bring along a hat or umbrella. Bike rental service is available. It's only 13.3km to circle the city wall once. During",
          "Enjoyed this part of our city tour by bicycle 13 kilometres ride on the 12 metre wide road on top of the wall. So well preserved and clean as is the whole city with wonderful medieval buildings and beautiful gardens.",
          "When you think about this wall and that it is over 600 years old, it is amazing! We walked around on the top of it for a while and then saw there was a bicyle rental place on top of it. If we had the time, we certainly would have done that. It would be a great way to see the",
          "Hard to imagine such construction built without modern machinery. Garrisons still intact. Although the cobble stones are worn, the wall and all of its gates are beautiful.",
          "We spent our last morning here with a local guide prior to taking the high speed train back to Beijing. Do not miss going here. It dates to the Ming Dynasty and there is so much history.",
          "It was great to see the only complete city wall existing. Climb up and the walk the whole circumference or just a bit- upto you. Its around 14km so after a while the views stop being a highlight but if you want to get off remember you can only do so at certain points so plan for",
          "Its a MUST see in Xian. This is what makes this city a unique travel point. 14 Km in diameter, 12 meters thick at the top level 18m at the ground level and 20 meters tall. Price: 54 RMB one day ticket for adult 90 RMB double bike !!deposit of 100 RMB for one bike!! 35 RMB",
          "My hotel was near an entrance to the city wall. I got some cash, bought a ticket, and hiked up the stairs to the top of the wall. It is about 9 miles around and all along the way are placards in Chinese and English describing places, people, and events pertinent to particular",
          "Rent a bike and go around the wall. it's a great trip. Make sure you take lots of water ! It should take you about an hour and a half ... but expect a good couple of hours as you'll surely stop many times to see what is happening on both sides of the wall",
          "I've walked sections of it twice, but my dream is to rent a bike and cycle the entire city wall. The wall is 12-14 meters wide at the top, so even a wobbly cyclist like me should be able to stay out of trouble. I estimate it should take less than an hour to cover the 8-mile",
          "This was an unexpected surprise on our tour of Xi'an. Very impressive & massive fortress walls, about 8.5 miles long and 46 feet wide. Very well preserved - a nice walk or bicycle ride offers great views of the gates, towers, and the city, as well as the park surrounding the",
          "The climb to the top was short. The view was clear. Some people were riding bikes or strolling along the top. Because of the height, it was possible to take some very photos of the city.",
          "We were all amazed at the size of the wall. It is set as a square with 4 gates, with the road running through the gate meeting in the centre. All roads inside the wall meet at the centre structure, (I can't remember what it is called).",
          "This can be done without a guide- plenty of walking or cycling with stunning views. It would take a few hours to cycle or walk the full perimeter so would recommend just selecting a portion to do. Easy to acces",
          "There isn't much to say about this place really. They are city walls after all. They are restored so they are nice and safe to walk around and have some funky cartoon statues which myself and my guide enjoyed taking pictures with.",
          "Nothing much to see but it will be interesting if you will imagine how it was when you hear the story/usage of the structure in the olden time.",
          "This wall circles the city and is a great way to walk around the centre of Xian and mingle with the local people, who are very friendly. There are various steps that you can use to enter or exit if you want to look at something. The wall is also worth seeing at night as the",
          "Very steep steps lead to the top of the wall but it was worth the climb. To walk all the way would take quite a while but we went a fair way. On one side is the high-rise modern new city of Xi'an and on the other the old low-rise city. All along the new city side of the wall are",
          "There is something special about having this wall in Xi\u2019an. It looks like China and feels nostalgic. It lights up at night and can be enjoyed when you walk around town.",
          "Not extremely impressed with the scenery around but it is worthwhile to visit to appreciate the history behind. The city wall is 15km in total. Recommend to start at the South Gate & rent a bike to cycle if one is fit to cycle on cobblestone for 1 hour. Get off at Yongxin Place",
          "This market area provided ample opportunity to explore the various regional and cultural foods! The activity and vendors encouraging walkers by to sample their wares added to the adventure. Everything you can image on a stick, fried, seasoned or sweet to be bought and",
          "Biking along the top of the wall was one of the highlights of my trip to China. It is so unique to Xi'an and I would recommend it to anyone. My only regret is that I did not go the whole way around.",
          "As a city of around 11 million inhabitants and spread over a very large area, it is easy to forget that this is also an ancient city with a dynastic history of about 2,200 years and a history stretching way further back. To visit a section of the remaining city wall is a must.",
          "Walking here was like walking in the past, Imagine the hours, days, months and years of work to built this amazing place is incredible. Celine our guide knew and explain us every detail that we were wow!!",
          "its a must do if you are in Xian. there is a fee to get onto the wall and another fee to rent a bike. its about 14 km around the top of the wall. took about 90 minutes allowing for stops to take pictures. there are small shops and food places as well.",
          "I biked the city wall in 2009. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t leave enough time to do it on this visit in March 2019. But you can still do it and I loved it.",
          "Only did the South Gate as was short on time. However,there is not much of a sight. There are no bicycle rentals for kids and the buggy was 120yuan per pax. Took a few pictures and left.",
          "We did the evening tour to the ancient city wall of the ancient city. The original city wall was initiated before even there was a country of \"China\"! (During the so-called city state period of China, namely \"the Spring & War Period\" prior to 219 BCD, the site of the city of",

          "The South Gate entrance is definitely the prettiest and the busiest. I started at the North Gate and rented a bike to cycle around the wall and end at the South Gate 7km away. The entire perimeter is 14km. Biking is highly recommended as you can cover more in a shorter amount of",
          "The city wall is a great place to visit if you have a couple of hours to spare. You can walk it or ride a rented bicycle. Since it's a pedestrian walkway up high, you don't have to worry about speedy electric bikes or cars. Lots of fun!",
          "This wall is one of few which is still largely in tact. You can walk or hire a bicycle to travel the wall. Not an awful lot to see, the city wall now surrounds the more modern part of the city.",
          "I was transit to Beijing during the Spring Festival, I got the chance to visit Xian for a half day. That day was snowy with cold wind, I still tried riding a bicycle, pretty cold but fun. At that time, lantern show displayed, but I was not interested in it since I had seen much",
          "We really enjoyed touring on the city wall via bike. It was the perfect way to take in the immensity of this ancient structure and to see some interesting points along the way. Bike rental was inexpensive - only about $7, but we were surprised to learn that it was about $8 to",
          "Really fun activity for a family and great way to see the city. My son and I did it together. It was extra special given that all the lanterns are still there from the Spring Festival. I was tired by the end, though!!",
          "We spent several hours up on the wall. It is a good way to see the inner city. We decided to rent bikes because of time limits, and had a great time. The offer single and tandem bikes for rent. Wall is about 9 miles around, so bikes were helpful.",
          "Had a great time with my 6 students biking along the city walls. (Currently on exchange in Xi\u2019an) We accessed the wall via South Gate (54yuan/adult and 27/student) and there are stations for bikes in both directions. Bike cost 45yuan/3 hours or a tandem for 90yuan/3 hours. You",
          "We were here during the new year celebration so there were giant \u201clanterns\u201d on and around the wall which made it absolutely magical. They go all out for their most import holiday, the New Year. This is the year of the pig. So colorful and whimsical. Lots of steps so be aware.",
          "Definitely hire a bike and ride around the city wall in the late afternoon evening - they turn the lights on around 6pm. We went when the lantern festival (New Years) decorations were still up and it was stunning!! Bike hire cost us 45 for one person (90 for a tandem bike) with",
          "During my tour in Xi'an last January, Me and my Wife visited xi'an wall. An amazing structure to Walk around or to take a bike ride. the view is amazingly beautiful. never felt like leaving the place. I recommend everyone who comes to Xi'an to take a tour in Xi'an wall.",
          "Whilst it is a great way to see the city from a different aspect, there are some important things to note. When you first enter, and BEFORE you get on to the Wall, make sure you find out which gates allow you to exit (only where you see you can buy tickets on the ticket map) as",
          "Enjoyed climbing up and looking around d as well as the tremendous view at near sunset glorious view of the city scape",
          "Historic walled city is interesting, but there's nothing particularly memorable about the site. Clean, with restrooms, and renting a bike was kind of fun.",
          "An excellent place to watch Xi'an's life. Great place to be at sunshine, you can take hundreds of noce photos. If you wish to do the whole wall, you should rent a bike (inside the wall).",
          "We arrived during the Chinese New Year celebrations so there was a very festive atmosphere in the area surrounding the wall. We rented bicycles and although it was freezing cold, had great fun touring the wall and taking pictures.",
          "Nice quick stop to see the massive wall, take a quick stroll and snap a few photos. Some people were riding bicycles on top of the wall, and supposedly takes about 2 hours to pedal all the way around.",
          "Apart the Great Wall outside Beijing I never had the chance to walk on the city walls to site seeing around, and this was a per-se a unique experience. It's a long walk on a very wide street where no car are admitted, it felt strange. Time by time there are little buildings or",
          "This is one of the first things you will see once you get to the center of Xi'an. I wouldn't recommend doing a whole circuit on the wall, unless you have time to spare. I only did one quarter of the wall, nearest to the Drum and Bell towers. The view is pretty nice and the wall",
          "Visited during Spring Festival. Lots of people and lots of lit up decorations from the New Year. You have to go underground to get to the entrance. We initially had a hard time figuring out how to get to it...looked hopelessly for a staircase. You have to buy a ticket -- about",

          "I loved walking on the City Wall in Xi'an. The Lantern Festival at the South Gate was fantastic to see, both in the daytime and at night. We walked all the way from the south gate to the west gate and wanted to rent the bikes to finish the loop, but 2 of us were too old and 1",
          "Xi\u2019an City wall is an awesome experience. It\u2019s a good amount wider than the Great Wall (that you\u2019d visit when in Beijing) and has been very well preserved over the past 600 years. The wall surrounds both the Bell Tower and Drum Tower. A tour of the wall and towers is very",
          "Approaching Xi'an, it is impossible to not notice The Wall and its gates as you approach certain parts of the city. While The Wall can be seen from the ground in many areas, the best way to see and appreciate it is from above. The Wall forms a giant circuit that you can walk",
          "We spent 1 hour and half walking on this wall. The view from the top is very nice and because of the Chinese New Year the South Gate part was decorated in an amazing way. The prices of souvenirs and food on the wall are little bit expensive so I recommend to not buy anything.",
          "My wife and I walked the entire wall. There are bikes that can be hired in the wall or people were being driven around in golf carts as a part of a tour. Was a nice long walk and a great way to see the city.",
          "I trekked the entire wall, from South Gate to South Gate. It took a little under 4 hours, but that included some stops for water, souvenirs, and snacks. A bottle of water was 8 RMB, so more expensive than a convenience store, but it was really handy so I didn't mind terribly.",

          "This was a pleasant place to walk around and learn more about the history of the city and the region. We did not do the bike tour; but seemed like that was a popular attraction. The entire wall is 8 miles so is quite a long walk; only walked a portion; but was super enjoyable",
          "The bike ride experience was wonderful. We did the whole wall and saw the city from differnet sides. Very smart defensive system built around 600 or 700 years ago. Do not miss the Wall!",

          "If you go to Xi'an you have to walk the wall! OK you can cycle it, or go on an electric mini bus, but walking it gives you the full feel for how it must have been centuries ago. I didn't walk the full wall but the section from the South Gate to the East Gate, which must be",

          "Don't miss the chance to walk along this magical, ancient wall! It's so stunning the view from there!",
          "This city wall looks amazing at night time and you can walk on the wall easily. We stayed at Grand Park Xi'an which looks directly out onto the City Wall",

          "Our trip was arranged by China Highlights who provided Mark, a very knowledgeable guide. For the morning he arranged a visit to Xian city walls. I would say that in some ways these walls are even more remarkable than the Great Wall - their size and solidity was impressive.",
          "This was by far one of my favorite experiences in Xi\u2019an. I rented a bike at the East Gate and rode clockwise to the South Gate. The wall is much longer than I thought and biking around made it easy to see so much of the city. The bike ride is bumpy FYI. You will need \u00a5100 for a",

          "We were inside the walled city, explained Peter and now were off to see the wall at close quarters. Walled city? Unlike other cities/towns, where the walled portion houses the old city quarters, Xi'an is a tad different. While care has been taken to preserve the old monuments",
          "The wall was the favorite part of our trip in Xi'an for many of our group. Biking around the wall is worth it. Pollution was bad on the day we went so we couldn't see far off of the wall but it was still worth the visit. There are bathrooms located in many places which is a nice",
          "We had a short time to view these fortifications. Well worth spending an hour around the main area. Can hire a bike to ride around the complete wall if you have more time",
          "Oh, I loved this wall even more than the Great wall - believe or not. Here you can walk around, have a good view of the city. Look at people just enjoying themselves and, if you are lucky, seeing wedding/engament-photography. Also the wall is fantastic to see at night as it is",
          "It is well worth going up on the walls to appreciate the scale of them and the old city. You can hire bikes to ride around. I suggest going up late afternoon to evening as they and the city look best with the lights.",

          "There are crowded parts, but it was good to walk around farther than most and get away from the crowds. Interesting little dioramas are inside the watch towers. Some are broken, but it was funny to make up stories and descriptions of what happened.",
          "Bike the wall to comprehend the size of the city wall and its function. A short walk around doesn't do it justice. Bike rentals on top of the wall are easy and affordable.",
          "On one side of the all is the old city; on the other the contrasting modern city with wide roads and high buildings. There are two popular ways to experience the wall...walking and bicycling.Walking the wall is an educational experience. There are markers along the route with",
          "We were taken here on a tour and we were all really impressed. The wall is more than 15 kilometers long, and has been lovingly restored to its current beauty. Apparently much of it had been destroyed during centuries of wars. It is now a beautiful structure that can be enjoyed",
          "This was another amazing experience in Xi'an. The wall is quite wide and and goes right around the ancient town. On the one side you see the high rises on modern Xi'an, and the other side the older buildings. Good idea to be on the wall just after sunset, one gets incredible",

        "wiki": "The Tang dynasty (, [t\u02b0\u01ce\u014b]; Chinese: \u5510\u671d) or Tang Empire was an  imperial dynasty ruling China from 618 to 907, with an interregnum between 690 and 705. It was preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture. Tang territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the Han dynasty. \nThe L\u01d0 family (\u674e) founded the dynasty, seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire and inaugurating a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule. The dynasty was formally interrupted during 690-705 when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne, proclaiming the Wu Zhou dynasty and becoming the only legitimate Chinese empress regnant. The devastating An Lushan Rebellion (755\u2013763) shook the nation and led to the decline of central authority in the dynasty's latter half. Like the previous Sui dynasty, the Tang maintained a civil-service system by recruiting scholar-officials through standardized examinations and recommendations to office. The rise of regional military governors known as jiedushi during the 9th century undermined this civil order. The dynasty and central government went into decline by the latter half of the 9th century; agrarian rebellions resulted in mass population loss and displacement, widespread poverty, and further government dysfunction that ultimately ended the dynasty in 907.\nThe Tang capital at Chang'an (present-day Xi'an) was then the world's most populous city. Two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries estimated the empire's population at about 50 million people, which grew to an estimated 80 million by the dynasty's end. From its numerous subjects, the dynasty raised professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers for control of Inner Asia and the lucrative trade-routes along the Silk Road. Far-flung kingdoms and states paid tribute to the Tang court, while the Tang also indirectly controlled several regions through a protectorate system. The adoption of the title Khan of Heaven by the Tang  emperor Taizong was eastern Asia's first \"simultaneous kingship\". In addition to its political hegemony, the Tang exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring East Asian nations such as Japan and Korea.\nChinese culture flourished and further matured during the Tang era. It is traditionally considered the greatest age for Chinese poetry. Two of China's most famous poets, Li Bai and Du Fu, belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as Han Gan, Zhang Xuan, and Zhou Fang. Tang scholars compiled a rich variety of historical literature, as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. Notable innovations included the development of woodblock printing. Buddhism became a major influence in Chinese culture, with native Chinese sects gaining prominence. However, in the 840s Emperor Wuzong enacted policies to suppress Buddhism, which subsequently declined in influence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\n\nThe Li family belonged to the northwest military aristocracy prevalent during the Sui dynasty and claimed to be paternally descended from the Taoist founder, Lao Tzu (whose personal name was Li Dan or Li Er) the Han dynasty General Li Guang and Western Liang ruler Li Gao.  This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (Li lineage; \u96b4\u897f\u674e\u6c0f), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai.  The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu.\nLi Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo\u2013Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Yang You. On the news of Emperor Yang's murder by General Yuwen Huaji on June 18, 618, Li Yuan declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, the Tang.Li Yuan, known as Emperor Gaozu of Tang, ruled until 626, when he was forcefully deposed by his son Li Shimin, the Prince of Qin.  Li Shimin had commanded troops since the age of 18 years old, had prowess with bow and arrow, sword and lance and was known for his effective cavalry charges.  Fighting a numerically superior army, he defeated Dou Jiande (573\u2013621) at Luoyang in the Battle of Hulao on May 28, 621.  In a violent elimination of royal family due to fear of assassination, Li Shimin ambushed and killed two of his brothers, Li Yuanji (b. 603) and Crown prince Li Jiancheng (b. 589), in the Xuanwu Gate Incident on July 2, 626.  Shortly thereafter, his father abdicated in his favor and Li Shimin ascended the throne.  He is conventionally known by his temple name Taizong.\n\nAlthough killing two brothers and deposing his father contradicted the Confucian value of filial piety, Taizong showed himself to be a capable leader who listened to the advice of the wisest members of his council.  In 628, Emperor Taizong held a Buddhist memorial service for the casualties of war, and in 629 he had Buddhist monasteries erected at the sites of major battles so that monks could pray for the fallen on both sides of the fight.  This was during the Tang campaign against the Eastern Turks, in which the Eastern Turkic Khaganate was destroyed after the capture of its ruler, Illig Qaghan by the famed Tang military officer Li Jing (571\u2013649); who later became a Chancellor of the Tang dynasty. With this victory, the Turks accepted Taizong as their khagan, a title rendered as Tian Kehan in addition to his rule as emperor of China under the traditional title \"Son of Heaven\". Taizong was succeeded by his son Li Zhi (as Emperor Gaozong) in 649.\n\n\n=== Wu Zetian's usurpation ===\n\nAlthough she entered Emperor Gaozong's court as the lowly consort Wu Wei Liang, Wu Zetian rose to the highest seat of power in 690, establishing the short-lived Wu Zhou.  Empress Wu's rise to power was achieved through cruel and calculating tactics: a popular conspiracy theory stated that she killed her own baby girl and blamed it on Gaozong's empress so that the empress would be demoted.  Emperor Gaozong suffered a stroke in 655, and Wu began to make many of his court decisions for him, discussing affairs of state with his councilors, who took orders from her while she sat behind a screen.  When Empress Wu's eldest son, the crown prince, began to assert his authority and advocate policies opposed by Empress Wu, he suddenly died in 675.  Many suspected he was poisoned by Empress Wu.  Although the next heir apparent kept a lower profile, in 680 he was accused by Wu of plotting a rebellion and was banished.  (He was later obliged to commit suicide.)\n\nIn 683, Emperor Gaozong died. He was succeeded by Emperor Zhongzong, his eldest surviving son by Wu.  Zhongzong tried to appoint his wife's father as chancellor: after only six weeks on the throne, he was deposed by Empress Wu in favor of his younger brother, Emperor Ruizong.  This provoked a group of Tang princes to rebel in 684.  Wu's armies suppressed them within two months.  She proclaimed the Tianshou era of Wu Zhou on October 16, 690, and three days later demoted Emperor Ruizong to crown prince.  He was also forced to give up his father's surname Li in favor of the Empress Wu.  She then ruled as China's only empress regnant.\nA palace coup on February 20, 705, forced Empress Wu to yield her position on February 22.  The next day, her son Zhongzong was restored to power; the Tang was formally restored on March 3. She died soon after.  To legitimize her rule, she circulated a document known as the Great Cloud Sutra, which predicted that a reincarnation of the Maitreya Buddha would be a female monarch who would dispel illness, worry, and disaster from the world.  She even introduced numerous revised written characters to the written language, which reverted to the originals after her death.  Arguably the most important part of her legacy was diminishing the hegemony of the Northwestern aristocracy, allowing people from other clans and regions of China to become more represented in Chinese politics and government.\n\n\n=== Emperor Xuanzong's reign ===\n\nThere were many prominent women at court during and after Wu's reign, including Shangguan Wan'er (664\u2013710), a poet, writer, and trusted official in charge of Wu's private office. In 706 the wife of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang, Empress Wei (d. 710), persuaded her husband to staff government offices with his sister and her daughters, and in 709 requested that he grant women the right to bequeath hereditary privileges to their sons (which before was a male right only). Empress Wei eventually poisoned Zhongzong, whereupon she placed his fifteen-year-old son upon the throne in 710. Two weeks later, Li Longji (the later Emperor Xuanzong) entered the palace with a few followers and slew Empress Wei and her faction. He then installed his father Emperor Ruizong (r. 710\u2013712) on the throne. Just as Emperor Zhongzong was dominated by Empress Wei, so too was Ruizong dominated by Princess Taiping. This was finally ended when Princess Taiping's coup failed in 712 (she later hanged herself in 713) and Emperor Ruizong abdicated to Emperor Xuanzong.\n\nDuring the 44-year reign of Emperor Xuanzong, the Tang dynasty reached its height, a golden age with low economic inflation and a toned down lifestyle for the imperial court. Seen as a progressive and benevolent ruler, Xuanzong even abolished the death penalty in the year 747; all executions had to be approved beforehand by the emperor himself (these were relatively few, considering that there were only 24 executions in the year 730). Xuanzong bowed to the consensus of his ministers on policy decisions and made efforts to staff government ministries fairly with different political factions. His staunch Confucian chancellor Zhang Jiuling (673\u2013740) worked to reduce deflation and increase the money supply by upholding the use of private coinage, while his aristocratic and technocratic successor Li Linfu (d. 753) favored government monopoly over the issuance of coinage. After 737, most of Xuanzong's confidence rested in his long-standing chancellor Li Linfu, who championed a more aggressive foreign policy employing non-Chinese generals. This policy ultimately created the conditions for a massive rebellion against Xuanzong.\n\n\n=== An Lushan Rebellion and catastrophe ===\n\nThe Tang Empire was at its height of power up until the middle of the 8th century, when the An Lushan Rebellion (December 16, 755 \u2013 February 17, 763) destroyed the prosperity of the empire. An Lushan was a half-Sogdian, half-Turk Tang commander since 744, had experience fighting the Khitans of Manchuria with a victory in 744, yet most of his campaigns against the Khitans were unsuccessful. He was given great responsibility in Hebei, which allowed him to rebel with an army of more than 100,000 troops. After capturing Luoyang, he named himself emperor of a new, but short-lived, Yan state. Despite early victories scored by Tang General Guo Ziyi (697\u2013781), the newly recruited troops of the army at the capital were no match for An Lushan's frontier veterans, so the court fled Chang'an. While the heir apparent raised troops in Shanxi and Xuanzong fled to Sichuan province, they called upon the help of the Uyghur Khaganate in 756. The Uyghur khan Moyanchur was greatly excited at this prospect, and married his own daughter to the Chinese diplomatic envoy once he arrived, receiving in turn a Chinese princess as his bride. The Uyghurs helped recapture the Tang capital from the rebels, but they refused to leave until the Tang paid them an enormous sum of tribute in silk. Even Abbasid Arabs assisted the Tang in putting down An Lushan's rebellion. The Tibetans took hold of the opportunity and raided many areas under Chinese control, and even after the Tibetan Empire had fallen apart in 842 (and the Uyghurs soon after) the Tang were in no position to reconquer Central Asia after 763. So significant was this loss that half a century later jinshi examination candidates were required to write an essay on the causes of the Tang's decline. Although An Lushan was killed by one of his eunuchs in 757, this time of troubles and widespread insurrection continued until rebel Shi Siming was killed by his own son in 763.\n\nOne of the legacies that the Tang government left since 710 was the gradual rise of regional military governors, the jiedushi, who slowly came to challenge the power of the central government. After the An Lushan Rebellion, the autonomous power and authority accumulated by the jiedushi in Hebei went beyond the central government's control. After a series of rebellions between 781 and 784 in today's Hebei, Shandong, Hubei and Henan provinces, the government had to officially acknowledge the jiedushi's hereditary ruling without accreditation. The Tang government relied on these governors and their armies for protection and to suppress locals that would take up arms against the government. In return, the central government would acknowledge the rights of these governors to maintain their army, collect taxes and even to pass on their title to heirs. As time passed, these military governors slowly phased out the prominence of civil officials drafted by exams, and became more autonomous from central authority. The rule of these powerful military governors lasted until 960, when a new civil order under the Song dynasty was established. Also, the abandonment of the equal-field system meant that people could buy and sell land freely. Many poor fell into debt because of this, forced to sell their land to the wealthy, which led to the exponential growth of large estates. With the breakdown of the land allocation system after 755, the central Chinese state barely interfered in agricultural management and acted merely as tax collector for roughly a millennium, save a few instances such as the Song's failed land nationalization during the 13th-century war with the Mongols.With the central government collapsing in authority over the various regions of the empire, it was recorded in 845 that bandits and river pirates in parties of 100 or more began plundering settlements along the Yangtze River with little resistance. In 858, massive floods along the Grand Canal inundated vast tracts of land and terrain of the North China Plain, which drowned tens of thousands of people in the process.\nThe Chinese belief in the Mandate of Heaven granted to the ailing Tang was also challenged when natural calamities occurred, forcing many to believe that the Tang had lost their right to rule. Furthermore, in 873 a disastrous harvest shook the foundations of the empire; in some areas only half of all agricultural produce was gathered, and tens of thousands faced famine and starvation. In the earlier period of the Tang, the central government was able to meet crises in the harvest, as it was recorded from 714\u2013719 that the Tang government responded effectively to natural disasters by extending the price-regulation granary system throughout the country. The central government was able then to build a large surplus stock of foods to ward off the rising danger of famine and increased agricultural productivity through land reclamation. In the 9th century, however, the Tang government was nearly helpless in dealing with any calamity.\n\n\n=== Rebuilding and recovery ===\n\nAlthough these natural calamities and rebellions stained the reputation and hampered the effectiveness of the central government, the early 9th century is nonetheless viewed as a period of recovery for the Tang dynasty. The government's withdrawal from its role in managing the economy had the unintended effect of stimulating trade, as more markets with less bureaucratic restrictions were opened up. By 780, the old grain tax and labor service of the 7th century was replaced by a semiannual tax paid in cash, signifying the shift to a money economy boosted by the merchant class. Cities in the Jiangnan region to the south, such as Yangzhou, Suzhou, and Hangzhou prospered the most economically during the late Tang period. The government monopoly on the production of salt, weakened after the An Lushan Rebellion, was placed under the Salt Commission, which became one of the most powerful state agencies, run by capable ministers chosen as specialists. The commission began the practice of selling merchants the rights to buy monopoly salt, which they would then transport and sell in local markets. In 799 salt accounted for over half of the government's revenues. S.A.M. Adshead writes that this salt tax represents \"the first time that an indirect tax, rather than tribute, levies on land or people, or profit from state enterprises such as mines, had been the primary resource of a major state.\" Even after the power of the central government was in decline after the mid 8th century, it was still able to function and give out imperial orders on a massive scale. The Tangshu (Old Book of Tang) compiled in the year 945 recorded that in 828 the Tang government issued a decree that standardized irrigational square-pallet chain pumps in the country:\n\nIn the second year of the Taihe reign period [828], in the second month...a standard model of the chain pump was issued from the palace, and the people of Jingzhao Fu (d footnote: the capital) were ordered by the emperor to make a considerable number of machines, for distribution to the people along the Zheng Bai Canal, for irrigation purposes.|\nThe last great ambitious ruler of the Tang dynasty was Emperor Xianzong (r. 805\u2013820), whose reign was aided by the fiscal reforms of the 780s, including a government monopoly on the salt industry. He also had an effective well trained imperial army stationed at the capital led by his court eunuchs; this was the Army of Divine Strategy, numbering 240,000 in strength as recorded in 798. Between the years 806 and 819, Emperor Xianzong conducted seven major military campaigns to quell the rebellious provinces that had claimed autonomy from central authority, managing to subdue all but two of them. Under his reign there was a brief end to the hereditary jiedushi, as Xianzong appointed his own military officers and staffed the regional bureaucracies once again with civil officials. However, Xianzong's successors proved less capable and more interested in the leisure of hunting, feasting, and playing outdoor sports, allowing eunuchs to amass more power as drafted scholar-officials caused strife in the bureaucracy with factional parties. The eunuchs' power became unchallenged after Emperor Wenzong's (r. 826\u2013840) failed plot to have them overthrown; instead the allies of Emperor Wenzong were publicly executed in the West Market of Chang'an, by the eunuchs' command.\n\nHowever, the Tang did manage to restore at least indirect control over former Tang territories as far west as the Hexi Corridor and Dunhuang in Gansu. In 848 the ethnic Han Chinese general Zhang Yichao (799\u2013872) managed to wrestle control of the region from the Tibetan Empire during its civil war. Shortly afterwards Emperor Xu\u0101nzong of Tang (r. 846\u2013859) acknowledged Zhang as the protector (\u9632\u79a6\u4f7f, Fangyushi) of Sha Prefecture and jiedushi military governor of the new Guiyi Circuit.\n\n\n=== End of the dynasty ===\nIn addition to natural calamities and jiedushi amassing autonomous control, the Huang Chao Rebellion (874\u2013884) resulted in the sacking of both Chang'an and Luoyang, and took an entire decade to suppress. Although the rebellion was defeated by the Tang, it never recovered from that crucial blow, weakening it for future military powers to replace it. There were also large groups of bandits in the size of small armies that ravaged the countryside in the last years of the Tang. They smuggled illicit salt, ambushed merchants and convoys, and even besieged several walled cities.Zhu Wen, originally a salt smuggler who had served under the rebel Huang Chao, surrendered to Tang forces. By helping to defeat Huang, he was renamed Zhu Quanzhong and granted a series of rapid military promotions to military governor of Xuanwu Circuit. Zhu later conquered many circuits and became the most powerful warlord. In 903 he controlled the imperial court and forced Emperor Zhaozong of Tang to move the capital to Luoyang, preparing to take the throne himself. In 904 Zhu assassinated Emperor Zhaozong to replace him with the emperor's young son Emperor Ai of Tang. In 905 Zhu executed 9 brothers of Emperor Ai as well as many officials and Empress Dowager He. In 907 the Tang dynasty was ended when Zhu deposed Ai and took the throne for himself (known posthumously as Emperor Taizu of Later Liang). He established the Later Liang, which inaugurated the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. A year later Zhu had the deposed Emperor Ai poisoned to death.\n\n\n== Administration and politics ==\n\n\n=== Initial reforms ===\nTaizong set out to solve internal problems within the government which had constantly plagued past dynasties. Building upon the Sui legal code, he issued a new legal code that subsequent Chinese dynasties would model theirs upon, as well as neighboring polities in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. The earliest law code to survive was the one established in the year 653, which was divided into 500 articles specifying different crimes and penalties ranging from ten blows with a light stick, one hundred blows with a heavy rod, exile, penal servitude, or execution.The legal code distinguished different levels of severity in meted punishments when different members of the social and political hierarchy committed the same crime. For example, the severity of punishment was different when a servant or nephew killed a master or an uncle than when a master or uncle killed a servant or nephew.\n\nThe Tang Code was largely retained by later codes such as the early Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) code of 1397, yet there were several revisions in later times, such as improved property rights for women during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279).The Tang had three departments (Chinese: \u7701; pinyin: sh\u011bng), which were obliged to draft, review, and implement policies respectively. There were also six ministries (Chinese: \u90e8; pinyin: b\u00f9) under the administrations that implemented policy, each of which was assigned different tasks. These Three Departments and Six Ministries included the personnel administration, finance, rites, military, justice, and public works\u2014an administrative model which would last until the fall of the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912).Although the founders of the Tang related to the glory of the earlier Han dynasty (3rd century BC\u20133rd century AD), the basis for much of their administrative organization was very similar to the previous Northern and Southern dynasties. The Northern Zhou (6th century) fubing system of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The equal-field system of the Northern Wei (4th\u20136th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.Although the central and local governments kept an enormous number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.The center of the political power of the Tang was the capital city of Chang'an (modern Xi'an), where the emperor maintained his large palace quarters and entertained political emissaries with music, sports, acrobatic stunts, poetry, paintings, and dramatic theater performances. The capital was also filled with incredible amounts of riches and resources to spare. When the Chinese prefectural government officials traveled to the capital in the year 643 to give the annual report of the affairs in their districts, Emperor Taizong discovered that many had no proper quarters to rest in and were renting rooms with merchants. Therefore, Emperor Taizong ordered the government agencies in charge of municipal construction to build every visiting official his own private mansion in the capital.\n\n\n=== Imperial examinations ===\n\nStudents of Confucian studies were candidates for the imperial examinations, which qualified their graduates for appointment to the local, provincial, and central government bureaucracies. Two types of exams given, mingjing (\u660e\u7d93; \"illuminating the classics\") and jinshi (\u9032\u58eb; \"presented scholar\"). The mingjing was based upon the Confucian classics and tested the student's knowledge of a broad variety of texts. The jinshi tested a student's literary abilities in writing essays in response to questions on governance and politics, as well as in composing poetry. Candidates were also judged on proper deportment, appearance, speech, and calligraphy, all subjective criteria that favored the wealthy over those of more modest means who were unable to pay tutors of rhetoric and writing. Although a disproportionate number of civil officials came from aristocratic families, wealth and noble status were not prerequisites, and the exams were open to all male subjects whose fathers were not of the artisan or merchant classes. To promote widespread Confucian education, the Tang government established state-run schools and issued standard versions of the Five Classics with commentaries.Open competition was designed to draw the best talent into government. But perhaps an even greater consideration for the Tang rulers was to avoid imperial dependence on powerful aristocratic families and warlords by recruiting a body of career officials having no family or local power base. The Tang law code ensured equal division of inherited property amongst legitimate heirs, encouraging social mobility by preventing powerful families from becoming landed nobility through primogeniture. The competition system proved successful, as scholar-officials acquired status in their local communities while developing an esprit de corps that connected them to the imperial court. From Tang times until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912, scholar-officials served as intermediaries between the people and the government. \nYet the potential of a widespread examination system was not fully realized until the succeeding Song dynasty, when the merit-driven scholar official largely shed his aristocratic habits and defined his social status through the examination system.\nThe examination system, used only on a small scale in Sui and Tang times, played a central role in the fashioning of this new elite. The early Song emperors, concerned above all to avoid domination of the government by military men, greatly expanded the civil service examination system and the government school system.\n\n\n=== Religion and politics ===\n\nFrom the outset, religion played a role in Tang politics. In his bid for power, Li Yuan had attracted a following by claiming descent from the Taoism sage Lao Tzu (fl. 6th century BC). People bidding for office would request the prayers of Buddhist monks, with successful aspirants making donations in return. Before the persecution of Buddhism in the 9th century, Buddhism and Taoism were both accepted.\nReligion was central in the reign of Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712\u2013756). The Empreror invited Taoist and Buddhist monks and clerics to his court, exalted the Taoist ancient Lao Tzu with grand titles, wrote commentary on the Lao Tzu scriptures, and set up a school to prepare candidates for Taoist examinations. In 726 he called upon the Indian monk Vajrabodhi (671\u2013741) to perform Tantric rites to avert a drought. In 742 he personally held the incense burner while Amoghavajra (705\u2013774, patriarch of the Shingon school) recited \"mystical incantations to secure the victory of Tang forces.\"Emperor Xuanzong closely regulated religious finances. Near the beginning of his reign in 713, he liquidated the Inexhaustible Treasury of a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an which had collected vast riches as multitudes of anonymous repentants left money, silk, and treasure at its doors. Although the monastery used its funds generously, the Emperor condemned it for fraudulent banking practices, and distributed its wealth to other Buddhist and Taoist monasteries, and to repair local statues, halls, and bridges. In 714, he forbade Chang'an shops from selling copied Buddhist sutras, giving a monopoly of this trade to the Buddhist clergy.\n\n\n=== Taxes and the census ===\nThe Tang dynasty government attempted to create an accurate census of the empire's population, mostly for effective taxation and military conscription. The early Tang government established modest grain and cloth taxes on each household, persuading households to register and provide the government with accurate demographic information. In the official census of 609, the population was tallied at 9 million households, about 50 million people, and this number did not increase in the census of 742. Patricia Ebrey writes that nonwithstanding census undercounting, China's population had not grown significantly since the earlier Han Dynasty, which recorded 58 million people in the year 2. S.A.M. Adshead disagrees, estimating about 75 million people by 750.In the Tang census of 754, there were 1,859 cities, 321 prefectures, and 1,538 counties throughout the empire. Although there were many large and prominent cities, the rural and agrarian areas comprised some 80 to 90% of the population. There was also a dramatic migration from northern to southern China, as the North held 75% of the overall population at the dynasty's inception, which by its end was reduced to 50%.Chinese population would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty, when it doubled to 100 million because of extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with higher yields of grain sold in a growing market.\n\n\n== Military and foreign policy ==\n\n\n=== Protectorates and tributaries ===\nThe 7th and first half of the 8th century are generally considered to be the era in which the Tang reached the zenith of its power. In this period, Tang control extended further west than any previous dynasty, stretching from north Vietnam in the south, to a point north of Kashmir bordering Persia in the west, to northern Korea in the north-east.Some of the kingdoms paying tribute to the Tang dynasty included Kashmir, Nepal, Khotan, Kucha, Kashgar, Silla, Champa, and kingdoms located in Amu Darya and Syr Darya valley. Turkic nomads addressed the Emperor of Tang China as Tian Kehan. After the widespread G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk revolt of Shabol\u00fce Khan (d. 658) was put down at Issyk Kul in 657 by Su Dingfang (591\u2013667), Emperor Gaozong established several protectorates governed by a Protectorate General or Grand Protectorate General, which extended the Chinese sphere of influence as far as Herat in Western Afghanistan. Protectorate Generals were given a great deal of autonomy to handle local crises without waiting for central admission. After Xuanzong's reign, military governors (jiedushi) were given enormous power, including the ability to maintain their own armies, collect taxes, and pass their titles on hereditarily. This is commonly recognized as the beginning of the fall of Tang's central government.\n\n\n=== Soldiers and conscription ===\nBy the year 737, Emperor Xuanzong discarded the policy of conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending them out to the frontier every three years drained the treasury. By the late 7th century, the fubing troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided to them in the equal-field system. The supposed standard of 100 mu of land allotted to each family was in fact decreasing in size in places where population expanded and the wealthy bought up most of the land. Hard-pressed peasants and vagrants were then induced into military service with benefits of exemption from both taxation and corv\u00e9e labor service, as well as provisions for farmland and dwellings for dependents who accompanied soldiers on the frontier. By the year 742 the total number of enlisted troops in the Tang armies had risen to about 500,000 men.\n\n\n=== Eastern regions ===\n\nIn East Asia, Tang Chinese military campaigns were less successful elsewhere than in previous imperial Chinese dynasties. Like the emperors of the Sui dynasty before him, Taizong established a military campaign in 644 against the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo in the Goguryeo\u2013Tang War; however, this led to its withdrawal in the first campaign because they failed to overcome the successful defense led by General Yeon Gaesomun. Allying with the Korean Silla Kingdom, the Chinese fought against Baekje and their Yamato Japanese allies in the Battle of Baekgang in August 663, a decisive Tang\u2013Silla victory. The Tang dynasty navy had several different ship types at its disposal to engage in naval warfare, these ships described by Li Quan in his Taipai Yinjing (Canon of the White and Gloomy Planet of War) of 759. The Battle of Baekgang was actually a restoration movement by remnant forces of Baekje, since their kingdom was toppled in 660 by a joint Tang\u2013Silla invasion, led by Chinese general Su Dingfang and Korean general Kim Yushin (595\u2013673). In another joint invasion with Silla, the Tang army severely weakened the Goguryeo Kingdom in the north by taking out its outer forts in the year 645. With joint attacks by Silla and Tang armies under commander Li Shiji (594\u2013669), the Kingdom of Goguryeo was destroyed by 668.\n\nAlthough they were formerly enemies, the Tang accepted officials and generals of Goguryeo into their administration and military, such as the brothers Yeon Namsaeng (634\u2013679) and Yeon Namsan (639\u2013701). From 668 to 676, the Tang Empire would control northern Korea. However, in 671 Silla broke the alliance and began the Silla\u2013Tang War to expel the Tang forces. At the same time the Tang faced threats on its western border when a large Chinese army was defeated by the Tibetans on the Dafei River in 670. By 676, the Tang army tactically withdrew from Korea in favor of its new ally, Unified Silla. Following a revolt of the Eastern Turks in 679, the Tang abandoned its Korean campaigns.Although the Tang had fought the Japanese, they still held cordial relations with Japan. There were numerous Imperial embassies to China from Japan, diplomatic missions that were not halted until 894 by Emperor Uda (r. 887\u2013897), upon persuasion by Sugawara no Michizane (845\u2013903). The Japanese Emperor Tenmu (r. 672\u2013686) even established his conscripted army on that of the Chinese model, his state ceremonies on the Chinese model, and constructed his palace at Fujiwara on the Chinese model of architecture.Many Chinese Buddhist monks came to Japan to help further the spread of Buddhism as well. Two 7th-century monks in particular, Zhi Yu and Zhi You, visited the court of Emperor Tenji (r. 661\u2013672), whereupon they presented a gift of a south-pointing chariot that they had crafted. This 3rd century mechanically driven directional-compass vehicle (employing a differential gear) was again reproduced in several models for Tenji in 666, as recorded in the Nihon Shoki of 720. Japanese monks also visited China; such was the case with Ennin (794\u2013864), who wrote of his travel experiences including travels along China's Grand Canal. The Japanese monk Enchin (814\u2013891) stayed in China from 839 to 847 and again from 853 to 858, landing near Fuzhou, Fujian and setting sail for Japan from Taizhou, Zhejiang during his second trip to China.\n\n\n=== Western and Northern regions ===\n\nTang dynasty tomb figures|Tomb figure of mounted warrior similar to the one unearthed from the tomb of Crown Prince Li Chongrun.\nThe Sui and Tang carried out successful military campaigns against the steppe nomads. Chinese foreign policy to the north and west now had to deal with Turkic nomads, who were becoming the most dominant ethnic group in Central Asia. To handle and avoid any threats posed by the Turks, the Sui government repaired fortifications and received their trade and tribute missions. They sent four royal princesses to form marriage alliances with Turkic clan leaders, in 597, 599, 614, and 617. The Sui stirred trouble and conflict amongst ethnic groups against the Turks. As early as the Sui dynasty, the Turks had become a major militarized force employed by the Chinese. When the Khitans began raiding northeast China in 605, a Chinese general led 20,000 Turks against them, distributing Khitan livestock and women to the Turks as a reward. On two occasions between 635 and 636, Tang royal princesses were married to Turk mercenaries or generals in Chinese service. Throughout the Tang dynasty until the end of 755, there were approximately ten Turkic generals serving under the Tang. While most of the Tang army was made of fubing Chinese conscripts, the majority of the troops led by Turkic generals were of non-Chinese origin, campaigning largely in the western frontier where the presence of fubing troops was low. Some \"Turkic\" troops were tribalized Han Chinese, a desinicized people.Civil war in China was almost totally diminished by 626, along with the defeat in 628 of the Ordos Chinese warlord Liang Shidu; after these internal conflicts, the Tang began an offensive against the Turks. In the year 630, Tang armies captured areas of the Ordos Desert, modern-day Inner Mongolia province, and southern Mongolia from the Turks. After this military victory, Emperor Taizong won the title of Great Khan from the various Turks in the region who pledged their allegiance to both him and the Chinese empire (with several thousand Turks traveling into China to live at Chang'an). On June 11, 631, Emperor Taizong also sent envoys to the Xueyantuo bearing gold and silk in order to persuade the release of enslaved Chinese prisoners who were captured during the transition from Sui to Tang from the northern frontier; this embassy succeeded in freeing 80,000 Chinese men and women who were then returned to China.\n\nWhile the Turks were settled in the Ordos region (former territory of the Xiongnu), the Tang government took on the military policy of dominating the central steppe. Like the earlier Han dynasty, the Tang dynasty (along with Turkic allies) conquered and subdued Central Asia during the 640s and 650s. During Emperor Taizong's reign alone, large campaigns were launched against not only the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks, but also separate campaigns against the Tuyuhun, the oasis city-states, and the Xueyantuo. Under Emperor Gaozong, a campaign led by the general Su Dingfang was launched against the Western Turks ruled by Ashina Helu.The Tang Empire competed with the Tibetan Empire for control of areas in Inner and Central Asia, which was at times settled with marriage alliances such as the marrying of Princess Wencheng (d. 680) to Songts\u00e4n Gampo (d. 649). A Tibetan tradition mentions that Chinese troops captured Lhasa after Songts\u00e4n Gampo's death, but no such invasion is mentioned in either Chinese annals or the Tibetan manuscripts of Dunhuang.\nThere was a long string of conflicts with Tibet over territories in the Tarim Basin between 670\u2013692, and in 763 the Tibetans even captured the capital of China, Chang'an, for fifteen days during the An Shi Rebellion. In fact, it was during this rebellion that the Tang withdrew its western garrisons stationed in what is now Gansu and Qinghai, which the Tibetans then occupied along with the territory of what is now Xinjiang. Hostilities between the Tang and Tibet continued until they signed a formal peace treaty in 821. The terms of this treaty, including the fixed borders between the two countries, are recorded in a bilingual inscription on a stone pillar outside the Jokhang temple in Lhasa.\nDuring the Islamic conquest of Persia (633\u2013656), the son of the last ruler of the Sassanid Empire, Prince Peroz and his court moved to Tang China. According to the Old Book of Tang, Peroz was made the head of a Governorate of Persia in what is now Zaranj, Afghanistan. During this conquest of Persia, the Rashidun Caliph Uthman Ibn Affan (r. 644\u2013656) sent an embassy to the Tang court at Chang'an. Arab sources claim Umayyad commander Qutayba ibn Muslim briefly took Kashgar from China and withdrew after an agreement, but modern historians entirely dismiss this claim. The Arab Umayyad Caliphate in 715 desposed Ikhshid, the king the Fergana Valley, and installed a new king Alutar on the throne. The deposed king fled to Kucha (seat of Anxi Protectorate), and sought Chinese intervention. The Chinese sent 10,000 troops under Zhang Xiaosong to Ferghana. He defeated Alutar and the Arab occupation force at Namangan and reinstalled Ikhshid on the throne. The Tang dynasty Chinese defeated the Arab Umayyad invaders at the Battle of Aksu (717). The Arab Umayyad commander Al-Yashkuri and his army fled to Tashkent after they were defeated. The Turgesh then crushed the Arab Umayyads and drove them out. By the 740s, the Arabs under the Abbasid Caliphate in Khorasan had reestablished a presence in the Ferghana basin and in Sogdiana. At the Battle of Talas in 751, Karluk mercenaries under the Chinese defected, helping the Arab armies of the Caliphate to defeat the Tang force under commander Gao Xianzhi. Although the battle itself was not of the greatest significance militarily, this was a pivotal moment in history, as it marks the spread of Chinese papermaking into regions west of China as captured Chinese soldiers shared the technique of papermaking to the Arabs. These techniques ultimately reached Europe by the 12th century through Arab-controlled Spain. Although they had fought at Talas, on June 11, 758, an Abbasid embassy arrived at Chang'an simultaneously with the Uighur Turks bearing gifts for the Tang Emperor. In 788\u20139 the Chinese concluded a military alliance with the Uighur Turks who twice defeated the Tibetans, in 789 near the town of Gaochang in Dzungaria, and in 791 near Ningxia on the Yellow River.\n\nJoseph Needham writes that a tributary embassy came to the court of Emperor Taizong in 643 from the Patriarch of Antioch. However, Friedrich Hirth and other sinologists such as S.A.M. Adshead have identified Fu lin (\u62c2\u83fb) in the Old and New Book of Tang as the Byzantine Empire, which those histories directly associated with Daqin (i.e. the Roman Empire). The embassy sent in 643 by Boduoli (\u6ce2\u591a\u529b) was identified as Byzantine ruler Constans II Pogonatos (K\u014dnstantinos Pogonatos, or \"Constantine the Bearded\") and further embassies were recorded as being sent into the 8th century. S.A.M. Adshead offers a different transliteration stemming from \"patriarch\" or \"patrician\", possibly a reference to one of the acting regents for the young Byzantine monarch. The Old and New Book of Tang also provide a description of the Byzantine capital Constantinople, including how it was besieged by the Da shi (\u5927\u98df, i.e. Umayyad Caliphate) forces of Muawiyah I, who forced them to pay tribute to the Arabs. The 7th-century Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta wrote about the reunification of northern and southern China by the Sui dynasty (dating this to the time of Emperor Maurice); the capital city Khubdan (from Old Turkic Khumdan, i.e. Chang'an); the basic geography of China including its previous political division around the Yangtze River; the name of China's ruler Taisson meaning \"Son of God\", but possibly derived from the name of the contemporaneous ruler Emperor Taizong.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThrough use of the land trade along the Silk Road and maritime trade by sail at sea, the Tang were able to acquire and gain many new technologies, cultural practices, rare luxury, and contemporary items. From Europe, the Middle East, Central and South Asia, the Tang dynasty were able to acquire new ideas in fashion, new types of ceramics, and improved silver-smithing techniques. The Tang Chinese also gradually adopted the foreign concept of stools and chairs as seating, whereas the Chinese beforehand always sat on mats placed on the floor. People of the Middle East coveted and purchased in bulk Chinese goods such as silks, lacquerwares, and porcelain wares. Songs, dances, and musical instruments from foreign regions became popular in China during the Tang dynasty. These musical instruments included oboes, flutes, and small lacquered drums from Kucha in the Tarim Basin, and percussion instruments from India such as cymbals. At the court there were nine musical ensembles (expanded from seven in the Sui dynasty) that played ecletic Asian music.\n\nThere was great interaction with India, a hub for Buddhist knowledge, with famous travelers such as Xuanzang (d. 664) visiting the South Asian state. After a 17-year-long trip, Xuanzang managed to bring back valuable Sanskrit texts to be translated into Chinese. There was also a Turkic\u2013Chinese dictionary available for serious scholars and students, while Turkic folk songs gave inspiration to some Chinese poetry. In the interior of China, trade was facilitated by the Grand Canal and the Tang government's rationalization of the greater canal system that reduced costs of transporting grain and other commodities. The state also managed roughly 32,100 km (19,900 mi) of postal service routes by horse or boat.\n\n\n=== Silk Road ===\nAlthough the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141\u201387 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade.\n\nThe Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire withdrew its troops from its western lands, allowing the Tibetan Empire to largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded China's stringent immigrant laws . As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions.The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon.\n\n\n=== Seaports and maritime trade ===\n\nChinese envoys have been sailing through the Indian Ocean to India since perhaps the 2nd century BC, yet it was during the Tang dynasty that a strong Chinese maritime presence  could be found in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, into Persia, Mesopotamia (sailing up the Euphrates River in modern-day Iraq), Arabia, Egypt in the Middle East and Aksum (Ethiopia), and Somalia in the Horn of Africa.During the Tang dynasty, thousands of foreign expatriate merchants came and lived in numerous Chinese cities to do business with China, including Persians, Arabs, Hindu Indians, Malays, Bengalis, Sinhalese, Khmers, Chams, Jews and Nestorian Christians of the Near East, among many others. In 748, the Buddhist monk Jian Zhen described Guangzhou as a bustling mercantile business center where many large and impressive foreign ships came to dock. He wrote that \"many large ships came from Borneo, Persia, Qunglun (Indonesia/Java)...with...spices, pearls, and jade piled up mountain high\", as written in the Yue Jue Shu (Lost Records of the State of Yue). Relations with the Arabs were often strained: When the imperial government was attempting to quell the An Lushan Rebellion, Arab and Persian pirates burned and looted Canton on October 30, 758.  The Tang government reacted by shutting the port of Canton down for roughly five decades; thus, foreign vessels docked at Hanoi instead. However, when the port reopened, it continued to thrive. In 851 the Arab merchant Sulaiman al-Tajir observed the manufacturing of Chinese porcelain in Guangzhou and admired its transparent quality. He also provided a description of Guangzhou's landmarks, granaries, local government administration, some of its written records, treatment of travelers, along with the use of ceramics, rice, wine, and tea. Their presence came to an end under the revenge of Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, who purportedly slaughtered thousands regardless of ethnicity. Huang's rebellion was eventually suppressed in 884.\nVessels from neighboring East Asian states such as Silla and Balhae of Korea and the Hizen Province of Japan were all involved in the Yellow Sea trade, which Silla dominated. After Silla and Japan reopened renewed hostilities in the late 7th century, most Japanese maritime merchants chose to set sail from Nagasaki towards the mouth of the Huai River, the Yangtze River, and even as far south as the Hangzhou Bay in order to avoid Korean ships in the Yellow Sea. In order to sail back to Japan in 838, the Japanese embassy to China procured nine ships and sixty Korean sailors from the Korean wards of Chuzhou and Lianshui cities along the Huai River. It is also known that Chinese trade ships traveling to Japan set sail from the various ports along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces.\n\nThe Chinese engaged in large-scale production for overseas export by at least the time of the Tang. This was proven by the discovery of the Belitung shipwreck, a silt-preserved shipwrecked Arabian dhow in the Gaspar Strait near Belitung, which had 63,000 pieces of Tang ceramics, silver, and gold (including a Changsha bowl inscribed with a date: \"16th day of the seventh month of the second year of the Baoli reign\", or 826, roughly confirmed by radiocarbon dating of star anise at the wreck). Beginning in 785, the Chinese began to call regularly at Sufala on the East African coast in order to cut out Arab middlemen, with various contemporary Chinese sources giving detailed descriptions of trade in Africa. The official and geographer Jia Dan (730\u2013805) wrote of two common sea trade routes in his day: one from the coast of the Bohai Sea towards Korea and another from Guangzhou through Malacca towards the Nicobar Islands, Sri Lanka and India, the eastern and northern shores of the Arabian Sea to the Euphrates River. In 863 the Chinese author Duan Chengshi (d. 863) provided a detailed description of the slave trade, ivory trade, and ambergris trade in a country called Bobali, which historians suggest was Berbera in Somalia. In Fustat (old Cairo), Egypt, the fame of Chinese ceramics there led to an enormous demand for Chinese goods; hence Chinese often traveled there (this continued into later periods such as Fatimid Egypt). From this time period, the Arab merchant Shulama once wrote of his admiration for Chinese seafaring junks, but noted that their draft was too deep for them to enter the Euphrates River, which forced them to ferry passengers and cargo in small boats. Shulama also noted that Chinese ships were often very large, with capacities up to 600\u2013700 passengers.\n\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nBoth the Sui and Tang Dynasties had turned away from the more feudal culture of the preceding Northern Dynasties, in favor of staunch civil Confucianism. The governmental system was supported by a large class of Confucian intellectuals selected through either civil service examinations or recommendations. In the Tang period, Taoism and Buddhism were commonly practiced ideologies that played a large role in people's daily lives. The Tang Chinese enjoyed feasting, drinking, holidays, sports, and all sorts of entertainment, while Chinese literature blossomed and was more widely accessible with new printing methods.\n\n\n=== Chang'an, the Tang capital ===\n\nAlthough Chang'an was the capital of the earlier Han and Jin dynasties, after subsequent destruction in warfare, it was the Sui dynasty model that comprised the Tang era capital. The roughly square dimensions of the city had six miles (10 km) of outer walls running east to west, and more than five miles (8 km) of outer walls running north to south. The royal palace, the Taiji Palace, stood north of the city's central axis. From the large Mingde Gates located mid-center of the main southern wall, a wide city avenue stretched from there all the way north to the central administrative city, behind which was the Chentian Gate of the royal palace, or Imperial City. Intersecting this were fourteen main streets running east to west, while eleven main streets ran north to south. These main intersecting roads formed 108 rectangular wards with walls and four gates each, and each ward filled with multiple city blocks. The city was made famous for this checkerboard pattern of main roads with walled and gated districts, its layout even mentioned in one of Du Fu's poems. During the Heian period, the city of Heian ky\u014d (present-day Kyoto) of Japan like many cities was arranged in the checkerboard street grid pattern of the Tang capital and in accordance with traditional geomancy following the model of Chang'an. Of these 108 wards in Chang'an, two of them (each the size of two regular city wards) were designated as government-supervised markets, and other space reserved for temples, gardens, ponds, etc. Throughout the entire city, there were 111 Buddhist monasteries, 41 Taoist abbeys, 38 family shrines, 2 official temples, 7 churches of foreign religions, 10 city wards with provincial transmission offices, 12 major inns, and 6 graveyards. Some city wards were literally filled with open public playing fields or the backyards of lavish mansions for playing horse polo and cuju (Chinese soccer). In 662, Emperor Gaozong moved the imperial court to the Daming Palace, which became the political center of the empire and served as the royal residence of the Tang emperors for more than 220 years.\n\nThe Tang capital was the largest city in the world at its time, the population of the city wards and its suburban countryside reaching two million inhabitants. The Tang capital was very cosmopolitan, with ethnicities of Persia, Central Asia, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Tibet, India, and many other places living within. Naturally, with this plethora of different ethnicities living in Chang'an, there were also many different practiced religions, such as Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, and Zoroastrianism, among others. With the open access to China that the Silk Road to the west facilitated, many foreign settlers were able to move east to China, while the city of Chang'an itself had about 25,000 foreigners living within. Exotic green-eyed, blond-haired Tocharian ladies serving wine in agate and amber cups, singing, and dancing at taverns attracted customers. If a foreigner in China pursued a Chinese woman for marriage, he was required to stay in China and was unable to take his bride back to his homeland, as stated in a law passed in 628 to protect women from temporary marriages with foreign envoys. Several laws enforcing segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed during the Tang dynasty. In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced Uighurs in the capital, Chang'an, to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from passing off as Chinese.\n\nChang'an was the center of the central government, the home of the imperial family, and was filled with splendor and wealth. However, incidentally it was not the economic hub during the Tang dynasty. The city of Yangzhou along the Grand Canal and close to the Yangtze River was the greatest economic center during the Tang era.Yangzhou was the headquarters for the Tang government's salt monopoly, and was the greatest industrial center of China. It acted as a midpoint in shipping of foreign goods that would be organized and distributed to the major cities of the north. Much like the seaport of Guangzhou in the south, Yangzhou boasted thousands of foreign traders from all across Asia.There was also the secondary capital city of Luoyang, which was the favored capital of the two by Empress Wu. In the year 691 she had more than 100,000 families (more than 500,000 people) from around the region of Chang'an move to populate Luoyang instead. With a population of about a million, Luoyang became the second largest city in the empire, and with its close proximity to the Luo River it benefited from southern agricultural fertility and trade traffic of the Grand Canal. However, the Tang court eventually demoted its capital status and did not visit Luoyang after the year 743, when Chang'an's problem of acquiring adequate supplies and stores for the year was solved. As early as 736, granaries were built at critical points along the route from Yangzhou to Chang'an, which eliminated shipment delays, spoilage, and pilfering. An artificial lake used as a transshipment pool was dredged east of Chang'an in 743, where curious northerners could finally see the array of boats found in southern China, delivering tax and tribute items to the imperial court.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nThe Tang period was a golden age of Chinese literature and art. Over 48,900 poems penned by some 2,200 Tang authors have survived to the present day. Skill in the composition of poetry became a required study for those wishing to pass imperial examinations, while poetry was also heavily competitive; poetry contests amongst guests at banquets and courtiers were common. Poetry styles that were popular in the Tang included gushi and jintishi, with the renowned poet Li Bai (701\u2013762) famous for the former style, and poets like Wang Wei (701\u2013761) and Cui Hao (704\u2013754) famous for their use of the latter. Jintishi poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line stanzas or seven characters per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the antithesis is often lost in translation to other languages). Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (\u56b4\u7fbd; active 1194\u20131245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713\u2013766) era with \"canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.\" Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for Du Fu (712\u2013770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.The Classical Prose Movement was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors Liu Zongyuan (773\u2013819) and Han Yu (768\u2013824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the piantiwen (\u9a19\u9ad4\u6587, \"parallel prose\") style begun in the Han dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated piantiwen, they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct. This guwen (archaic prose) style can be traced back to Han Yu, and would become largely associated with orthodox Neo-Confucianism.Short story fiction and tales were also popular during the Tang, one of the more famous ones being Yingying's Biography by Yuan Zhen (779\u2013831), which was widely circulated in his own time and by the Yuan dynasty (1279\u20131368) became the basis for plays in Chinese opera. Timothy C. Wong places this story within the wider context of Tang love tales, which often share the plot designs of quick passion, inescapable societal pressure leading to the abandonment of romance, followed by a period of melancholy. Wong states that this scheme lacks the undying vows and total self-commitment to love found in Western romances such as Romeo and Juliet, but that underlying traditional Chinese values of inseparableness of self from one's environment (including human society) served to create the necessary fictional device of romantic tension.\n\nThere were large encyclopedias published in the Tang. The Yiwen Leiju encyclopedia was compiled in 624 by the chief editor Ouyang Xun (557\u2013641) as well as Linghu Defen (582\u2013666) and Chen Shuda (d. 635). The encyclopedia Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era was fully compiled in 729 by Gautama Siddha (fl. 8th century), an ethnic Indian astronomer, astrologer, and scholar born in the capital Chang'an.\nChinese geographers such as Jia Dan wrote accurate descriptions of places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, he described the sea route going into the mouth of the Persian Gulf, and that the medieval Iranians (whom he called the people of Luo-He-Yi) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the sea that acted as lighthouse beacons for ships that might go astray. Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the Persian Gulf, Arabic writers a century after Jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as al-Mas'udi and al-Muqaddasi. The Tang dynasty Chinese diplomat Wang Xuance traveled to Magadha (modern northeastern India) during the 7th century. Afterwards he wrote the book Zhang Tianzhu Guotu (Illustrated Accounts of Central India), which included a wealth of geographical information.Many histories of previous dynasties were compiled between 636 and 659 by court officials during and shortly after the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang. These included the Book of Liang, Book of Chen, Book of Northern Qi, Book of Zhou, Book of Sui, Book of Jin, History of Northern Dynasties and the History of Southern Dynasties. Although not included in the official Twenty-Four Histories, the Tongdian and Tang Huiyao were nonetheless valuable written historical works of the Tang period. The Shitong written by Liu Zhiji in 710 was a meta-history, as it covered the history of Chinese historiography in past centuries until his time. The Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, compiled by Bianji, recounted the journey of Xuanzang, the Tang era's most renowned Buddhist monk.\nOther important literary offerings included Duan Chengshi's (d. 863) Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang, an entertaining collection of foreign legends and hearsay, reports on natural phenomena, short anecdotes, mythical and mundane tales, as well as notes on various subjects. The exact literary category or classification that Duan's large informal narrative would fit into is still debated amongst scholars and historians.\n\n\n=== Religion and philosophy ===\n\nSince ancient times, some Chinese had believed in folk religion and Taoism that incorporated many deities. Practitioners believed the Tao and the afterlife was a reality parallel to the living world, complete with its own bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors. Funerary practices included providing the deceased with everything they might need in the afterlife, including animals, servants, entertainers, hunters, homes, and officials. This ideal is reflected in Tang dynasty art. This is also reflected in many short stories written in the Tang about people accidentally winding up in the realm of the dead, only to come back and report their experiences.Buddhism, originating in India around the time of Confucius, continued its influence during the Tang period and was accepted by some members of imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. In an age before Neo-Confucianism and figures such as Zhu Xi (1130\u20131200), Buddhism had begun to flourish in China during the Northern and Southern dynasties, and became the dominant ideology during the prosperous Tang. Buddhist monasteries played an integral role in Chinese society, offering lodging for travelers in remote areas, schools for children throughout the country, and a place for urban literati to stage social events and gatherings such as going-away parties. Buddhist monasteries were also engaged in the economy, since their land property and serfs gave them enough revenues to set up mills, oil presses, and other enterprises. Although the monasteries retained 'serfs', these monastery dependents could actually own property and employ others to help them in their work, including their own slaves.The prominent status of Buddhism in Chinese culture began to decline as the dynasty and central government declined as well during the late 8th century to 9th century. Buddhist convents and temples that were exempt from state taxes beforehand were targeted by the state for taxation. In 845 Emperor Wuzong of Tang finally shut down 4,600 Buddhist monasteries along with 40,000 temples and shrines, forcing 260,000 Buddhist monks and nuns to return to secular life; this episode would later be dubbed one of the Four Buddhist Persecutions in China. Although the ban would be lifted just a few years after, Buddhism never regained its once dominant status in Chinese culture. This situation also came about through a revival of interest in native Chinese philosophies such as Confucianism and Taoism. Han Yu (786\u2013824)\u2014who Arthur F. Wright stated was a \"brilliant polemicist and ardent xenophobe\"\u2014was one of the first men of the Tang to denounce Buddhism. Although his contemporaries found him crude and obnoxious, he would foreshadow the later persecution of Buddhism in the Tang, as well as the revival of Confucian theory with the rise of Neo-Confucianism of the Song dynasty. Nonetheless, Ch\u00e1n Buddhism gained popularity amongst the educated elite. There were also many famous Chan monks from the Tang era, such as Mazu Daoyi, Baizhang, and Huangbo Xiyun. The sect of Pure Land Buddhism initiated by the Chinese monk Huiyuan (334\u2013416) was also just as popular as Chan Buddhism during the Tang.\n\nRivaling Buddhism was Taoism, a native Chinese philosophical and religious belief system that found its roots in the Tao Te Ching (a text attributed to a 6th-century BC figure named Lao Tzu) and the Zhuangzi. The ruling Li family of the Tang dynasty actually claimed descent from the ancient Lao Tzu. On numerous occasions where Tang princes would become crown prince or Tang princesses taking vows as Taoist priestesses, their lavish former mansions would be converted into Taoist abbeys and places of worship. Many Taoists were associated with alchemy in their pursuits to find an elixir of immortality and a means to create gold from concocted mixtures of many other elements. Although they never achieved their goals in either of these futile pursuits, they did contribute to the discovery of new metal alloys, porcelain products, and new dyes. The historian Joseph Needham labeled the work of the Taoist alchemists as \"protoscience rather than pseudoscience.\" However, the close connection between Taoism and alchemy, which some sinologists have asserted, is refuted by Nathan Sivin, who states that alchemy was just as prominent (if not more so) in the secular sphere and practiced more often by laymen.\n\nThe Tang dynasty also officially recognized various foreign religions. The Assyrian Church of the East, otherwise known as the Nestorian Church or the Church of the East in China, was given recognition by the Tang court. In 781, the Nestorian Stele was created in order to honor the achievements of their community in China. A Christian monastery was established in Shaanxi province where the Daqin Pagoda still stands, and inside the pagoda there is Christian-themed artwork. Although the religion largely died out after the Tang, it was revived in China following the Mongol invasions of the 13th century.Although the Sogdians had been responsible for transmitting Buddhism to China from India during the 2nd to 4th centuries, soon afterwards they largely converted to Zoroastrianism due to their links to Sassanid Persia. Sogdian merchants and their families living in cities such as Chang'an, Luoyang, and Xiangyang usually built a Zoroastrian temple once their local communities grew larger than 100 households. Sogdians were also responsible for spreading Manicheism in Tang China and the Uighur Khaganate. The Uighurs built the first Manichean monastery in China in 768, yet in 843 the Tang government ordered that the property of all Manichean monasteries be confiscated in response to the outbreak of war with the Uighurs. With the blanket ban on foreign religions two years later, Manicheism was driven underground and never flourished in China again.\n\n\n=== Leisure ===\n\nMuch more than earlier periods, the Tang era was renowned for the time reserved for leisure activity, especially for those in the upper classes. Many outdoor sports and activities were enjoyed during the Tang, including archery, hunting, horse polo, cuju (soccer), cockfighting, and even tug of war. Government officials were granted vacations during their tenure in office. Officials were granted 30 days off every three years to visit their parents if they lived 1,000 mi (1,600 km) away, or 15 days off if the parents lived more than 167 mi (269 km) away (travel time not included). Officials were granted nine days of vacation time for weddings of a son or daughter, and either five, three, or one days/day off for the nuptials of close relatives (travel time not included). Officials also received a total of three days off for their son's capping initiation rite into manhood, and one day off for the ceremony of initiation rite of a close relative's son.\n\nTraditional Chinese holidays such as Chinese New Year, Lantern Festival, Cold Food Festival, and others were universal holidays. In the capital city of Chang'an there was always lively celebration, especially for the Lantern Festival since the city's nighttime curfew was lifted by the government for three days straight. Between the years 628 and 758, the imperial throne bestowed a total of sixty-nine grand carnivals nationwide, granted by the emperor in the case of special circumstances such as important military victories, abundant harvests after a long drought or famine, the granting of amnesties, the installment of a new crown prince, etc. For special celebration in the Tang era, lavish and gargantuan-sized feasts were sometimes prepared, as the imperial court had staffed agencies to prepare the meals. This included a prepared feast for 1,100 elders of Chang'an in 664, a feast for 3,500 officers of the Divine Strategy Army in 768, and a feast for 1,200 women of the palace and members of the imperial family in the year 826. Drinking wine and alcoholic beverages was heavily ingrained into Chinese culture, as people drank for nearly every social event. A court official in the 8th century allegedly had a serpentine-shaped structure called the 'Ale Grotto' built with 50,000 bricks on the groundfloor that each featured a bowl from which his friends could drink.\n\n\n=== Status in clothing ===\nIn general, garments were made from silk, wool, or linen depending on your social status and what you could afford. Furthermore, there were laws that specified what kinds of clothing could be worn by whom. The color of the clothing also indicated rank. \"Purple colored clothes were used by officials above the third grade; light red were meant for officials above the fifth grade; dark green was limited to the sixth grade and above officials; light green was solely for officials above the seventh grade; dark cyan was exclusive for officials above the eighth grade; light cyan garments adorned officials above the ninth grade. The common people and all those who did not reside in the palace were allowed to wear yellow colored clothes.\"  During this period, China's power, culture, economy, and influence were thriving. As a result, women could afford to wear loose-fitting, wide-sleeved garments. Even lower-class women's robes would have sleeves four to five feet in width.\n\n\n=== Position of women ===\n\nConcepts of women's social rights and social status during the Tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. However, this was largely reserved for urban women of elite status, as men and women in the rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of silk worms, while men tended to farming in the fields.There were many women in the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Taoist priestesses. The head mistresses of high-class courtesans in the North Hamlet of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power. Said courtesans, who likely influenced the Japanese geishas, were well respected. These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the drinking games, and were trained to have the utmost respectable table manners.Although they were renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans were known to dominate the conversation among elite men, and were not afraid to openly castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked too much or too loudly, boasted too much of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for everyone by rude behavior (on one occasion a courtesan even beat up a drunken man who had insulted her). When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized a new form of lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.It was fashionable for women to be full-figured (or plump). Men enjoyed the presence of assertive, active women. The foreign horse-riding sport of polo from Persia became a wildly popular trend among the Chinese elite, and women often played the sport (as glazed earthenware figurines from the time period portray). The preferred hairstyle for women was to bunch their hair up like \"an elaborate edifice above the forehead\", while affluent ladies wore extravagant head ornaments, combs, pearl necklaces, face powders, and perfumes. A law was passed in 671 which attempted to force women to wear hats with veils again in order to promote decency, but these laws were ignored as some women started wearing caps and even no hats at all, as well as men's riding clothes and boots, and tight-sleeved bodices.There were some prominent court women after the era of Empress Wu, such as Yang Guifei (719\u2013756), who had Emperor Xuanzong appoint many of her relatives and cronies to important ministerial and martial positions.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nDuring the earlier Northern and Southern dynasties (420\u2013589), and perhaps even earlier, the drinking of tea (Camellia sinensis) became popular in southern China. Tea was viewed then as a beverage of tasteful pleasure and with pharmacological purpose as well. During the Tang dynasty, tea became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. The poet Lu Tong (790\u2013835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of tea. The 8th-century author Lu Yu (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise on the art of drinking tea, called The Classic of Tea. Although wrapping paper had been used in China since the 2nd century BC, during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves. Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.\nEarlier, the first recorded use of toilet paper was made in 589 by the scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531\u2013591), and in 851 an Arab traveler commented on how he believed that Tang era Chinese were not careful about cleanliness because they did not wash with water (as was his people's habit) when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply used paper to wipe themselves.In ancient times, the Chinese had outlined the five most basic foodstuffs known as the five grains: sesamum, legumes, wheat, panicled millet, and glutinous millet. The Ming dynasty encyclopedist Song Yingxing (1587\u20131666) noted that rice was not counted amongst the five grains from the time of the legendary and deified Chinese sage Shennong (the existence of whom Yingxing wrote was \"an uncertain matter\") into the 2nd millenniums BC, because the properly wet and humid climate in southern China for growing rice was not yet fully settled or cultivated by the Chinese. But Song Yingxing also noted that in the Ming dynasty, seven tenths of civilians' food was rice. In fact, in the Tang dynasty rice was not only the most important staple in southern China, but had also became popular in the north, which was for a long time the center of China.\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, wheat replaced the position of millet and became the main staple crop. As a consequence, wheat cake shared a considerable amount in the staple of Tang. There were four main kinds of cake: steamed cake, boiled cake, pancake, and Hu cake.\n\nSteamed cake was consumed commonly by both civilians and aristocrats. Like the Rougamo in modern Chinese cuisine, steamed cake was usually stuffed by meat and vegetable. There were plenty of shops and packmen selling steamed cake in Chang\u2019an, and its price was also far from expensive. Taiping Guangji recorded a civilian in Chang'an named Zou Luotuo, who was poor and \"often push his cart out selling steamed cake.\"Boiled cake was the staple of the Northern Dynasty, and it kept its popularity in the Tang dynasty. The definition here was very broad, including current day wonton, noodles, and many other kinds of food that soak wheat in water. Consuming boiled cake was treated as an effective and popular way of diet therapy. While aristocrats favored wonton, civilians usually consumed noodles and noodle slice soup, because the process to make wonton was heavy and complicated.Pancake was hard to find in China before the Tang. But in the Tang dynasty pancake started becoming popular. There were also many shops in Tang cities selling pancakes. A story in Taiping Guangji recorded that a merchant in early Tang bought a large vacant lot in Chang\u2019an to set up several shops selling pancake and dumplings.Hu cake, which means foreign cake, was extremely popular in Tang. Hu cake was toasted in oven and covered by sesame. Restaurants in Tang usually treated Hu cake as an indispensable food in their menu. A Japanese Buddhist monk Ennin recorded in The Record of a Pilgrimage to China in Search of the Law that at that time Hu cake was popular among all civilians.\n\nDuring the Tang, the many common foodstuffs and cooking ingredients in addition to those already listed were barley, garlic, salt, turnips, soybeans, pears, apricots, peaches, apples, pomegranates, jujubes, rhubarb, hazelnuts, pine nuts, chestnuts, walnuts, yams, taro, etc. The various meats that were consumed included pork, chicken, lamb (especially preferred in the north), sea otter, bear (which was hard to catch, but there were recipes for steamed, boiled, and marinated bear), and even Bactrian camels. In the south along the coast meat from seafood was by default the most common, as the Chinese enjoyed eating cooked jellyfish with cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, cardamom, and ginger, as well as oysters with wine, fried squid with ginger and vinegar, horseshoe crabs and red swimming crabs, shrimp and pufferfish, which the Chinese called \"river piglet\".Some foods were also off-limits, as the Tang court encouraged people not to eat beef (since the bull was a valuable working animal), and from 831 to 833 Emperor Wenzong of Tang even banned the slaughter of cattle on the grounds of his religious convictions to Buddhism.From the trade overseas and over land, the Chinese acquired peaches from Samarkand, date palms, pistachios, and figs from Greater Iran, pine nuts and ginseng roots from Korea and mangoes from Southeast Asia. In China, there was a great demand for sugar; during the reign of Harsha over North India (r. 606\u2013647), Indian envoys to the Tang brought two makers of sugar who successfully taught the Chinese how to cultivate sugarcane. Cotton also came from India as a finished product from Bengal, although it was during the Tang that the Chinese began to grow and process cotton, and by the Yuan dynasty it became the prime textile fabric in China.Methods of food preservation were important, and practiced throughout China. The common people used simple methods of preservation, such as digging deep ditches and trenches, brining, and salting their foods. The emperor had large ice pits located in the parks in and around Chang'an for preserving food, while the wealthy and elite had their own smaller ice pits. Each year the emperor had laborers carve 1000 blocks of ice from frozen creeks in mountain valleys, each block with the dimension of 3 ft (0.91 m) by 3 ft by 3.5 ft (1.1 m). Frozen delicacies such as chilled melon were enjoyed during the summer.\n\n\n== Science and technology ==\n\n\n=== Engineering ===\n\nTechnology during the Tang period was built also upon the precedents of the past. Previous advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of Zhang Heng (78\u2013139) and Ma Jun (fl. 3rd century), which gave the Tang mathematician, mechanical engineer, astronomer, and monk Yi Xing (683\u2013727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork escapement mechanism in 725. This was used alongside a clepsydra clock and waterwheel to power a rotating armillary sphere in representation of astronomical observation. Yi Xing's device also had a mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a striking clock. Yi Xing's astronomical clock and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement. However, the most common type of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a steelyard balance that allowed seasonal adjustment in the pressure head of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.There were many other mechanical inventions during the Tang era. These included a 3 ft (0.91 m) tall mechanical wine server of the early 8th century that was in the shape of an artificial mountain, carved out of iron and rested on a lacquered-wooden tortoise frame. This intricate device used a hydraulic pump that siphoned wine out of metal dragon-headed faucets, as well as tilting bowls that were timed to dip wine down, by force of gravity when filled, into an artificial lake that had intricate iron leaves popping up as trays for placing party treats. Furthermore, as the historian Charles Benn describes it:\n\nMidway up the southern side of the mountain was a dragon\u2026the beast opened its mouth and spit brew into a goblet seated on a large [iron] lotus leaf beneath. When the cup was 80% full, the dragon ceased spewing ale, and a guest immediately seized the goblet. If he was slow in draining the cup and returning it to the leaf, the door of a pavilion at the top of the mountain opened and a mechanical wine server, dressed in a cap and gown, emerged with a wooden bat in his hand. As soon as the guest returned the goblet, the dragon refilled it, the wine server withdrew, and the doors of the pavilion closed\u2026A pump siphoned the ale that flowed into the ale pool through a hidden hole and returned the brew to the reservoir [holding more than 16 quarts/15 liters of wine] inside the mountain.\nYet the use of a teasing mechanical puppet in this wine-serving device wasn't exactly a novel invention of the Tang, since the use of mechanical puppets in China date back to the Qin dynasty (221\u2013207 BC). In the 3rd century Ma Jun had an entire mechanical puppet theater operated by the rotation of a waterwheel. There was also an automatic wine-server known in the ancient Greco-Roman world, a design of the Greek inventor Heron of Alexandria that employed an urn with an inner valve and a lever device similar to the one described above. There are many stories of automatons used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who stretched his hands out to collect contributions; when the amount of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved his arms to deposit them in a satchel. This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny slot machine. Other devices included one by Wang Ju, whose \"wooden otter\" could allegedly catch fish; Needham suspects a spring trap of some kind was employed here.In the realm of structural engineering and technical Chinese architecture, there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the Yingshan Ling (National Building Law). Fragments of this book have survived in the Tang L\u00fc (The Tang Code), while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the Yingzao Fashi (State Building Standards) by Li Jie (1065\u20131101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (712\u2013756) there were 34,850 registered craftsmen serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).\n\n\n=== Woodblock printing ===\n\nWoodblock printing made the written word available to vastly greater audiences. One of the world's oldest surviving printed documents is a miniature Buddhist dharani sutra unearthed at Xi'an in 1974 and dated roughly from 650 to 670. The Diamond Sutra is the first full-length book printed at regular size, complete with illustrations embedded with the text and dated precisely to 868. Among the earliest documents to be printed were Buddhist texts as well as calendars, the latter essential for calculating and marking which days were auspicious and which days were not. With so many books coming into circulation for the general public, literacy rates could improve, along with the lower classes being able to obtain cheaper sources of study. Therefore, there were more lower-class people seen entering the Imperial Examinations and passing them by the later Song dynasty. Although the later Bi Sheng's movable type printing in the 11th century was innovative for his period, woodblock printing that became widespread in the Tang would remain the dominant printing type in China until the more advanced printing press from Europe became widely accepted and used in East Asia. The first use of the playing card during the Tang dynasty was an auxiliary invention of the new age of printing.\n\n\n=== Cartography ===\n\nIn the realm of cartography, there were further advances beyond the map-makers of the Han dynasty. When the Tang chancellor Pei Ju (547\u2013627) was working for the Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a graduated scale in the tradition of Pei Xiu (224\u2013271). The Tang chancellor Xu Jingzong (592\u2013672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658. In the year 785 the Emperor Dezong had the geographer and cartographer Jia Dan (730\u2013805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia. Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1 m (30 ft) in length and 10 m (33 ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred li (Chinese unit of measuring distance). A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li. However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are star charts. Despite this, the earliest extant terrain maps of China come from the ancient State of Qin; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.\n\n\n=== Medicine ===\nThe Chinese of the Tang era were also very interested in the benefits of officially classifying all of the medicines used in pharmacology. In 657, Emperor Gaozong of Tang (r. 649\u2013683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official materia medica, complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops. In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians. Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and Sun Simiao (581\u2013682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with diabetes had an excess of sugar in their urine, and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and starchy foods. As written by Zhen Chuan and others in the Tang, the thyroid glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat goiters; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with goiter in the West until 1890. The use of the dental amalgam, manufactured from tin and silver, was first introduced in the medical text Xinxiu Bencao written by Su Gong in 659.\n\n\n=== Alchemy, gas cylinders, and air conditioning ===\nChinese scientists of the Tang period employed complex chemical formulas for an array of different purposes, often found through experiments of alchemy. These included a waterproof and dust-repelling cream or varnish for clothes and weapons, fireproof cement for glass and porcelain wares, a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes of underwater divers, a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas. The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as porcelain was invented in China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it.Ever since the Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep boreholes to transport natural gas from bamboo pipelines to stoves where cast iron evaporation pans boiled brine to extract salt. During the Tang dynasty, a gazetteer of Sichuan province stated that at one of these 182 m (600 ft) 'fire wells', men collected natural gas into portable bamboo tubes which could be carried around for dozens of km (mi) and still produce a flame. These were essentially the first gas cylinders; Robert Temple assumes some sort of tap was used for this device.The inventor Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) of the Han dynasty invented a rotary fan for air conditioning, with seven wheels 3 m (10 ft) in diameter and manually powered. In 747, Emperor Xuanzong had a \"Cool Hall\" built in the imperial palace, which the Tang Yulin (\u5510\u8a9e\u6797) describes as having water-powered fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains. During the subsequent Song dynasty, written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used.\n\n\n== Historiography ==\n\nThe first classic work about the Tang is the Old Book of Tang by Liu Xu (887\u2013946) et al. of the Later Jin, who redacted it during the last years of his life. This was edited into another history (labeled the New Book of Tang) in order to distinguish it, which was a work by the Song historians Ouyang Xiu (1007\u20131072), Song Qi (998\u20131061), et al. of the Song dynasty (between the years 1044 and 1060). Both of them were based upon earlier annals, yet those are now lost. Both of them also rank among the Twenty-Four Histories of China. One of the surviving sources of the Old Book of Tang, primarily covering up to 756, is the Tongdian, which Du You presented to the emperor in 801. The Tang period was again placed into the enormous universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, edited, compiled, and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song dynasty Chancellor Sima Guang (1019\u20131086). This historical text, written with three million Chinese characters in 294 volumes, covered the history of China from the beginning of the Warring States (403 BC) until the beginning of the Song dynasty (960).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAbramson, Marc S.

        "wiki": "Xi'an (UK:  shee-AN, US:  shee-AHN; Chinese: [\u0255\u00ed.\u00e1n] (listen)), also known as Sian, is the capital of Shaanxi Province. A sub-provincial city on the Guanzhong Plain in Northwest China, it is one of the oldest cities in China, the oldest prefecture capital and one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals, having held the position under several of the most important dynasties in Chinese history, including Western Zhou, Qin, Western Han, Sui and Tang. Xi'an is the starting point of the Silk Road and home to the Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shi Huang.Since the 1980s, as part of the economic growth of inland China especially for the central and northwest regions, the city of Xi'an has re-emerged as a cultural, industrial, and educational centre of the entire central-northwest region, with many facilities for research and development, national security and space exploration. Xi'an currently holds sub-provincial status, administering 11 districts and 2 counties. As of 2018 Xi'an has a population of 12,005,600 and the Xi'an\u2013Xianyang metropolitan area a population of 12.6 million. It is the most populous city in Northwest China, as well as the third most populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Chengdu. In 2019, it was named as one of the 7 main emerging megacities, or megalopolises, in China and designated as a metropolis that also consists of areas surrounding the city itself (citation needed). According to GaWC 2020, Xi\u2019an is ranked Beta-, an increase from Gamma last year. \n\n\n== Name ==\n\"Xi'an\" is the atonal pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of its name \u897f\u5b89, which means \"Western Peace\". (The apostrophe \u2013 known in Chinese as a \u9694\u97f3\u7b26\u865f, g\u00e9y\u012bn f\u00fah\u00e0o \u2013 should be included to distinguish its pronunciation from the single syllable xian.) The name was adopted in 1369 under the early Ming dynasty. Jesuit missionaries recorded its name as \"Si-ngan\" or \"Si-ngan-fou\" from its status as the seat of a prefecture (\u5e9c, f\u01d4). This form still appears in the Latin name of the Catholic diocese of Xi'an, archidioecesis Singanensis. The name was later romanized as \"Hsi-an\" by Wade & Giles and as \"Sianfu\" or \"Sian\" by the Qing imperial post office, both of which were common until the general adoption of pinyin.\nThe area of present-day Xi'an has been the site of several important former Chinese cities. The capital of the Western Zhou were the twin cities of Feng and Hao, known collectively as Fenghao, located on opposite banks of the Feng River at its confluence with the southern bank of the Wei in the western suburbs of present-day Xi'an. The Qin capital Xianyang was erected north of the Wei during the Warring States period and was succeeded by the Western Han capital of Chang'an (\u9577\u5b89), meaning \"Perpetual Peace\", which was located south of the Wei and covered the central area of present-day Xi'an. During the Eastern Han, Chang'an was also known as Xijing (\u897f\u4eac) or the \"Western Capital\", relative to its position to the main capital at Luoyang. Under the Sui, its name became Daxing (\u5927\u8208, \"Greatly Prosperous\") in AD 581. Under the Tang, the name reverted to Chang'an in 618. Under the Mongolian Yuan dynasty (13th & 14th centuries), it held a succession of names: Fengyuan (\u5949\u5143), Anxi (\u5b89\u897f, \"Peaceful West\"), and Jingzhao (\u4eac\u5146). The Ming name \"Xi'an\" was changed back to Xijing (\"Western Capital\", as above) between 1930 and 1943.\nXi'an currently does not have a widely accepted one-character abbreviation as many other Chinese cities do. Its license plates are simply marked with \u9655A, based on the name of its province.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nXi'an has a rich and culturally significant history. The Lantian Man was discovered in 1963 in Lantian County, 50 km (31 mi) southeast of Xi'an, and dates back to at least 500,000 years before the present time. A 6,500-year-old Neolithic village, Banpo, was discovered in 1953 on the eastern outskirts of the city proper, which contains the remains of several well organized Neolithic settlements carbon dated to 5600\u20136700 years ago. The site is now home to the Xi'an Banpo Museum, built in 1957 to preserve the archaeological collection.\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nXi'an became a cultural and political centre of China in the 11th century BC with the founding of the Zhou dynasty. The capital of Zhou was established in the twin settlements of Fengjing (\u4e30\u4eac) and Haojing, together known as Fenghao, located southwest of contemporary Xi'an. The settlement was also known as Z\u014dngzh\u014du to indicate its role as the capital of the vassal states. In 770 BC, the capital was moved to Luoyang due to political unrest.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nFollowing the Warring States period, China was unified under the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) for the first time, with the capital located at Xianyang, just northwest of modern Xi'an. The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang ordered the construction of the Terracotta Army and his mausoleum just to the east of Xi'an almost immediately after his ascension to the throne.In 202 BC, the founding emperor Liu Bang of the Han dynasty established his capital in Chang'an County; his first palace, Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae, \"Perpetual Happiness\") was built across the river from the ruin of the Qin capital. This is traditionally regarded as the founding date of Chang'an. Two years later, Liu Bang built Weiyang Palace (\u672a\u592e\u5bae, \"Never Ending Palace\") north of modern Xi'an. Weiyang Palace was the largest palace ever built on Earth, covering 4.8 square kilometres (1,200 acres), which is 6.7 times the size of the current Forbidden City and 11 times the size of the Vatican City. The original Xi'an city wall was started in 194 BC and took 4 years to finish. Upon completion, the wall measured 25.7 km (15.97 mi) in length and 12 to 16 m (39.37\u201352.49 ft) in thickness at the base, enclosing an area of 36 km2 (13.90 sq mi). In the year 190, amidst uprisings and rebellions just prior to the Three Kingdoms Period, a powerful warlord named Dong Zhuo moved the court from Luoyang to Chang'an in a bid to avoid a coalition of other powerful warlords against him.\nFollowing several hundred years of unrest, the Sui dynasty united China again in 582. The emperor of Sui ordered a new capital to be built southeast of the Han capital, called Daxing. It consisted of three sections: the Imperial City, the palace section, and the civilian section, with a total area of 84 km2 (32 sq mi) within the city walls. At the time, it was the largest city in the world. The city was renamed Chang'an by the Tang dynasty. In the mid-7th century, after returning from his pilgrimage to India, the Buddhist monk Xuanzang established a translation centre for Sanskrit scriptures.\nConstruction of the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda began in 652. This pagoda was 64 m (209.97 ft) in height, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras obtained from India by Xuanzang. In 707, construction of the Small Wild Goose Pagoda began. This pagoda measured 45 m (147.64 ft) tall at the time of completion, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras by Yijing. The massive 1556 Shaanxi earthquake eventually damaged the tower and reduced its height to 43.4 m (142.39 ft).The Nestorian Stele is a Tang Chinese stele erected in 781 that documents 150 years of early Christianity in China. It is a 279 cm tall limestone block with text in both Chinese and Syriac describing the existence of Christian communities in several cities in northern China. It reveals that the initial Nestorian Christian church had met recognition by the Tang Emperor Taizong, due to efforts of the Christian missionary Alopen in 635.Chang'an was devastated at the end of the Tang dynasty in 904. Residents were forced to move to the new capital city in Luoyang. Only a small area in the city continued to be occupied thereafter. During the Ming dynasty, a new wall was constructed in 1370 and remains intact to this day. The wall measures 11.9 km (7.4 mi) in circumference, 12 m (39.37 ft) in height, and 15 to 18 m (49.21\u201359.06 ft) in thickness at the base; a moat was also built outside the walls. The new wall and moat would protect a much smaller city of 12 km2 (4.6 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn October 1911, during the Xinhai revolution, revolutionaries attacked the Manchu fort in Xi'an city. Xinhai forces stormed the fort, killing some 20,000 Manchus, therefore successfully liquidated the entire population of Manchus in Xi'an city. The Hui Muslim community of northwestern China was divided in its support for the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. The Hui Muslims of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries and the Hui Muslims of Gansu supported the Qing.  The native Hui Muslims (Mohammedans) of Xi'an joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the Manchus. Only some wealthy Manchus who were ransomed and Manchu females survived. Wealthy Han Chinese seized Manchu girls to become their slaves and poor Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women to be their wives. Young pretty Manchu girls were also seized by Hui Muslims of Xi'an during the massacre and brought up as Muslims.A British missionary who witnessed the massacre commented that \"Old and young, men and women, children alike, were all butchered... Houses were plundered and then burnt; those who would fain have laid hidden till the storm was past, were forced to come out into the open. The revolutionaries, protected by a parapet of the wall, poured a heavy, unceasing, relentless fire into the doomed Tartar (Manchu) city, those who tried to escape thence into the Chinese city were cut down as they emerged from the gates.\"In 1936, the Xi'an Incident took place inside the city during the Chinese Civil War. The incident brought the Kuomintang (KMT) and Communist Party of China to a truce in order to concentrate on fighting against the Japanese Invasion. On May 20, 1949, the Communist-controlled People's Liberation Army captured the city of Xi'an from the Kuomintang force.Xi'an made headlines for being one of the many cities where the 2012 China anti-Japanese demonstrations occurred.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nXi'an lies on the Guanzhong Plain in the south-central part of Shaanxi province, on a flood plain created by the eight surrounding rivers and streams. The city has an average elevation of 400 metres (1,312 ft) above sea level and an annual precipitation of 553 mm (21.8 in). The urban area of Xi'an is located at 34\u00b016\u2032N 108\u00b056\u2032E. The Wei River provides potable water to the city.\nThe city borders the northern foot of the Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the south, and the banks of the Wei River to the north. Hua Shan, one of the five sacred Taoist mountains, is located 100 km (62 mi) away to the east of the city. Not far to the north is the Loess Plateau.\nAt the beginning of Han dynasty, Prime Minister Zhang Liang advised the emperor Liu Bang to choose Guanzhong as the capital of the Han dynasty: \"Guanzhong Plain, which is located behind Xiao Pass and Hangu Pass, connects Long (Gansu) and Shu (Sichuan). Lands of thousand miles rich in harvest be found here, as if this place belongs to the nation of heaven.\" (\u5173\u4e2d\u5de6\u5d24\u51fd\uff0c\u53f3\u9647\u8700\uff0c\u6c83\u91ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u6b64\u6240\u8c13\u91d1\u57ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd\u4e5f) Since then, Guanzhong is also known as the 'Nation of the Heaven'.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nXi'an has a temperate climate that is influenced by the East Asian monsoon, classified under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification as situated on the borderline between a semi-arid climate (BSk) and humid subtropical climate (Cwa). The Wei River valley is characterised by hot, humid summers, cold, dry winters, and dry springs and autumns. Most of the annual precipitation is delivered from July to late October. Snow occasionally falls in winter but rarely settles for long. Dust storms often occur during March and April as the city rapidly warms up. Summer months also experience frequent but short thunderstorms. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from around the freezing mark in January to 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 14.08 \u00b0C (57.3 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 31 percent in December to 47 percent in August, the city receives 1,536 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221220.6 \u00b0C (\u22125 \u00b0F) on January 11, 1955 to 41.8 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on June 21, 1998. A highest record of 42.9 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) was registered in another station on June 17, 2006.\n\n\n=== National Time Service Centre ===\nThe Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory was established in 1966. In 1975, according to the Geodetic Origin Report of the People's Republic of China, 'in order to avoid bias in the mensuration as much as possible, the Geodetic Origin would be in central mainland China.' Lintong (\u4e34\u6f7c), a town near Xi'an was chosen. Since 1986, Chinese Standard Time (CST) was set from NTSC. The NTSC in Lintong is 36 km (22 mi) away from Xi'an.\n\nNational Time Service Centre (NTSC), the Chinese Academy of Sciences is an institute which is mainly engaged in the service and research on time and frequency. NTSC takes charge of generating and maintaining the national standard time scale, disseminating the time and frequency signals. The autonomous standard time scales of universal time and atomic time and the dissemination techniques with LF radio and HF radio were established successively during the 1970s and 1980s, which meet all the requirements for different applications on the whole, such as the scientific researches, national economy, etc.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2007 Xi'an has a population of 4.07 million.\nCompared to the census data from 2000, the population has increased by 656,700 persons to 4.05;million. In contrast, the population in 2010 has steadily increased to 8.7 million and in 2016 the population is somewhat near 9 million for permanent residents.  The population is 51.66 percent male and 48.34 percent female. Among its districts, Yanta has the largest population, with 1.08 million inhabitants.The encompassing Xi'an-Xianyang metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 12.9 million, and locally as 13,569,700, of which 5,740,000 is urban.The majority of Xi'an residents are Han Chinese, who make up 99.1 percent of the city's total population. There are around 81,500 people belonging to ethnic minorities living in Xi'an, including 50,000 Hui people.During World War II, Xi'an became a destination for many refugees from other provinces of China, especially neighboring Henan Province. Because Xi'an was far inland, the invading Japanese army only managed a few aerial assaults on the city. As a result, Xi'an suffered minimal destruction. After 1949, the national government tried to balance the development in different regions of China, and relocated a number of factories and universities from other cities to Xi'an. Modern Xi'an Jiaotong University was relocated from its original campus in Shanghai.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Xi'an has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts and 2 counties:\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nXi'an has many areas that are easily accessible on foot. In many commercial, residential, educational zones in the city, especially in the shopping and entertainment districts around the Bell Tower, underpasses and overpasses have been built for the safety and convenience of pedestrians.\nElectric bikes are popular among students and offer easy transportation in and around the city for many residents. A bicycle-sharing network started operating in 2013 and today has 52,000 bikes, used by over 200,000 people per day. Taxi services are numerous, but many citizens of Xi'an still commute to work using the city's 270 official municipal bus routes serviced by a fleet of over 7,800 buses, with an average system-wide ridership of over 4 million people per day. The bus network is complemented by a rapidly expanding subway system that carries over 1.5 million commuters per day. There are more than 2 million registered automobiles in Xi'an; the growing number of personal automobiles also means traffic jams are a common urban issue.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nLine 2, running through the city from north (North Railway Station) to south (Weiqu Nan), was the first line opened to the public on September 16, 2011. Operations began on September 28, 2011. This line is 19.9 kilometres (12.4 miles) long with 17 stations. Line 1 opened on September 15, 2013. As a west\u2013east railway, its 19 stations connect Houweizhai and Fangzhicheng. Line 3 runs from northeast (Baoshuiqu) to southwest (Yuhuazhai) and opened on November 8, 2016.

          "Upon entering, went downstairs to see how Xi'an was set out with walled city then new buildings. Miniature display. Newish building very clean, clean modern bathrooms. Some early Chinese porcelain seen but had then to leave. Would t bother going back unless saw some advertising",

          "This is a free entry museum and therefore, when we arrived, the line for the tickets was very long. Fortunately, there was an option to pay for another exhibit and get immediate entry which we availed. The museum isn't that large and it was very crowded by students as well.",
          "This is a big building for the number of exhibits on show. I assume it's size is designed to handle large groups of people like school outings. What they do have is very interesting with a lot of ancient artifacts. Take a look at the floor of the basement which shows the local",

          "The building itself is quite beautiful as are the surrounding grounds with fountains, bridges and such. Inside are housed treasures going back many centuries. I was here with a tour so there wasn't nearly enough time to explore the whole museum. It's adjacent to the grounds of",
          "A very modern museum in the gardens that surround the small goose pagoda, it's worth a stop if you're coming to see the temple and grounds. There is a great model of ancient Xi'an in the basement and some beautiful statuary and pottery in the cases. Although it's all quite",
          "We were on our SNA tour and it was School Holidays. However, our tour guide Vina was very good and her knowledge exceptional. We enjoyed viewing the rooms and artifacts and seeing the schoolchildren who were very polite. Chinese families, very interested in Western people, very",
          "I don't think my review will be a fair reflection on the museum itself, as it was ridiculously hot on the day we actually decided to visit. There are a LOT of fine cultural relics kept here, most of which were unearthed in the important tombs and the capital sites of the Zhou",
          "If you are interested in real traditional architecture and relics, this is the place to be. Even though Xian is an ancient city, not much real stuff has left. This is one of the few.",
          "Had guide with us to explain what we were looking at, interesting, exhibits behind glasses, air conditioned shop, take water with you",
          "This is a must go point and very valuable place to understand the history of Xi'an which is over two thousand years. it's free but too many people. Highly recommend to book the ticket online.",
          "The museum is located in the same vicinity as the small goose pagoda and can be accessed through the northwestern exit gate. It is not as informative as Shaanxi museum and if you are on a tight schedule, feel free to skip it. Entrance is free and just bring along your passport.",
          "In comparison with other museums in Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing the museum lacks space and good display. Very crowded and stuffy. Make sure you don't visit on weekend or public holidays.",
          "The museum stands within a beautifully built building with well manicured lawns and fountains. I found the contents to be extremely informative and a great learning of ancient times",
          "Visited this museum together with a small climb up to the tower. The tower has nothing inside but you can its structure and the city view at the top. You have to pay 30rmb to climb the tower. Museum and park are free of charge. Museum has interesting artifacts and very",
          "This museum located by the side of the small goose pagoda is a treasure trove for archaeology lovers. It is divided into well organized sections over 3 floors. Great.",
          "The Xi'an museum is located in the compound of the small wild goose pagoda complex. It can be accessed free of charge, like the small wild goose pagoda, with the same entrance ticket that can be obtained at the entrance of the pagoda, a mere 10 mn walk from Nanxiaomen subway",
          "If u are interested in history\uff0c a best place to be\uff0ccan spent half day here. very interesting soverign shop too.",
          "Gives a miniature overview of the thousands of years of Chinese history and splendid ancient cultures",
          "You'll find many interesting exhibits here and you'll get to learn a lot about Xi'an's history (well... it is a museum).",
          "This was on our itinerary and, frankly, I wasn't keen on going. In the end though, it was very nice with a large selection of buddhas, lots of local Chinese art and gemstones (jade!). Cool exhibits and the space is not that big. Nice for an afternoon. The tea shop is great too.",
          "It was very interesting, but very very busy and the layout seemed a little backwards. We learned a lot and the history was very well explained, even in English so that was an added bonus. I would advise NOT going during the Chinese New Year, though!",
          "Good collection of artefacts in here. Lots of Buddhist collections too plenty to see We didn't spend too long in here but you could spend quite a while in there but we're not massively into museums so we looked at what we wanted to and then went off to see the small goose",
          "You can go this museum along with your trip to small wild goose pagoda. There is no entry fee (unless you want guided tour). This covers lot of history about Changan. Xian was known as Changan in ancient time. The museum is well managed and artifacts are displayed properly.",
          "Many people, including me, think there is only one museum in Xian. But there is 2 museums located in Xian. Xian museum has an incredible collection for Buddhistic sculpture and statues. This is one of my favorite museum for 5 years. The collection in this museum are",
          "medium size museum, lots of things to see, a great place to learn history, and building is so well design. you may have a good rest inside and outside the museum. you will regret if you did no visit here.",
          "My daughter and I really enjoyed wandering around the museum. My advice? Leave the tour guide behind. They just want to rush you through it and you'll miss more than half what's in here. Go on your own and enjoy!",
          "Free entry to museums really say something about a country, one of them being about how much emphasis is placed on its culture. This museum was situated inside a \"park\" where both the actual museum and the buildings in the park spoke about the lengthy history of China. I loved",
          "You should go there because it's free and glamorous. But you have to register your name with passport at the entrance. You ought to go on weekdays since you can walk without crowded people. However it is not a huge museum, you can visit through in 1-2 hours or less.",
          "A great museum to learn more about the history of X'ian, the province, and its people. Definitely recommended prior to other major sites.",
          "A very informative museum - I learnt a lot about Chinese history including the terracotta warriors which I visited the next day. Allow at least an hour here. Good for a rainy day and clean toilets",
          "A great museum to view even from the outside based on the beautiful architecture. The displays inside too are full of intrigue and wonder.",
          "Good pieces from 2ooo years ago, potteries, metal chariots & gold artifacts with intricate carving are really impressive.",
          "My wife and I really enjoyed visiting this museum. There were so many fascinating artifacts on display in and around the museum. A great place to spend a great day.",
          "its a shame all these sorts of sites are surrounded by markets and hawkers selling cheap nasty trinkets",
          "It's indoors in a huge enclosure to protect the Terra Cotta army figures and really an amazing find. Kind of out of the way but worth seeing for sure. While I was there I actually met one of the three peasants who discovered the artifacts while digging a well. The city of X'ian",
          "One of the best museums I have visited. The museum layout follows the Chinese history period and dynasties which is very good and interesting. Has some of the most amazing artifacts from the bronze chariots to ancient potteries and weapons. It does have some amazing terracotta",
          "Not a large collection but the different Buddhas and costumes were particularly interesting. Well worth a visit",
          "Xi'an Museum is rather small, and there is very little English. Admission is free with Little Goose Pagoda admission (which is also free). Recommend to visit only if you are killing time.",
          "you can see lots of pots,plates,statues from many ming dynsaties.a bit crowed but if you have the time a good visit",
          "We visited this museum as part of our tour and found it very good . Artifacts ranging from 2,000 year old weapons, plates , Wine vessels to Jade jewelry and other interesting pieces .",
          "It's a nice museum, but there's nothing particularly stand-out about the artefacts. All in all I think we spent about an hour there - it's not really worth more than that.",
          "There is a lot to see and learn from here, but on the day we went it was so crowded and hot we wanted to get out shortly after we arrived. And the crowds were pushy. Imagine that in China! ;-) Can skip this when touring Xi'an, in our opinion. There are plenty of relics to",
          "Very interesting, different view of the history of that region of China. I don't generally like the tourist trap places, of which this is one, but it is exceptionally interesting and informative.",
          "A Must do while in Xi'an, incredible discovery. It is about 1 1/2 hr away from the Airport, lots of traffic and very polluted",
          "First of all, do not confuse the Xi'an City Museum with the Shaanxi Provincial Museum, also in Xi'an. The Xi'an Museum price? Free! But bring a photo of your passport or bring some other government ID (heck, they took my Texas Driver's License). The collection, no",
          "This is a lovely museum,,so peaceful and so well laid out,,the buildings looked almost new but they had been built so long ago, we found that each temple or building we saw each had their own lay out of the gardens and buildings,,but they were all with the usual statures. I",
          "This museum is extremely well laid out, it's lighting is dramatic. I was astounded how the ancient Chinese, had so much power over life and death. The Horse graves I found disturbing. But, this was the reality at that time. Excellent museum, just excellent. We were very licky in",
          "I liked how every thing was put in order. You just started at one floor and worked your way down or up.",
          "great place to spend at most 3 hours.this is not an all day location to visit. no 1 pit is the most exciting. the building they are housed in is as big as an aircraft hanger. you can also get something to eat hare lots of outlets to suit all tastes.",
          "This gives you a good insight into the on going work, how and when the pits were discovered, and what other artefacts have been discovered. Did you know that no 2 warriors are the same, each warrior that worked for the emperor had to make a warrior in the image of a colleague.",
          "It has a collection smaller than the Shanxi History Museum. However, compared with the other city owned museums, this one is great. The highlight is the small wild goose pogoda next to its side door. That was an ancient pogoda built in the Tang nynasty when Buddhism got to",
          "Despite the crowd, I liked hearing many young Chinese students ask questions about what they were looking at.",
          "Museum is big enough to show the ancient culture and history in China,several section of the exhibit are excellent to show the bronze culture and the ancient Silk Riad. The challenge is too crowed as the tickets is free, also some part occupied for shopping area,make the museum",
          "Great museum to wander all day in. If you don't mind reading, skip taking the guide here. They tend to hurry you along. This is because most locals do not appreciate museums.",
          "We visited this museum, which is attached to the Small Wild Goose pagoda grounds. It is nicely arranged and had some wonderful exhibits and information.",
          "A smaller museum than the Shaanxi Museum, the entrance fee is free, after you show them your identification. Inside you can watch the audio video presentation in Mandarin on the Little Wild Goose ( small fee ), The pagoda, which is within the compound, but to climb the pagoda,",
          "Downtown Xian, easy taxi ride from hotel district. Beautiful building, Well lighted and mounted exhibits. Worth a visit.",
          "I picked the Xian Museum because others on tripadvisor said it was a good size and had good air conditioning, and they were right. it's located right by the Small Wild Goose Pagoda. If you go in that way, you then wander through a bunch of souvenir and art shops, and a park,",
          "Just to reiterate, we're talking here about the Xi'an Museum, situated just south of the Small Wild Goose Pagoda park. The entrance is on \u6731\u96c0\u5927\u8857 (ZhuQue DaJie). A nice collection of Buddhist statues, steles, etc, from the Northern Zhou Dynasty and others. Some of the labelling is",
          "A beautifully designed museum with an excellent display of Chinese artifacts -especially detailing the history of the terracotta army. Strongly recommend visiting the museum before visiting the site of the terracotta warriors. The museum's display is a perfect introduction to",
          "I strongly recommend people to spend at least half a day to visit Xi'an museum. It packs with 13 dynasties of Chinese history and is well organized. It is a must visit place and gives you knowledge of most influential dynasties of Chinese ancient history.",
          "Less on show than Shaanxi but just as good & the displays were of similar periods. Again a few problems with the small labels but still worth a visit.",
          "Unlike the provincial museum in Xi\"an this museum was effectively air conditioned and not overcrowded, it's in a purpose built building adjacent to the small wild goose Pagoda, I'm not a museum geek and I suspect the exhibits were nothing spectacular but it did have a nice feel",
          "One learns the glorious history of China, somewhat well kept secret. Need 2-3 hours if you are museum lover. Decent outlets for lunch and good souvenirs !",
          "Located new the south gate the Xian Beilin Museum displays steles and engraved stone work. It ha Steven display rooms, eight pavilions so there is a lot to see. I feel it is well worth the visit.",
          "this is a bucket list item- very very crowded, but you must see it. Be wary of the vendors just outside, you will have a hard time shaking them loose. The excavation is amazing.",
          "Because the rain was blocking us to stay outside, we spend some valuable time here in this museum. And we learned a lot. Nice set up and displays.",
          "Not a big fan of museums. Having said that this much more quiet than other museums so it was possible to visit in a leasurely manner",
          "If you want to learn more about China's culture and history, you must visit this museum and be sure to be overwhelmed by the items on display. The details, the craftsmanship of the artists is beyond imagination. Take your time not to miss anything and take your pictures for",
          "How many museums can you visit? Well as many as neccessary to see how many diferences there are in this huge country. So, here you may see displays of pottery, brass and copper ware, document seals ( chops ) and calligraphy and costumes that are unique to this region.",
          "Present your passport and Museum entry is free. Lines are long, but camaraderie prevails and it\u2019s part of the experience. Walking distance from subway stop. Museum closed Mondays. An easy and interesting way to spend a morning or afternoon.",
          "Something you won't see anywhere else in the world obviously ! Busy place, get out there early in the day & just accept that it will be busy! Wear comfortable shoes :) but there is assistance for those who can't walk too far. Lots of eating houses on site.",
          "Xi'an has such an amazing history - capital city of the Chinese Empire for over 1,000 years. Well worth a visit to this museum for a \"snapshot\".",
          "As a museum opens public for tourists, I'm surprised 1 or 2 exhibits do not have English translations at all for every piece of material. And apparently the guy works at tourist center at the museum doesn't understand fully in english (we asked if there's English audio guide",
          "It is worth visiting the museum as well as the small pagoda garden next door to it. There is a floor map at then entrance of the museum showing how various dynasties have influenced the development of the area. The basement has a scale model of old Xi'an which is very",
          "Most of the pieces were unearthed in the area in the '70s and '80s. I can't even imagine how incredible it would have been to be part of the archeology of this area during that time. These pieces are like those you will only see in art history textbooks as they will most likely",
          "The building is designed by IM Pei, and is free, uncrowded and easy to get to. The museum contents are a small subset of what is in the Shanghai Museum, which is very worth seeing. There is also a rotating exhibition which for us was a contemporary artist with large disturbing",
          "I was surprised to see a museum selling artifacts from the past. The prices seem fair considering the value of the products.",
          "It was a really large museum with a lot of history packed into it. It was overwhelming. You needed at least 3 to 4 hours to view everything.",
          "The artifacts in this building are priceless, some go back thousands of years, truly a marvel to behold, and they allow photography.",
          "This is incredible so many artifacts and requries a number of hours to take it all in. Some of the peices are so old and makes you appreciate the age of China and all the struggles they have endured.",
          "This Pagoda with the surrounding well-kept park is worth a visit. Located some 1.5 miles south of the Xi\u2019an City Wall, it is easily accessible by public bus. We spent a leisurely afternoon in this site. Quite a number of birds like magpies, sparrows and the colourful hoopoe",
          "The museum is modern and is definitely a must see attraction. The history is well documented and the artifacts on display will impress you.",
          "A bit of a misnomer on the Tripadvisor listing. This is a double attraction and with free entry : the Small White Goose pagoda and the Xi'an Museum. We visited on a rainy morning and the pagoda gardens were lovely and very peaceful : a great contrast to the Great Wild Goose",
          "There are a lot of treasures in this museum. I regret not to hire a guide since I am sure there are many interesting stories behind the displays. We were there for 2 hours, didn't get to read many descriptions.",
          "This was worth a look although there was not much there. The pagoda itself was not open so other than a couple of minutes to walk around it and visit the bell and drum towers, there isn't much else. The buildings around have been taken over as shops but the whole site could do",
          "The Terra Cotta Exhibit is extensive, it can take the whole day if you want to see all 3 archeological digs/pavilions plus the Museum itself. Tkae the time to read and soak in everything. Avoid the summer crowds, easier to do in the winter low season, even though it still gets",
          "This museum is good, but if you compare to Beijing national museum or Shanghai museum then not so good",
          "A lot of eye-candy in this museum. There is a whole lot to see and you will probably spend a few hours there. Here and there I would have loved to read a bit more about the displayed weapons, tools, pottery or jewellery.",
          "I entered the park containing the Xi'an Museum and Small Goose Pagoda from the North, buying a ticket for the Pagoda at the entrance; I presume that this must have also served as the ticket for the entire complex including the Xi'an Museum as no-one subsequently asked to see my",
          "This museum has free entrance, but the daily number of visitors is limited to 4,000 (I believe), on a first-come-first-served basis. Since I came after lunch, I was afraid that I would not get a permit. Fortunately, the system works in such a way that half of the daily tickets",
          "very good museum, with some exceptional pieces. The entrance is free, but there's usually a line as they limit the number of people that can go in. We were there with an infant on a cold day, so we when we were approached by some locals offering to get you tickets for 10 RMB, we",
          "This is a lovely small museum with some great pieces of Chinese history. The entrance ticket is free when you show your passport or id, although there may be a limit to the number of free tickets they give out a day. The ticket also includes the temple and small pagoda. There is",
          "We really enjoyed this museum on a cold damp day. It is beautifully laid out, with objects well-displayed. It is true there is not a lot of information in English. But the objects displayed were exquisite. It is on the grounds of the Small Wild Goose Pagoda, which we were not",
          "A compact museum with excellent pieces and display makes it easy and enjoyable for any age. If you are some that likes to spend several hours there's plenty to see, but it is laid out in a way that those who have limited time can also great an insight into the history of the",
          "Hope this is the right museum, its with the Pagoda mentioned. Interesting exhibits, beautifully displayed, not a very big place but worth a look.",
          "If you don't read Chinese, make sure you get a guide. Most of the captions are in Chinese. Lots of artifacts but lack of explanation. However, if you like history, should pay this visit",
          "If you plan to visit the Little Goose Pagoda than the Xi'an Museum is on the same grounds. The highlight for me was the model of ancient Xi'an (in the basement). The grounds and museum are free but you need to have ID to get your free admission from the ticket booth. I didn't",
          "I wish we'd had more time at this museum. It wasn't on our original itinerary (time constraints, alas) but we were in the vicinity and decided to take a half hour to run and see as much as we could! My sister chose to see the Buddha exhibit (she loved it!) while I powered",
          "If time is short, i would give this a miss. There is a little to see but not much. There is more to see in Xian. We were only here for a day and a half, and have managed to pack a lot in, but could have visited the Drum or Bell Tower instead.",
          "I had a great experience here, having come from the overcrowded Shanxii History museum. This museum was much less crowded, and allowed for a much more private and enjoyable experience. They did not have terracotta warriors (but you'll probably being going to the Terracotta",
          "It is nice place to be and to taste from the historical culture of Xian, which has lots of to offer. Don't forget not to buy warriors because they are fake - only the one in the museum - with the government approval are real and from the same material .",
          "The museum was a very interesting place to visit. The history and collection of relics and the presentation of the museum was outstanding. This was a nice place to visit full of history and learning of past chineese culture.",
          "From the crowds blocking virtually every entrance, it is clear that this attraction is working. There are good displays and the building itself well managed. Like all museums of this size you need time.",
          "It was completely unexpected. Didn't look like any other mosque I know off. It was a lovely and tranquil place with a impressive history which was provided by Jasmine, of course. I had a lovely time even with the mosquitoes pestering me in these leafy courtyards",
          "Comapared with Xi'an Museum, I like more Shaanxi History Museum. For our Xi'an tours offered by lvpad.com/cities/Xi-an/10 contains this scenic spot, we have to visit. It is not a boring museum but one we could recommend. There contains a good selection of artifacts from many",
          "English explanations of the well lighted and presented artifacts showing life of the anxients. The 360 degree film of warriors and the Terra Cotta Warriors was an ambitious undertaking that was worth a few minutes, but not quite up to the quality of the rest of the museum.",
          "It was a good place to absorb some of the history of this area. It was modern and easily navigated by ourselves without our guide. Not a boring museum but one we could recommend.",
          "Contains a good selection of artifacts from many dynasties. My favorites were the grave-protecting statues - grotesque sculptures used to protect from grave robbers. Setting is beautiful - within a quiet park with a lake and a pagoda.",
          "I spent a lovely 2 hrs here going through the museum. This was an almost emotional experience having never seen relics from 1000 bc before. The history here is overwhelming. The grounds are beautifully maintained with lakes, bridges and temple buildings. Before you enter the",
          "A must do visit for anyone interested in history, and a great oppertunity to tie together all the things one sees at the historical sights.",
          "Visited China in 2013 and this was one of the tour highlights. The Terra Cotta army discovered in 1974 it is a must see on any trip to China . The accomplishment of in the construction of the terra cotta army is a must see on any tour and an important piece of Chinese history",
          "As we had visited Shanghai museum and it was just a bit to much for us I was a bit wary of going here but it's much more interesting, perhaps it's because we had a guided tour and were shown the most interesting objects.",
          "Very nice museum. I'm happy our group visited this museum. It was a good extension of the terra cotta warriors site.",
          "I, personally, will always be amaze at the Chinese and their treasures. Plenty to see and like here.",
          "I guess there are a few extra bits and pieces in here, nice pottery and silks exhibits, but all the surrounding towns seem to have very similar museums, nothing special.",
          "Plenty of English well worth the visit, well laid out good descriptions of exhibits. Nice clean toilets and good disabled access.",
          "The museum is well organised with helpful multi-lingual explanations. What it helps one to understand is not just the context for the Terracotta Warriors but the ethnic and cultural mix that contributed to the creation of Chinese history and culture, quite remarkable",
          "It's hard to get around to everything in the museum and this no different. However it is the first museum I have come across with a kids cr\u00e8che. Lovely, clean and cool. They have some amazing artifacts.",
          "This was a visitor's dream! Hardly anyone there opposed to the Shaanxi Historical Museum. Although a bit smaller, allow a good hour and a half. Beautiful pieces in this museum. If time is limited, favour this museum over the Historical one, you will not regret it. The Small",
          "Great place to see the history of the Terra Costa warriors and how there were built. Also how over the years there were buried and unearthed by a local farmer.",
          "We went to Xi'an Museum instead of Shaanxi history museum own to recommendation of my friend who has been to Xi'an before, it was really good.",
          "Go on weekdays not weekends as it gets very busy. The history is very interesting so it better with a guide to talk you through it",
          "Very complete displays with much historical information - need a full day to see it all. Large school groups made for a crowded experience when we visited.",
          "It was soooo crowded. We had to queue of over an hour in the blazing heat to get a ticket (and we were lucky...they close the ticketing service altogether for a couple of hours at lunch) and once we walked into the museum itself, we hit a wall of sound.... so many people. BUT",
          "Here you will see Confucian Temple, Forest of stone tablets, mausoleum stone sculptures and more. At this place you may realize that the history in China is so rich and no other place in the World posses so many pieces of ancient arts.",
          "no chance to see anything as there were too many people - not maximum ticket sales per hour or booked slots.....VERY BAD!",
          "The only the genuine part is the pagoda. The rest of the surrounds were built about 3 years ago , but great job and looks very authentic.",
          "I visited only the pagoda, I wasnt interested in the museum. The pagoda is really nice, is worth it, and you will see a lot of small temples and amazing art pieces made out of Jade.",
          "It was interesting, but we were still in awe of the warriors, maybe if a person went here first it would have been more impressive, but since everything was wonderful, I would not have wanted to miss even this.",
          "When we were there, the museum was hosting a truly sensational display of Bhudda statues, relics, and artwork. Apparently it hosts a lot of select exhibitions, so find out what's on and if of interest, don't miss it",
          "The \"Small\" Goose Pagoda was just a little smaller than the Large Goose Pagoda and is no longer in daily use. The grounds were awesome, the Pagoda leans (look at it carefully), the artist shops were excellent with great prices. Be sure to swing the log and ring the \"Bell\" to",
          "The museum is phenomenalt. So much history from just thed Xian area including prehistoric finds and pottery from over 8,000 years ago. At the pagoda we had an experinece of them having a master scribe on site who translated our grandchildren's names and a special wish on rice",
          "It attracts less tourist that Shaanxi History Museum and has few nice exhibitions. Also the park next to the pagoda is calm and peaceful. Over all I liked it better than Shaanxi.",
          "Lots of historical treasures that are worth checking out at your own leisure and you realize that it's definitely worth spending time there. Seeing is believing.... Need I to say more???? Of course after the museum, you can make a quick trip to check out the pagoda.",
          "As might be expected, this is designed mainly for tourist but the presentations were beautifully done, varied and with wonderful music. Food was fair but you come for the show.",
          "An absolute surprise in Xi'an, excellent examples of Chines art through the ages, well presented. There were some unusual examples of folk art, e.g. art on donkey skins, etc.",
          "All the temples and Pagodas in China are interesting to see and walk around as they are so different to anything in the western world. We were often disappointed though by the fact these buildings were frequently not as old as they appeared and were copies of the original",
          "After a month in China this was the first museum we got into. They are very popular with the residents. I can now see why, the collections are awe inspiring and extremely well presented.",
          "Interesting sight... LOTS of people and great Chinese architecture. It is nice, but if you don't go, you don't miss much...",

          "I was told by my COT guide, Justin that the Big Goose is just bigger. There was a bell that you can ring for 10 RMB. Also, you can climb up the pagoda for a fee. It takes about 20 mins going up and down. The stairs and spaces gets a bit narrow as you get up to the highest",
          "Great place to visit to check out a real pagoda. It is so beautiful with lots of old trees and outbuildings on site.",
          "Both venues are highly recommended and should be looked i was lucky enough to have a guide who was able to provide me with detailed knowledge. Well worth going",

          "This is a great restful place to relax. The pagoda has great views but mind your head as the headroom on the stairs shortens as you climb. The museum is nice but not as elaborate as the provincial museum. Your admission is free if you show your passport a ticket office.",
          "The park around the pagoda is tranquil and worth spending time in. The pagoda is impressive and obviously ancient. We were there in the afternoon as the sun was setting and the walk around the pagoda was beautiful. The yellow leaves were a great backdrop to an old building.",
          "You have to paid 30 rmb to climb until the rooftop of the small pagoda, from there you got a nice view around, on the little park next door + the Xi\u2019an Museum. Than I visited the Xi\u2019an Museum, you got many artefacts from the past including statues, paintings, clothes, ceramics,",
          "Compare with the Big Wild Goose Pagoda, this was a place of peace. We enjoyed the park around the Small Goose Pagoda, this was really relaxing and not as crowded as the Dayan Pagoda. The Xi'An museum is a modern building with interesting architecture and spacious interior. Free",
          "A really interesting architectural structure. It looks older than it is. Easy to add to your trip to Xian and worth a flying visit.",

          "We didn't have time to visit the pagoda itself as the queues were enormous (it was Chinese National Holiday), but the park was fascinating; very busy, well laid out, plenty of places to eat (both Chinese and Western). At 2pm every afternoon the fountains 'dance' to Chinese and",
          "This is a relatively small museum which mainly houses an exhibition of jade artefacts and exquisite dresses and costumes dating right up to the twentieth century. Unlike most other sites entry is free! In the grounds is the Small Goose Pagoda.",
          "The whole garden/grounds area of the Small Goose Pagoda are quite well kept and picturesque. I especially enjoyed the rose garden which added some beautiful colour to my pictures of the pagoda. I didn't take time to go through the museum because I'm not much of a fan, but",
          "Was interesting but not as spectacular as the other sites in Xian. The large Goose Pagoda in more imposing and in a very nice area of the city.",
          "You can walk freely in the park around the pagoda. Howeverif you want to climb it, you have to pay (I forget the price). The park is nice and there are a few shops if you want to buy souvenirs. You can also ring a big bell for a few yuan. The pagoda is smaller than the big one",
          "i did not have enough time to visit the museum but went by trike taxi to the Pagoda. The golden buddah is the highlight and quite spectacular and the grounds are well laid out. The pagoda itself leans precariously . Watch for the fountain display usually every hour on the hour",
          "Not far from the City Centre, this lovely park and the new modern and cavernous aircon Xi'an museum is well worth a few hours of your time. The little goose pagoda is what it is, but it's set in some nice grounds, and has a lake with resident geese. It's a shame the city",
          "South of the city, outside the walls. Not expensive to enter the grounds and museum, peaceful, pleasant and the museum full of interesting artefacts. Although the climb to the top of the pagoda is not for the feint hearted and when you get to the top there is not a great deal of",
          "We spent a week in Xi'an \"doing\" museums, and this one was well-worth the time to visit. In the basement is a scale model of how the city looked in ancient times. We found it informative. The artifacts, such as Han period ceramics and jades, found in the city of Xi'an were",
          "The Small Goose Pagoda is worth seeing, it is very different in model and scale than other pagodas you will see in China. While you're walking in the area, take a look at the other out buildings along the way there is a huge bell (relic) that is worth viewing as well. Do not",
          "Well presented and displayed, I am sure that some would find this interesting, there are a dearth of artefacts on display from various dynasty's but all much of a muchness. Most of the museums we visited had similar if not the same types of exhibit and after a while they",
          "Set in a very pretty park, which is worth a visit in its own right, the Small Goose Pagoda is quite an interesting building with an intriguing past. You can climb the stairs to the top but the day we went was very hot so we decided against it as, despite it being called 'small'",
          "It was very interesting, with the small goose pagoda being around 700 years old it is hard to comprehend. Still, worth a look.",
          "Beautiful gardens to stroll around. The pagoda is interesting seeing as it is a survivor of several earthquakes. Good photo opportunities, so take the camera. Entry to the grounds 30 RMB. Within walking distance from the South Gate of the city walls, approx 40 min. When we",
          "Didn't go into the museum but walked around the small goose pagoda. You won't need to spend much time here but lovely to see. Fascinating to hear how an earthquake previously seriously cracked the pagoda and then 200 years ago another one closed it again. Its been standing",
          "Perhaps I got less out of this because of the very english weather we were treated to that morning! The pagoda was ok-just! I'm crtain it would have looked better in sunshine. Inevitable renovation going on on site! Museum was better and an excellent escape from rain!",
          "A great place to spend for one afternoon in Xian. If you are interested in City PLan, the exhibition for Xian city plan from Qin, Han, Sui, Tang and Ming Dynasty with different locations is worthwhile to visit",
          "You might well OD on museums in China, but each is different. The key is to visit at your own pace and try to have a guide that knows the history if possible. We did not rent the earphones available and that might have been worthwhile, but we did not want to spend time at EACH",
          "The museum has a wonderful collection - nice peaceful location in the middle fo the city. surrounded by gardens and water with the small goose pagoda - lovely location. The surrounding area had a lot of construction going taking place around the shops and gardens - once that",
          "Visited here with a tour, saw the pagoda and below it is a museum demonstrating how the Chinese use to write on silk, lovely paintings and they will write your name on a silk painting to buy or you can have your name written on rice paper for free.",

          "Climb up to the top of the Pagoda, and take in the view. The structure is in gret shape, and climb to the top is absolutely worth it. Visit the shops at bottom, and see some beautiful art. Our favorites were the crane pictures, and the chinese writings. If you are there",
          "The Small Goose Pagoda is set in a beautiful park in the southwest of the city. The Pagoda itself is beautiful, though not as impressive as the Big Wild Goose Pagoda on the other side of the city. The real highlight is the park in which it is set, a beautiful, calm haven where",
          "Xi\u2019an museum is an attraction that I highly recommended! As we know, Xi\u2019an is a historical city that many relics\u2019 attractions and museums could be visited. Sometimes the history stuffs may make people feel heavy, but Xi\u2019an museum would make you feel relaxed with history. That\u2019s",

          "The park around the pagoda is very pleasant, and it is worth climbing the pagoda. There is a good view from the top over the city, but it may be very hazy depending on the pollution. The museum is quite interesting, but there are better places to go in Xian.",
          "Well, try to go to the small goose pagoda park at 12 o clock when they have the watter show. The park sourrounding the pagoda is beautiful. At night, around 7 pm, the watter show as well has a light show wich is priceless, and all for freee, in a public open space. Well, and the",

          "The Pagoda is an interesting constrution (the stone pagoda) the other wooden buildings are rebuilt. Very \"touristy\" hard to see monks, not too many Chinese were there visiting. A vast tourist/merchandise shop with prices a little bit high. I guess a ust if in Xi'an ......",
          "The Small Goose Pagoda is a very beautiful place (with a nice park) in a modern city. The garden around the Pagoda is very well kept and with plenty of places where you can rest in the shade of the trees. Xi'an museum is a modern building, very graceful and well integrated in",
          "Here I liked the bell and those two entrances with turtle . Looking majestic.",

          "Built in the 7th century to house Buddhist scriptures and it contains statues of Buddhist figures in Chinese history and notable Tang dynasty artwork. A small rose garden with things that look like tombstones, but were actually used to mount horses. It's a very quiet place,",

          "Went on a Sunday morning. It was lovely and empty. After the throngs on the City Wall and at the Terracotta museum this was so refreshing. The grounds of the Pagoda are worth exploring, lot's of places to sit down on your own and reflect. There are some shops but they are",

        "wiki": "Emperor Xian of Han (2 April 181 \u2013 21 April 234), personal name Liu Xie (\u5289\u5354), courtesy name Bohe, was the 14th and last emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty in China. He reigned from 28 September 189 until 11 December 220.Liu Xie was a son of Liu Hong (Emperor Ling) and was a younger half-brother of his predecessor, Liu Bian (Emperor Shao). In 189, at the age of eight, he became emperor after the warlord Dong Zhuo, who had seized control of the Han central government, deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with Liu Xie. The newly enthroned Liu Xie, historically known as Emperor Xian, was in fact a puppet ruler under Dong Zhuo's control. In 190, when a coalition of regional warlords launched a punitive campaign against Dong Zhuo in the name of freeing Emperor Xian, Dong Zhuo ordered the destruction of the imperial capital, Luoyang, and forcefully relocated the imperial capital along with its residents to Chang'an. After Dong Zhuo's assassination in 192, Emperor Xian fell under the control of Li Jue and Guo Si, two former subordinates of Dong Zhuo. The various regional warlords formally acknowledged Emperor Xian's legitimacy but never took action to save him from being held hostage.\nIn 195, Emperor Xian managed to escape from Chang'an and return to the ruins of Luoyang during a feud between Li Jue and Guo Si, where he soon became stranded. A year later, the warlord Cao Cao led his forces into Luoyang, received Emperor Xian, took him under his protection, and escorted him to Xu, where the new imperial capital was established. Although Cao Cao paid nominal allegiance to Emperor Xian, he was actually the de facto head of the central government. He skillfully used Emperor Xian as a \"trump card\" to bolster his legitimacy when he attacked and eliminated rival warlords in his quest to reunify the Han Empire under the central government's rule. Cao Cao's success seemed inevitable until the winter of 208\u2013209, when he lost the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs against the southern warlords Sun Quan and Liu Bei. The battle paved the way for the subsequent emergence of the Three Kingdoms later of Wei, Shu and Wu.\nIn late 220, some months after Cao Cao's death, Cao Cao's successor, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him. He then established the state of Cao Wei with himself as the new emperor \u2013 an event marking the formal end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in China. The dethroned Emperor Xian received the noble title Duke of Shanyang (Chinese: \u5c71\u967d\u516c) from Cao Pi and spent the rest of his life in comfort and enjoyed preferential treatment. He died on 21 April 234, about 14 years after the fall of the Han dynasty.\n\n\n== Family background ==\n\nLiu Xie was born in 181 to Emperor Ling and his Consort Wang. During her pregnancy, Consort Wang, fearful of Emperor Ling's Empress He, had taken drugs that were intended to induce an abortion, but was not successful in her attempt. Soon after she gave birth to Liu Xie, the jealous Empress He poisoned her by putting poison in her food. Emperor Ling was enraged and wanted to depose her, but the eunuchs pleaded on her behalf, and she was not deposed. Liu Xie was raised personally by Emperor Ling's mother Empress Dowager Dong and known by the circumspect title \"Marquis Dong\". (This is due to superstition; Emperor Ling had lost a number of sons previously, and therefore both Liu Xie and his elder brother Liu Bian were known by such titles; Liu Bian, having been raised by Shi Zimiao (\u53f2\u5b50\u7707), was known as \"Marquis Shi\"). Liu Bian was born of the empress and was older, but Emperor Ling viewed his behaviour as being insufficiently solemn and therefore considered appointing Liu Xie as his crown prince, but hesitated and could not decide.\nWhen Emperor Ling died in 189, an influential eunuch official whom he trusted, Jian Shuo, wanted to first kill Empress He's brother, General-in-Chief He Jin, and then install Liu Xie on the throne, and therefore set up a trap at a meeting he was to have with He Jin. He Jin found out, and preemptively declared Liu Bian the new emperor. Later that year, Emperor Shao granted Liu Xie the title \"Prince of Bohai\" (\u6e24\u6d77\u738b) and later changed his title to \"Prince of Chenliu\" (\u9673\u7559\u738b).\n\n\n== Accession to the throne and collapse of the Han dynasty ==\n\n\n=== Rise of Dong Zhuo ===\nAfter Liu Bian became emperor, He Jin became the most powerful official in the imperial court, and he and his advisor Yuan Shao quickly entered into a conspiracy to exterminate the eunuchs. They were, however, rebuffed by Empress Dowager He, and they hatched the plan to secretly order a number of warlords to advance on the capital Luoyang to force Empress Dowager He to agree to their demands. One of these warlords was Dong Zhuo, who saw this as an opportunity to control the central government.\nHe Jin's plan was discovered by the eunuchs, who laid a trap for him and killed him. Yuan Shao then led his forces into the palace and killed the majority of the eunuchs. The remaining eunuchs initially took the young emperor and Liu Xie hostage, but were eventually forced to commit suicide when the battle turned against them. When Dong Zhuo then arrived on scene, he, impressed with his own power and unimpressed with the nervous Emperor Shao, forced the young emperor to yield the throne to Liu Xie (partly because he was raised by Empress Dowager Dong who, while not related to Dong Zhuo, was therefore respected by Dong Zhuo), who then ascended the throne as Emperor Xian. Dong Zhuo then murdered Empress Dowager He and the former Emperor Shao, and became firmly in control of the political scene.\n\n\n=== Forced relocation west and the death of Dong Zhuo ===\n\nIn the spring of 190, a number of local officials, loosely forming a coalition led by Yuan Shao, quickly rose up against Dong Zhuo. Even though they still feared Dong Zhuo's military power and did not directly advance on Luoyang, Dong Zhuo was also fearful of their collective strength, and therefore determined to move the capital west to the old Han capital Chang'an, closer to his power base in Liang Province (\u6dbc\u5dde; covering present-day Gansu). On 9 April 190, he forced Emperor Xian to relocate to Chang'an and set fire to Luoyang, leaving it largely in ruins.\nAfter the revolting coalition collapsed, a number of officials, led by Wang Yun and L\u00fc Bu, assassinated Dong on 22 May 192. For a while, it appeared that the Han regime might return to normal, as Wang Yun quickly established relatively friendly relations with the local officials resisting Dong but by this time acting more as local warlords. However, due to Wang Yun's failure to pacify Dong Zhuo's former subordinates, they rose in revolt and killed Wang.\n\n\n=== Return to Luoyang's ruins ===\n\nDong Zhuo's former subordinates, led by Li Jue and Guo Si, took Emperor Xian and the imperial court under their control. However, Li Jue and Guo Si did not have serious ambitions, and their incompetence in governance furthered the breakdown of the Han Empire into warlord regimes. In 195, Li Jue and Guo Si had a major fallout, and Li took Emperor Xian hostage while Guo took the officials hostage as they battled. Later in the year, after peace talks between Li Jue and Guo Si, they agreed to allow Emperor Xian to return to Luoyang, but as soon as Emperor Xian departed Chang'an, they regretted their decision and chased him with their troops. While they were never able to capture him, Emperor Xian's court was rendered poor and unable to fend for itself, and once it returned to Luoyang, it lacked even the basic essentials of life. Many officials starved to death. At this time, Yuan Shao's strategist Ju Shou suggested that he welcome Emperor Xian to his base in Ji Province so that he could effectively be in control of the central government, but the other strategists Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong opposed \u2014 under the faulty logic that if he did, he would have to yield to Emperor Xian on key decisions. Yuan Shao listened to Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong and never again considered welcoming Emperor Xian.\n\n\n=== Tight control by Cao Cao ===\nWhat Yuan Shao would not do, Cao Cao did. Cao Cao was at this time a relatively minor warlord, as the governor of Yan Province (covering present-day western Shandong and eastern Henan), with his headquarters at Xu (present-day Xuchang, Henan). He saw the strategic advantage in having the emperor under his control and protection, and in 196 he marched west to Luoyang and, after securing an agreement with Emperor Xian's generals Dong Cheng and Yang Feng, convincing them of his loyalty, he entered Luoyang and technically shared power with Dong and Yang, but was in fact in command.\nUnlike the situation with Dong Zhuo, though, Cao Cao knew how to assuage the other generals and nobles, and while he gave them little power, he made sure that they remained honoured, so minimal opposition against him developed at the imperial court. He then moved the capital to Xu to affirm his control over the central government, and when Yang Feng opposed him, he defeated Yang and was able to move the capital.Cao Cao then began to issue imperial edicts in Emperor Xian's name \u2014 including a harshly-worded edict condemning Yuan Shao for taking over nearby provinces \u2014 even though it still bestowed Yuan with the highly honorific post of Grand Commandant. Cao Cao and Emperor Xian maintained a superficially cordial relationship, but this did not prevent two major confrontations involving Cao and other court officials.\n\nIn early 199, as Cao Cao was facing a major military confrontation against Yuan Shao, Dong Cheng claimed to have received a secret edict issued by Emperor Xian (hidden in a belt), and he entered into a conspiracy with Liu Bei, Zhong Ji (\u79cd\u8f2f) and Wang Fu (\u738b\u670d) to assassinate Cao Cao. Late in 199, Liu Bei started a rebellion and waited for Dong Cheng to act in the capital, but in 200, Dong's conspiracy was discovered, and he, along with Zhong Ji and Wang Fu, were killed. Liu Bei was later defeated by Cao Cao and forced to flee to Yuan Shao's territory. Dong Cheng's daughter, an imperial consort, was pregnant, and Emperor Xian personally tried to intercede for her, but Cao Cao had her executed anyway.Emperor Xian's empress, Fu Shou, angry and fearful about how Consort Dong died, wrote her father, Fu Wan (\u4f0f\u5b8c), a letter accusing Cao Cao of cruelty, and implicitly asking her father to start a new conspiracy against Cao. Fu Wan was fearful of Cao Cao and never acted on the letter, in 214, her letter was discovered. Cao Cao was extremely angry and forced Emperor Xian to have Empress Fu deposed. Emperor Xian was hesitant, and Cao Cao sent his soldiers into the palace to put pressure on the emperor. Empress Fu hid inside the walls, but was finally discovered and dragged out. As she was led away, she cried out to Emperor Xian for him to save her life, but his only response was that he could not even know what would happen to him. She was killed, along with her two sons and family. Cao Cao soon forced Emperor Xian to instate his daughter Cao Jie, then an imperial consort, as the new empress.\n\n\n== Abdication and death ==\nCao Cao died on 15 March 220. His son and successor, Cao Pi, soon forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne in favour of himself, ending the Han dynasty. Cao Pi established a new state known as Cao Wei (sometimes known inaccurately as the Kingdom of Wei), and he granted Emperor Xian a noble title \u2013 Duke of Shanyang (\u5c71\u967d\u516c). The former Emperor Xian died in 234 and was buried with honours befitting an emperor, using Han ceremonies, and the then emperor of Wei, Cao Rui, was one of the mourners. As Emperor Xian's crown prince was already dead, his grandson Liu Kang (\u5289\u5eb7) inherited his dukedom, which lasted for 75 more years and two more dukes, Liu Jin (\u5289\u747e) and Liu Qiu (\u5289\u79cb), until the line was exterminated by invading Xiongnu tribes in about 309, during the Jin dynasty. This practice of an emperor conferring hereditary nobility on his predecessor, from whom he usurped the throne, was known as er wang san ke (\u4e8c\u738b\u4e09\u606a).\n\n\n== Era names ==\n189: Yonghan (\u6c38\u6c49; \u6c38\u6f22; Y\u01d2ngh\u00e0n)\n190\u2013193: Chuping (\u521d\u5e73; Ch\u016bp\u00edng)\n194\u2013195: Xingping (\u5174\u5e73; \u8208\u5e73; X\u012bngp\u00edng)\n196\u2013220: Jian'an (\u5efa\u5b89; Ji\u00e0n'\u0101n)\n220: Yankang (\u5ef6\u5eb7; Y\u00e1nk\u0101ng)\n\n\n== Family ==\nParents:\nLiu Hong, Emperor Xiaoling (\u5b5d\u9748\u7687\u5e1d \u5289\u5b8f; 156\u2013189)\nEmpress Linghuai, of the Wang clan (\u9748\u61f7\u7687\u540e \u738b\u6c0f; d. 181), personal name Rong (\u69ae)\nConsorts and Issue:\nEmpress, of the Fu clan (\u7687\u540e \u4f0f\u6c0f; d. 214), personal name Shou (\u58fd)\nLiu Feng, Prince of Nanyang (\u5357\u967d\u738b \u5289\u99ae; d. 200)\nTwo sons\nEmpress Xianmu, of the Cao clan (\u737b\u7a46\u7687\u540e \u66f9\u6c0f; 195\u2013260), personal name Jie (\u7bc0)\nPrincess Changle (\u9577\u6a02\u516c\u4e3b), personal name Man (\u66fc)\nGuiren , of the Dong clan (\u8463\u8cb4\u4eba)\nMiscarriage\nUnknown\nLiu Xi, Prince of Jiyin (\u6fdf\u9670\u738b \u5289\u7199)\nLiu Yi, Prince of Shanyang (\u5c71\u967d\u738b \u5289\u61ff)\nLiu Mao, Prince of Jibei (\u6fdf\u5317\u738b \u5289\u8c8c)\nLiu Dun, Prince of Donghai (\u6771\u6d77\u738b \u5289\u6566)\nFirst daughter\nMarried Cao Pi (187\u2013226)\nSecond daughter\nMarried Cao Pi (187\u2013226)\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese emperors family tree (early)#Han dynasty, Xin dynasty and Shu Han\nLists of people of the Three Kingdoms\n\n\n== References ==\n\nChen, Shou (3rd century).

          "I visited China last Jun 2012. and would like to recommend an outstanding Museum in Xian, named HANYANGLING. Located east of Xian airport. we were lucky to have some spare time (before departing Xian), and a very patriotic, knowledgeable guide to take us there. There is no",
          "We visited a couple of months ago and only on reviewing my photos did I think that I should have left a review. This is an excellent site and our guide urged us to make some time to visit and he was right to do so. Totally different to the life size terracotta warriors you can",
          "This tomb and museum is spectacular and much more intimate than the famous football-size fields of Bin Ma Yong, the Terra Cotta Warriors of the Emperor Qin Shi Huang. In June 2012 I visited Xian's Han Yang Ling tomb northwest of the current city of Xi-An. This underground museum",
          "This museum is near Xi'an Xianyang International Airport, while visit it before check-in is not suitable, since there is so many things to see.",
          "The Tomb of Emperor Jing Di (Han Yang Ling Museum) is even better than the TerraCotta Warriors ! You walk on glass walkways over the actual Excavation site - so you feel as if you can actually touch the clay figurines which were commissioned to be made by Emperor Jing Di. As he",
          "This was one of the most fascinating attractions I saw in a six week trip to China. Lonely Planet stated that this (along with the Terra Cotta Warriors) was one of the two top attractions in Xi'an, and I would go further: I think it might be better than the Terra Cotta",
          "I STRONGLY encourage people to make a trip to the Han Yang Ling Tombs (the tomb of Emperor Jingdi). This site hasn't hit the tourist trails yet, so it's relatively peaceful and calm compared to the famous terracotta warriors. Unfortunately it's not as easy to get to via public",
          "Go here, absolutely worth the trip and every penny. China's best museum that lets you get close to ancient artifacts and see how Chinese emperors rivaled the Egyptians in tomb building.",
          "If you like terracotta army, if you like china history, you will like this place. Based on our travel book, we went to this museum before leaving Xian (it is on the way). We pre-booked a taxi , cost Y200 - from Big Goose pagoda (out hotel) to the museum, then to the airport.",
          "This is one of those things you probably hadn't even heard of before you went (we hadn't) and are so glad you went afterwards. As a contrast to the Terracotta warriors this is excellent. Smaller versions but displayed in a better way (half excavated). They are small models as",
          "This place is great and should be seen on the way to the airport. We saw it after having seen the Terra Cotta Warriors and that made a the experience even better. While the terra cotta figures here are not life size like the Warriors, they are none the less impressive because",
          "Run, don't walk, to see this underground musuem! This tomb gets about 3-4 paragraphs in the Lonely Planet since the Terracotta Warriors are the reason most people go to Xi'an, so my sister and I almost didn't go. We saw some photos of Jingdi's tomb and decided we really",
          "Review of Han Yang Ling Museum I cannot believe that I\u2019m the first to review this attraction and I\u2019m sorry that my photos do not do it justice. On our visit to Xian to see the tomb of Qin Shi Huang and the Terracotta Warriors our excellent guide Cindy from China Highlights"

        "wiki": "Xi'an (UK:  shee-AN, US:  shee-AHN; Chinese: [\u0255\u00ed.\u00e1n] (listen)), also known as Sian, is the capital of Shaanxi Province. A sub-provincial city on the Guanzhong Plain in Northwest China, it is one of the oldest cities in China, the oldest prefecture capital and one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals, having held the position under several of the most important dynasties in Chinese history, including Western Zhou, Qin, Western Han, Sui and Tang. Xi'an is the starting point of the Silk Road and home to the Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shi Huang.Since the 1980s, as part of the economic growth of inland China especially for the central and northwest regions, the city of Xi'an has re-emerged as a cultural, industrial, and educational centre of the entire central-northwest region, with many facilities for research and development, national security and space exploration. Xi'an currently holds sub-provincial status, administering 11 districts and 2 counties. As of 2018 Xi'an has a population of 12,005,600 and the Xi'an\u2013Xianyang metropolitan area a population of 12.6 million. It is the most populous city in Northwest China, as well as the third most populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Chengdu. In 2019, it was named as one of the 7 main emerging megacities, or megalopolises, in China and designated as a metropolis that also consists of areas surrounding the city itself (citation needed). According to GaWC 2020, Xi\u2019an is ranked Beta-, an increase from Gamma last year. \n\n\n== Name ==\n\"Xi'an\" is the atonal pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of its name \u897f\u5b89, which means \"Western Peace\". (The apostrophe \u2013 known in Chinese as a \u9694\u97f3\u7b26\u865f, g\u00e9y\u012bn f\u00fah\u00e0o \u2013 should be included to distinguish its pronunciation from the single syllable xian.) The name was adopted in 1369 under the early Ming dynasty. Jesuit missionaries recorded its name as \"Si-ngan\" or \"Si-ngan-fou\" from its status as the seat of a prefecture (\u5e9c, f\u01d4). This form still appears in the Latin name of the Catholic diocese of Xi'an, archidioecesis Singanensis. The name was later romanized as \"Hsi-an\" by Wade & Giles and as \"Sianfu\" or \"Sian\" by the Qing imperial post office, both of which were common until the general adoption of pinyin.\nThe area of present-day Xi'an has been the site of several important former Chinese cities. The capital of the Western Zhou were the twin cities of Feng and Hao, known collectively as Fenghao, located on opposite banks of the Feng River at its confluence with the southern bank of the Wei in the western suburbs of present-day Xi'an. The Qin capital Xianyang was erected north of the Wei during the Warring States period and was succeeded by the Western Han capital of Chang'an (\u9577\u5b89), meaning \"Perpetual Peace\", which was located south of the Wei and covered the central area of present-day Xi'an. During the Eastern Han, Chang'an was also known as Xijing (\u897f\u4eac) or the \"Western Capital\", relative to its position to the main capital at Luoyang. Under the Sui, its name became Daxing (\u5927\u8208, \"Greatly Prosperous\") in AD 581. Under the Tang, the name reverted to Chang'an in 618. Under the Mongolian Yuan dynasty (13th & 14th centuries), it held a succession of names: Fengyuan (\u5949\u5143), Anxi (\u5b89\u897f, \"Peaceful West\"), and Jingzhao (\u4eac\u5146). The Ming name \"Xi'an\" was changed back to Xijing (\"Western Capital\", as above) between 1930 and 1943.\nXi'an currently does not have a widely accepted one-character abbreviation as many other Chinese cities do. Its license plates are simply marked with \u9655A, based on the name of its province.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nXi'an has a rich and culturally significant history. The Lantian Man was discovered in 1963 in Lantian County, 50 km (31 mi) southeast of Xi'an, and dates back to at least 500,000 years before the present time. A 6,500-year-old Neolithic village, Banpo, was discovered in 1953 on the eastern outskirts of the city proper, which contains the remains of several well organized Neolithic settlements carbon dated to 5600\u20136700 years ago. The site is now home to the Xi'an Banpo Museum, built in 1957 to preserve the archaeological collection.\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nXi'an became a cultural and political centre of China in the 11th century BC with the founding of the Zhou dynasty. The capital of Zhou was established in the twin settlements of Fengjing (\u4e30\u4eac) and Haojing, together known as Fenghao, located southwest of contemporary Xi'an. The settlement was also known as Z\u014dngzh\u014du to indicate its role as the capital of the vassal states. In 770 BC, the capital was moved to Luoyang due to political unrest.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nFollowing the Warring States period, China was unified under the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) for the first time, with the capital located at Xianyang, just northwest of modern Xi'an. The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang ordered the construction of the Terracotta Army and his mausoleum just to the east of Xi'an almost immediately after his ascension to the throne.In 202 BC, the founding emperor Liu Bang of the Han dynasty established his capital in Chang'an County; his first palace, Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae, \"Perpetual Happiness\") was built across the river from the ruin of the Qin capital. This is traditionally regarded as the founding date of Chang'an. Two years later, Liu Bang built Weiyang Palace (\u672a\u592e\u5bae, \"Never Ending Palace\") north of modern Xi'an. Weiyang Palace was the largest palace ever built on Earth, covering 4.8 square kilometres (1,200 acres), which is 6.7 times the size of the current Forbidden City and 11 times the size of the Vatican City. The original Xi'an city wall was started in 194 BC and took 4 years to finish. Upon completion, the wall measured 25.7 km (15.97 mi) in length and 12 to 16 m (39.37\u201352.49 ft) in thickness at the base, enclosing an area of 36 km2 (13.90 sq mi). In the year 190, amidst uprisings and rebellions just prior to the Three Kingdoms Period, a powerful warlord named Dong Zhuo moved the court from Luoyang to Chang'an in a bid to avoid a coalition of other powerful warlords against him.\nFollowing several hundred years of unrest, the Sui dynasty united China again in 582. The emperor of Sui ordered a new capital to be built southeast of the Han capital, called Daxing. It consisted of three sections: the Imperial City, the palace section, and the civilian section, with a total area of 84 km2 (32 sq mi) within the city walls. At the time, it was the largest city in the world. The city was renamed Chang'an by the Tang dynasty. In the mid-7th century, after returning from his pilgrimage to India, the Buddhist monk Xuanzang established a translation centre for Sanskrit scriptures.\nConstruction of the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda began in 652. This pagoda was 64 m (209.97 ft) in height, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras obtained from India by Xuanzang. In 707, construction of the Small Wild Goose Pagoda began. This pagoda measured 45 m (147.64 ft) tall at the time of completion, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras by Yijing. The massive 1556 Shaanxi earthquake eventually damaged the tower and reduced its height to 43.4 m (142.39 ft).The Nestorian Stele is a Tang Chinese stele erected in 781 that documents 150 years of early Christianity in China. It is a 279 cm tall limestone block with text in both Chinese and Syriac describing the existence of Christian communities in several cities in northern China. It reveals that the initial Nestorian Christian church had met recognition by the Tang Emperor Taizong, due to efforts of the Christian missionary Alopen in 635.Chang'an was devastated at the end of the Tang dynasty in 904. Residents were forced to move to the new capital city in Luoyang. Only a small area in the city continued to be occupied thereafter. During the Ming dynasty, a new wall was constructed in 1370 and remains intact to this day. The wall measures 11.9 km (7.4 mi) in circumference, 12 m (39.37 ft) in height, and 15 to 18 m (49.21\u201359.06 ft) in thickness at the base; a moat was also built outside the walls. The new wall and moat would protect a much smaller city of 12 km2 (4.6 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn October 1911, during the Xinhai revolution, revolutionaries attacked the Manchu fort in Xi'an city. Xinhai forces stormed the fort, killing some 20,000 Manchus, therefore successfully liquidated the entire population of Manchus in Xi'an city. The Hui Muslim community of northwestern China was divided in its support for the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. The Hui Muslims of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries and the Hui Muslims of Gansu supported the Qing.  The native Hui Muslims (Mohammedans) of Xi'an joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the Manchus. Only some wealthy Manchus who were ransomed and Manchu females survived. Wealthy Han Chinese seized Manchu girls to become their slaves and poor Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women to be their wives. Young pretty Manchu girls were also seized by Hui Muslims of Xi'an during the massacre and brought up as Muslims.A British missionary who witnessed the massacre commented that \"Old and young, men and women, children alike, were all butchered... Houses were plundered and then burnt; those who would fain have laid hidden till the storm was past, were forced to come out into the open. The revolutionaries, protected by a parapet of the wall, poured a heavy, unceasing, relentless fire into the doomed Tartar (Manchu) city, those who tried to escape thence into the Chinese city were cut down as they emerged from the gates.\"In 1936, the Xi'an Incident took place inside the city during the Chinese Civil War. The incident brought the Kuomintang (KMT) and Communist Party of China to a truce in order to concentrate on fighting against the Japanese Invasion. On May 20, 1949, the Communist-controlled People's Liberation Army captured the city of Xi'an from the Kuomintang force.Xi'an made headlines for being one of the many cities where the 2012 China anti-Japanese demonstrations occurred.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nXi'an lies on the Guanzhong Plain in the south-central part of Shaanxi province, on a flood plain created by the eight surrounding rivers and streams. The city has an average elevation of 400 metres (1,312 ft) above sea level and an annual precipitation of 553 mm (21.8 in). The urban area of Xi'an is located at 34\u00b016\u2032N 108\u00b056\u2032E. The Wei River provides potable water to the city.\nThe city borders the northern foot of the Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the south, and the banks of the Wei River to the north. Hua Shan, one of the five sacred Taoist mountains, is located 100 km (62 mi) away to the east of the city. Not far to the north is the Loess Plateau.\nAt the beginning of Han dynasty, Prime Minister Zhang Liang advised the emperor Liu Bang to choose Guanzhong as the capital of the Han dynasty: \"Guanzhong Plain, which is located behind Xiao Pass and Hangu Pass, connects Long (Gansu) and Shu (Sichuan). Lands of thousand miles rich in harvest be found here, as if this place belongs to the nation of heaven.\" (\u5173\u4e2d\u5de6\u5d24\u51fd\uff0c\u53f3\u9647\u8700\uff0c\u6c83\u91ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u6b64\u6240\u8c13\u91d1\u57ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd\u4e5f) Since then, Guanzhong is also known as the 'Nation of the Heaven'.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nXi'an has a temperate climate that is influenced by the East Asian monsoon, classified under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification as situated on the borderline between a semi-arid climate (BSk) and humid subtropical climate (Cwa). The Wei River valley is characterised by hot, humid summers, cold, dry winters, and dry springs and autumns. Most of the annual precipitation is delivered from July to late October. Snow occasionally falls in winter but rarely settles for long. Dust storms often occur during March and April as the city rapidly warms up. Summer months also experience frequent but short thunderstorms. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from around the freezing mark in January to 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 14.08 \u00b0C (57.3 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 31 percent in December to 47 percent in August, the city receives 1,536 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221220.6 \u00b0C (\u22125 \u00b0F) on January 11, 1955 to 41.8 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on June 21, 1998. A highest record of 42.9 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) was registered in another station on June 17, 2006.\n\n\n=== National Time Service Centre ===\nThe Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory was established in 1966. In 1975, according to the Geodetic Origin Report of the People's Republic of China, 'in order to avoid bias in the mensuration as much as possible, the Geodetic Origin would be in central mainland China.' Lintong (\u4e34\u6f7c), a town near Xi'an was chosen. Since 1986, Chinese Standard Time (CST) was set from NTSC. The NTSC in Lintong is 36 km (22 mi) away from Xi'an.\n\nNational Time Service Centre (NTSC), the Chinese Academy of Sciences is an institute which is mainly engaged in the service and research on time and frequency. NTSC takes charge of generating and maintaining the national standard time scale, disseminating the time and frequency signals. The autonomous standard time scales of universal time and atomic time and the dissemination techniques with LF radio and HF radio were established successively during the 1970s and 1980s, which meet all the requirements for different applications on the whole, such as the scientific researches, national economy, etc.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2007 Xi'an has a population of 4.07 million.\nCompared to the census data from 2000, the population has increased by 656,700 persons to 4.05;million. In contrast, the population in 2010 has steadily increased to 8.7 million and in 2016 the population is somewhat near 9 million for permanent residents.  The population is 51.66 percent male and 48.34 percent female. Among its districts, Yanta has the largest population, with 1.08 million inhabitants.The encompassing Xi'an-Xianyang metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 12.9 million, and locally as 13,569,700, of which 5,740,000 is urban.The majority of Xi'an residents are Han Chinese, who make up 99.1 percent of the city's total population. There are around 81,500 people belonging to ethnic minorities living in Xi'an, including 50,000 Hui people.During World War II, Xi'an became a destination for many refugees from other provinces of China, especially neighboring Henan Province. Because Xi'an was far inland, the invading Japanese army only managed a few aerial assaults on the city. As a result, Xi'an suffered minimal destruction. After 1949, the national government tried to balance the development in different regions of China, and relocated a number of factories and universities from other cities to Xi'an. Modern Xi'an Jiaotong University was relocated from its original campus in Shanghai.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Xi'an has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts and 2 counties:\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nXi'an has many areas that are easily accessible on foot. In many commercial, residential, educational zones in the city, especially in the shopping and entertainment districts around the Bell Tower, underpasses and overpasses have been built for the safety and convenience of pedestrians.\nElectric bikes are popular among students and offer easy transportation in and around the city for many residents. A bicycle-sharing network started operating in 2013 and today has 52,000 bikes, used by over 200,000 people per day. Taxi services are numerous, but many citizens of Xi'an still commute to work using the city's 270 official municipal bus routes serviced by a fleet of over 7,800 buses, with an average system-wide ridership of over 4 million people per day. The bus network is complemented by a rapidly expanding subway system that carries over 1.5 million commuters per day. There are more than 2 million registered automobiles in Xi'an; the growing number of personal automobiles also means traffic jams are a common urban issue.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nLine 2, running through the city from north (North Railway Station) to south (Weiqu Nan), was the first line opened to the public on September 16, 2011. Operations began on September 28, 2011. This line is 19.9 kilometres (12.4 miles) long with 17 stations. Line 1 opened on September 15, 2013. As a west\u2013east railway, its 19 stations connect Houweizhai and Fangzhicheng. Line 3 runs from northeast (Baoshuiqu) to southwest (Yuhuazhai) and opened on November 8, 2016. Line 4, which is basically parallel to Line 2 on its east, runs from the North Square of the North Railway Station [Beikezhan (Beiguangchang)] to south (Hangtianxincheng) and was available publicly on December 26, 2018.\nEight lines are planned to be finished around 2021. It will mainly service the urban and suburban districts of Xi'an municipality and part of nearby Xianyang City.The subway system covers some of the most famous attractions, such as Banpo Museum (Banpo Station, Line 1), Bell and Drum Tower (Line 2), Fortifications of Xi'an (Line 2), the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda (Line 3 and Line 4), the Daminggong National Heritage Park (Line 4) and Shaanxi History Museum (Line 2, 3 and 4), etc.The first metro departure time for Line 1, 2, 3 and 4 is 6:00, the last metro departure time for Line 3 and 4 is 23:00, for Line 1 is 23:30, and for Line 2 is 23:50.On December 30, 2008, a fire accident occurred that was extinguished within an hour and all workers evacuated safely. Sixty-six hours later, on January 2, another fire occurred at another station on Line 2.\n\n\n=== Taxi ===\nTaxis in Xi'an are predominantly BYD Auto made in Xi'an.\nMost, if not all, taxis in Xi'an run on compressed natural gas. For the taxis' fare, during the period of 06:00 through 23:00, \u00a59/2 kilometres (1.2 miles) for the fare fall and \u00a52.3/km later, at night \u00a510 for the fare fall and \u00a52.7/km later.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThere are 6 passenger transport railway stations in Xi'an. Xi'an railway station, located just north of Xi'an walled city, is one of the eight major national railway stations, and the main railway transportation hub of Shaanxi Province. The new Xi'an North railway station, situated a few miles to the north, is the station for the high-speed trains of the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an High-Speed Railway. With 34 platforms, it is the largest railway station in Northwest China. Construction of the station began on September 19, 2008. The station was opened on January 11, 2011. As of May 2012, Xi'an North Station is served only by the fast (G-series and D-series) trains running on the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an high-speed railway; one of them continues south to Hankou.\nThe city's other stations include Xi'an West, Xi'an East, Xi'an South, Sanmincun, and Fangzhicheng railway stations.\nXi'an Railway Station covers 597,000 square metres (6,430,000 square feet), has 5 passenger platforms, and 24 tracks. It provides 112 services to 80 000 people daily. Among the destinations served by direct trains from Xi'an are Beijing, Zhengzhou, Lanzhou, Baoji, and Mount Hua. China Railway High-speed 2 now run an express services from Xi'an to Baoji and Xi'an to Zhengzhou; with a total running time to Baoji of under 90 minutes, and 2 hours to Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an high-speed railway also serves Xi'an. Construction work began on September 25, 2005, the railway opened for service on February 6, 2010. The railway has made air service between Zhengzhou and Xi'an uncompetitive. All passenger flights between the two cities were suspended within 48 days of start of regular high-speed rail service.\n\n\n=== Expressways ===\nXi'an currently has three ring road systems, the Second Ring road and the Third Ring road which encircle the city. These ring roads are similar to freeways, except where there are traffic signals on the Second Ring road.\nAs a tourist city, Xi'an has built expressways to Lintong, Tongchuan and Baoji, with well-maintained roads to famous scenic spots in suburban counties and to the north slope of the Qin Mountains. Since its construction in September 2007, the G5 Beijing\u2013Kunming Expressway connects Hanzhong and Xi'an through the Qinling.\n\nChina National Highway 108\nChina National Highway 210\nChina National Highway 211\nChina National Highway 312\n\n\n=== Air ===\nXi'an Xianyang International Airport (airport code: XIY) is the major airport serving the city and it is the largest airport in the northwestern part of China. It is 41 kilometres (25 mi) northwest of Xi'an city centre, and 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) northeast of the centre of Xianyang. China Eastern Airlines, Hainan Airlines and China Southern Airlines are the main airlines using the airport. Terminal 3 and the second runway were opened on May 3, 2012.International Routes:\nThere are direct flights from Xi'an to many major cities in Asia, including Bangkok, Busan, Fukuoka, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Osaka, Sapporo, Singapore Seoul, and Taipei.\nFirst direct route between Xi'an and Europe was launched by Finnair on June 14, 2013.

        "wiki": "A pagoda is a tiered tower with multiple eaves common to  China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and other parts of Asia. Most pagodas were built to have a religious function, most often Buddhist but sometimes Taoist, and were often located in or near viharas. The pagoda traces its origins to the stupa of ancient India.Chinese pagodas (Chinese: \u5854; pinyin: T\u01ce) are a traditional part of Chinese architecture.  In addition to religious use, since ancient times Chinese pagodas have been praised for the spectacular views they offer, and many famous poems in Chinese history attest to the joy of scaling pagodas. The oldest and tallest were built of wood, but most that survived were built of brick or stone. Some pagodas were solid, and had no interior at all. Others were hollow and held within themselves an altar, with the larger frequently containing a smaller pagoda (pagodas were not inhabited buildings and had no \"floors\" or \"rooms\").  The pagoda's interior has a series of staircases that allow the visitor to ascend to the top of the building and to witness the view from an opening on one side at each story. Most have between three and 13 stories (almost always an odd number) and the classic gradual tiered eaves.In some countries, the term may refer to other religious structures. In Vietnam and Cambodia, due to French translation, the English term pagoda is a more generic term referring to a place of worship, although pagoda is not an accurate word to describe a Buddhist vihara.  The architectural structure of the stupa has spread across Asia, taking on many diverse forms as details specific to different regions are incorporated into the overall design. Many Philippine bell towers are highly influenced by pagodas through Chinese workers hired by the Spaniards.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nOne proposed etymology is from a South Chinese pronunciation of the term for an eight-cornered tower, Chinese: \u516b\u89d2\u5854, and reinforced by the name of a famous pagoda encountered by many early European visitors to China, the \"P\u00e1zh\u014du t\u01ce\" (Chinese: \u7436\u6d32\u5854), standing just south of Guangzhou at Whampoa Anchorage. Another proposed etymology is Persian butkada, from but, \"idol\" and kada, \"temple, dwelling.\"Another etymology, found in many English language dictionaries, is modern English pagoda from Portuguese (via Dravidian), from Sanskrit bhagavati, feminine of bhagavat, \"blessed\", from bhag, \"good fortune\".Yet another etymology of pagoda is from the Sinhala word d\u0101gaba which is derived from Sanskrit dh\u0101tugarbha or Pali dh\u0101tugabbha: \"relic womb/chamber\" or \"reliquary shrine\", i.e. a stupa, by way of Portuguese.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin of the pagoda can be traced to the stupa (3rd century BCE). The stupa, a dome shaped monument, was used as a commemorative monument associated with storing sacred relics.  In East Asia, the architecture of Chinese towers and Chinese pavilions blended into pagoda architecture, eventually also spreading to Southeast Asia. The pagoda's original purpose was to house relics and sacred writings. This purpose was popularized due to the efforts of Buddhist missionaries, pilgrims, rulers, and ordinary devotees to seek out, distribute, and extol Buddhist relics.These buildings (pagoda, stupa) became prominent as Buddhist monuments used for enshrining sacred relics.\n\n\n=== China ===\n\nEarliest base-structure type for Chinese pagodas were square-base and circular-base. By the 5th-10th centuries the Chinese began to build octagonal-base pagoda towers.  The highest Chinese pagoda from the pre-modern age is the Liaodi Pagoda of Kaiyuan Monastery, Dingxian, Hebei province, completed in the year 1055 AD under Emperor Renzong of Song and standing at a total height of 84 m (275 ft). Although it no longer stands, the tallest pre-modern pagoda in Chinese history was the 100-metre-tall wooden pagoda (330 ft) of Chang'an, built by Emperor Yang of Sui. The Liaodi Pagoda is the tallest pre-modern pagoda still standing, yet in April 2007 a new wooden pagoda at the Tianning Temple of Changzhou was opened to the public; this pagoda is now the tallest in China, standing at 154 m (505 ft).\n\n\n== Symbolism and geomancy ==\n\nChinese iconography is noticeable in Chinese pagoda as well as other East Asian pagoda architectures. Iconography of Han is noticeable in architecture of the Chinese Pagoda. The image of the Shakyamuni Buddha in the abhaya mudra is also noticeable in some Chinese pagodas. Buddhist iconography is also inside of the symbolism in the pagoda. In an article on Buddhist elements in Han art, Wu Hung suggests that in these tombs, Buddhist iconography was so well incorporated into native Chinese traditions that a unique system of symbolism had been developed.\nSome believed they would influence the success of young students taking the examinations for a civil service degree. When a pagoda of Yihuang County in Fuzhou collapsed in 1210 during the Song Dynasty, local inhabitants believed that the unfortunate event correlated with the recent failure of many exam candidates in the prefectural examinations for official degrees, the prerequisite for appointment in civil service. The pagoda was rebuilt in 1223 and had a list inscribed on it of the recently successful examination candidates, in hopes that it would reverse the trend and win the county supernatural favor.The image of Gautama Buddha in the abhaya mudr\u0101 is also noticeable in some Pagodas. Buddhist iconography can be observed throughout the pagoda symbolism. In an article on Buddhist elements in Han dynasty art, Wu Hung suggests that in these tombs, Buddhist symbolism was so well-incorporated into native Chinese traditions that a unique system of symbolism had been developed.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nPagodas attract lightning strikes because of their height. Many pagodas have a decorated finial at the top of the structure, and when made of metal, this finial, sometimes referred to as a \"demon-arrester\", can function as a lightning rod. Also Pagodas come in many different sizes, as some may be small and others may be large.Pagodas traditionally have an odd number of levels, a notable exception being the eighteenth century pagoda designed by Sir William Chambers at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London.\nThe pagodas in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia are very different from Chinese and Japanese pagodas. Pagodas in these countries are derived from Dravidian architecture.\n\n\n== Construction materials ==\n\n\n=== Wood ===\n\nFrom the Eastern Han Dynasty to the Southern and Northern Dynasties (c. 25\u2013589) pagodas were mostly built of wood, as were other ancient Chinese structures.  Wooden pagodas are resistant to earthquakes, however many have burnt down, and wood is also prone to both natural rot and insect infestation.\nExamples of wooden pagodas:\n\nWhite Horse Pagoda at White Horse Temple, Luoyang.\nFutuci Pagoda in Xuzhou, built in the Three Kingdoms period (c. 220\u2013265).\nMany of the pagodas in Stories About Buddhist Temples in Luoyang, a Northern Wei text, were wooden.The literature of subsequent eras also provides evidence of the domination of wooden pagoda construction in this period.  The famous Tang Dynasty poet, Du Mu, once wrote:\n\n480 Buddhist temples of the Southern Dynasties,\nuncountable towers and pagodas stand in the misty rain.The oldest extant fully wooden pagoda standing in China today is the Pagoda of Fugong Temple in Ying County, Shanxi Province, built in the 11th century during the Song Dynasty/Liao Dynasty (refer to Architecture section in Song Dynasty).\n\n\n=== Transition to brick and stone ===\n\nDuring the Northern Wei and Sui dynasties (386\u2013618) experiments began with the construction of brick and stone pagodas.  Even at the end of the Sui, however, wood was still the most common material.  For example, Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty (reigned 581\u2013604) once issued a decree for all counties and prefectures to build pagodas to a set of standard designs, however since they were all built of wood none have survived. Only the Songyue Pagoda has survived, a circular-based pagoda built out of stone in 523 AD.\n\n\n==== Brick ====\nThe earliest extant brick pagoda is the 40-metre-tall Songyue Pagoda in Dengfeng Country, Henan. This curved, circle-based pagoda was built in 523 during the Northern Wei Dynasty, and has survived for 15 centuries. Much like the later pagodas found during the following Tang Dynasty, this temple featured tiers of eaves encircling its frame, as well as a spire crowning the top. Its walls are 2.5 m thick, with a ground floor diameter of 10.6 m. Another early brick pagoda is the Sui Dynasty Guoqing Pagoda built in 597.\n\n\n==== Stone ====\nThe earliest large-scale stone pagoda is a Four Gates Pagoda at Licheng, Shandong, built in 611 during the Sui Dynasty. Like the Songyue Pagoda, it also features a spire at its top, and is built in the pavilion style.\n\n\n==== Brick and stone ====\nOne of the earliest brick and stone pagodas was a three-storey construction built in the (first) Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420), by Wang Jun of Xiangyang.  However, it is now destroyed.\nBrick and stone went on to dominate Tang, Song, Liao and Jin Dynasty pagoda construction. An example is the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda (652 AD), built during the early Tang Dynasty. The Porcelain Pagoda of Nanjing has been one of the most famous brick and stone pagoda in China throughout history.\nThe Zhou dynasty started making the ancient pagodas about 3,500 years ago.\n\n\n== De-emphasis over time ==\n\nPagodas, in keeping with the tradition of the White Horse Temple, were generally placed in the center of temples until the Sui and Tang dynasties.  During the Tang, the importance of the main hall was elevated and the pagoda was moved beside the hall, or out of the temple compound altogether.  In the early Tang, Daoxuan wrote a Standard Design for Buddhist Temple Construction in which the main hall replaced the pagoda as the center of the temple.\nThe design of temples was also influenced by the use of traditional Chinese residences as shrines, after they were philanthropically donated by the wealthy or the pious.  In such pre-configured spaces, building a central pagoda might not have been either desirable or possible.\nIn the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279), the Chan (Zen) sect developed a new 'seven part structure' for temples.  The seven parts\u2014the Buddha hall, dharma hall, monks' quarters, depository, gate, pure land hall and toilet facilities\u2014completely exclude pagodas, and can be seen to represent the final triumph of the traditional Chinese palace/courtyard system over the original central-pagoda tradition established 1000 years earlier by the White Horse Temple in 67. Although they were built outside of the main temple itself, large pagodas in the tradition of the past were still built. This includes the two Ming Dynasty pagodas of Famen Temple and the Chongwen Pagoda in Jingyang of Shaanxi Province.\nA prominent, later example of converting a palace to a temple is Beijing's Yonghe Temple, which was the residence of Yongzheng Emperor before he ascended the throne.  It was donated for use as a lamasery after his death in 1735.\n\n\n== Styles of eras ==\n\n\n=== Han Dynasty ===\nExamples of Han Dynasty era tower architecture predating Buddhist influence and the full-fledged Chinese pagoda can be seen in the four pictures below. Michael Loewe writes that during the Han Dynasty (202 BC \u2013 220 AD) period, multi-storied towers were erected for religious purposes, as astronomical observatories, as watchtowers, or as ornate buildings that were believed to attract the favor of spirits, deities, and immortals.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Sui and Tang ===\nPagodas built during the Sui and Tang Dynasty usually had a square base, with a few exceptions such as the Daqin Pagoda:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Dali kingdom ===\n\n\n=== Song, Liao, Jin, Yuan ===\nPagodas of the Five Dynasties, Northern and Southern Song, Liao, Jin, and Yuan Dynasties incorporated many new styles, with a greater emphasis on hexagonal and octagonal bases for pagodas:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ming and Qing ===\nPagodas in the Ming and Qing Dynasties generally inherited the styles of previous eras, although there were some minor variations:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Some notable pagodas ==\nTiered towers with multiple eaves:\n\nD\u00e2u Pagoda, B\u1eafc Ninh, Vietnam, built in 187.\nPashupatinath Temple, Kathmandu, Nepal built in the 5th century.\nTr\u1ea5n Qu\u1ed1c Pagoda, Hanoi, Vietnam, built in 545.\nSongyue Pagoda on Mount Song, Henan, China, built in 523.\nMireuksa at Iksan, Korea, built in the early 7th century.\nBunhwangsa at Gyeongju, Korea, built in 634.\nXumi Pagoda at Zhengding, Hebei, China, built in 636.\nDaqin Pagoda in China, built in 640.\nHwangnyongsa Wooden nine-story pagoda on Hwangnyongsa, Gyeongju, Korea, built in 645.\nPagoda at H\u014dry\u016b-ji, Ikaruga, Nara, Japan, built in the 7th century.\nGiant Wild Goose Pagoda, built in Xi'an, China in 704\nSmall Wild Goose Pagoda, built in Xi'an, China in 709.\nSeokgatap on Bulguksa, Gyeongju, Korea, built in 751.\nDabotap on Bulguksa, Gyeongju, Korea, built in 751.\nTiger Hill Pagoda, built in 961 outside of Suzhou, China\nLingxiao Pagoda at Zhengding, Hebei, China, built in 1045.\nIron Pagoda of Kaifeng, built in 1049, during the Song dynasty.\nLiaodi Pagoda of Dingzhou, built in 1055 during the Song dynasty\nPagoda of Fogong Temple, built in 1056 in Ying County, Shanxi, China.\nPizhi Pagoda of Lingyan Temple, Shandong, China, 11th century.\nBeisi Pagoda at Suzhou, Jiangsu, China, built in 1162.\nLiuhe Pagoda of Hangzhou, built in 1165, during the Song dynasty.\nIchij\u014d-ji, Kasai, Hy\u014dgo, Japan, built in 1171.\nThe Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, built between 1402 and 1424, a wonder of the medieval world in Nanjing, China.\nTsui Sing Lau Pagoda in Ping Shan, Hong Kong, built in 1486.\nDragon and Tiger Pagodas in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, built in 1976.\nSeven-storey Pagoda in Chinese Garden at Jurong East, Singapore, built in 1975.\nPazhou Pagoda on Whampoa (Huangpu) Island, Guangzhou (Canton), China, built in 1600.\nPagoda of the Celestial Lady, in Hu\u1ebf, Vietnam, built in 1601.\nPalsangjeon, a five-story pagoda at Beopjusa, Korea built in 1605.\nT\u014d-ji, the tallest wooden structure in Kyoto, Japan, built in 1644.\nNyatapola at Bhaktapur, Kathmandu Valley built during 1701\u20131702.\nThe Great Pagoda at Kew Gardens, London, UK, built in 1762.\nReading Pagoda of Reading, Pennsylvania, built in 1908.\nKek Lok Si's main pagoda in Penang, Malaysia, exhibits a combination of Chinese, Burmese and Thai Buddhist architecture, built in 1930.\nThe pagoda of Japan Pavilion at Epcot, Florida, built in 1982.\nPagoda of Tianning Temple, the tallest pagoda in the world since its completion in April 2007, stands at 153.7 m in height.\nNepalese Peace Pagoda in Brisbane, Australia built for the World Expo '88.\nPagoda Avalokitesvara, Indonesia, tallest pagoda in Indonesia, stands at 45 meters built in 2004.Stupas called \"pagodas\":\n\nGlobal Vipassana Pagoda, the largest unsupported domed stone structure in the world.\nMingun Pahtodawgyi, a monumental uncompleted stupa began by King Bodawpaya in 1790.

Even amidst partial cultural disintegration, it was succeeded by the 10th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

A \"1970 Plan for National Economy\" by the State Council and a report to intensify \"preparedness against war\" by the Central Military Commission were adopted. Chen Boda proposed to appoint a State President, but Mao Zedong opposed.

        "wiki": "Xi'an (UK:  shee-AN, US:  shee-AHN; Chinese: [\u0255\u00ed.\u00e1n] (listen)), also known as Sian, is the capital of Shaanxi Province. A sub-provincial city on the Guanzhong Plain in Northwest China, it is one of the oldest cities in China, the oldest prefecture capital and one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals, having held the position under several of the most important dynasties in Chinese history, including Western Zhou, Qin, Western Han, Sui and Tang. Xi'an is the starting point of the Silk Road and home to the Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shi Huang.Since the 1980s, as part of the economic growth of inland China especially for the central and northwest regions, the city of Xi'an has re-emerged as a cultural, industrial, and educational centre of the entire central-northwest region, with many facilities for research and development, national security and space exploration. Xi'an currently holds sub-provincial status, administering 11 districts and 2 counties. As of 2018 Xi'an has a population of 12,005,600 and the Xi'an\u2013Xianyang metropolitan area a population of 12.6 million. It is the most populous city in Northwest China, as well as the third most populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Chengdu. In 2019, it was named as one of the 7 main emerging megacities, or megalopolises, in China and designated as a metropolis that also consists of areas surrounding the city itself (citation needed). According to GaWC 2020, Xi\u2019an is ranked Beta-, an increase from Gamma last year. \n\n\n== Name ==\n\"Xi'an\" is the atonal pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of its name \u897f\u5b89, which means \"Western Peace\". (The apostrophe \u2013 known in Chinese as a \u9694\u97f3\u7b26\u865f, g\u00e9y\u012bn f\u00fah\u00e0o \u2013 should be included to distinguish its pronunciation from the single syllable xian.) The name was adopted in 1369 under the early Ming dynasty. Jesuit missionaries recorded its name as \"Si-ngan\" or \"Si-ngan-fou\" from its status as the seat of a prefecture (\u5e9c, f\u01d4). This form still appears in the Latin name of the Catholic diocese of Xi'an, archidioecesis Singanensis. The name was later romanized as \"Hsi-an\" by Wade & Giles and as \"Sianfu\" or \"Sian\" by the Qing imperial post office, both of which were common until the general adoption of pinyin.\nThe area of present-day Xi'an has been the site of several important former Chinese cities. The capital of the Western Zhou were the twin cities of Feng and Hao, known collectively as Fenghao, located on opposite banks of the Feng River at its confluence with the southern bank of the Wei in the western suburbs of present-day Xi'an. The Qin capital Xianyang was erected north of the Wei during the Warring States period and was succeeded by the Western Han capital of Chang'an (\u9577\u5b89), meaning \"Perpetual Peace\", which was located south of the Wei and covered the central area of present-day Xi'an. During the Eastern Han, Chang'an was also known as Xijing (\u897f\u4eac) or the \"Western Capital\", relative to its position to the main capital at Luoyang. Under the Sui, its name became Daxing (\u5927\u8208, \"Greatly Prosperous\") in AD 581. Under the Tang, the name reverted to Chang'an in 618. Under the Mongolian Yuan dynasty (13th & 14th centuries), it held a succession of names: Fengyuan (\u5949\u5143), Anxi (\u5b89\u897f, \"Peaceful West\"), and Jingzhao (\u4eac\u5146). The Ming name \"Xi'an\" was changed back to Xijing (\"Western Capital\", as above) between 1930 and 1943.\nXi'an currently does not have a widely accepted one-character abbreviation as many other Chinese cities do. Its license plates are simply marked with \u9655A, based on the name of its province.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nXi'an has a rich and culturally significant history. The Lantian Man was discovered in 1963 in Lantian County, 50 km (31 mi) southeast of Xi'an, and dates back to at least 500,000 years before the present time. A 6,500-year-old Neolithic village, Banpo, was discovered in 1953 on the eastern outskirts of the city proper, which contains the remains of several well organized Neolithic settlements carbon dated to 5600\u20136700 years ago. The site is now home to the Xi'an Banpo Museum, built in 1957 to preserve the archaeological collection.\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nXi'an became a cultural and political centre of China in the 11th century BC with the founding of the Zhou dynasty. The capital of Zhou was established in the twin settlements of Fengjing (\u4e30\u4eac) and Haojing, together known as Fenghao, located southwest of contemporary Xi'an. The settlement was also known as Z\u014dngzh\u014du to indicate its role as the capital of the vassal states. In 770 BC, the capital was moved to Luoyang due to political unrest.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nFollowing the Warring States period, China was unified under the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) for the first time, with the capital located at Xianyang, just northwest of modern Xi'an. The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang ordered the construction of the Terracotta Army and his mausoleum just to the east of Xi'an almost immediately after his ascension to the throne.In 202 BC, the founding emperor Liu Bang of the Han dynasty established his capital in Chang'an County; his first palace, Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae, \"Perpetual Happiness\") was built across the river from the ruin of the Qin capital. This is traditionally regarded as the founding date of Chang'an. Two years later, Liu Bang built Weiyang Palace (\u672a\u592e\u5bae, \"Never Ending Palace\") north of modern Xi'an. Weiyang Palace was the largest palace ever built on Earth, covering 4.8 square kilometres (1,200 acres), which is 6.7 times the size of the current Forbidden City and 11 times the size of the Vatican City. The original Xi'an city wall was started in 194 BC and took 4 years to finish. Upon completion, the wall measured 25.7 km (15.97 mi) in length and 12 to 16 m (39.37\u201352.49 ft) in thickness at the base, enclosing an area of 36 km2 (13.90 sq mi). In the year 190, amidst uprisings and rebellions just prior to the Three Kingdoms Period, a powerful warlord named Dong Zhuo moved the court from Luoyang to Chang'an in a bid to avoid a coalition of other powerful warlords against him.\nFollowing several hundred years of unrest, the Sui dynasty united China again in 582. The emperor of Sui ordered a new capital to be built southeast of the Han capital, called Daxing. It consisted of three sections: the Imperial City, the palace section, and the civilian section, with a total area of 84 km2 (32 sq mi) within the city walls. At the time, it was the largest city in the world. The city was renamed Chang'an by the Tang dynasty. In the mid-7th century, after returning from his pilgrimage to India, the Buddhist monk Xuanzang established a translation centre for Sanskrit scriptures.\nConstruction of the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda began in 652. This pagoda was 64 m (209.97 ft) in height, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras obtained from India by Xuanzang. In 707, construction of the Small Wild Goose Pagoda began. This pagoda measured 45 m (147.64 ft) tall at the time of completion, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras by Yijing. The massive 1556 Shaanxi earthquake eventually damaged the tower and reduced its height to 43.4 m (142.39 ft).The Nestorian Stele is a Tang Chinese stele erected in 781 that documents 150 years of early Christianity in China. It is a 279 cm tall limestone block with text in both Chinese and Syriac describing the existence of Christian communities in several cities in northern China. It reveals that the initial Nestorian Christian church had met recognition by the Tang Emperor Taizong, due to efforts of the Christian missionary Alopen in 635.Chang'an was devastated at the end of the Tang dynasty in 904. Residents were forced to move to the new capital city in Luoyang. Only a small area in the city continued to be occupied thereafter. During the Ming dynasty, a new wall was constructed in 1370 and remains intact to this day. The wall measures 11.9 km (7.4 mi) in circumference, 12 m (39.37 ft) in height, and 15 to 18 m (49.21\u201359.06 ft) in thickness at the base; a moat was also built outside the walls. The new wall and moat would protect a much smaller city of 12 km2 (4.6 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn October 1911, during the Xinhai revolution, revolutionaries attacked the Manchu fort in Xi'an city. Xinhai forces stormed the fort, killing some 20,000 Manchus, therefore successfully liquidated the entire population of Manchus in Xi'an city. The Hui Muslim community of northwestern China was divided in its support for the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. The Hui Muslims of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries and the Hui Muslims of Gansu supported the Qing.  The native Hui Muslims (Mohammedans) of Xi'an joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the Manchus. Only some wealthy Manchus who were ransomed and Manchu females survived. Wealthy Han Chinese seized Manchu girls to become their slaves and poor Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women to be their wives. Young pretty Manchu girls were also seized by Hui Muslims of Xi'an during the massacre and brought up as Muslims.A British missionary who witnessed the massacre commented that \"Old and young, men and women, children alike, were all butchered... Houses were plundered and then burnt; those who would fain have laid hidden till the storm was past, were forced to come out into the open. The revolutionaries, protected by a parapet of the wall, poured a heavy, unceasing, relentless fire into the doomed Tartar (Manchu) city, those who tried to escape thence into the Chinese city were cut down as they emerged from the gates.\"In 1936, the Xi'an Incident took place inside the city during the Chinese Civil War. The incident brought the Kuomintang (KMT) and Communist Party of China to a truce in order to concentrate on fighting against the Japanese Invasion. On May 20, 1949, the Communist-controlled People's Liberation Army captured the city of Xi'an from the Kuomintang force.Xi'an made headlines for being one of the many cities where the 2012 China anti-Japanese demonstrations occurred.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nXi'an lies on the Guanzhong Plain in the south-central part of Shaanxi province, on a flood plain created by the eight surrounding rivers and streams. The city has an average elevation of 400 metres (1,312 ft) above sea level and an annual precipitation of 553 mm (21.8 in). The urban area of Xi'an is located at 34\u00b016\u2032N 108\u00b056\u2032E. The Wei River provides potable water to the city.\nThe city borders the northern foot of the Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the south, and the banks of the Wei River to the north. Hua Shan, one of the five sacred Taoist mountains, is located 100 km (62 mi) away to the east of the city. Not far to the north is the Loess Plateau.\nAt the beginning of Han dynasty, Prime Minister Zhang Liang advised the emperor Liu Bang to choose Guanzhong as the capital of the Han dynasty: \"Guanzhong Plain, which is located behind Xiao Pass and Hangu Pass, connects Long (Gansu) and Shu (Sichuan). Lands of thousand miles rich in harvest be found here, as if this place belongs to the nation of heaven.\" (\u5173\u4e2d\u5de6\u5d24\u51fd\uff0c\u53f3\u9647\u8700\uff0c\u6c83\u91ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u6b64\u6240\u8c13\u91d1\u57ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd\u4e5f) Since then, Guanzhong is also known as the 'Nation of the Heaven'.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nXi'an has a temperate climate that is influenced by the East Asian monsoon, classified under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification as situated on the borderline between a semi-arid climate (BSk) and humid subtropical climate (Cwa). The Wei River valley is characterised by hot, humid summers, cold, dry winters, and dry springs and autumns. Most of the annual precipitation is delivered from July to late October. Snow occasionally falls in winter but rarely settles for long. Dust storms often occur during March and April as the city rapidly warms up. Summer months also experience frequent but short thunderstorms. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from around the freezing mark in January to 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 14.08 \u00b0C (57.3 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 31 percent in December to 47 percent in August, the city receives 1,536 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221220.6 \u00b0C (\u22125 \u00b0F) on January 11, 1955 to 41.8 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on June 21, 1998. A highest record of 42.9 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) was registered in another station on June 17, 2006.\n\n\n=== National Time Service Centre ===\nThe Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory was established in 1966. In 1975, according to the Geodetic Origin Report of the People's Republic of China, 'in order to avoid bias in the mensuration as much as possible, the Geodetic Origin would be in central mainland China.' Lintong (\u4e34\u6f7c), a town near Xi'an was chosen. Since 1986, Chinese Standard Time (CST) was set from NTSC. The NTSC in Lintong is 36 km (22 mi) away from Xi'an.\n\nNational Time Service Centre (NTSC), the Chinese Academy of Sciences is an institute which is mainly engaged in the service and research on time and frequency. NTSC takes charge of generating and maintaining the national standard time scale, disseminating the time and frequency signals. The autonomous standard time scales of universal time and atomic time and the dissemination techniques with LF radio and HF radio were established successively during the 1970s and 1980s, which meet all the requirements for different applications on the whole, such as the scientific researches, national economy, etc.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2007 Xi'an has a population of 4.07 million.\nCompared to the census data from 2000, the population has increased by 656,700 persons to 4.05;million. In contrast, the population in 2010 has steadily increased to 8.7 million and in 2016 the population is somewhat near 9 million for permanent residents.  The population is 51.66 percent male and 48.34 percent female. Among its districts, Yanta has the largest population, with 1.08 million inhabitants.The encompassing Xi'an-Xianyang metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 12.9 million, and locally as 13,569,700, of which 5,740,000 is urban.The majority of Xi'an residents are Han Chinese, who make up 99.1 percent of the city's total population. There are around 81,500 people belonging to ethnic minorities living in Xi'an, including 50,000 Hui people.During World War II, Xi'an became a destination for many refugees from other provinces of China, especially neighboring Henan Province. Because Xi'an was far inland, the invading Japanese army only managed a few aerial assaults on the city. As a result, Xi'an suffered minimal destruction. After 1949, the national government tried to balance the development in different regions of China, and relocated a number of factories and universities from other cities to Xi'an. Modern Xi'an Jiaotong University was relocated from its original campus in Shanghai.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Xi'an has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts and 2 counties:\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nXi'an has many areas that are easily accessible on foot. In many commercial, residential, educational zones in the city, especially in the shopping and entertainment districts around the Bell Tower, underpasses and overpasses have been built for the safety and convenience of pedestrians.\nElectric bikes are popular among students and offer easy transportation in and around the city for many residents. A bicycle-sharing network started operating in 2013 and today has 52,000 bikes, used by over 200,000 people per day. Taxi services are numerous, but many citizens of Xi'an still commute to work using the city's 270 official municipal bus routes serviced by a fleet of over 7,800 buses, with an average system-wide ridership of over 4 million people per day. The bus network is complemented by a rapidly expanding subway system that carries over 1.5 million commuters per day. There are more than 2 million registered automobiles in Xi'an; the growing number of personal automobiles also means traffic jams are a common urban issue.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nLine 2, running through the city from north (North Railway Station) to south (Weiqu Nan), was the first line opened to the public on September 16, 2011. Operations began on September 28, 2011. This line is 19.9 kilometres (12.4 miles) long with 17 stations. Line 1 opened on September 15, 2013. As a west\u2013east railway, its 19 stations connect Houweizhai and Fangzhicheng. Line 3 runs from northeast (Baoshuiqu) to southwest (Yuhuazhai) and opened on November 8, 2016. Line 4, which is basically parallel to Line 2 on its east, runs from the North Square of the North Railway Station [Beikezhan (Beiguangchang)] to south (Hangtianxincheng) and was available publicly on December 26, 2018.\nEight lines are planned to be finished around 2021. It will mainly service the urban and suburban districts of Xi'an municipality and part of nearby Xianyang City.The subway system covers some of the most famous attractions, such as Banpo Museum (Banpo Station, Line 1), Bell and Drum Tower (Line 2), Fortifications of Xi'an (Line 2), the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda (Line 3 and Line 4), the Daminggong National Heritage Park (Line 4) and Shaanxi History Museum (Line 2, 3 and 4), etc.The first metro departure time for Line 1, 2, 3 and 4 is 6:00, the last metro departure time for Line 3 and 4 is 23:00, for Line 1 is 23:30, and for Line 2 is 23:50.On December 30, 2008, a fire accident occurred that was extinguished within an hour and all workers evacuated safely. Sixty-six hours later, on January 2, another fire occurred at another station on Line 2.\n\n\n=== Taxi ===\nTaxis in Xi'an are predominantly BYD Auto made in Xi'an.\nMost, if not all, taxis in Xi'an run on compressed natural gas. For the taxis' fare, during the period of 06:00 through 23:00, \u00a59/2 kilometres (1.2 miles) for the fare fall and \u00a52.3/km later, at night \u00a510 for the fare fall and \u00a52.7/km later.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThere are 6 passenger transport railway stations in Xi'an. Xi'an railway station, located just north of Xi'an walled city, is one of the eight major national railway stations, and the main railway transportation hub of Shaanxi Province. The new Xi'an North railway station, situated a few miles to the north, is the station for the high-speed trains of the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an High-Speed Railway. With 34 platforms, it is the largest railway station in Northwest China. Construction of the station began on September 19, 2008. The station was opened on January 11, 2011. As of May 2012, Xi'an North Station is served only by the fast (G-series and D-series) trains running on the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an high-speed railway; one of them continues south to Hankou.\nThe city's other stations include Xi'an West, Xi'an East, Xi'an South, Sanmincun, and Fangzhicheng railway stations.\nXi'an Railway Station covers 597,000 square metres (6,430,000 square feet), has 5 passenger platforms, and 24 tracks. It provides 112 services to 80 000 people daily. Among the destinations served by direct trains from Xi'an are Beijing, Zhengzhou, Lanzhou, Baoji, and Mount Hua. China Railway High-speed 2 now run an express services from Xi'an to Baoji and Xi'an to Zhengzhou; with a total running time to Baoji of under 90 minutes, and 2 hours to Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an high-speed railway also serves Xi'an. Construction work began on September 25, 2005, the railway opened for service on February 6, 2010. The railway has made air service between Zhengzhou and Xi'an uncompetitive. All passenger flights between the two cities were suspended within 48 days of start of regular high-speed rail service.\n\n\n=== Expressways ===\nXi'an currently has three ring road systems, the Second Ring road and the Third Ring road which encircle the city. These ring roads are similar to freeways, except where there are traffic signals on the Second Ring road.\nAs a tourist city, Xi'an has built expressways to Lintong, Tongchuan and Baoji, with well-maintained roads to famous scenic spots in suburban counties and to the north slope of the Qin Mountains. Since its construction in September 2007, the G5 Beijing\u2013Kunming Expressway connects Hanzhong and Xi'an through the Qinling.\n\nChina National Highway 108\nChina National Highway 210\nChina National Highway 211\nChina National Highway 312\n\n\n=== Air ===\nXi'an Xianyang International Airport (airport code: XIY) is the major airport serving the city and it is the largest airport in the northwestern part of China. It is 41 kilometres (25 mi) northwest of Xi'an city centre, and 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) northeast of the centre of Xianyang. China Eastern Airlines, Hainan Airlines and China Southern Airlines are the main airlines using the airport. Terminal 3 and the second runway were opened on May 3, 2012.International Routes:\nThere are direct flights from Xi'an to many major cities in Asia, including Bangkok, Busan, Fukuoka, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Osaka, Sapporo, Singapore Seoul, and Taipei.\nFirst direct route between Xi'an and Europe was launched by Finnair on June 14, 2013. There are 3 three frequencies per week via Helsinki hub to many major cities in Europe during the summer season.\nUnited Airlines begun non-stop service to San Francisco since May 2016.\nGermany's Fraport, the operator of Frankfurt Airport, has paid 490  million yuan to obtain a 24.5  percent stake in the Xianyang International Airport, offering opportunities to upgrade and expand the facility.\n\nOn June 6, 1994, China Northwest Airlines flight 2303 broke up in mid-air and crashed near Xi'an, en route to Guangzhou from Xian. A maintenance error was responsible. All 160 people on board died. As of 2016, it remains the deadliest airplane crash ever to occur in mainland China.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Xi'an descends from one of the world's earliest civilizations. The Guanzhong Ren (simplified Chinese: \u5173\u4e2d\u4eba; traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u4e2d\u4eba; pinyin: Gu\u0101nzh\u014dng r\u00e9n) culture is considered the cultural antecedent of Xi'anese; their features are satirized as the \"Ten Strangenesses of Guanzhong Ren\" (simplified Chinese: \u5173\u4e2d\u5341\u5927\u602a; traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u4e2d\u5341\u5927\u602a; pinyin: Gu\u0101nzh\u014dng sh\u00ed d\u00e0 gu\u00e0i). Xi'an is also known for the \"Eight Great Sights of Chang'an\" (simplified Chinese: \u957f\u5b89\u516b\u666f; traditional Chinese: \u9577\u5b89\u516b\u666f; pinyin: Ch\u00e1ng'\u0101n b\u0101j\u01d0ng), a collection of scenic areas in the region. Xi'an guyue is named for Xi'an.\n\n\n=== Arts district ===\nMuch like Beijing 1798 and Shanghai 1933, Xi'an has an art district called Textile Town (Chinese: \u7eba\u7ec7\u57ce; pinyin: F\u01cengzh\u012b ch\u00e9ng). The district derives its name from the many textile factories built there since the 1950s. Today it is no longer a centre for the textile industry but a new art factory with 4 workshops in total.\n\n\n=== Resident artists ===\nXi'an is home to contemporary Chinese stars such as Xu Wei, Zhang Chu and Zheng Jun.\n\n\n=== Xi'an cuisine ===\n\nYangrou paomo (flat bread soaked in lamb soup; simplified Chinese: \u7f8a\u8089\u6ce1\u998d; traditional Chinese: \u7f8a\u8089\u6ce1\u9943; pinyin: Y\u00e1ngr\u00f2u p\u00e0om\u00f3) is a well known Xi'anese dish.\nLiang pi (cold rice noodles; simplified Chinese: \u51c9\u76ae; traditional Chinese: \u6dbc\u76ae; pinyin: li\u00e1ngp\u00ed ) are wheat or rice noodles served cold with vinegar and chili oil. \nBiangbiang mian, also known as youpo chemian (simplified Chinese: \u6cb9\u6cfc\u626f\u9762; traditional Chinese: \u6cb9\u6f51\u626f\u9eb5; pinyin: Y\u00f3up\u014d ch\u011bmi\u00e0n), are thick and long hand-pulled noodles, often served with red hot pepper.\nRoujiamo (meat buns; simplified Chinese: \u8089\u593e\u998d; traditional Chinese: \u8089\u593e\u9943; pinyin: R\u00f2uji\u0101m\u00f3) is a type of steamed bun, filled with meat (usually pork, but other types of meat may also be found).

          "The Bell Tower Square marks the geographical center of the ancient capital. This is quite very interesting and at night is really an incredible and picturesque sight with lots of bright light outlining the city walls. The Bell Tower and Drum Tower are in the historical center of",
          "The Bell Tower is magnificent piece of historic architecture that is much more impressive a night when it is beautifully lite and can be seen from blocks away.",
          "The city at night is really an amazing and beautiful sight with lots of bright light outlining the city walls. Food is really good, good hotel and inexpensive.",
          "Try and view this at night time. During the day it is rather pale and gray and nothing to rave about at all - and then at night time, it comes to life! In fact this whole area is great at night time!",
          "Bell Tower and Drum Tower are really in the historical centre of the City, not far from Muslim streets and the great Xi_An Mosque. Best time to visit us after dusk when the Bell Tower is illuminated.",
          "This looked really lovely when lit up at night though we didn't have time for a closer look as on the bus!",
          "I think most people go here to climb to the second level and take pictures. Honestly they are not that great. The pics you want are OF the Bell Tower not FROM the Bell Tower. Just my thought.",
          "Need to pay 25 yuan to go up. Didn't do that. Its well lit and the area around is all food and shopping",
          "Beautiful lights when darker. Free to walk around. Good history associated with it and close shops/bars so not to much of a walk.",
          "Nice for pics and an evening walk. Muslim quarter in near by. Cool underground walking tunnels to get around city center.",
          "Similar is shape to Drum Tower, this Tower is accessed through the underground network. The day we visited was during the Mid Autumn Festival and the security was high with many police with riot shields and helmets. The towers is well maintained, and has some artefacts on",
          "Very pretty sight in the center of the old city. To get here, metro line 2, exit zhonglou. Views are best at night.",
          "This is the largest Bell Tower in China, located the heart of Xi'an City around with a large roundabout. The entrance located underground near subway station. Open during morning time until 5pm. Lighting at night also beautiful, it's worth to visit.",
          "Nice enough building near the entrance to the Muslim Quarter scooping street. Looks nice when lit up. Not an awful lot to see if you go in /up",
          "Located right in the middle of Xi'an CBD in the middle of a roundabout. Not as grand as the Forbidden Palace in Beijing, and repairs still being carried out, but still an excellent example of Chinese architecture (existed in the Sui and Tang eras but rebuilt and repaired since",
          "Worth visiting, good photo opportunity, good views. Reasonably priced to get in. Walking distance to the drum tower too.",
          "We visited this iconic place in the evening when it was all lit up...so beautiful. It is a great people-watching place as all ages come to walk around the square, sit, relax and just \"hang out\". It was a lovely early summer evening and very unforgettable.",
          "Beautiful by night with all the lights on. It is at the intersection of many busy streets so quite difficult actually to take photos of.",
          "My family visited there on June 23 evening. It\u2019s great place to visit in Xi\u2019an. There were 2 different towers such as bell tower and drums tower. Ancient city wall and evening street food market Muslim quarter nearby.",
          "You can get to the Drum and Bell Tower through an underground tunnel system where there are vendors and security checkpoints. You need someone to explain to you what the artifacts are because there is no English written on the exhibits.",
          "This place is in the centre of Xian and from the top :you can see the traffic below and it is like an ancient clock tower :it is a beautiful place to visit.",
          "Xi'an keeps some of its best attractions within the city's walls. The large structure is quite lovely at night.",
          "There was a little confusion, but their is both a Bell Tower and a Drum tower. Both cost money to see and you can pay to see both as a ticket, for 55 yuan each, if I remember right. They are small so not a lot of stuff to see, but they do offer great views of the city. They",
          "The area is all lit up at night and looks amazing. Worth the visit for the history of the bell but does get very busy",
          "Very beautiful. You see this as part of the tour of the city wall. Nice to visit on your way to see the main attraction out of town\u2014-the Warriors!",
          "Really nice example of Chinese medieval architecture, and I recommend visiting it by night since it is beautifully illuminated by numerous lights and it looks much better than on the daylight",
          "You can climb up the tower to see the surrounding square but just the entrance area to the Muslim quarter. Amazing to imagine that the same traders coming in or out of here with their caravans headed for the the west saw this too.",
          "The sight of the Bell Tower dominates the downtown area. We never went inside, but drove past it many times during our stay. It is especially impressive when lit up at night.",
          "beautifully light up at night not far from old city walls would have spent more time but tour i was on got in late at night and left in morning for terracotta warriors full day and onto other parts",
          "Stayed at the Bell Tower Hotel which boasts of beautiful view of the Bell Tower and in the night, with the lights, the Bell Tower is even more spectacular.",
          "You must be blind if you were not able to see this Bell Tower while in Xian, coz it is right in the centre of a busy roundabout in town center...! The night view was more beautiful to see.",
          "we did a tour of the bell tower and old city at night, its spectacular, the bell tower itself is magnificent, i can only imagine how spectacular the old town was years ago, there is lots to see within the tower itself and the history is really interesting, beautiful and",
          "The lights at night are exceptional and this is an outstanding sight. the bell tower is at the centre of the old city and is easily found.",
          "Try to visit this bell tower when the musical performance takes place. It is centrally located and has a very colourful and interesting 14th Century tower which was rebuilt in 1700.",
          "Right in the middle of a roundabout. Nice to see but not really a stop you must go to when in Xian. A lot of history and the top floor is the prettiest!",
          "I'm Photographer. We got some killer shots here at night. Along with many other people from all over the world most with tripods, we all had a great time. While the area everybody shot fro was semi congested, I was never hassled by anybody. We were there for several hours",
          "We were on a group tour and visited around nine pm on a tour bus. The tower is very well lit at night. However the crowdsaround the tower weresuch that we couldn\u2019t stop so we had to settle for a few laps to take it all in. Worth the trip and it doesn\u2019t take much put of your day",
          "We stayed in a hotel quite close to the Bell Tower and went to see this beautiful ancient tower several times during evening hours. Not the same beauty in day light.",
          "The Bell Tower serves as a landmark and symbol for the city of Xi'an, and has done so for over seven hundred years. Located today in the middle of a traffic roundabout just south of the city's atmospheric Muslim quarter, it looks imposing during the daytime and beautifully",
          "Built in 1384 the bell tower is interesting to see. The bell itself was cast in 711AD. Cost is 30yuan (about $6.50AUD) It sits in the centre of what is like a huge roundabout. You have to go underground to come up the otherside into the middle of the road way. Some good views",
          "Take the evening and head down to the Xi'an Bell Tower. Lots of shopping around the area. Take the underpass to the tower and then head off to the Drum Tower and Muslim Market. All within walking distance and all lit up and beautiful at night.",
          "Worth going to if only to see the views from the top. The bell is hung in a corner with a few explanations in Mandarin and English - we bought a combination ticket for the Drum and Bell towers. If limited on time just do the Drum",
          "After touring the muslim square, we head over to the shopping mall. At exit 5. The lighting of the bell and drum tower can be seen at around 8pm.",
          "There is actually a map that shows exactly where you are in the underground. A nice old building at the center of the city.",
          "We paid CNY50 per head for entry into both Bell Tower and Drum Tower. Both sites are located within 600m of each other. In Drum Tower, they have performances on musical instruments by local artists. In Bell Tower, they have snapshots and write ups on the history of the",
          "We arrived late at night to see the Tower and wall. The lights on the structure was amazing. Next morning we went to visit and were stuns on the amount of people visiting at 7.30 in the morning. Another great spot to visit when in Xi\u2019an.",
          "We bought a combined bell and drum tower ticket and felt the signage for those who do not read Mandarin well was poor. Which bell was used and when? Still not sure! We went up to the top and on a clear day the views of the city were great. If the air is polluted this is not the",
          "Stunning place at night, didn't get to visit, but every morning the bell was rung to signal the opening of the city gates, and every night the drum was sounded to close the gates, very impressive,",
          "the tower is literraly the center of attractio as it is located in the center of a rotonda. the place is particularly nice to behold at night",
          "We bought the tickets in the circular subway. When you see lots of people in the subway, you find the tickets point. There are not too much things can be seen in the Tower. It is an exhibition of old Chinese furnitures.",
          "looks very nice at the night and makes for excellent pictures. Can climb but have to come a bit early.",
          "Read about the history of the Bell Tower and then immerse yourself inside! That is what we wanted to do, but ended up only looking at it as repairs of some sort were happening.",
          "We enjoyed the traditional music that we enjoyed in the Bell Tower. Our guide Maya provided good information about the history design and tradition of the Bell Tower. I would recommend going.",
          "This is quite interesting but nothing spectacular. The views from outside at night are best. However it is in the center of Xian and you buy a ticket that covers the Bell tower and the drum tower so worth a visit.",
          "Basically nothing to see and the show time mentioned is not respected. You better take photo from the other side of the street",
          "What a beautiful place to see during the day but oh so stunning at night when it is all lit up. We got to see it via automobile during the day and also on a walk from the Muslim area at night.",
          "We went there twice; night and day. Nevertheless, it was more beautiful at night because of the light. There were many modern department stores around so the bell tower is the only ancient building here. Despite that fact, malls were good place to hide from the burning heat",
          "after a long climb from the under ground wall way, it was a good view but not much else well looked after monument",
          "We had a room facing the bell tower. So we were able to see it everyday at different times for 4 days. It was most beautiful at night. Not that worth the ticket price to tour inside the tower",
          "Stunning to drive by during the day or when it is lit up at night. We had a perfect view from the bus on our way home from a dance performance.",
          "An old clock tower built during Ming dynasty. It's not necessary to enter the building itself, nothing really special about it. You won't miss anything. Just observe it from afar. Enter through underground walkway leading to clock tower metro.",
          "Bell tower is very close to the drum tower. Drum tower is worth going inside. Bell tower can view from exterior",
          "We visited this in the morning prior to our train trip back to Beijing. There is so much history here and this is a must see in Xi'an.",
          "The Bell Tower is easy to find and worth visiting. At night, it is colorful and absolutely beautiful. There is shopping nearby at a high end mall and a little further away is a mall with more local flavor which includes underground and above ground levels and every price range.",
          "It's in the middle of a busy roundabout. Quite frankly I'd rather spend an hour at Hyde Park Corner.",
          "So interesting to see this beautiful bell tower hundreds of years old, in the middle of a busy roundabout full of speeding cars, scooters and buses. Must see at night all lite up!",
          "The tower looks lovely especially at night when the lights are lit up. Not necessary to buy ticket to climb up the tower as there is not much to see inside. Another must go in Xian !",
          "One more time we had the opportunity to appreciate the delicatessen of the Chinese culture. The work done when they built this place was amazing.",
          "Attracts tourists from every corner to view this beautiful tower. Don't get confused with Bell Canada, Bell Tower name was assigned to it.",
          "The Bell Tower was included as part of a walking tour, and it took less than 5 minutes to see it from the outside. The entrance was closed perhaps due to the holiday.",
          "No original bells there... could be better. Well connected to the Drum tower. A ticket can be bought with dual entry to the bell and drum towers. Suggest to go to the drum tower first as the last drum performance ends at 16.20.",
          "Absolutely stunning at night all lit up, even in the rain! Although we were too late to go inside it looks amazing from the outside. Well worth the visit with the Drum Tower close by too.",
          "After seeing the Beijing Drum and Bell towers I was pleasantly surprised by the Xi'an Bell tower. It is much better looking and involves less of a climb. It is also centrally located in the middle of a roundabout. This gives a nice view when you're on the upper level of the",
          "A landmark worth visiting. Like the Drum tower, the English translations of the history are disappointing. Very crowded when we went but nice views of the city from all four sides.",
          "It is in the center of the city. You can buy the admission, visit the interior and go up to see the traffic around. It is beautiful at night when it lights up. A landmark in Xi'an.",
          "This Bell Tower, in central Xi\u2019an, has been renovated over the past several years and is a wonderful and historic Chinese building. Worthy of your time to visit,",
          "It was a magical place, both day and night views were a dream, there are a ton of places near by and was a must in xian",
          "We walked past the bell tower all the time as our accommodation was on its path. We never went up however it looks amazing at night all lit up. This is the same for the drum tower. Breathtaking at night.",
          "From Bell Tower can take beautiful pictures of Xi'an shopping district from evening onwards.Explore all the shopping areas to find really nice clothing,gd food,i will advise all travellers to walk to all 4 directions back alley to hunt for the nice food u like,not to forget to",
          "It\u2019s really good experience the atmosphere in Xi\u2019an, eapecially during night time.. The light show is amazing, one of them is in Bell Tower (City Center). One of the place i should comeback in the future~",
          "Get a combined ticket for the Bell and Drum Towers as they are both worth looking at, especially for the elaborate paint work inside and out which you can only really see close up, and the exhibits and history inside. But you don't need much more than 30 to 40 minutes to see",
          "I stayed right across the street at the Bell Tower Hotel (highly recommend) so I saw this everyday upon leaving the hotel and coming back and I was always pleased with the view. This area is very bustling I equate it to a bit like Times Square, it is the center point of the",
          "This and the drum tower are iconic and worth visiting for the views and the history surrounding the buildings that have been important through the history of the city.",
          "worth the visit, you can walk to the pagoda from here, there are local shops all around and plenty to see.",
          "The Bell Tower is the landmark building which defines the geographical location of the old Xi\u2019an city. It is generally regarded to be the center of Xi\u2019an city, around is four streets named with four directions that extends all the way to the City Wall. The West and the South",
          "There was no line and it doesn't take all that long to see, so do not miss. Interesting history - bells for sounding particular events in the course of a year, as well as sounding alarms and the time. Well preserved. Good views",
          "This is an interesting place to visit. There is an excellent display of old Chinese furniture, art and ceramics inside. There are excellent city views and good photo opportunity. Combine with drum tower for a combination ticket and see both for a reduced cost.",
          "Not much to see during the day, just a huge grey structure. But at night with all the colored lights, its quite a sight. Great photos too. Its in the centre of the ancient capital of Xi'an.",
          "This was for us first attraction to see. Nice historical monument in the \ud83c\udf03. What is great that sightseeing tour could be extended to near by drum and bell \ud83d\udd14 tower or city wall.",
          "Was interesting but to us an anticlimax as it wasn't as good as I'd expected from the inside for the effort to get there.",
          "This place is accessible via public transport and this is the preferred option as there isn\u2019t much parking nearby. Once you climb the the 7 flights of stairs which get narrow towards the top and are not for tall people as you have to duck whilst climbing the stairs you get a",
          "You can walk on this wall and get various great views of Xi'an. Huge walkinga area and a favorite of brides and grooms getting wedding pictures taken there with a lovely backdrop.",
          "It was amazing to catch a photo right in front of the bell tower at night. We had a nice couple shot to end our night!",
          "Walk in the day to admire the numerous drums as it is just infront of moslem quarters. Do walk at night to see the beautiful building being light up. Take day and night photo for memories.",
          "This site is worth doing as part of a tour of Xian sites, including the drum tower aswell. It is an interesting building and inside there are photos of how Xian looked earlier in the 20th century. As we were last in Xian 30 years ago, and it was very different then, seeing",
          "A must see at night. The lights are beautiful can be seen from just about anywhere. The strange thing is it's actually a traffic around about.",
          "A historic tower to alert soldiers and citizens in the old days. Small cost to enter and can be combined with the drum tower. Good view from the tower. It is very pretty at night as it is lit up.",
          "Worth a vit. Enticing architecture and rich history in a scenic old world city setting. Not to miss it.",
          "Just a viewing of this structure at night in the middle of a busy traffic junction is worth the visit. A must see in a trip to Xi'an.",
          "Great place to visit to see the history of the tower itself as well as the local area. Easy to get to from most parts of the downtown area. Easy to access via subway as there is a station within 100m. Taller people need to watch their head as there are a lot of low hanging",
          "The Xian Bell Tower consists of a wall surrounding the old city and has lots of history behind it going back to the Ming dynasty. The wall has a rampart, a moat and is about 130' high. Lots of room on the rampart for people to walk/stroll, bicycle, etc. Very good views of the",

          "I enjoyed our evening walk to the Bell Tower which is just a 15 walk from the hotel we stayed. The whole place is lit up and rivals the glittter and glitziness of Las Vegas!",
          "It's lit up at night, so an evening visit really give visitors a sense of the majesty of the Bell Tower. It's located in the center of a traffic circle, so we circumnavigated the tower on the outside of the circle for some great photos.",
          "Similar to other ancient Chinese bell towers. Includes exhibit of vintage royal furniture, other artifacts. Excellent but short performance on ancient Chinese instruments given throughout day.",
          "Can see all levels and museum inside tower in about 45 minutes. We did it in 30 minutes as we had to hurry to get to somewhere else. Saw it in early evening and it\u2019s beautifully lit up. Got in on a ticket we purchased two nights earlier at Drum Tower. Be sure to get the",
          "I wish we could have spent more time here. As it was, we drove by slowly on our night bus tour of Xi\u2019an. The tower is so beautifully lit up at night, and I highly recommend that you visit (at night).",
          "The history behind the bell tower was just as interesting as looking at it. You could probably get what the guide told use from a book, but I am sure the guide gave us more than the \"textbook\" version.",
          "The tower is beautiful at night. If your in the area, exploring the Muslim quarter it\u2019s worth visiting when dark.",
          "Make sure to enter the Muslim quarter via the Bell Tower. Worth seeing it at night. If you have seen the one in Beijing - there is no special need. If you see this one - you can skip Beijing's (which required a long drive).",
          "It\u2019s. A little tricky finding the entrance to the tower which sits in the middle of a very busy intersection. You have to go down the stairs to go under the street and come up at the tower. Not a ton to see inside the tower, but great views back to the wall, and to the Drum",
          "Personally I didn\u2019t see the hype of going during the day. I spent my time in the city at the wall and going to the terracotta warriors. But walking by the tower at night was beautiful. At least try to pass it at some point during your time in the city. But I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d",
          "Bell towers in Chinese cities seem to be very similar. Different shapes but similar architecture and displays. If you haven't been in one, they are definitely worth a look and the displays are well worth catching. Visually, at night, they look amazing in Xian.",
          "The Bell is located behind structure where the picture has red flags to the right side. It is on the gate.",
          "Beautiful and impressive building, and easy to get to since it\u2019s basically in the middle of everything. Not worth paying to go inside, just enjoy outside",
          "The Bell Tower of Xi'an, built in 1384 during the early Ming dynasty, is a symbol of Xi'an and one of the grandest of its kind in China. It is located in a busy traffic circle surrounded by flowers. The amazing architecture of this structure is spectacular when it is lit up at",

          "The architecture in the Bell Tower and Drum Tower is phenomenal, given the history and era these sites were constructed. Must see.",
          "This bell was Rung to signify the morning so the gates to the city would be opened. Excellent job done of Preservation and Restoration done",
          "We enjoyed the area around trhe Tower and the architecture. It was amazing to see the many crowds and lots of tourists from other parts of China, just like when we visited the Terra Cotta soldiers...",
          "We didn\u2019t enter, seems like there is no place you can enter for free, but the building itself is beautiful. Well worth visiting at night when it is lit up.",
          "The bell tower is located in the middle of what appears to be a major round about near the city wall. After seeing many such constructions, the view from the road is good enough",
          "It's historic and has many interesting information and there is a collection of art and artifacts, photos and of course the bell",
          "Grand to view in the day time but lit at night this is a stunning sight ,my second time of seeing it and it is just as breathtaking as as last time",
          "Visit to Xian would not be complete or perfect without being there at night, the historic ambience and views are not to be missed. You can also hire a bike from there. Plenty of photo ops. Easily accessible as v close to city centre.",
          "For sure There is 2 huge buildings separated by a courtyard During the Golden week there was a special show You need to book in advance At night IT s even more beautiful I did not go inside it was closed on October first week",
          "We had just visited the Xian Museum and the Small Wild Goose Pagoda and grounds when we heard this loud drumming noise. It was coming from this huge bell outside the Drum Tower. The view from the top of the tower is amazing and well worth the effort to get there. Outside the",
          "go there to have a good view from the city, get the ticket will take u some time but you can buy a combine ticket for bell and drum tower like this u save time",
          "Not exceptional but of historic interest and good to view by day ie night in the heart of this bustling city",
          "We visited in the day time and read the interesting history of the building. There are great views of the city streets. In the evening we went again as our hotel was nearby.Looks totally different illuminatd as do the surrounding buildings and streets",
          "Historical bell and drun towers connected with renovated shopping streets and friendly square make the walking tour more entertaining.Not mention the famous local Muslim food street nearby adding more flavors to the food lovers.Views of night and day are both worthy to visit.",
          "This area within the City Wall is quite astonishing! The two towers, Bell & Drum, are not far from each other, and there are the food & market streets in between that the locals love to go through. They reminded me of the streets in New Orleans during high season. At night,",
          "Bell tower and Drum tower are the landmark of Xian City. Both of them were responsible to report time in the old days. Now they become the beautiful place to visit especially in the evening time.",
          "Really beautiful place to visit with some incredible history to it. Worth the entrance fee. We did find it hard to get over there initially but well worth it.",
          "The Xi'an Bell Tower is really beautiful let me tell you that, despite what others might say. Recommended.",
          "We didn't go up (though it was still open at about 7pm when we passed) but really worth viewing at night time when it and the Drum Tower are lit up. Adds another dimension and is done fairly tastefully. Perfect to combine with a trip to the Muslim quarter for dinner.",
          "It was built in 1384 during the early Ming Dynasty, are a symbol of the city of Xi'an and one of the grandest of its kind in China. Xi'an Bell Tower was mainly used for time reporting and publishing news in ancient times. It is one of the major sight-seeing destinations. It is",
          "Spectacular first impression as we approached our hotel. Gloriously lit with many lights right in the middle of the city",
          "A bit over rated, you climb lots of steps of a reconstructed tower, good view and night. Near the Muslim quarter",
          "We visited the Bell Tower on foot from our hotel, and were glad we had made the effort for the interesting history and the views of Xi'an from the tower. Crowded with Chinese visitors, but still worth it.",
          "This is a reconstruction. The story is charming but it seems overrated although it is very famous. Best viewed at night. Its a good signpost to nearby Muslim area.",
          "Went to the Bell tower today. It is very nice with a good view. The architecture is beautiful. The price is not bad.",
          "If you have not visited many old Chinese buildings, then it's worth the admission ticket to get inside. (Admittedly, after a while, they all look alike.) Inside is a typical Chinese museum, most of the artifacts being handwritten memos about moving the building to its current",
          "Well worth visiting - don't miss it. Take the underground walkway to get there. Very close to the Drum Tower and Muslim street.",
          "Go during the day to see the sights around the Tower by walking around the upstairs outside of the Tower and inspecting the inside of the Tower. Go again at night to see the Tower light up! It is quite a site.",
          "The Bell Tower is located above the wall that at one time protected Xi'an. There is also the Drum Tower. There is a small admission charge so it is probably a good idea to purchase the combo ticket for both towers. The best time is at night when the wall and towers are lit up.",
          "When in Xian in 1997 the wall was incomplete but the bel, tower and the drum tower were still there. How things can change in China. Good to visit for the history",
          "The Bell Tower is allocates just in front of the Bell Tower Subway station and this makes it easy to access. This is not a huge attraction. This looks magnificent at night. Remember to get the \u2018package\u2019 ticket for entry to the Bell and Drum tower if you are doing both. The",
          "The city streets are lovely at night with Bell Tower and Drum tower highlighted and streets lined with bright red lighted Chinese Knots. Worth a leisure stroll after dark.",
          "It was nice to see traditional buildings around. The bell tower is high up and can be seen clearly from a distance.",
          "Lots of stairs but you can enjoy it by early night with the lights on such a sight. Overall view is it is big,people say it doest have much to show inside but I always like to see for myself. It is not expensive not for handicapped people.",
          "Just interesting. It is a nice building to see and if you are in the athletic side you can climb the stairs. It is in an old part of Beijing quite interesting to visit too.",
          "Get a pass for Bell tower and drum tower. Get these from the underpass but sometimes there are long queues.Busy at weekends.Good views from upper floors but lots of narrow steps.No wheelchair access and limited mobility options",
          "Xian is not very big, so when visiting the Bell Tower you are also surrounded by lots of other things to explore. This attraction is best to be seen at night, I would recommend going in the evening to experience the families and lively atmosphere.",
          "Fun visit. You can learn a little about the history of the towers. At the top, you will get a good view of the city. We went just as the sun was going down. For some reason, they waived the admission cost. (Great!) We enjoyed to the tower and went down the large shopping",
          "The Xi'an Bell Tower is very much worth a short evening stroll if you are staying in one of the nearby hotels. The lighting is very striking and the people watching is quite fun.",
          "The Bell and Drum Tower combo of Xi'an are no doubts must sees. Both look very similar, and both have good views of the city and each other. The cost for both (in memory) wasn't much so it's probably worth going to them and taking a look. Inside the Bell Tower was basically a",
          "If your close by it is definitely worth checking out. We did not pay to actually go into the tower because the beauty is in the architecture and lighting on the outside. It is so beautiful at night and an excellent and iconic photo site.",
          "It\u2019s not such a beauty: inside what my be interesting is the ceiling and the big bell where you can take a good picture but this is it. If you do not have time, skip it! You won\u2019t miss a lot. On the contrary if you have time get one ticket for both towers with a discount. It\u2019s",
          "Bell Tower was one of the central landmark of the Xi'an City, entrance ticket will cost you 35 yuan but if you buy combo ticket of 50 yuan you will get to enter Xi'an Bell Tower and Xi'an Drum Tower. on top of the Bell Tower you can see the all streets and at far end you will",
          "We enjoyed taking photos of the Bell Tower from the ground at night, but the view from the tower is of traffic jams in all directions. There is an antique bell in the corner of the second floor. For us, it was not really worth the entrance fee.",
          "Pretty impressive two storied bell tower built during the Ming Dynasty. The tower was originally built during the Tang Dynasty but has been relocated from its original base. It is situated in the center of Xi'an and at the intersection of four streets that covers North,",
          "Would 100% suggest to go there at night, too - the Bell Tower is lit up and looks even better. When going up, you'll be provided with a good view in the for directions being able to see the North and South Gate of the Xi'an City Wall. Do this and skip going up the Drum Tower",
          "what an awesome looking building with so much history...beautiful views of all four gates facing it... to really Enjoy it go back at night when it's beautifully lit.. the colours are stunning... also the night life is amazing with lots of places to eat nearby.. well worth the",
          "The Bell Tower is a symbol of the city. Erected in 1380 during the early Ming Dynasty, it stands towering above the city center and offers incredible view of Xian. The drum was beat at sunset to indicate the end of the day, hence the name. On the Drum Tower's first floor, lies",
          "Good view of xian city which are very organized (xian was first city in china with city planning)...suggest to go in the mid afternoon to catch the evening scene as well...they really chase you soon after the sun sets so better take your blue hour picture quickly",
          "The lights on the building are beautiful. Come in the evening. The area will be bustling and see the Muslim Quarter too. It will not be open to visitors at night though.",
          "Better viewed a night and though our driver could not stop , he did drive round it slowly several times so that we could take photos.",
          "Just next to muslim street. Tells you about history. Gives you a view of the surrounding area. Show you how they tell the time in ancient China and why they have a drum tower and a bell tower.",
          "Taken here on the way to hotel which we were dying to get too as it was too hot & we were tired after traveling from Beijing by train. Maybe next time we could see it in the evening or another day",
          "I have been to the Bell Towers in Nanjing and Beijing. But this is the oldest one. It's still very well kept although not many bells remain on site. Yet it's still an extraordinary historic site to visit. It is located in the center of the city.",
          "This is architecture at its best. A great place to view at night time. Fantastic display of lighting to show its features at its best.",
          "Ok ok .... I know the title was way after the tower ... but hey it seemed like the thing to write ! The bell tower a standing relic to times gone by . Somewhat tall and for sure old architecture. You are able to wander in and around after entrance Check point of course . From",
          "Sitting right in the middle of a roundabout. This tower had significance in its past when it told local people of the time when people used to ring the bell now it just sits as a piece of history in the middle of a roundabout in the modern city. Beautiful flowers around this",
          "Bell tower is very interesting.. we had a tour guide Kevin who gave us free time to explore as well as lots of history about the Chinese dynasty. We had a rickshaw ride just before around the streets. It was a fab experience!",
          "You can see the Bell Tower from the Drum Tower. In old Xi'an they both had jobs. Today - try to go when the women are playing the bells - worth it!",
          "It is a bit stunning to see this huge structure in daylight but it is also very pretty when lit up at night.",
          "The Xi'an Bell Tower is an important landmark in Xi'an. It adds to the historic flavours of the city, coupled with the City Wall and Temples peppered throughout. Right in the centre of a bustling intersection, the bell tower is overlooked by modern hotels and shopping precincts.",
          "Lovely views from the bell tower Xi\u2019an and can see the 4 entrances to the city wall . Worth the trip from the Muslim quarter walk !",
          "What a magnificent sight amongst all the beautiful lights of Xian at night. I highly recommend a ride by to see the Bell Tower in all its Glory.",
          "As with the Drum Tower, this was a stop that could easily have been skipped. Outside viewing only and given it was pouring rain, we viewed from the bus.",
          "Student price cost only 17rmb and the view on top is magnificent. Entrance is through underground. The visit should be quick as there is not much to view inside the tower.",
          "We were there at daytime and night time, it is beautiful. Especially night light. There are a lot food close by.",
          "Great place to visit especially just before night time lights are turned on in surroubding city. Busy attraction. Lots of colourful structure inside. Some historical displays. Entry on via subway. Great view f Drum Tower. My entry was free for some unknown reason.",
          "nothing really spcial. we caught the drum show which was alright. walked around for 10-15 minutes and then left",
          "This bell tower was built in 1384 , early Ming Dynasty, and has a few bronze bells in it . Built of timbre and bricks and one of the biggest and nicest in china . Visiting inside possible.",
          "actual visiting and climbing the tower I wouldnt say is a must do in Xian...but looks amazing by night with all the illuminatin and so on.",
          "You must see this at night... try not to go on a weekend or holiday because it gets really crowded. This is a do not miss if you are in Xian!",
          "The Bell Tower is located int he center of the city, by the Muslim Market, where four main streets intersect. It is the largest and best preserved among the existing bell towers in China. Price to take a tour is about $5 US dollars. Inside the tower is a beautiful bell and a",
          "You can buy a combo ticket to Bell Tower and Drum Tower inside the metro station that serves it. It costs 50RMB. Lovely Tower with obviously a bell inside, you can go up the tower and see a view of Xian. It's very similar to the Drum Tower which is located 200m away.",
          "We had a great view of the Bell Tower from our hotel and the illumination at night was great. We decided not to pay the admission fee to climb the tower, but I would advise an evening visit as the view is much better.",
          "This is a beautiful building that is at the base of the Muslim Market. Stop here for pictures before going to the to the Muslim Market or food walking street.",
          "Nice area, looks great at night time with the whole thing lit up. Interesting to go inside and see the stories about the history.",
          "Easy to get to from the subwas and it is close to the entrance to the Moslem Quarters so do the Bell and the Drum Tower, then visit the Moslem Quarters. The two probably will take you less than an hour and are worth doing.",
          "The Bell Tower marks the centre of the city, with the north-south and east-west streets radiating form it. Good for a quick visit, where u can take views of the city from its highest levels. The cardinal streets are also home to various levels of shopping, from local, small",
          "The whole thing can be completed in 25 minutes and we came by taxi spend about 80 yuan to see this. Finally it was not so remarkable as the terra cotta warriors and not great memories i will have of this visit.",
          "Located in an easily accessible area of xian. We visited before opening hours which was a positive as there were no crowds. For us we took photos outside which was enough.",
          "Just beautiful with all the lights and decorations! You come to Xi\u2019an, it is a must see! So much shopping and real life in China!",
          "Fun place to visit late in the evening! It is so beautifully lit up! Don't need a guide for this, but if you need a great guide, I highly recommend Bryan Bai. His website is xianhistorytourguide.com",
          "Visited the Bell Tower in an evening when the whole area was illuminated. Very popular with tourists and locals, there are bars and restaurants akso nearby.",
          "It\u2019s not the best thing to do in Xi\u2019An but if you\u2019re in town you might as well visit. Thankfully it wasn\u2019t very crowded this visit and the weather was slightly warm but okay. You get wonderful views of the city center as in fact you are in the center of Xi\u2019an here. The visit is",
          "Great looking tower not sure it\u2019s a must do to enter the tower it\u2019s just ok for me. Definitely see it at night time looks stunning with the lights. I did see it during day and night and it\u2019s worth seeing it both ways.",
          "The bell tower was easy to access through an underground pedestrian path. The tower was open late (8 pm) which was very helpful when trying to fit a full day of sightseeing in! Easy to do Drum tower/ Bell tower and Muslim quarter in same walk.",
          "Entrance is in the underpass opposite the metro entrance/ exit. Go inside- the ceiling is beautiful with some interesting exhibits too. It is also beautifully lit up at night time. Joint ticket is worthwhile.",
          "Take the combined ticket to visit both bell n drum tower. Both are close by, near subway Stn. Nice time pass in the middle of the city.",
          "We were in the local area and walked around this site. Quite hectic with plenty of people and activity. Very interesting design and architecture. Plenty of other sites nearby to explore, so heaps to see in this area. A good place to \u201cpeople watch\u201d.",
          "Certainly the centre of town. Its the Arc de Triomphe of Xian with all roads leading to it. While historically important, internally it lacks much character other than the roofing. Best seen at night.",
          "Stayed in the bell tower hotel. OK for a few night. Did not go into the bell tower or the Drum tower but they look great when lit at night. Head down behind the drum tower in the evening the street is alive with street food and resturants it's a great place to visit and sample",
          "Only two storey high, from the bell tower, we can see the North, South, East and West entrances of the City wall. A big shopping centre is located right beside it. The bell is really not that large.",
          "In the middle of the city, the Bell tower has a great history to it. For being over 2000 years old, the old Lady has held up quite nicely. Entrance fee required. Not really much to see inside, so we opted to view from below.",
          "if we talk about city center as heart of a city than Bell Tower square is the main place in Xi'an ! from there you can actually get all public transportation(metro station is there and all around the square you can get bus to all destinations included main train station!) ,",
          "This is right in the middle of the old Xi'an city and really, should not be missed. The view of the Bell Tower lighted up at night is dazzling. I wonder how it would look from the sky. The Bell Tower can be visited in conjunction with the nearby Drum Tower with a combined",
          "This is (Xi'an Bell Tower) worth visiting at night in all it's lit up glory. There are actually 2 Bells. Unfortunately I have forgotten what was the purpose of the bells, except it did not toll for me, but certainly worth visiting all the same. You will be pleased at having",
          "During the day\u2014enjoy the tower, it\u2019s a brief stop when in the Muslim quarter. At night, go back and enjoy the city and tower lit up. It\u2019s a bit Vegas-ish or NY time square-ish. Enjoy!",
          "I would advise a long wander through the city of Xi'an to take in all of the bell and drum towers and ensuring a walk through the Muslim quarter. It will be a day spent amongst really nice architecture and most of the streets in this area are lined with modern shops and your",
          "This was a wonderful experience to visit the Bell Tower and then sit and absorb the sights and the sounds of the city. The position of the tower allows you to enjoy the old and the new together. It is beautiful by night.",
          "This was kind of boring. We rented the headset so we had some idea of what the building and grounds were about. But, frankly, it's just not really worth the time with all the other fascinating things in this city of more than 10 million people.",
          "Although it is closed at night, it\u2019s wonderfully lit at night and looks amazing. It is ok during the day, you can see all of old xian from the tower... you used to be able to ring the bell but not anymore.i would save money, go to the wall, during the day and then see the tower",
          "The Xi\u2019an Bell Tower is a central part of the old city. Located near the entrance of the Muslim district, the bell tower is a sight to behold. I would encourage you to go and see this in the evening time when all of the lights are on. Adjacent to the bell tower is the drum",
          "Beautiful sight at night. Right in the centre of town. Go on Top to admire the view of this bell tower.",
          "A very impressive building in the centre of the old walled city The building rises up like a solid wall - the bottom 8metres is pure foundations so giving the impression of 4 floors when in fact only 2 The bells would beat the rising sun and alert all peasants of the coming",
          "This is something like heart of the city. Bell tower is beautiful with light decorations. Night is very beautiful in every night.",
          "The entire area is stunning, especially at night when the exterior is lit. It is quite cheap to go inside, but to me, the best part was the outside.",
          "We visited the Bell tower, Drum tower and east gate of the wall in an afternoon. Each was viewed from the outside as we didn't see the point in paying to go up with the smog so bad that visibility was down to a few hundred metres. Didn't expect this to be in the middle of a busy",
          "I love the history of China. The great Wall, the inner walls, the drum towers, the arrow towers. A good place to meet.",
          "The coolest part about this bell tower are the ceilings inside or the view of it from outside. If you want to learn about the restoration history of this particular bell tower, then you are in luck! That's about the only thing inside this thing. If you have time to blow, then",
          "Hard to imagine that this is how they got up and went to bed by the sound of a bell or a drum..and all the cities have them how ingenious",
          "Well worth the visit, and located close to a range of shopping outlets and a market. Within walking distance of the Drum Tower.",
          "The best part of visiting this tower is the great views from above (either from the small area around the Tower after going up or from the wraparound balcony on the second floor inside the Tower) of these four main boulevards kind of \"radiating out from\" the big roundabout where",
          "Visited the bell and drum tower on my first day in Xi an. Great to see and not expensive to get in either (buy a joint ticket for the two) plenty of history and information in both buildings. After that used them as mostly reference points for taxis. They look amazing at night",

          "Part of the well preserved and rich history of Xian. A must visit and view site. Another world class example of how to preserve Architectural Master pieces for future generations. Excellent local guides who are well versed.",
          "Good place to get away from the crowds for a little while during the day. Great view of the city after a short climb up the stairs to the top. There is some history to read on the bottom floor which explains the reason behind the tower Also make sure you see it at night, its lit",
          "We hadn't planned on visiting the Bell Tower but pleased we did. It was very interesting and steeped in history. Great view from the top even with the haze of polution",
          "You can't visit Xi'an without seeing the Bell Tower. The inside exhibit has some information to read, but the real point of visiting the Bell Tower is to gain a sense of ancient times when the ringing bell was the signal to open the city games in the morning. The Bell Tower",

          "If you come to Xi\u2019an and you\u2019ve never been to the Bell Tower, then you\u2019ve never come to Xi\u2019an. Located at the center of the city, connected with 4 main streets that stretches all the way to the city wall, Bell Tower is one of the must-gos in the city. Locals love going there for",
          "An amazing construction,stellar at night . Part of the original city wall . It\u2019s scale is impressive very imposing . Certainly worth a visit .",
          "I stayed at a hostel near the Xian Train station. On the first few occasions, I lost my way after roaming around at the Muslim Quarters. I met a passer-by to seek her direction and she told me to first find the main road of Beidajie (north main street) and take the Bell Tower",
          "The bell tower is an ok visit. For us there were lots of other sights to see that were better. It is close to some good shopping.",
          "Both Bell and Drum Tower, it's best to visit around sunset time where you still get some light to see the day view and once it gets dark, you can see the lights lit up, beautiful. Inside isn't much to see, but outside is beautiful. Drum and Bell Tower are within walking distance",

          "The bell tower is better to visit at night as it is beautifully lit up and there are rows of flowers surrounding it. I wouldn\u2019t go on a tour to see this and it is quick to look at, not exactly what I was expecting.",
          "Inside the ancient walls of Xi'an stand the impressive Bell and Drum towers. They both offer great views across the old city and from a historical perspective are wonderful. I love the idea behind them from both a social and military perspective, they also are in immediate",

          "Really gorgeous by night. A beautifull tower, that can be seen from the wall or visited closer. Really well preserved.",

          "Accessed via the underpass this is a pay to enter attraction. It is an interesting building with some old photos demonstrating the pace of change in the city over the past 20 years or so. There are stairs to negotiate and this is not a suitable venue for anyone with mobility",

          "We did not think it worth it to buy a ticket, but we admired the Bell Tower from the street. It is a beautiful building, but was crowded -- more so than the Drum Tower, which I thought was more interesting.",
          "A real land mark in the city which is the centre of the roundabout from many direction so visible from a large part of the city. Have to say it looks good in the day but it comes alive in the evening when darkness falls. You can't avoid seeing it do you may as well visit it.",

          "Since this site is central to other places such as the Drum Tower and Muslim street, it is worth having a look at. However, to make a visit to the tower and do nothing else in the area is really not worthwhile.",
          "The outlying area of bell tower offers many stores for shopping. Many small vendors with some big names. I ran short on time that day to go inside the tower",
          "This is a very picturesque place for a quality photo with stunning back drop ! But like anything in China go early or you will have to wait for hundreds of people to get out of your way for that shot.",
          "This tower , like the Drum Tower was built in the 14th Century and renovated in the 1700's. It is an interesting tower without a bell but worth a look.",
          "Great spot to view at night. The tower is attractively illuminated and the surrounding night-life provides a good taste of the town.",
          "We took a combo ticket for the Bell Tower and Drum Tower...worth visiting both....superb scenes and night view is also good",
          "Right by the Muslim market. During the daytime you can climb it, and when it's lit up in the evening it's a real attraction.",
          "Its very beautiful at night when the lights are lit. To have more of this beauty its best to stay at a hotel which is near bell tower.",
          "Part of the attraction marathon in Xian. Located inside the City Wall. Well worth s visit. Tons of history along with its sister attraction the Drum Tower. Both worth seeing, especially during the evening hours. Minimum cost to see the inside filled with exhibits, statues",
          "A great place to walk around at night particularly. The lighting is perfect and the ambiance transcending. Take your camera for some great pictures. Definitely worth a visit. It's sister Tower, The Drum Tower, is also worth visiting.",
          "Beautifully restored and lit at night. You cannot miss it. Access to the Bell Tower is through an underground passageway for it stands in the middle of a roundbout. Purchase a ticket (35yuan) to get in. Exhibition galleries on the ground and first floors and take a panoramic",
          "I was rather disappointed by the two towers (apart from getting to write that, LotR fan for life). Unless you can read Chinese you will be unable to learn of anything when inside. You can get some decent pictures of it, and the surrounding area. It is difficult to get a good",
          "This attraction is a must-see in Xi'An after the Terracotta warriors. However, do no expect too much !",
          "Going to bell tower can be little complicated for the strangerrs! You cannot access the tower via crossing the road! You have to go underground! Find the underground pathways for metro. Go down the stairs then you will find a sign that says 'bell tower' You purchase the ticket",
          "Placed in the center of Xi'an, the Bell tower is one of the most ancient buildings in town. It's way better to see it at night and lots of people gather there in summer",
          "Beautiful once it's been lit up. Not much to see when you're up there. The entrance is through the metro station which was a little confusing.",
          "We all gasped 'wow!' When we saw the painted ceilings and beautiful windows. There were displays in English explaining the history of the tower. And the views of Xia from the upper levels were fantastic. We bought a combined ticket to see both the bell tower and drum tower.",
          "This is a quick stop while in Xi'an and it's close to the Muslim quarter so you can do both same day. BUT if you can, it's worth viewing it both during the day and at night.",
          "A Grand Bell Tower that has a strategic position in the city centre to keep time for the city. It is brightly litted in the night and has become a famous tourist site.",
          "Be sure to plan at least 4 days in Xian to visit the sites. This is the cradle of Chinese civilization. Admission to Bell tower and Drum tower is 50 yuan",
          "Heart of Xi'an. Can visit here and the drum tower on the way to Muslim street. Nice bell. Nice views if downtown area. Nice decoration on the walls and ceilings. Check it out",
          "This is a good item to place on your visitation list. It's centrally located and gives good views of Xian.",
          "The Bell Tower is interesting to see but right around the corner is the Muslim Street. See the Bell Tower, spend alot of time at the Muslim Street nearby. The Muslim street is like a food carnival!",
          "Xi'an Bell Tower -A picturesque spot especially at night with all the lights. Nothing much on top though.",
          "Easy to get to with the underground walkways but not really an extraordinary place to visit. Lots of history, but not very well done",
          "Neighborhood by the South Gate is remarkable, with the Bell Tower just one of the many nearby highlights",
          "Beautiful exhibition of Chinese paintings on the second floor is worth visiting the Bell Tower! It's actually not a must see but if you are close to it, don't miss it!",
          "The historical Bell Tower and the Drum Tower are walking distance apart and both are well worth a visit. They are in the centre of Xian city and easy to find. But if time is short then visit the Drum Tower as it provides a good and sufficient experience. The Towers tend to be",
          "Loved Xian. It has so much culture from the walls, Drum Tower and monuments in Xian itself. We had a night tour with George Pu who, as always, told the history of the monuments in such a way that everyone enjoyed it.",
          "Allow about an hour or so to visit, and if you can, time it so that you can see the musical presentation. The tower itself is not that big, with only a few things to view inside. Right next to the Muslim Quarter, so go hungry!",
          "You have to want to go there because you can't just walk to the bell tower you have to go through a tunnel that goes under the street. It is worth the effort and the small fee to get in. We arrived just before dusk and as we came up the stairs out of the tunnel the lights came",
          "Wow wow and wow. Get your cultural experience here. OMG it's amazing so beautiful. I didn't see this place during the day but I got to see it in all its glory at night all lit up",
          "Not very impressive during the day but loved the perfect lighting at night. Drum tower is also nearby.",
          "Terrific area to see old meets new. Beautiful parklands between drum tower and bell tower. Muslim quarter located near by.",
          "These towers are all over china, and they're all rather similar. The ceiling of the main room is beautifully painted. This one has some nice gardens around it, is conveniently located, and does not take a long time. The drum tower is right next door, so buy a ticket for both.",
          "The Bell Tower, is a stately traditional building. From this important landmark extend East, South, West and North Streets, connecting the tower to the East, South, West and North Gates of the City Wall. It was at the central location of Muslim Quarter and Shopping complex make",
          "This again was impressive and looks amazing at night lit up. I believe the bell is still in use today on special ocassions.",
          "Go see it at night lots of lights , Not sure what else to say It's bright it's cool & it's their cheers",
          "It is recommended to buy a combo ticket for Bell Tower and Drum Tower. Very interesting landmark in the middle of city. And end our journey at food street at moslem quarter (just behind the Drum Tower). Or stopby at starbuck at west street square between Bell Tower and Drum",
          "Central location for shopping, eating, and transportation. The night view of the buildings are spetacular.",
          "No visit to Xi'an is complete without visiting the Xi'an Bell Tower. The grounds are vast and so clean..a wonderful spot of photos",
          "We had a view of the lit up bell tower from the bus, thereby compelling us to go back. It is undoubtedly the most beautiful building in xian",
          "This tower is great for getting your bearings as you can see all directions of the city and get a great view. It's best to buy a combined ticket for both this and the drum tower as you'll save yourself some money buying them combined. Lots of artifacts and paintings inside -",
          "Genuinely old building when much has been destroyed in the name of progress. Lots of steps but good views of the old Muslim quarter.",
          "There is a park near these two towers where beautiful flowers and plants grow. Lots of stairs to climb but worth it for the view, espeically at night. Like many Chinese buildings this one is also beautifully illuminated at night",
          "great view over the city- easy walking and close to shops and other attractions. Must do while visiting",
          "We only looked at the Bell Tower at night when walking past from the markets at the Muslim Quarter.The colours are fantastic. Lots of people are here. Young, old, everyone. Great photo opportunities.",
          "Be sure to see this by night when the lights are on. It has been beautifully restored. It dates from the 800s.",
          "The Bell Tower is a fascinating thing to see. It is the centerpiece of a round a bout in the walled part of Xi'an. It is light up beautifully at night but to see during the day with the Drum Tower just down the street gives you an idea of what China may have looked like so long",
          "Honestly, the best pictures were from down the tower, the bell has lots of signs prohibiting something in Chinese that can not be pictured good. If you go to the city wall you\u00b4ll have the view and save the steps up and down and your money. For me it was useful only to see from",
          "Visited the site but found it a very large disappointment as what you see at the tower, you can see at the Xian City wall. Basically you pay to ascend a few stories and to sound the bell. 10 minutes will suffice. Better to go to the City Wall.",
          "We stumbled across this while out for a walk in this beautiful city at night . It sits in the middle of a busy intersection that is accessible by underground tunnels. It gives you a great view of this both modern and ancient part of town. They have done a fantastic job of",
          "This is THE landmark of the city, located in the very centre of the historical heart. As you will often pass by, take the opportunity to visit the inside which is worth it. Access by the various underpasses around the roundabout. Take the combo ticket with Drum Tower (50\u00a5). You",
          "The Bell Tower looks great and you are able to go inside of it. I didn't go in, but from the outside it looked lovely, in the center of town. Had lots of lovely flowers around it.",
          "You can buy a ticket that is combine with the Drum Tower however we were told that the Bell Tower was better and there is no inside part to tour at the Drum Tower. We went in the middle of the day and it was very hot inside and outside the tower. It was very underwhelming and",
          "There was an amazing market when we vistas which merges off from the Muslim quarter and this is an amazing site, would recommend to go at night",
          "What a great tower!!! You can not miss it if you go to Xian. The architecture is beautiful and the places around as great.",
          "It is near the Muslim Quarter and a beautiful sight at night. Definitely a lovely spot for an evening stroll. We didn't go inside, I don't have an opinion on that aspect.",
          "We saw the Bell Tower during the day as it is right in the middle of the downtown area. It looks striking but be prepared to visit it at night and be blown away by the way they have it lit up. It is surrounded by shops of all descriptions from high end fashion down to trinket",
          "The Drum tower is right next to the busy Muslim Bazar and is one of the iconic location of Xi'an. Not only can one go up the tower and see the entire area, there is lot to explore for food and shopping. One most be an expert to bargain in the nearby Muslim Bazar, else you would",
          "I missed the combined Bell/Drum tower ticket, bought 2 single tickets and lost 20RMB. Anyways both are quite similar buildings. Nice views from the building top floor. Unfortunately there is not much written in english, there are loads in chinese. One need to draw conclusions",
          "The Bell Tower is right in the heart of the old city. It\u2019s beautifully lit up at night and makes for amazing photos (take a tripod!). You can go up inside the tower but you have to be in before 8pm (there is a small fee) \u2013 We missed it by 3 minutes! Access is from the",
          "Nothing spectacular, but maybe a good photo shot when it lights up at night! Right in front of the Muslim Quarter, just drop by!",
          "Entry off the subway underpass. Buy a combined drum tower pass to save. Great place to watch the traffic merging.",
          "This is a beautiful building with views of the old city from all sides. It is a worthwhile venue to visit. There is some limited shade depending on time of day. The history is displayed and easy to read without a guide.",
          "We had an hour to wander around here, and there was a cycle race being held, with bikes doing circuits at very high speeds. Just added to the overall experience.",
          "While we could not go inside, the view from outside at night (when it is beautiful) is simply amazing!",
          "Located at the center of xian. Sorrounded by shopping malls. Can easily be accessed by metro transit. Old structures were properly renovated.",
          "Loved this just sitting on the steps opposite and looked at the detail of this impressive structure. Many food eatery around. Access is easy just use underground street crossings. Opposite near the steps at night many people come and put on light shows and mingle use this as",
          "Culturally and Historically Interesting- great photo opportunity!! We visited in the evening so saw the Bell Tower and Drum Tower and the Xi'an City walls lit up. Quite a busy area with a bit of hustle and bustle",
          "This attraction was pretty cool and didn't take long to see. I would recommend doing the Drum Tower at the same time and saving money on the admission ticket. The building itself was an impressive thing to see, but there was also a display of ancient furniture on display inside",
          "as lack of time, i only visited at night time but it was beautiful at night. it seem has different color in different floor, it looked like a cake. ha",
          "Best night views I've seen in a while! It looks amazing and you can sense a traditional Chinese vibe around. Avoid weekends, as it is very crowded!",
          "The Bell Tower marks the centre of the city. It is really nothing special because of the roads build around it. The tower, or the Drum Tower next to it, is not worth the effort alone: the Muslim street and other side streets are the main reason for a visitor to this area.",
          "If you come with a metro, take an exit C. It is not necessary to get out to the ground, look for the ticket boost in the metro. It is difficult to take photos from the ground floor without cars. The drum tower and Muslim quarter are in the walk-able distance (10 min).",
          "As many walls in China, the towers that construct with it are very significant to the history of the cities. Most are really treasured and powerful reminders of the city's historical past, and its leaders. They are beautifully maintained, and awesome sites for viewing the city",
          "By night exquisite lighting. By day it was superb. Great colours, great position. Can't miss it as right where East and West meet in Xi'an. Not sure if recently refurbished but it is truely beautiful.",
          "Drove around the Bell Tower as part of a Xian Night tour as it is located on a very busy roundabout in the centre of Xian. We did not stop to have a look as the traffic was very heavy. Architecturally impressive and looked great lit up at night.",
          "Situated in the centre of a roundabout this attraction offers both historical interest and views of the city centre. Buy a dual Bell Tower / Drum Tower ticket for best value (35 Yuan)",
          "We stayed across the road in the Bell Tower hotel and had a great view of the Bell Tower. The Bell Tower marks the geographical center of the ancient capital. It is now located on a very busy roundabout with heavy traffic constantly passing around it. From here you have entrance",
          "Expensive and not necessarily a lot if \"content\". Is nice but not worth the money. The ext view is by far more intresting specially by night.",
          "We drove around it as we toured Xi'an - very pretty and close to the Drum Tower as well. Amazing that it was built in the 12th century and it still standing. It would have been nice to stop in but traffic is a mess around there.",
          "Bell tower is in middle of old town Xian. Pictures are amazing in the evening. Its near shopping wall and colours are great to see",
          "Magical when lit up. Worth the visits. Its a bit if a traffic island in a similar way to the Colosseum in Rome but of course its in wonderful Xian with a unique Chinese flavour",
          "The Bell Tower was very interesting to see, but I did not have the chance to go inside. It appeared that you could go in and climb part of the way up to get views around the immediate area. I liked learning from my guide as to the history behind the tower and how it was used to",
          "It wasn't easy to find the underground access (the Bell Tower is located in the middle of a busy roundabout), but it was worth it. It is a wonderful view during daytime, too, but definitely amazing at night with all the lights. After having climbed the Drum Tower, we didn't go",
          "All light up and very pretty at night. Close to the Drum tower and the Muslim street markets. Worth the walk around. Contained within the city walls.",
          "Add this to your list of places to see in the city. You can walk from the hotel just by exiting to the right for a few blocks.",
          "Pretty at night and during the day interesting to view from the city wall on the bikes- easy ride and good views",
          "It's a double whammy...firstly the Drum Tower and then the Bell Tower and somewhere in between the Muslim Quarter if you wish? Big Bell in the center of a very busy roundabout. You gain access by a tunnel by the underground (subway).",
          "The bell tower was build in 1384 during the Ming dynasty . Early morning of ancient times the mission of the bell ringing was to give the correct time to the whole city. Visit both the bell and drum tower in the daylight and also at night when the lights are on. It is in the",
          "Nothing much to say here. Nice interior and exterior and the view of the city from the tower. To be honest, just take a photo outside, near the open plaza infront of it at night. Is enough.",
          "I suggest you go around Bell and Drum towers just before sunset to see them during the day and when the lights are turned on. It will give you a completely different views! Worth to visit and it is in vicinity to the Muslim Quarter too.",
          "This is another of the many big structures in Xi'an. It is interesting and the architecture is appealing, but one can \"overdose\" on similar sights.",
          "The Bell Tower at night is simply beautiful. There are people milling about at all hours (including vendors). The sights, smells and people are amazing. This is a must see for photos and to experience Xi'an - especially if you are on your way to the Muslim Market.",
          "We wandered around the bell tower area around 18.00 and we got some photos then the light was on around 18.45. The bell tower is one of the xi'an's landmarks so we decided to enter but there was nothing much inside so we didnt go in the drum tower since we thought it might be",
          "Most interesting history and grandstand the main street in Xian near the wall and Muslim Markets and shopping mall.",
          "The bell tower is right at the centre of the city & looks lovely when it is lit up at night, it is worth a visit to read about the history of the bell tower & Xian. Top tip is to buy a combined Bell Tower & Drum Tower ticket",
          "Beautifully lit at night but it closes at 8pm. Remember to ask if children get discount or are free.",
          "This city has a lot to offer from a historic point of view hence the Bell Tower tour completes this.",
          "Great to start a walk along the wall from here. We had a pleasant afternoon walking the city wall from the bell tower. A long walk but a nice one. There are shops around at the bell tower if you prefer to do shopping but the idea for us was to get great views of the city.",
          "This tower is lit up at night and is a great photo opportunity. It forms a traffic-circle (a roundabout) so you have to get there via a pedestrian subway.",
          "Easily accesible, the drum tower is well worth the visit. Our hotel was only 500 metres away so an easy walk to this ancient attraction. Try and time it for sunrise/sunset for the bells/drums.",
          "You haven't truly visited Xi'an in enough depth if you haven't visited the Bell Tower! It's right at the heart of the city, easily accessible via the underground walkway and metro/subway, and it's got some fantastic bells there. The music however really gives you an experience",
          "Bell Tower is where you start your journey in and around the heart of Xi'an. You can access the underground walkway which also has the Metro Line and go from there to the many interesting places. Bell Tower is beautiful during the day and captivating at night",
          "A really interesting place to pass by, not sure I would go especially to see it though. Its really big and you can see it from far off.",
          "Unless you're in your 30s or 40s there are outrageously steep stairs to get to the drum tower. Each step is appoximately 1 1/2 feet high and went straight up (no elevator). It wasn't worth the climb",
          "We had a really nice night walk and had the chance to admire all these buildings at night that are beautify illuminated. The Bell tower was my favorite, took incredible pictures. When in Xi'an, try to do this at night.",
          "I didn't go inside, so I can't comment on the inside. But my hotel was around the corner of the Muslim quarter so the last 4 days I have seen both the bell tower as the drum tower a lot. At night both our beautifully lit out and the make a nice picture. The bell tower is not",
          "Due to we buy the yearly travel card, first time go in visit the bell tower is free of charge just need to show the card. They will exchange the ticket with you. Overall is just see the history and the direction of XIAN.",
          "A beautiful historical sight, much improved by illumination at night. You can go inside where there is a history of shadow puppets upstairs and history of Bell Tower below.",
          "Another historic building. The large bell could awaken the citizens and serve as the timekeeper for th city.",
          "Part of the wall at the South Gate, the tower looks brilliant at night lit up. Not enough detail on the signs, but given it's part of the open air city it's enough. Audio Guides are available",
          "It's located in junction. After you get out from the subway station you will see the building. It's beautiful with the light. I didnt get in because it's closed in the night.",
          "Beautifully illuminated at night, if you ever get lost in Xian know that this is exactly in the centre.",
          "Lovely to see lit up at night. Situated near the metro and easy to walk to. There are food markets near by",
          "The tower is located inside the city wall in the center of modern city. There is a big watch/bell so the people from all side can see the bell directly. If you walking and lost, just find the bell tower and you can find the way to go home",
          "We learned the history of this site and took pictures We did not ask to go closer and do not know if you could go inside",
          "Lit up after dark, the bell tower is a great old building and best viewed from a distance. Access is via an underground walk way as the tower is actually now in the middle of a busy roundabout. Getting photos without buses is difficult. There is not much inside and the view out",
          "Great at night, during the day nothing special, really take a wake around when it's dark. Haven't been checking inside, but it made atmosphere of Xi'an more special",
          "Nice bell tower. Not much to do but to sit, relax and do some great people watching. Best to go in the evening, when it's dark out and the tower is all lite up.",
          "This is a great place to visit during the day but when it is lit up at night it looks beautiful. Visiting the Drum tower on the same day is very doable.Within walking distance of Muslim quarter for dinner.",
          "It's very old and it is built in Chinese traditional style. Tower is opened for tourists in the daytime, but it looks better with illumination in evening. It's situated near \"Bell tower\" subway station in the city center, so it's easily to find. Also you can see near here Drum",
          "The Bell Tower is in the center of Xi'an and is surrounded by traffic. It is a prominent structure and is particularly impressive when lit up at night.",
          "Late in the holiday and nursing a bad ankle but still worth all the steps. Fascinating structure, got lost in thought thinking about the largest beams that you can see on the first level. Tower has been extensively renovated since 1940s so wonder if these beams are the original",
          "This is a fascinating sight in the middle of the walled city. better with the lighting up and very impressive during the day but looks wonderful when lit up at night surrounded by the constant traffic.",
          "Watch the play, climb the stairs, check it out on a clear, good day to see the views of the city. (Travelled in October 2012). Look at it after hours for the colours.",
          "Visited there in summer holiday on July 2016. Its located in city centre,can be easily reached by Subway line 2 and get off at Bell Tower Station. Recommended time for a visit is 1 hour.",
          "It is said that Bell Tower (\u949f\u697c\uff0cZhonglou) has been the centre of Xian City. Unique and beautiful. No one misses it while traveling to Xian. Its just besides the Muslim Food Street, which is by far the most crowded street of Xian. A Must see i would say.",
          "If you enjoy eastern architecture you need to see this! We spent some time there and you have great views of the surrounding city streets",
          "The memory of the night view of bell tower remains refreshing in my mind.it was breath taking and highly advisable!",
          "The tower is impressive, particularly in the night when it is illuminated. It worths a visit and a walk on the large street that brings to it",
          "Good place to visit. Learning stop. This tower you can learn about history, ancient architecture and culture.",
          "What a gorgeous place! The pictures taken of his place were amazing. At night it is incredible! A must visit . So much to do around this place. Take time to visit.",
          "Bell tower is adjacent to the drum tower. It is well lit at night and you should take selfie at the backdrop of this monument. This place is at a working distance from the xian south gate.",
          "Great view at night with the lighting effects. A lot of people taking photos so you may need to wait for a bit before you can find the best angle to shoot but it's defintiely worthwhile.",
          "You can access the bell tower from the pedestrian underground tunnel around the roundabout (south side, opposite from the subway exit) Entry is 35 yuan a person. You can climb up to the second level and watch the history of the bell tower.",
          "it looks beautiful at night and is so near the Muslim quarter. It is quite attractive to watch and definitely a memorable sight.",
          "This was a disappointment after the Drum Tower. There should be a combined price to see both. Not worth the visit.",
          "The Bell Tower is located at the center of the roundabout, which is only accessible via the underpass around the attraction. Once on the second level, we could see the prominent Jingyun Bell, which is the replica of the actual Tang dynasty era bell that once hung inside the",
          "Similar to other big bell/drum towers across China however again with the history of Xi'an and stories a nice thing to go see and I would recommend a visit if staying in Xi'an . As one of the oldest cities and previous capitals of China Xi'an has a lot to offer. With the Bell",
          "Both the bell and drum towers in Xi'an are stunning at night and during the day. A walk up to the top and around gives a good view of the city below. You can also see a traditional performance at different times during the day. Traveled in March 2014.",
          "The bell tower has a great history and is nice to visit if you haven't before. Also visit the Drum tower and then finish the day at the Muslim Quarter.",
          "This is a great photo opportunity at night, the lights really do the scene justice. The whole square is bustling with life. For an extra good view and picture, try taking a picture from the mall opposite. It is really easy to get here. Just hop on the subway and get off at",
          "You would see that the Bell tower is situated at the central of this ancient city. It was used as a time-telling tower where everywhere within the ancient city would be informes of the time of the day by the ringing of the large bell. The belltower is best appreciated from afar,",

        "wiki": "Xi'an (UK:  shee-AN, US:  shee-AHN; Chinese: [\u0255\u00ed.\u00e1n] (listen)), also known as Sian, is the capital of Shaanxi Province. A sub-provincial city on the Guanzhong Plain in Northwest China, it is one of the oldest cities in China, the oldest prefecture capital and one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals, having held the position under several of the most important dynasties in Chinese history, including Western Zhou, Qin, Western Han, Sui and Tang. Xi'an is the starting point of the Silk Road and home to the Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shi Huang.Since the 1980s, as part of the economic growth of inland China especially for the central and northwest regions, the city of Xi'an has re-emerged as a cultural, industrial, and educational centre of the entire central-northwest region, with many facilities for research and development, national security and space exploration. Xi'an currently holds sub-provincial status, administering 11 districts and 2 counties. As of 2018 Xi'an has a population of 12,005,600 and the Xi'an\u2013Xianyang metropolitan area a population of 12.6 million. It is the most populous city in Northwest China, as well as the third most populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Chengdu. In 2019, it was named as one of the 7 main emerging megacities, or megalopolises, in China and designated as a metropolis that also consists of areas surrounding the city itself (citation needed). According to GaWC 2020, Xi\u2019an is ranked Beta-, an increase from Gamma last year. \n\n\n== Name ==\n\"Xi'an\" is the atonal pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of its name \u897f\u5b89, which means \"Western Peace\". (The apostrophe \u2013 known in Chinese as a \u9694\u97f3\u7b26\u865f, g\u00e9y\u012bn f\u00fah\u00e0o \u2013 should be included to distinguish its pronunciation from the single syllable xian.) The name was adopted in 1369 under the early Ming dynasty. Jesuit missionaries recorded its name as \"Si-ngan\" or \"Si-ngan-fou\" from its status as the seat of a prefecture (\u5e9c, f\u01d4). This form still appears in the Latin name of the Catholic diocese of Xi'an, archidioecesis Singanensis. The name was later romanized as \"Hsi-an\" by Wade & Giles and as \"Sianfu\" or \"Sian\" by the Qing imperial post office, both of which were common until the general adoption of pinyin.\nThe area of present-day Xi'an has been the site of several important former Chinese cities. The capital of the Western Zhou were the twin cities of Feng and Hao, known collectively as Fenghao, located on opposite banks of the Feng River at its confluence with the southern bank of the Wei in the western suburbs of present-day Xi'an. The Qin capital Xianyang was erected north of the Wei during the Warring States period and was succeeded by the Western Han capital of Chang'an (\u9577\u5b89), meaning \"Perpetual Peace\", which was located south of the Wei and covered the central area of present-day Xi'an. During the Eastern Han, Chang'an was also known as Xijing (\u897f\u4eac) or the \"Western Capital\", relative to its position to the main capital at Luoyang. Under the Sui, its name became Daxing (\u5927\u8208, \"Greatly Prosperous\") in AD 581. Under the Tang, the name reverted to Chang'an in 618. Under the Mongolian Yuan dynasty (13th & 14th centuries), it held a succession of names: Fengyuan (\u5949\u5143), Anxi (\u5b89\u897f, \"Peaceful West\"), and Jingzhao (\u4eac\u5146). The Ming name \"Xi'an\" was changed back to Xijing (\"Western Capital\", as above) between 1930 and 1943.\nXi'an currently does not have a widely accepted one-character abbreviation as many other Chinese cities do. Its license plates are simply marked with \u9655A, based on the name of its province.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nXi'an has a rich and culturally significant history. The Lantian Man was discovered in 1963 in Lantian County, 50 km (31 mi) southeast of Xi'an, and dates back to at least 500,000 years before the present time. A 6,500-year-old Neolithic village, Banpo, was discovered in 1953 on the eastern outskirts of the city proper, which contains the remains of several well organized Neolithic settlements carbon dated to 5600\u20136700 years ago. The site is now home to the Xi'an Banpo Museum, built in 1957 to preserve the archaeological collection.\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nXi'an became a cultural and political centre of China in the 11th century BC with the founding of the Zhou dynasty. The capital of Zhou was established in the twin settlements of Fengjing (\u4e30\u4eac) and Haojing, together known as Fenghao, located southwest of contemporary Xi'an. The settlement was also known as Z\u014dngzh\u014du to indicate its role as the capital of the vassal states. In 770 BC, the capital was moved to Luoyang due to political unrest.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nFollowing the Warring States period, China was unified under the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) for the first time, with the capital located at Xianyang, just northwest of modern Xi'an. The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang ordered the construction of the Terracotta Army and his mausoleum just to the east of Xi'an almost immediately after his ascension to the throne.In 202 BC, the founding emperor Liu Bang of the Han dynasty established his capital in Chang'an County; his first palace, Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae, \"Perpetual Happiness\") was built across the river from the ruin of the Qin capital. This is traditionally regarded as the founding date of Chang'an. Two years later, Liu Bang built Weiyang Palace (\u672a\u592e\u5bae, \"Never Ending Palace\") north of modern Xi'an. Weiyang Palace was the largest palace ever built on Earth, covering 4.8 square kilometres (1,200 acres), which is 6.7 times the size of the current Forbidden City and 11 times the size of the Vatican City. The original Xi'an city wall was started in 194 BC and took 4 years to finish. Upon completion, the wall measured 25.7 km (15.97 mi) in length and 12 to 16 m (39.37\u201352.49 ft) in thickness at the base, enclosing an area of 36 km2 (13.90 sq mi). In the year 190, amidst uprisings and rebellions just prior to the Three Kingdoms Period, a powerful warlord named Dong Zhuo moved the court from Luoyang to Chang'an in a bid to avoid a coalition of other powerful warlords against him.\nFollowing several hundred years of unrest, the Sui dynasty united China again in 582. The emperor of Sui ordered a new capital to be built southeast of the Han capital, called Daxing. It consisted of three sections: the Imperial City, the palace section, and the civilian section, with a total area of 84 km2 (32 sq mi) within the city walls. At the time, it was the largest city in the world. The city was renamed Chang'an by the Tang dynasty. In the mid-7th century, after returning from his pilgrimage to India, the Buddhist monk Xuanzang established a translation centre for Sanskrit scriptures.\nConstruction of the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda began in 652. This pagoda was 64 m (209.97 ft) in height, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras obtained from India by Xuanzang. In 707, construction of the Small Wild Goose Pagoda began. This pagoda measured 45 m (147.64 ft) tall at the time of completion, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras by Yijing. The massive 1556 Shaanxi earthquake eventually damaged the tower and reduced its height to 43.4 m (142.39 ft).The Nestorian Stele is a Tang Chinese stele erected in 781 that documents 150 years of early Christianity in China. It is a 279 cm tall limestone block with text in both Chinese and Syriac describing the existence of Christian communities in several cities in northern China. It reveals that the initial Nestorian Christian church had met recognition by the Tang Emperor Taizong, due to efforts of the Christian missionary Alopen in 635.Chang'an was devastated at the end of the Tang dynasty in 904. Residents were forced to move to the new capital city in Luoyang. Only a small area in the city continued to be occupied thereafter. During the Ming dynasty, a new wall was constructed in 1370 and remains intact to this day. The wall measures 11.9 km (7.4 mi) in circumference, 12 m (39.37 ft) in height, and 15 to 18 m (49.21\u201359.06 ft) in thickness at the base; a moat was also built outside the walls. The new wall and moat would protect a much smaller city of 12 km2 (4.6 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn October 1911, during the Xinhai revolution, revolutionaries attacked the Manchu fort in Xi'an city. Xinhai forces stormed the fort, killing some 20,000 Manchus, therefore successfully liquidated the entire population of Manchus in Xi'an city. The Hui Muslim community of northwestern China was divided in its support for the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. The Hui Muslims of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries and the Hui Muslims of Gansu supported the Qing.  The native Hui Muslims (Mohammedans) of Xi'an joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the Manchus. Only some wealthy Manchus who were ransomed and Manchu females survived. Wealthy Han Chinese seized Manchu girls to become their slaves and poor Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women to be their wives. Young pretty Manchu girls were also seized by Hui Muslims of Xi'an during the massacre and brought up as Muslims.A British missionary who witnessed the massacre commented that \"Old and young, men and women, children alike, were all butchered... Houses were plundered and then burnt; those who would fain have laid hidden till the storm was past, were forced to come out into the open. The revolutionaries, protected by a parapet of the wall, poured a heavy, unceasing, relentless fire into the doomed Tartar (Manchu) city, those who tried to escape thence into the Chinese city were cut down as they emerged from the gates.\"In 1936, the Xi'an Incident took place inside the city during the Chinese Civil War. The incident brought the Kuomintang (KMT) and Communist Party of China to a truce in order to concentrate on fighting against the Japanese Invasion. On May 20, 1949, the Communist-controlled People's Liberation Army captured the city of Xi'an from the Kuomintang force.Xi'an made headlines for being one of the many cities where the 2012 China anti-Japanese demonstrations occurred.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nXi'an lies on the Guanzhong Plain in the south-central part of Shaanxi province, on a flood plain created by the eight surrounding rivers and streams. The city has an average elevation of 400 metres (1,312 ft) above sea level and an annual precipitation of 553 mm (21.8 in). The urban area of Xi'an is located at 34\u00b016\u2032N 108\u00b056\u2032E. The Wei River provides potable water to the city.\nThe city borders the northern foot of the Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the south, and the banks of the Wei River to the north. Hua Shan, one of the five sacred Taoist mountains, is located 100 km (62 mi) away to the east of the city. Not far to the north is the Loess Plateau.\nAt the beginning of Han dynasty, Prime Minister Zhang Liang advised the emperor Liu Bang to choose Guanzhong as the capital of the Han dynasty: \"Guanzhong Plain, which is located behind Xiao Pass and Hangu Pass, connects Long (Gansu) and Shu (Sichuan). Lands of thousand miles rich in harvest be found here, as if this place belongs to the nation of heaven.\" (\u5173\u4e2d\u5de6\u5d24\u51fd\uff0c\u53f3\u9647\u8700\uff0c\u6c83\u91ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u6b64\u6240\u8c13\u91d1\u57ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd\u4e5f) Since then, Guanzhong is also known as the 'Nation of the Heaven'.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nXi'an has a temperate climate that is influenced by the East Asian monsoon, classified under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification as situated on the borderline between a semi-arid climate (BSk) and humid subtropical climate (Cwa). The Wei River valley is characterised by hot, humid summers, cold, dry winters, and dry springs and autumns. Most of the annual precipitation is delivered from July to late October. Snow occasionally falls in winter but rarely settles for long. Dust storms often occur during March and April as the city rapidly warms up. Summer months also experience frequent but short thunderstorms. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from around the freezing mark in January to 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 14.08 \u00b0C (57.3 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 31 percent in December to 47 percent in August, the city receives 1,536 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221220.6 \u00b0C (\u22125 \u00b0F) on January 11, 1955 to 41.8 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on June 21, 1998. A highest record of 42.9 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) was registered in another station on June 17, 2006.\n\n\n=== National Time Service Centre ===\nThe Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory was established in 1966. In 1975, according to the Geodetic Origin Report of the People's Republic of China, 'in order to avoid bias in the mensuration as much as possible, the Geodetic Origin would be in central mainland China.' Lintong (\u4e34\u6f7c), a town near Xi'an was chosen. Since 1986, Chinese Standard Time (CST) was set from NTSC. The NTSC in Lintong is 36 km (22 mi) away from Xi'an.\n\nNational Time Service Centre (NTSC), the Chinese Academy of Sciences is an institute which is mainly engaged in the service and research on time and frequency. NTSC takes charge of generating and maintaining the national standard time scale, disseminating the time and frequency signals. The autonomous standard time scales of universal time and atomic time and the dissemination techniques with LF radio and HF radio were established successively during the 1970s and 1980s, which meet all the requirements for different applications on the whole, such as the scientific researches, national economy, etc.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2007 Xi'an has a population of 4.07 million.\nCompared to the census data from 2000, the population has increased by 656,700 persons to 4.05;million. In contrast, the population in 2010 has steadily increased to 8.7 million and in 2016 the population is somewhat near 9 million for permanent residents.  The population is 51.66 percent male and 48.34 percent female. Among its districts, Yanta has the largest population, with 1.08 million inhabitants.The encompassing Xi'an-Xianyang metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 12.9 million, and locally as 13,569,700, of which 5,740,000 is urban.The majority of Xi'an residents are Han Chinese, who make up 99.1 percent of the city's total population. There are around 81,500 people belonging to ethnic minorities living in Xi'an, including 50,000 Hui people.During World War II, Xi'an became a destination for many refugees from other provinces of China, especially neighboring Henan Province. Because Xi'an was far inland, the invading Japanese army only managed a few aerial assaults on the city. As a result, Xi'an suffered minimal destruction. After 1949, the national government tried to balance the development in different regions of China, and relocated a number of factories and universities from other cities to Xi'an. Modern Xi'an Jiaotong University was relocated from its original campus in Shanghai.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Xi'an has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts and 2 counties:\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nXi'an has many areas that are easily accessible on foot. In many commercial, residential, educational zones in the city, especially in the shopping and entertainment districts around the Bell Tower, underpasses and overpasses have been built for the safety and convenience of pedestrians.\nElectric bikes are popular among students and offer easy transportation in and around the city for many residents. A bicycle-sharing network started operating in 2013 and today has 52,000 bikes, used by over 200,000 people per day. Taxi services are numerous, but many citizens of Xi'an still commute to work using the city's 270 official municipal bus routes serviced by a fleet of over 7,800 buses, with an average system-wide ridership of over 4 million people per day. The bus network is complemented by a rapidly expanding subway system that carries over 1.5 million commuters per day. There are more than 2 million registered automobiles in Xi'an; the growing number of personal automobiles also means traffic jams are a common urban issue.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nLine 2, running through the city from north (North Railway Station) to south (Weiqu Nan), was the first line opened to the public on September 16, 2011. Operations began on September 28, 2011. This line is 19.9 kilometres (12.4 miles) long with 17 stations. Line 1 opened on September 15, 2013.

Sixty-six hours later, on January 2, another fire occurred at another station on Line 2.\n\n\n=== Taxi ===\nTaxis in Xi'an are predominantly BYD Auto made in Xi'an.\nMost, if not all, taxis in Xi'an run on compressed natural gas. For the taxis' fare, during the period of 06:00 through 23:00, \u00a59/2 kilometres (1.2 miles) for the fare fall and \u00a52.3/km later, at night \u00a510 for the fare fall and \u00a52.7/km later.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThere are 6 passenger transport railway stations in Xi'an. Xi'an railway station, located just north of Xi'an walled city, is one of the eight major national railway stations, and the main railway transportation hub of Shaanxi Province. The new Xi'an North railway station, situated a few miles to the north, is the station for the high-speed trains of the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an High-Speed Railway. With 34 platforms, it is the largest railway station in Northwest China. Construction of the station began on September 19, 2008. The station was opened on January 11, 2011. As of May 2012, Xi'an North Station is served only by the fast (G-series and D-series) trains running on the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an high-speed railway; one of them continues south to Hankou.\nThe city's other stations include Xi'an West, Xi'an East, Xi'an South, Sanmincun, and Fangzhicheng railway stations.\nXi'an Railway Station covers 597,000 square metres (6,430,000 square feet), has 5 passenger platforms, and 24 tracks.

The Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an high-speed railway also serves Xi'an. Construction work began on September 25, 2005, the railway opened for service on February 6, 2010. The railway has made air service between Zhengzhou and Xi'an uncompetitive. All passenger flights between the two cities were suspended within 48 days of start of regular high-speed rail service.\n\n\n=== Expressways ===\nXi'an currently has three ring road systems, the Second Ring road and the Third Ring road which encircle the city. These ring roads are similar to freeways, except where there are traffic signals on the Second Ring road.\nAs a tourist city, Xi'an has built expressways to Lintong, Tongchuan and Baoji, with well-maintained roads to famous scenic spots in suburban counties and to the north slope of the Qin Mountains. Since its construction in September 2007, the G5 Beijing\u2013Kunming Expressway connects Hanzhong and Xi'an through the Qinling.\n\nChina National Highway 108\nChina National Highway 210\nChina National Highway 211\nChina National Highway 312\n\n\n=== Air ===\nXi'an Xianyang International Airport (airport code: XIY) is the major airport serving the city and it is the largest airport in the northwestern part of China.

A maintenance error was responsible. All 160 people on board died. As of 2016, it remains the deadliest airplane crash ever to occur in mainland China.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Xi'an descends from one of the world's earliest civilizations. The Guanzhong Ren (simplified Chinese: \u5173\u4e2d\u4eba; traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u4e2d\u4eba; pinyin: Gu\u0101nzh\u014dng r\u00e9n) culture is considered the cultural antecedent of Xi'anese; their features are satirized as the \"Ten Strangenesses of Guanzhong Ren\" (simplified Chinese: \u5173\u4e2d\u5341\u5927\u602a; traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u4e2d\u5341\u5927\u602a; pinyin: Gu\u0101nzh\u014dng sh\u00ed d\u00e0 gu\u00e0i).

          "I contacted Liu at xiantourbooking.com after reading the other reviews on TripAdvisor and also having looked at the website for further information. I have nothing but the highest praise for Liu's company and for the experience I had in Xi'an. I had 2.5 days available to spend",
          "I bboked \u897f\u5b89\u897f\u90e8\u56fd\u9645\u65c5\u884c\u793e\u65b0\u57ce\u5206\u793e for 3 days excursion in Xi'an.

          "Wonderful tour of this exciting and inspiring site. Remains difficult to comprehend. Met the farmer who unearthed the first artifact. It was a head & he was fearful that it was a bad omen. His farm is gone & sleepy Xiang is a boom town tourist site. He signs souvenir books in",
          "I contacted Mr Liu's company having seen the good reports on Trip Advisor. Contact was made at very short notice on the internet and Mr Liu phoned me back to confirm arrangements. A follow up on the internet suggested that I and my guide could visit all the tour sites by local",
          "I have been traveling for more than 30 years and never have I came across a more professional, courteous and considerate guide than Liu Yu of Xian Tours. The exceptional service started from the time I booked our small group tour in Australia. Liu got straight back to me with",
          "In the past 14 years I have been to China on average about 2 times per year. I have seen many culturally significant sites, but this was my first trip to Xi'an and the Terracotta Warriors. By far this is the best site I have seen. The tomb of Qin Shi Huang and the many artifacts",
          "As a frequent traveler in China, I was looking for an agency that could handle my desire to visit some places as much as 5 hour's drive from Xian, including the magnificent Maijishan grottoes, sites in the Qinling mountains, etc. Unlike some other companies that wanted to fit me",
          "I arrived at my hotel and had little confidence in the ability of the hotel staff to arrange a tour to the Xi'an Warriors site for the next day. I found Liu Yu's service and read the good experiences of other travelers, and sent off an online enquiry. Within 20 minutes, Liu",
          "Went on a 10 day Gate 1 tour and spent an afternoon at the Terra Cotta Warriors.....truly an awesome sight! And a must see!",
          "I visited China for business and some traveling. We (a group of 4) took one day to fly from Shanghai to Xian to see the the terracotta worries. Liu waited to us at the airport picked us up with a driver and a van and took us to see terracotta worries. Liu was very knowledgeable,",
          "Liu is awesome. He took care of everything along the way, there weren't any touristy stops that ate up precious time, and provided excellent service. Additionally he is really knowledgeable on Chinese history and speaks perfect English. He is a great guy and made our trip really",
          "We had a day and half with Liu seeing both the Terracotta warriors Xian. He was an amazingly knowledgeable guide and a thoroughly nice guy. I would recommend the tour highly",
          "Liu, our guide was nothing short of fantastic. The service was first rate, and great value. I am sure there are cheaper ways to do everything we did, but I doubt there are better. we stayed in the Tang Dynasty Art Garden Hotel, which was superb, and right next to the Wild Goose",
          "I went to see the terra cotta warriors on advice from a friend not knowing what to expect. What all this king did 2300 yrs ago and how the govt. is saving it and showcasing it was great. A definite highlight not to be missed. What made it over the top was our tour guide, Raphael",
          "This was the one place in China that is a must. It is the most interesting place and well worth the extra few days you spend in China. Just the site of this and to know the story of why and how the warriors were built.To see and meet the farmer who unearthed the warriors while",
          "My family group of 6 recently visited Xi'an for a one day tour of the Terracotta warriors, \"Muslim Street\" and City gate. We had such a great time that I had to write this review. We were greeted at Xi'an airport by Aaron Liu , our private tour host for the visit. It did not",

          "Having been to china previously, I yearned to go back with my partner. We decided we wanted to see the usual attractions aswell as some that aren't as frequented. Aaron was our tour guide and from our first point of contact his service and knowledge was second to none, just",

          "Liu Yu was the perfect tour guide. From the very first email he sent to me in response to my request for information, to the follow up note he sent to me after the trip, he was extremely professional, organised, diligent and service oriented - things I have often struggled to",
          "i would like thank Aaron for making my Visit to China a memorable experience. I have many memories from my 6 week visit one of which was my visit to the see the Terracotta warriors. It was exhilarating and amazing to see so many still in one piece. It was great to learn the"

          "This is well worth a visit when you are in Xi'an from the point of view appreciating comparative developments in different parts of the world. The ceramics here are remarkable since they already display aesthetic as opposed to purely functional features. The excavations are sad",
          "Often over-shadowed by the nearby terracotta warriors, this Neolithic site is still worth a visit. The museum is newly refurbished, signage is good, and a walk around the site is both instructive and interesting. Less crowded than other sites.",
          "Banpo is an archaeological site dating back to ~6000 BC. It contains a village of about 45 homes, with artifacts such as tools, implements and skeletal remains. There are also several displays with recreations of what the wooden structures would have looked like. You can easily",

          "I didn't know about this place until our tour guide took us here. It was really interesting to see how they built their communities 6000 yrs ago. Good way to spend an hour",

          "I literally was told about this place the night before. It is really remarkable because it was a civilization run by women and it is the oldest in China. Really amazing and it only takes about an hour. No one was there. The women would take a man for a little while and",
          "Definitely worth your time if you have an extra couple hours. very interesting how developed people were ~6,000 years ago. This place does a nice job in sharing a story, and museum is excellent with many old artifacts, tools, weapons, etc...",
          "there is not a great deal to actually look at as most of what you see has been excavated to reveal how structures were made back then, they were a fairly advanced design for so long ago.there is a the remains of a small village structures in the main museum with visual displays",
          "I think because we had just come from the Terracotta Warrior museum this place was a bit of a let down. Fairly deserted, which was nice, but the museum buildings were cold, almost as cold as outdoors. The English translations on the exhibits were poor. This museum was suggested",
          "Very interesting neolithic village complex, but a lot of it had been removed to the main History Museum, so you are left with the site itself, some excavations, and a series of skeletons. Unfortunately our guide didn't know much more than the notices on each section, most of",
          "A little known place but worth the effort to visit to better understand how early people lived in the Xian area 6000 years ago. There were no queues or x-ray machines!",

          "Stopped at the BanPo Museum on our way back from visiting the Terracotta Warriors, for a visit of about 60 minutes. The site date from about 4,800 BC, and the museum offers some remarkable insights into life in the Neolithic period in China.",
          "Our hired taxi took us here before going to see the Teracotta Warriors. It\u2019s well worth the 60-90 minutes to visit. I never knew about this place, and never had seen 6,000 year-old relics and archaeological ruins. Excellent.",

          "Really interesting slice of ancient pre-history in this Neolithic village discovered in the 1950s, and archaeologists have yet to piece it all together. (e.g. are some of the markings on carved rocks recovered in the excavation a form of proto-writing?)",
          "Felt the museum did not explain well how the prehistoric people acquired their building and living technology nor how comparable civilisations were evolving elsewhere",
          "This was an optional part of a tour to see the Terracotta Army but was definitely worth it. The museum shows ancient dwellings in a very interesting way. A must see if you can fit it into your day.",

          "Avoid this place even if it is on your way to or from the terracotta warriors museum. You pay 65 yuan to enter and see only mud and burial ground. I think we were scammed as our cab driver had tickets which he sold to us. There was not a single person in ticket queue.",
          "An off the popular tourist trail but fascinating excursion for those really interested in ancient culture. This is an actual archeological dig site for the Banpo people that lived about 5000 years ago! The site is well preserved and provides a good day out in a peaceful",

          "This site is over 6,000 years old, and was found by chance in 1953. Archeologists have worked out where houses were and their shape. There are cooking areas and cooking utensils. Several skeletons have been revealed, buried with cooking utensils which were probably believed to",
          "Our guide did a great job of explaining to us what the village would have looked like from the shapes seen in the archeological dig. It was remarkable to imagine how the homes were structured and how they may have lived/functioned inside. The relics in the attached museum were",
          "a looked after prehistoric site that had lots of interesting items including beautiful pottery. We had an audio guide that explained various things that were numbered. i hadnt really thought about ancient china until we visited this museum. worth a visit.",
          "This is a prehistoric archaeological site so nothing exists above ground level. They help your imagination with a number of conjectured panoramas and pictures of the period. Lovely setting for the museum and an interesting local art and craft exhibition nearby.",
          "This seems to be an attraction that only receives visitors because it's enroute to the Terracotta Army, which is a shame really because it tells the history of China dating back to some 6,000 years. But the exhibition area needs an update - it all looks very 1980s, and this kind",
          "Banpo culture existed 6700 years ago, and this place the part of the oldest chinese history! You will see the real \"china\" they made 6700 years ago! This is just amazing!!! At this place you will feel the ancient time of China.",
          "This museum gives a strong historical context. It's an easy to navigate museum. It is good for individuals and families alike to walk through. The Banpo Museum shows the craftsmanship and resourcefulness of the indigenous people. Great!",

          "You need to go to this place. It is one of those little out of the way places that you might miss but you shouldn't. China is culturally rich in history but this is even further indepth history that I was not expecting. It is easy to get around and very well laid out. I wish",
          "It is rare to see a 6000 year old archeological site and this one is in the middle of the city! Mostly what you see are the foundations of the village and skeleton bones of Neolithic people. Some English posted. Best to have a guide.",
          "This Neolithic site was discovered when workers were clearing the area to build a factory. The museum displays artifacts from the site and reconstructions of the homes and buildings showing how they believe the stone age civilisation lived 5000-3000 BC. They believe the",

          "The Banpo Museum, like the Terra Cotta Warriors site, is a fascinating archaeological site. Well done for visitors, and there's a decent amount of English on the placards, and a wide range of viewing points. We weren't expecting such an expansive, real-live site",
          "This was not my favorite place on my trip, but it was worth visiting. I really enjoyed the scenery and how this reservation sat in the middle of a city but had a separate feeling. I found the remains of the people buried at the site to be saddening, but if you like History, this",
          "I have been here twice and I am in awe every time. I just love the history here. It's really not too much to look at but you're standing in a 6000 year old village with artifacts and even bones still here. It is an amazing place if you're into history!",
          "We went and saw this as a guides choice activitie. But it was amazing to see what history and how the people lived.",

          "We went this on referral by our tour guide but really we think there are better things to do in this city. Best give this a miss. It's run down and not maintained. It's showing a very interesting period in the local history but the museum is tired and there's not much to see and",
          "Interesting way to kill an hour. Most amazing thing is that it was a 6000 year old archaeological site. Recreations and videos all have English translations. I would rate these as some of the better displays I've seen. I wouldn't kill yourself to get there.",
          "This is a 6000+ year old museum incredibly preserved. The actual skeletons of real people may be somewhat confronting for some but where else can we see something so old. Can be busy but dont let the tour guides rush you through.",
          "Visited this place last year, but despite it's historical significance felt it was down at heel, sadly needing revitalising and updating of exhibits and signage (some of which was heavy political propaganda from years back). Delighted to note on this visit the authorities have",

          "If it wasn't for the fact that I have a background in archaeology I would not have known it was there. I large cultural heritage site in the middle of an industrial area. I think it was really well laid out and serves as a good example of how to present this type of site.",
          "I would rate this one of my favourite touristy places in Xi'an. As it was the actual site where all this history was discovered, I can't help but feel awed standing in the midst of it all and wondering what it'd be like if I was there 6000 years ago. There are some descriptions",
          "Really enjoyed this museum as prehistoric history fascinates me. Well preserved tools and lots of fascinating facts. Must go!",
          "Definitely give it a go if you want to see how Neolithic people lived and burried. There were even complete skeletons of people burried together.",
          "This place isn't large but it's well laid out and the ancient village is very well preserved. I enjoyed the exhibits as they were fascinating and easy to follow. There are some videos that explain the housing structures. The juvenile exhibit was either not happening or pretty",
          "It is a very small museum. It didn't take us long to get around. the most intersting part was seeing the old house sites and skeletons and learning about how the Banpo people lived. Most exhibits have an English translation. It was very quiet at the time we visited. Can easily",
          "Banpo ruins of the Yellow River Basin is a typical primitive society matriarchal commune village site, is a Neolithic Yangshao culture, dating back about 6000 years. Discovered in 1952, 1954-1957 excavation, an area of about 50,000 square meters, has unearthed 45 houses, more",
          "Stopped here briefly on the way to see the warriors. Really enjoyed learning about the history of the site, including the clues that archaeologists have found about the Ban Po society that lived here. The museum has many artifacts including pottery and tools.",
          "very old and a little boring but the history is worth the effort to explore and learn, but only if you have some extra time in Xi'an",
          "This was an unexpected side trip on our way to the Terracotta Warriors site, but well worth it. Only downside was the Chinese groups tour guides use of an amplified sound system. Each. Three od#r four tour guides amplified voices bouncing off the walls made our guide's voice",
          "This is a site near Xian, where there is original matriarchal village that was excavated in 1960s. Though it is not far from the city center, but very few visitors. Actually it can be visited en route to Terra-cotta Warriors. There are tombs, kiln, ruin of the houses etc. here,",
          "this is the remnants of a 6000 year old city and pretty interesting. I guide Mary knows her stuff and was very knowledgeable. You will like this stop the sites is a solid must see.",
          "For those historically curious, this is an interesting and wonderful spot to visit. Not many tourist visit this place by China standards so you can spend your sweet time admiring and learning about really ancient times of Xian.",
          "Did not actually know about this place till our guide recommended it, plus it was on the way to the TCW. It is interesting. Alot more space to look at the exhibits than the Shanxi History Museum.",
          "Came here on the way to Terracotta warriors museum. Interesting insight to their world 6000 years ago.",
          "We weren't planning on going but our tour guide made a stop here and it's interesting to find out there was a matriarchal society that flourished. You can see the dig site and a reconstruction of what it possibly looked like.",

          "6000 years...well! Very interesting. To be honest, I thought there would be more to see, but, it was very interesting even though I thought this. Thank goodness we had a guide, otherwise we would've been looking at old dust. I found the burial reasoning and discussion very",
          "To be honest, I was not excited about another museum/exhibit visit, but, this was really enjoyable. Nestled in a big green field we entered the museum. We had paid $200 for our drive and guide to take us out to the spot, which was actually back by the airport - a good 40 minute",
          "This is a small museum with a few interesting exhibits. The information is fully presented in both English and Mandarin but some of the exhibits were repetitious.",
          "Went here as an add on to a tour to Warriors and very pleased I did. Its fascinating and well presented but better if you have a guide although there are descriptions in English",
          "I really enjoyed this place! Go to the museum first, this shows many of the artifacts they unearthed, both items from every day life and burial goods. I was fascinated to see how incredibly modern the fish hooks looked. And the spindles looked like they did for many years.",
          "Read a review that this museum is not worth seeing. I absolutely disagree. In it, I found out that stone-age Chinese were already using their cooking pottery for steaming! Their fishing hooks and needles made of fish bones were absolutely amazing tools to be made 6000 years ago.",
          "It's something interesting, but very small place. Skipping this from your schedule wouldn't hurt. It can be just the \"filler\" to your free time if you are in this area.",

          "Banpo Neolithic Village was a stop as part of a tour package. It was very interesting, and gave quite a bit of cultural history of what and how China operated 6000 years ago. It was very intersting to find out that women were actually the dominant force and leaders/head of the",
          "This museum exhibits a village that is over 4000 years old. it is unique in the world and really worth seeing.They have improved the exhibits since my first trip in 1989 and the area around it is an interesting juxtaposition of the past and the present.",

          "The Banpo Neolithic Village is a fascinating place. For a start, it is over 6000 years old and must make the terracotta warriors almost modern! The Yangshao culture tribes used to live here. It was a matriarchal society where the women did all the work of runnng the household",
          "This site is interesting and tells the beginning of the dwellers to Xi'an. Though there is little remains, the museum is able to tell the story of the origin of this village and life in this village too.",

          "I stopped by here on my way to the Terra Cotta Warriors. I have always been interested in excavation sights where ever I go. This is not a very big sight but it is packed with a ton of information and artifacts. I found it so interesting to see how life was back 6,000 years",
          "I went here on my way to see the Terra Cotta warriors. I found it to be interesting to see how life was back 6,000 years ago. They have excavated living areas such as living, cooking, and beds. The burial system was extremely interesting. There are many artifacts that they",
          "Yes, I get that this is a huge find and that this shows civilisations from a time before we could fathom blah blah blah, but this is boring. I love exploring historical sites, and China has some of the best I have visited during my travels. But this one is just a little far",
          "Do not waste your money going to this place. The entrance is more expensive than the Forbidden City! There is only an excavation of the remains of an old village...not much to see. Bowls, arrows, spears from the neolithic age.",
          "We spend hours wandering around the Banpo site imaging how the people lived here thousands of years ago. I loved the way they showed what the ruins would have been like when they were lived in. They even had skeletons , what an amazing place, just needs better signage to move",
          "Stopped here for an hour. A good example of an ancient civilisation . It was not very busy ( rare in China!) and was worth an hour of your time",
          "Seeing how cultures lived 6000 years ago is interesting especially when looking at the recreations of the homes. Worth a side trip.",
          "Visited this museum with my two children today (11 and 6). Besides from the museum focusing on the prehistoric discovery itself there is a excavation site, a life size remodelling of what they believe some of the homes looked like, and a place where a man shows kids how to make",
          "We travelled quite a way to see this, and regretted it. It may have some, relatively minor, historical relvance, but not worth the trip.",

          "Since my husband and I are very interested in archeology, evolution, and early civilization, this quiet museum ranks high up there for us. I especially love the abstract art on the potteries and other artifacts. This place is easy to get to on the Metro (Ban Po stop at the east",

          "I would only recommend if you have plenty of time spare. We visited on the way back from the Terracotta Warriors, after that experience this seemed a bit dull! You would not be missing anything if you did not visit. Save your money, it cost 65 RMB per person to enter.",
          "This dig site is located in the middle of urbanized Xi'an. It was discovered when they were digging for foundations. Seeing the archaeological dig and the pre-historic settlement and burial sites was interesting.",

          "It's a little quieter than other places. Fun to walk around and see the exhibit. We were on a tour so we had limited time but it felt like you could spend an hour or two there enjoyably.",
          "This was the earliest Neolithic village in China when discovered in the 1950's and they did it justice by housing it in a massive hangar and erecting a purpose built museum to display all the wonderful artefacts they found. The amazing linear face designs on the pots are really",
          "I visited about a year ago, but I still have positive memories of it being really interesting. It was small, and there wasn't a ton of information in English, but it was enough to get me intrigued. There was also nice space outside of the archaeological/museum area to spend some",
          "If you got an hour to spare, this is a nice excavation of an ancient village. Just fun to walk around there and see how a village looked so many years ago",
          "This place exhibits the existence of the Banpo race which resided in Xi'an. The remains and evidence of the layout of their home are still very visible and well maintained. Our guide explained to us how the Banpo race lived. However, what caught our eyes were the Burial Jar for",

          "We visited Banpo on the 2nd day of our 2 weeks in Xi'an - which was great as it gave us a good insight into ancient Xi'an. The museum is well set up and very interesting. Our guide made it easy to really get immersed in understanding the site. The content, the excavations",
          "I congratulate the Chinese archaeologists who have done so much brilliant work on the site. It is fascinating to see, read about and visualise the life of the Banpo people all those thousands of years ago. If you have no interest in history than this archaeological site may not",
          "This was very interesting to see how things were 6,000 years ago! Both the way this lived, the way the family clan was setup and how they made their homes. Well worth the stop along with the Village display next door.",
          "it house artefacts from ancient village i believe called Banpo Village. it educates the visitor on how the ancient lifestyle is, how the house was built etc. went there during the winter, and there was no other visitor other than us, so we felt a bit weird",

          "Not too far from the city, pay this museum a visit either if you're fond of this kind of pre historic site or if you have never seen one. In my opinion it is not incredible, very similar to what can be seen elsewhere.",
          "Went here for a morning visit, however very disappointed as it turned out to be a bit of a tourist trap. Save your time and money and visit some of the more tradional sites in the city",
          "If you are into the archeology then you will be interested in this site. It was discovered by accident when local Gov. was going to build a some kind of energy power plants about 40 years ago.",
          "We were very impressed by the Banpo village museum. It was very well set up and had signs and n English, as well as Chinese. The mural of the village and its surroundings, as it once appeared, is very well done.",
          "Although I can recommend Banpo Museum for its interesting exhibits, I have two caveats. One, if you don't read Chinese yourself, go with somebody who can, as the English explanations often left much to guess (or were unwittingly amusing). Secondly, do not go in the summer if the",
          "A somewhat recent archeological treasure that is 6000 years old. Makes it easy to see and imagine life in the Banpo Village. Well worth the visit!",
          "It's not a top place to visit in Xi'an but good for history explorer. and if you have extra free time then you can visit this place, not crowed. ticket price is 65 RMB. Banpo is the type site associated with Yangshao Culture. Archaeological sites with similarities to the first",

          "You can see many relics of ancient human bones. Atmosphere a little creepy, cold. not many visitors when I was there. Visitors can buy xian peasant painting.",
          "Sit of a Neolithic village that was a matriarchal society. Excellent museum and a excavation of the village is great. Included in the visit xi'an card but entry restricted till mid morning. Not to far from the subway or bus stop.",
          "This was our first stop to many museums, and I would say this was a a great start because it's the most ancient. Banpo is about 6000 years ago, and it was amazing to see how a female dominating society worked. There were skeleton well preserved, and urn that contained baby's",
          "Banpo museum and Neolithic site is very interesting and impressive. It's located inside a small park, which is also nice. There's a lot of explenatios signs in English. We've been there in Saturday, and it was quite quiet (the other places in Xi'an was very crowded and noisy).",
          "Banpo Village seems like it would be worthwhile for a real scientist type rather than for the casual tourist who has come to see the Terracotta figures.",
          "The Banpo Museum is excellent example of Neolithic humans in China. Several dioramas represent the lifestyle and behavior of these people. We found their burial customs to be fascinating, in that it is very similar to our contemporary \"family plots\". China is history-rich",
          "This is the first archeology site that I have visited and I am impressed. I, was at the Banpo Museum as part of the day tour to see, the Terracotta Army, the Huaqing Palace and also a run at Wen Yi South Road for ornamental fish window shopping. In fact, I still have some time,",
          "I don't think it's a top destination, but it's well worth a visit if you have the time. The excavated site has been enclosed and can be seen from walkways. Several excellent animated short films are displayed in both Chinese & English that show how the village houses were",

          "If your time is limited in Xi'an then this can be given a pass. There is not much to see but what there is is well presented.",
          "Interesting site, but difficult to comprehend the layout. The gardens leading to the site are beautiful.",
          "The museum is situated a short distance from the Terracotta museum and so our local guide suggested we stopped by and have a look. I did not have much expectation at first but end up spending about 1.5-2 hours in the museum. The museum is at the excavation site where they found",
          "Although a museum, it's not a quiet place where people thoughtfully stop, look and think about the past. Noisy, loud groups drift by in their herds, cameras click merrily away, and loads of selfies! The re-created village has well displayed artefacts and scenes, with evidence of",
          "As the first museum at prehistoric site, it was built at the base of the excavations of the Banpo site. The site is a typical Neolithic matriarchal community of the Yangshao culture dating back about 6000 years. at that time, the Banpo people used tools made of wood anf stone.",

          "The museum is laid out well and artifacts are very well preserved, but if you are pressed for time, I would skip it. As with many sights in Xi'an, I think this is more interesting for Chinese tourists as they may learn about this in school.",
          "I made a stop at Banpo several years ago on a trip with fellow archaeology and geology students from an American university. The site is fantastic, and really well preserved. Anyone who is interested in prehistoric China should certainly make the stop if in Xi'an. It is a",

          "As far as museums built directly at archaeological digs are concerned, this is one of the better ones that I have visited. Plenty of interpretative material and enough translation into English to keep a foreigner engaged. Be aware that this site isn't some quaint village out",

          "You get to see the early 4000bc early human in china. It's a maternal society when women were the head of households. Interestingly, they do nt have a concept of mono partner and I think this is really interesting to know they were such a open society compared to ours. ;)",
          "There are only a few sites preserved about early living in China. Not a must see visit but was part of the package and still interesting. Shows an excavation site of a typical Neolithic matriarchal community of the Yangshao Culture dating back about 6,000 years. On display are",

          "This can be a museum to be missed. It basically just show the site of some more than 2000 years ago village. Nothing much displayed and most of the displayed stuff or information is also available in Xi'An museum itself",
          "This museum is really great because you can walk around the actual site itself and see the things that can't be put on display in a museum like house foundations, post holes, and burials. There is a museum section, too, where you can see all the ceramics, and the collections are",
          "I booked a tour to go the terracotta army and this museum was included in the tour (Eastern tour). However, the museum is not that interesting. You will see some reconstruction of the ground where the houses where, some tools or stuffs like that. There are very few explanations,",

          "Banpo is a huge Neolithic Village that existed beneath modern-day Xi'an. Part of what is called the \"Yangshao Culture,\" the museum is built over the open excavation of the site. You can see post-holes, the shape of the houses, a moat, kilns, hearths, and a few pottery vessels in",
          "The site is quite interesting, but not worth a visit in itself. The tour guide will tell you lots of interesting facts about the matriarchal Banpo Society to bring the site to life. If not, you are basically looking at a few post-holes and skeletons.",
          "It's a bit more \"raw\" than the terracotta warriors in terms of a tourist development, and we visited with a guide (see Alex tours) which helped provide anything that was missing in terms of English commentary. That said, it would have been perfectly enjoyable had we visited",

          "Our guide and driver suggested a stop at Banpo Museum when I decided the imperial hot springs didn't look that interesting and we therefore had some extra time in our day. I'm so glad we stopped at Banpo to see the remains of a 6,000-year-old matriarchal society. Not only was",
          "The Banpo Village historical site is well worth the effort of seeing on a visit to Xi'an, especially if you thought that the Terra Cotta Warriors was the only game in town. The Village depicts an agrarian, matriarchal society which flourished in the broad river basin some 6000",
          "We were not sure what our guide was taking us to. It's interesting to see how dwelling forms and communal living occurred so long long ago. If you want to know about Chinese society and history, this is interesting.",
          "6,000 years ago (Old Testament Times) the Chinese were already using very advanced tools. Often overlooked in one's visit of Xian. This village is well worth a visit if you are not in a hurry.",

          "Except for the usual $$ entry fee....I think we enjoyed this more than the Terracotta warrior site (which was good but overated with extremely long walks through uninteresting SHOPS). We did enjoy the bronze age museum on the way out of the Terra cota warriors. Traces/descibes",
          "I'm not big on museums and archeological sites, so this site does not rate very high on my list of places visited and experienced while in China. The museum is actually an active archeological site, so as you are walking around, there will be scientists working to unearth new",
          "A 6000 year old excavation including remnants of huts, layout of the \"village,\" and skeletal remains (Fossilized?) with burial items. This is low key and not as grand as seeing the Terra Cotta Warriors or, say, the Great Wall in Beijing, but this village is one of my strongest",
          "This is on the way to the Terracotta Warriors on the Eastern route, but if you're short in time, I do not recommend this museum. The artifacts are not as unique and interesting and much of it is not geared toward non-Chinese speakers/readers. Although, if you want some cheaper",

          "For me this was really an amazing place that should be on everyone's itinerary! This is a museum constructed over the archeological excavation of a neolithic village. You can see the actual site of the village, the way the houses were constructed, the way people were buried.",
          "Our guide took us here on the way to the Terracotta Warriors - he had convinced us it was worth a visit. It wasn't. It cost 65 Yuan each to get in and there was not much to see except for a few pits and a couple of old pots that had been excavated. It may be more interesting",
          "My guidebook didn't give this site a great review and I didn't intend to go there. Communication problems with my driver for the day meant that we stopped in. I thought it must be really good if he was insisting on it. For 65 Yuan it was overpriced. I left pretty annoyed at",
          "Quite interesting and some good information available. We visited as part of the terracotta warriors tour by our hostel. It is simply the foundations of an ancient village with some skeletons and things like that. Not a must visit destination but a good time filler.",

          "First off, why is this under \"nightlife?\" The museum is a rather interesting look at ancient Chinese culture, that dates back to 6000 years ago (according to the tour guide). The museum consists of several areas displaying the remains of the house foundation, pottery, and",
          "This place is a bit out of the ordinary tourist route, so takes some effort in several ways. The Banpo site was discovered quite early, in the 50\u00b4s, and you get the feeling not much has happened since. Not many modern tools to display and exhibit the finds are used here, which",
          "We found this one of the highlights of our tour to Xi'an. It was so interesting how communities would live and exist together; the history was mind-boggling. So glad we added this to our list of places to go in Xi'an. And our kids found it really interesting too which is",
          "not the most exciting destination in Xi'an-but one of the oldest. The remains of an old neolithic village is quite stunning to view. Very quiet place- not a lot of tourists. Some tours stop on the way to the Warriors and they don't stay long. I took a cab and could take my time.",
          "We were not sure about going to the Banpo Museum as we had seen mixed reviews, however we thoroughly enjoyed it. There are the excavation sites, but also reconstructions of the village. There are many artefacts and there is information about everything, but not too much.",
          "We visited this museum before seeing the Terra Cotta Warriors. It was fascinating to learn how this early matriarchal society lived and protected themselves and more than a bit of an eye-opener for this Western traveller to really appreciate China's very ancient civilization.",
          "On the way to the main attraction in Xian, the Terracotta Museum, our guide suggested we visit the Banpo Museum which we hadn't even read about before arriving in Xian. Banpo (\u534a\u5761) Museum was an excavation and exhibition site of the ancient civilization during the Neolithic era",

          "The 2010 edition of the Lonely Planet describes this site as being \"of enormous importance for Chinese archaeological studies\", however I would argue that this site is of importance to the history of the entire human race. The reasonable entry price (25Y) and lack of crowds",
          "We were brought here by a guide and found this excavation really interesting. I may even have enjoyed it better than the overcrowded TC Soldiers. Much was shown and told about this ancient neolithic tribe and we realized how long China has been inhabited.",
          "This was part of a tour I bought to go visit the Terracotta Warriors. I personally would have preferred to skip this place and spend more time at the Big Wild Goose Pagoda and at the Warriors. As other mentioned, it is pretty much just pits where old settlements were discovered,",

          "The main problem with this site has nothing to do with the way the Chinese have presented the exhibition. It simpy is the obvious difficulty of making a hole in the ground exciting. Without a doubt, this is a significant site. The Yellow River valley is, along with the Tigris",
          "Banpo Neolithic Village was never going to be my favourite visit in Xi'an. I am not an archaeologist, nor a historian. But the thing about China is that if you find one aspect of a visit you're not keen on, within a few minutes you will find something that will stay in your",
          "WE found the display very interesting. Don't be put off by negative reviews. The display here is just as worthwhile as the Terracotta Warriors. The fact is you will find remarkable the technological achievements of the human race from 5000 years ago. If you don't like history",

The mausoleum complex is located in the Weicheng district of the City of Xianyang, Shaanxi Province, on the northern bank of the Wei River and about 20 km to the north of the city center of the provincial capital of Xi\u2019an.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Han Yang Ling is composed of two large burial mounds, 86 smaller burial pits and a criminals' graveyard. The site today also hosts a museum. The larger of the two mounds is the burial place of the Jing Emperor, it sits next to the slightly smaller mound of his Empress Wang. The mausoleum is surrounded by 86 outer burial pits, 21 of which are accessible to visitors. The pits display more than 50,000 miniature terracotta figures reflecting the daily life of the Han emperor's court, including eunuchs, servants, tools and domesticated animals. The human figurines are naked but were originally clothed with exquisite fabrics. The complex is one of the \"Five Mausoleums\" of the Western Han Dynasty (Chinese: \u897f\u6c49\u4e94\u9675; pinyin: X\u012b H\u00e0n W\u01d4 L\u00edng).\nIn 2016, the discovery of the earliest tea traces known to date from the mausoleum of Emperor Jing  was announced, indicating that tea was drunk by Han Dynasty emperors as early as 2nd century BC.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTerracotta Army\nRule of Wen and Jing\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Hanyangling Museum\".

        "wiki": "Daxingshan Temple (simplified Chinese: \u5927\u5174\u5584\u5bfa; traditional Chinese: \u5927\u8208\u5584\u5bfa; pinyin: D\u00e0x\u012bngsh\u00e0n S\u00ec) is a Buddhist temple located in Yanta District of Xi'an, Shaanxi.The temple had reached unprecedented heyday in the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907), when \u015aubhakarasi\u1e43ha, Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra taught Chinese Esoteric Buddhism in the temple, known as the \"Three Prominent Buddhist Monks in the Kaiyuan Period\" (\u5f00\u5143\u4e09\u5927\u58eb). Then Japanese Buddhist monks Ennin and Enchin introduced it to Japan, since then, Daxingshan Temple became the cradle of Chinese Esoteric Buddhism. Daxingshan Temple, Daci'en Temple and Jianfu Temple became the three sutras translation sites (\u4e09\u5927\u8bd1\u7ecf\u573a) in the Tang dynasty.\nDaxingshan Temple was completely damaged in the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution, after the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907, most parts of the temple were ruined in wars and natural disasters, and gradually it became unknown to public. Most of the present structures in the temple were repaired or built in the Ming Dynasty (1368\u20131644) and modern China.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Western Jin dynasty ===\nDaxingshan Temple was first construction as \"Zunshan Temple\" (\u9075\u5584\u5bfa) in 266 by Emperor Wu of Western Jin dynasty (265\u2013420).\n\n\n=== Northern Zhou dynasty ===\nIn the mid-6th century, Emperor Ming of Northern Zhou dynasty (557\u2013581) founded the Zhigu Temple (\u965f\u5cb5\u5bfa) at the site of Zunshan Temple to commemorate his father-in-law.\n\n\n=== Sui dynasty ===\nIn 582, Emperor Wen of Sui dynasty (581\u2013618) ordered to relocate the temple to Chang'an, and renamed \"Daxingshan Temple\". Huiyuan (\u6167\u8fdc), Huizang (\u6167\u85cf), SengXiu (\u50e7\u4f11), Baozhen (\u5b9d\u9547), Hongzun (\u6d2a\u9075) and Tanqian (\u6619\u8fc1), known as the \"Six Prominent Buddhist Monks\", settled at the temple under the command of the emperor.\n\n\n=== Tang dynasty ===\nIn the reign of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang dynasty (684), to commemorate his father Wei Xuanzhen, Empress Wei renamed the temple \"Fengguo Temple\" (\u9146\u56fd\u5bfa). In 710, the temple restored the original name.\nFrom 716 to 720, during the Kaiyuan period (713\u2013741), \u015aubhakarasi\u1e43ha, Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra resided in the temple, where they translated Buddhist sutras and disseminated Chinese Esoteric Buddhism. Japanese Buddhist monks Ennin and Enchin received Chinese Esoteric Buddhism and introduced it from China to Japan. In 756, Amoghavajra was proposed as the new abbot of Daxingshan Temple. He was awarded the title of \"Teacher of the Empire\" by the Tang emperors Xuanzong (712\u2013756), Suzong (756\u2013763) and Daizong (763\u2013779).Since Emperor Wuzong (841\u2013846) believed in Taoism, he ordered to demolish Buddhist temples, confiscate temple lands and force monks to return to secular life. Daxingshan Temple was destroyed in this movement.After the fall of Tang dynasty, Daxingshan Temple fell into oblivion.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty ===\nDuring the Yongle era (1403\u20131424) of the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), monk Yunfeng (\u4e91\u5cf0) settled at Daxingshan Temple, he supervised the construction of halls and drum tower, and preached Chan Buddhism there.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), the temple underwent three renovations, respectively in the ruling of Shunzhi Emperor (1648) and in the reign of Kangxi Emperor (1694) and in the Tongzhi period (1862\u20131874). But the temple was badly damaged during the Taiping Rebellion.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nIn 1943, Daxingshan Temple became the site of a Buddhist college and the Association of Chinese Religious Believers, which were founded by Taixu, Yu Bin and Feng Yuxiang.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\nAfter the establishment of the Communist State in 1955, the Chinese government appropriated a large sum of money for constructing the temple. On August 6, 1956, it was listed among the first batch of provincial level cultural heritage by the Shaanxi Provincial Government.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution the Red Guards had attacked the temple in 1966.\nAfter the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, according to the national policy of free religious belief, the Buddhist Association of Shaanxi took over the temple and started a reconstruction project. In 1984, it has been designated as a National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area by the State Council of China. In 1985, it became the site of Buddhist Association of Xi'an. That same year, the Japanese Shingon presented a bronze statue of Ksitigarbha to the temple.In 2015, China's paramount leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi visited the temple.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nAlong the central axis of the temple stand six buildings including the Shanmen, Four Heavenly Kings Hall, Mahavira Hall, Guanyin Hall, Meditation Hall, and Dharma Hall. Subsidiary structures were built on both sides of the central axis including the Drum Tower, Bell Tower, Ksitigarbha Hall, and Manjusri Hall.\n\n\n=== Shanmen ===\nThe extant Shanmen was built in the Ming dynasty with a two story single eave gable and hip roof (\u5355\u6a90\u6b47\u5c71\u9876). On both sides of the shanmen there are two Chinese guardian lions.\n\n\n=== Four Heavenly Kings Hall ===\nMaitreya is enshrined in the Hall of Four Heavenly Kings and at the back of his statue is a statue of Skanda. Four Heavenly Kings' statues are enshrined in the left and right side of the hall. The statues of Maitreya and Skanda were made in the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644). Under the eaves is a plaque with the Chinese characters \"Hall of Heavenly Kings\" written by the former Venerable Master of the Buddhist Association of China Zhao Puchu.\n\n\n=== Ping'an Ksitigarbha Hall ===\nThe Ping'an Ksitigarbha Hall houses the statues of Ksitigarbha and Yama. In front of the hall, a wooden plaque with Chinese characters \"Ping'an Ksitigarbha Hall\" (\u5e73\u5b89\u5730\u85cf\u6bbf) was written by former abbot Jieming (\u754c\u660e).\n\n\n=== Mahavira Hall ===\nThe Mahavira Hall is the main hall in the temple. In the middle of the hall placed the statues of Five Buddha, with statues of Guanyin, Shancai and Longn\u00fc at his back. The statues of Twenty-four Gods stand on both sides of the hall.\n\n\n=== Guanyin Hall ===\nA Ming dynasty wood carving statue of Thousand Armed and Eyed Guanyin is placed in the hall. In the center of the eaves of the hall is a plaque, on which there are the words \"Guanyin Hall\" written by Chuanyin, the former Venerable Master of the Buddhist Association of China.\n\n\n=== Dharma Hall ===\nThe Dharma Hall enshrining the statue of Vairocana. Under the eaves is a plaque with the Chinese characters \"\u89c9\u609f\u4f17\u751f\" written by Guangxu Emperor (1875\u20131908) in the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nZhang Yuhuan (2012a). \"The Cradle of Chinese Esoteric Buddhism: Xi'an Daxingshan Temple\" \u300a\u6c49\u4f20\u4f5b\u6559\u5bc6\u5b97\u7684\u7956\u5ead\uff1a\u897f\u5b89\u5927\u5174\u5584\u5bfa\u300b.  \u300a\u56fe\u89e3\u4e2d\u56fd\u8457\u540d\u4f5b\u6559\u5bfa\u9662\u300b [Illustration of Famous Buddhist Temples in China] (in Chinese).

        "wiki": "The Shaolin Monastery (Chinese: \u5c11\u6797\u5bfa; pinyin: Sh\u00e0ol\u00edn s\u00ec), also known as the Shaolin Temple, is a Chan (\"Zen\") Buddhist temple in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, China.  Believed to have been founded in the fifth century, the Shaolin Temple is the main temple of the Shaolin school of Buddhism to this day.\nLocated 90 kilometres (56 miles) west of the city of Zhengzhou, the Shaolin Monastery and its Pagoda Forest were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010 as part of the \"Historic Monuments of Dengfeng\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nThe name refers to the woods of Shaoshi (\u5c11\u5ba4; Sh\u01ceo Sh\u00ec) mountain, one of the seven peaks of the Song mountains. The first Shaolin Monastery abbot was Batuo (also called Fotuo or Buddhabhadra), a dhy\u0101na master who came to ancient China from ancient India or from Central Asia in 464 AD to spread Buddhist teachings.\nAccording to the Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks (645 AD) by Daoxuan, Shaolin Monastery was built on the north side of Shaoshi, the central peak of Mount Song, one of the Sacred Mountains of China, by Emperor Xiaowen of the Northern Wei dynasty in 477 AD, to accommodate the Indian master beside the capital Luoyang city. Yang Xuanzhi, in the Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang (547 AD), and Li Xian, in the Ming Yitongzhi (1461), concur with Daoxuan's location and attribution. The Jiaqing Chongxiu Yitongzhi (1843) specifies that this monastery, located in the province of Henan, was built in the 20th year of the Taihe era of the Northern Wei dynasty, that is, the monastery was built in 495 AD.\nAs the center of Chan Buddhism, the Shaolin Temple attracted many emperors\u2019 attention in China\u2019s history. During the Tang dynasty 618\u2013907 AD Empress Wu Zetian (AD 625\u2013705) paid several visits to the Shaolin Temple discussing Chan philosophy with high monk Tan Zong. According to legend, Emperor Taizong granted the Shaolin Temple extra land and a special \"imperial dispensation\" to consume meat and alcohol during the Tang dynasty. If true, this would have made Shaolin the only temple in China that did not prohibit alcohol. Regardless of historical veracity, these rituals are not practiced today. This legend is not corroborated in any period documents, such as the Shaolin Stele erected in 728 AD. The stele does not list any such imperial dispensation as reward for the monks' assistance during the campaign against Wang Shichong, only land and a water mill are granted. The founder of the Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan (AD 1215\u20131294) ordered all Buddhist temples in China to be led by the Shaolin Temple; eight princes during the Ming dynasty converted to Shaolin.\n\nTraditionally Bodhidharma is credited as founder of the martial arts at the Shaolin Temple. However, martial arts historians have shown this legend stems from a 17th-century qigong manual known as the Yijin Jing.The authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing has been discredited by some historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and Ryuchi Matsuda. This argument is summarized by modern historian Lin Boyuan in his Zhongguo wushu shi:\n\nAs for the \"Yi Jin Jing\" (Muscle Change Classic), a spurious text attributed to Bodhidharma and included in the legend of his transmitting martial arts at the temple, it was written in the Ming dynasty, in 1624, by the Daoist priest Zining of Mt. Tiantai, and falsely attributed to Bodhidharma. Forged prefaces, attributed to the Tang general Li Jing and the Southern Song general Niu Gao were written. They say that, after Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years at Shaolin temple, he left behind an iron chest; when the monks opened this chest they found the two books \"Xi Sui Jing\" (Marrow Washing Classic) and \"Yi Jin Jing\" within. The first book was taken by his disciple Huike, and disappeared; as for the second, \"the monks selfishly coveted it, practicing the skills therein, falling into heterodox ways, and losing the correct purpose of cultivating the Real. The Shaolin monks have made some fame for themselves through their fighting skill; this is all due to having obtained this manuscript\". Based on this, Bodhidharma was claimed to be the ancestor of Shaolin martial arts. This manuscript is full of errors, absurdities and fantastic claims; it cannot be taken as a legitimate source.\nThe oldest available copy was published in 1827. The composition of the text itself has been dated to 1624. Even then, the association of Bodhidharma with martial arts only became widespread as a result of the 1904\u20131907 serialization of the novel The Travels of Lao Ts'an in Illustrated Fiction Magazine:\nOne of the most recently invented and familiar of the Shaolin historical narratives is a story that claims that the Indian monk Bodhidharma, the supposed founder of Chinese Chan (Zen) Buddhism, introduced boxing into the monastery as a form of exercise around a.d. 525. This story first appeared in a popular novel, The Travels of Lao T\u2019san, published as a series in a literary magazine in 1907. This story was quickly picked up by others and spread rapidly through publication in a popular contemporary boxing manual, Secrets of Shaolin Boxing Methods, and the first Chinese physical culture history published in 1919. As a result, it has enjoyed vast oral circulation and is one of the most \u201csacred\u201d of the narratives shared within Chinese and Chinese-derived martial arts. That this story is clearly a twentieth-century invention is confirmed by writings going back at least 250 years earlier, which mention both Bodhidharma and martial arts but make no connection between the two.\nOther scholars see an earlier connection between Da Mo and the Shaolin Monastery. Scholars generally accept the historicity of Da Mo (Bodhidharma) who arrived in China from his country India around 480. Da Mo (Bodhidharma) and his disciples are said to have lived at a spot about a mile from the Shaolin Temple that is now a small nunnery.\nIn the 6th century, around 547 AD, The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries says Da Mo visited the area near Mount Song. In 645 AD, The Continuation of the Biographies of Eminent Monks, describes him as being active in the Mount Song region. Around 710 AD, Da Mo is identified specifically with the Shaolin Temple (Precious Record of Dharma's Transmission or Chuanfa Baoji)  and writes of his sitting facing a wall in meditation for many years. It also speaks of Huike's many trials in his efforts to receive instruction from Da Mo.  In the 11th century (1004 AD) a work embellishes the Da Mo legends with great detail. A stele inscription at the Shaolin Monastery dated 728 Ad reveals Da Mo residing on Mount Song. Another stele from 798 AD speaks of Huike seeking instruction from Da Mo. Another engraving dated 1209 depicts the barefoot saint holding a shoe according to the ancient legend of Da Mo.  A plethora of 13th- and 14th-century steles feature Da Mo in various roles. One 13th-century image shows him riding a fragile stalk across the Yangtze River. In 1125 a special temple was constructed in his honor at the Shaolin Monastery.\n\n\n=== Destructions and renovations ===\nThe monastery has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. During the Red Turban Rebellion in the 14th century, bandits ransacked the monastery for its real or supposed valuables, destroying much of the temple and driving the monks away. The monastery was likely abandoned from 1351 or 1356 (the most likely dates for the attack) to at least 1359, when government troops retook Henan. The events of this period would later figure heavily in 16th-century legends of the temple's patron saint Vajrapani, with the story being changed to claim a victory for the monks, rather than a defeat.In 1641, rebel forces led by Li Zicheng sacked the monastery due to the monks' support of the Ming dynasty and the possible threat they posed to the rebels. This effectively destroyed the temple's fighting force. The temple fell into ruin and was home to only a few monks until the early 18th century, when the government of the Qing dynasty patronized and restored the temple.Perhaps the best-known story of the Temple's destruction is that it was destroyed by the Qing government for supposed anti-Qing activities. Variously said to have taken place in 1647 under the Shunzhi Emperor, in 1674, 1677, or 1714 under the Kangxi Emperor, or in 1728 or 1732 under the Yongzheng Emperor, this destruction is also supposed to have helped spread Shaolin martial arts throughout China by means of the five fugitive monks. Some accounts claim that a supposed southern Shaolin Temple was destroyed instead of, or in addition to, the temple in Henan: Ju Ke, in the Qing bai lei chao (1917), locates this temple in Fujian province. These stories commonly appear in legendary or popular accounts of martial history, and in wuxia fiction.\nWhile these latter accounts are popular among martial artists, and often serve as origin stories for various martial arts styles, they are viewed by scholars as fictional. The accounts are known through often inconsistent 19th-century secret society histories and popular literature, and also appear to draw on both Fujianese folklore and popular narratives such as the classical novel Water Margin. Modern scholarly attention to the tales is mainly concerned with their role as folklore.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nThere is evidence of Shaolin martial arts being exported to Japan beginning in the 18th century. Martial arts such as Okinawan Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b (\u5c0f\u6797\u6d41) style of Karate, for example, has a name meaning \"Shaolin School\" and the Japanese Shorinji Kempo   (\u5c11\u6797\u5bfa\u62f3\u6cd5) is translated as \"Shaolin Temple Fist Method\". Other similarities can be seen in centuries-old Chinese and Japanese martial arts manuals.In 1928, the warlord Shi Yousan set fire to the monastery, burning it for over 40 days, destroying a significant portion of the buildings, including many manuscripts of the temple library.The Cultural Revolution launched in 1966 targeted religious orders including the monastery. The monks who were present at the monastery when the Red Guards attacked were shackled and made to wear placards declaring the crimes charged against them. The monks were imprisoned after being publicly flogged and then paraded through the streets as people threw rubbish at them.   The film crew for the Jet Li movie Martial Arts of Shaolin was shocked to find that the remaining monks have for a time left the compound when they filmed at the monastery complex in 1986.Martial arts groups from around the world have made donations for the upkeep of the temple and grounds, and are subsequently honored with carved stones near the entrance of the temple. In the past, many have tried to capitalise on Shaolin Monastery fame by building their own schools on Mount Song. However, the Chinese government eventually outlawed this; the schools were moved to the nearby towns.A dharma gathering was held from 19-20th August 1999, in Shaolin Monastery for Shi Yongxin's assumption of office as Abbot. Over the next two decades the Monastery grew into a global business empire. In March 2006, Russian President Vladimir Putin became the first foreign leader to visit the monastery. In 2007, the Chinese government partially lifted the 300-year ban of the Jieba, the ancient ceremony of the nine marks which are burned onto the head with sticks of incense. The ban was lifted only for those who were mentally and physically prepared to participate in the tradition.Two modern bathrooms were recently added to the temple for use by monks and tourists. The new bathrooms reportedly cost three million yuan to build. Films have also been released like Shaolin Temple and more recently, Shaolin starring Andy Lau.In 1994 the temple registered its name as a trademark. In the late 2000s, Shi Yongxin began authorizing Shaolin branches outside of mainland China in what has been called a franchise scheme. The branches are run by current and former monks and allow dispersion of Shaolin culture and study of Shaolin kung fu around the globe. As of January, 2011, Yongxin and the temple operated over 40 companies in cities across the world, including London and Berlin, which have purchased land and property.In 2018, for the first time in its 1500-year history, the Shaolin Monastery raised the national flag as a part of a \"patriotism drive\" under the new National Religious Affairs Administration, a part of the United Front Work Department which \"oversees propaganda efforts as well as relations with the global Chinese diaspora\". Senior theology lecturer Sze Chi Chan of Hong Kong Baptist University analyzes this move as General Secretary Xi Jinping making an example of the Shaolin Monastery to send a message to other temples and the Chinese Catholic Church.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nThe Shaolin Monastery was historically led by an abbot, but the communist era restrictions on religious expression and independence have since changed this ancient system. The monastery is currently led by a committee composed primarily of government officials. The treasurer is appointed by the government, and as such the abbot has little control over finances. Profits are split with Dengfeng; the municipality takes two thirds of the profits and the monastery retains one third.\n\n\n== Shaolin temple buildings ==\nThe temple's inside area is 160 by 360 meters (520 ft \u00d7 1,180 ft), that is, 57,600 square meters (620,000 sq ft).

There has also been a Northern Shaolin monastery in northern China. Associated with stories of the supposed burning of Shaolin by the Qing government and with the tales of the Five Elders, this temple, sometimes known by the name Changlin, is often claimed to have been either the target of Qing forces or a place of refuge for monks displaced by attacks on the Shaolin Monastery in Henan. Besides the debate over the historicity of the Qing-era destruction, it is currently unknown whether there was a true southern temple, with several locations in Fujian given as the location for the monastery. Fujian does have a historic monastery called Changlin, and a monastery referred to as a \"Shaolin cloister\" has existed in Fuqing, Fujian, since the Song dynasty, but whether these have an actual connection to the Henan monastery or a martial tradition is still unknown. The Southern Temple has been a popular subject of wuxia fiction, first appearing in the 1893 novel Shengchao Ding Sheng Wannian Qing, where it is attacked by the Qianlong Emperor with the help of the White Eyebrow Taoist.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nShaolin Temple UK\nYuekong\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHenning, Stanley (1994), \"Ignorance, Legend and Taijiquan\" (PDF), Journal of the Chenstyle Taijiquan Research Association of Hawaii, 2 (3): 1\u20137\nHenning, Stan; Green, Tom (2001), Folklore in the Martial Arts.

        "wiki": "The Shaolin Monastery (Chinese: \u5c11\u6797\u5bfa; pinyin: Sh\u00e0ol\u00edn s\u00ec), also known as the Shaolin Temple, is a Chan (\"Zen\") Buddhist temple in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, China.  Believed to have been founded in the fifth century, the Shaolin Temple is the main temple of the Shaolin school of Buddhism to this day.\nLocated 90 kilometres (56 miles) west of the city of Zhengzhou, the Shaolin Monastery and its Pagoda Forest were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010 as part of the \"Historic Monuments of Dengfeng\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nThe name refers to the woods of Shaoshi (\u5c11\u5ba4; Sh\u01ceo Sh\u00ec) mountain, one of the seven peaks of the Song mountains. The first Shaolin Monastery abbot was Batuo (also called Fotuo or Buddhabhadra), a dhy\u0101na master who came to ancient China from ancient India or from Central Asia in 464 AD to spread Buddhist teachings.\nAccording to the Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks (645 AD) by Daoxuan, Shaolin Monastery was built on the north side of Shaoshi, the central peak of Mount Song, one of the Sacred Mountains of China, by Emperor Xiaowen of the Northern Wei dynasty in 477 AD, to accommodate the Indian master beside the capital Luoyang city. Yang Xuanzhi, in the Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang (547 AD), and Li Xian, in the Ming Yitongzhi (1461), concur with Daoxuan's location and attribution. The Jiaqing Chongxiu Yitongzhi (1843) specifies that this monastery, located in the province of Henan, was built in the 20th year of the Taihe era of the Northern Wei dynasty, that is, the monastery was built in 495 AD.\nAs the center of Chan Buddhism, the Shaolin Temple attracted many emperors\u2019 attention in China\u2019s history. During the Tang dynasty 618\u2013907 AD Empress Wu Zetian (AD 625\u2013705) paid several visits to the Shaolin Temple discussing Chan philosophy with high monk Tan Zong. According to legend, Emperor Taizong granted the Shaolin Temple extra land and a special \"imperial dispensation\" to consume meat and alcohol during the Tang dynasty. If true, this would have made Shaolin the only temple in China that did not prohibit alcohol. Regardless of historical veracity, these rituals are not practiced today. This legend is not corroborated in any period documents, such as the Shaolin Stele erected in 728 AD. The stele does not list any such imperial dispensation as reward for the monks' assistance during the campaign against Wang Shichong, only land and a water mill are granted. The founder of the Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan (AD 1215\u20131294) ordered all Buddhist temples in China to be led by the Shaolin Temple; eight princes during the Ming dynasty converted to Shaolin.\n\nTraditionally Bodhidharma is credited as founder of the martial arts at the Shaolin Temple. However, martial arts historians have shown this legend stems from a 17th-century qigong manual known as the Yijin Jing.The authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing has been discredited by some historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and Ryuchi Matsuda. This argument is summarized by modern historian Lin Boyuan in his Zhongguo wushu shi:\n\nAs for the \"Yi Jin Jing\" (Muscle Change Classic), a spurious text attributed to Bodhidharma and included in the legend of his transmitting martial arts at the temple, it was written in the Ming dynasty, in 1624, by the Daoist priest Zining of Mt. Tiantai, and falsely attributed to Bodhidharma. Forged prefaces, attributed to the Tang general Li Jing and the Southern Song general Niu Gao were written. They say that, after Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years at Shaolin temple, he left behind an iron chest; when the monks opened this chest they found the two books \"Xi Sui Jing\" (Marrow Washing Classic) and \"Yi Jin Jing\" within. The first book was taken by his disciple Huike, and disappeared; as for the second, \"the monks selfishly coveted it, practicing the skills therein, falling into heterodox ways, and losing the correct purpose of cultivating the Real. The Shaolin monks have made some fame for themselves through their fighting skill; this is all due to having obtained this manuscript\". Based on this, Bodhidharma was claimed to be the ancestor of Shaolin martial arts. This manuscript is full of errors, absurdities and fantastic claims; it cannot be taken as a legitimate source.\nThe oldest available copy was published in 1827. The composition of the text itself has been dated to 1624. Even then, the association of Bodhidharma with martial arts only became widespread as a result of the 1904\u20131907 serialization of the novel The Travels of Lao Ts'an in Illustrated Fiction Magazine:\nOne of the most recently invented and familiar of the Shaolin historical narratives is a story that claims that the Indian monk Bodhidharma, the supposed founder of Chinese Chan (Zen) Buddhism, introduced boxing into the monastery as a form of exercise around a.d. 525. This story first appeared in a popular novel, The Travels of Lao T\u2019san, published as a series in a literary magazine in 1907. This story was quickly picked up by others and spread rapidly through publication in a popular contemporary boxing manual, Secrets of Shaolin Boxing Methods, and the first Chinese physical culture history published in 1919. As a result, it has enjoyed vast oral circulation and is one of the most \u201csacred\u201d of the narratives shared within Chinese and Chinese-derived martial arts. That this story is clearly a twentieth-century invention is confirmed by writings going back at least 250 years earlier, which mention both Bodhidharma and martial arts but make no connection between the two.\nOther scholars see an earlier connection between Da Mo and the Shaolin Monastery. Scholars generally accept the historicity of Da Mo (Bodhidharma) who arrived in China from his country India around 480. Da Mo (Bodhidharma) and his disciples are said to have lived at a spot about a mile from the Shaolin Temple that is now a small nunnery.\nIn the 6th century, around 547 AD, The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries says Da Mo visited the area near Mount Song. In 645 AD, The Continuation of the Biographies of Eminent Monks, describes him as being active in the Mount Song region. Around 710 AD, Da Mo is identified specifically with the Shaolin Temple (Precious Record of Dharma's Transmission or Chuanfa Baoji)  and writes of his sitting facing a wall in meditation for many years. It also speaks of Huike's many trials in his efforts to receive instruction from Da Mo.  In the 11th century (1004 AD) a work embellishes the Da Mo legends with great detail. A stele inscription at the Shaolin Monastery dated 728 Ad reveals Da Mo residing on Mount Song. Another stele from 798 AD speaks of Huike seeking instruction from Da Mo. Another engraving dated 1209 depicts the barefoot saint holding a shoe according to the ancient legend of Da Mo.  A plethora of 13th- and 14th-century steles feature Da Mo in various roles. One 13th-century image shows him riding a fragile stalk across the Yangtze River. In 1125 a special temple was constructed in his honor at the Shaolin Monastery.\n\n\n=== Destructions and renovations ===\nThe monastery has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. During the Red Turban Rebellion in the 14th century, bandits ransacked the monastery for its real or supposed valuables, destroying much of the temple and driving the monks away. The monastery was likely abandoned from 1351 or 1356 (the most likely dates for the attack) to at least 1359, when government troops retook Henan. The events of this period would later figure heavily in 16th-century legends of the temple's patron saint Vajrapani, with the story being changed to claim a victory for the monks, rather than a defeat.In 1641, rebel forces led by Li Zicheng sacked the monastery due to the monks' support of the Ming dynasty and the possible threat they posed to the rebels. This effectively destroyed the temple's fighting force. The temple fell into ruin and was home to only a few monks until the early 18th century, when the government of the Qing dynasty patronized and restored the temple.Perhaps the best-known story of the Temple's destruction is that it was destroyed by the Qing government for supposed anti-Qing activities. Variously said to have taken place in 1647 under the Shunzhi Emperor, in 1674, 1677, or 1714 under the Kangxi Emperor, or in 1728 or 1732 under the Yongzheng Emperor, this destruction is also supposed to have helped spread Shaolin martial arts throughout China by means of the five fugitive monks. Some accounts claim that a supposed southern Shaolin Temple was destroyed instead of, or in addition to, the temple in Henan: Ju Ke, in the Qing bai lei chao (1917), locates this temple in Fujian province. These stories commonly appear in legendary or popular accounts of martial history, and in wuxia fiction.\nWhile these latter accounts are popular among martial artists, and often serve as origin stories for various martial arts styles, they are viewed by scholars as fictional. The accounts are known through often inconsistent 19th-century secret society histories and popular literature, and also appear to draw on both Fujianese folklore and popular narratives such as the classical novel Water Margin. Modern scholarly attention to the tales is mainly concerned with their role as folklore.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nThere is evidence of Shaolin martial arts being exported to Japan beginning in the 18th century.

The new bathrooms reportedly cost three million yuan to build. Films have also been released like Shaolin Temple and more recently, Shaolin starring Andy Lau.In 1994 the temple registered its name as a trademark. In the late 2000s, Shi Yongxin began authorizing Shaolin branches outside of mainland China in what has been called a franchise scheme. The branches are run by current and former monks and allow dispersion of Shaolin culture and study of Shaolin kung fu around the globe. As of January, 2011, Yongxin and the temple operated over 40 companies in cities across the world, including London and Berlin, which have purchased land and property.In 2018, for the first time in its 1500-year history, the Shaolin Monastery raised the national flag as a part of a \"patriotism drive\" under the new National Religious Affairs Administration, a part of the United Front Work Department which \"oversees propaganda efforts as well as relations with the global Chinese diaspora\".

There has also been a Northern Shaolin monastery in northern China. Associated with stories of the supposed burning of Shaolin by the Qing government and with the tales of the Five Elders, this temple, sometimes known by the name Changlin, is often claimed to have been either the target of Qing forces or a place of refuge for monks displaced by attacks on the Shaolin Monastery in Henan. Besides the debate over the historicity of the Qing-era destruction, it is currently unknown whether there was a true southern temple, with several locations in Fujian given as the location for the monastery. Fujian does have a historic monastery called Changlin, and a monastery referred to as a \"Shaolin cloister\" has existed in Fuqing, Fujian, since the Song dynasty, but whether these have an actual connection to the Henan monastery or a martial tradition is still unknown. The Southern Temple has been a popular subject of wuxia fiction, first appearing in the 1893 novel Shengchao Ding Sheng Wannian Qing, where it is attacked by the Qianlong Emperor with the help of the White Eyebrow Taoist.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nShaolin Temple UK\nYuekong\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHenning, Stanley (1994), \"Ignorance, Legend and Taijiquan\" (PDF), Journal of the Chenstyle Taijiquan Research Association of Hawaii, 2 (3): 1\u20137\nHenning, Stan; Green, Tom (2001), Folklore in the Martial Arts.

        "wiki": "Xi'an (UK:  shee-AN, US:  shee-AHN; Chinese: [\u0255\u00ed.\u00e1n] (listen)), also known as Sian, is the capital of Shaanxi Province. A sub-provincial city on the Guanzhong Plain in Northwest China, it is one of the oldest cities in China, the oldest prefecture capital and one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals, having held the position under several of the most important dynasties in Chinese history, including Western Zhou, Qin, Western Han, Sui and Tang. Xi'an is the starting point of the Silk Road and home to the Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shi Huang.Since the 1980s, as part of the economic growth of inland China especially for the central and northwest regions, the city of Xi'an has re-emerged as a cultural, industrial, and educational centre of the entire central-northwest region, with many facilities for research and development, national security and space exploration. Xi'an currently holds sub-provincial status, administering 11 districts and 2 counties. As of 2018 Xi'an has a population of 12,005,600 and the Xi'an\u2013Xianyang metropolitan area a population of 12.6 million. It is the most populous city in Northwest China, as well as the third most populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Chengdu. In 2019, it was named as one of the 7 main emerging megacities, or megalopolises, in China and designated as a metropolis that also consists of areas surrounding the city itself (citation needed). According to GaWC 2020, Xi\u2019an is ranked Beta-, an increase from Gamma last year. \n\n\n== Name ==\n\"Xi'an\" is the atonal pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of its name \u897f\u5b89, which means \"Western Peace\". (The apostrophe \u2013 known in Chinese as a \u9694\u97f3\u7b26\u865f, g\u00e9y\u012bn f\u00fah\u00e0o \u2013 should be included to distinguish its pronunciation from the single syllable xian.) The name was adopted in 1369 under the early Ming dynasty. Jesuit missionaries recorded its name as \"Si-ngan\" or \"Si-ngan-fou\" from its status as the seat of a prefecture (\u5e9c, f\u01d4). This form still appears in the Latin name of the Catholic diocese of Xi'an, archidioecesis Singanensis. The name was later romanized as \"Hsi-an\" by Wade & Giles and as \"Sianfu\" or \"Sian\" by the Qing imperial post office, both of which were common until the general adoption of pinyin.\nThe area of present-day Xi'an has been the site of several important former Chinese cities. The capital of the Western Zhou were the twin cities of Feng and Hao, known collectively as Fenghao, located on opposite banks of the Feng River at its confluence with the southern bank of the Wei in the western suburbs of present-day Xi'an. The Qin capital Xianyang was erected north of the Wei during the Warring States period and was succeeded by the Western Han capital of Chang'an (\u9577\u5b89), meaning \"Perpetual Peace\", which was located south of the Wei and covered the central area of present-day Xi'an. During the Eastern Han, Chang'an was also known as Xijing (\u897f\u4eac) or the \"Western Capital\", relative to its position to the main capital at Luoyang. Under the Sui, its name became Daxing (\u5927\u8208, \"Greatly Prosperous\") in AD 581. Under the Tang, the name reverted to Chang'an in 618. Under the Mongolian Yuan dynasty (13th & 14th centuries), it held a succession of names: Fengyuan (\u5949\u5143), Anxi (\u5b89\u897f, \"Peaceful West\"), and Jingzhao (\u4eac\u5146). The Ming name \"Xi'an\" was changed back to Xijing (\"Western Capital\", as above) between 1930 and 1943.\nXi'an currently does not have a widely accepted one-character abbreviation as many other Chinese cities do. Its license plates are simply marked with \u9655A, based on the name of its province.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nXi'an has a rich and culturally significant history. The Lantian Man was discovered in 1963 in Lantian County, 50 km (31 mi) southeast of Xi'an, and dates back to at least 500,000 years before the present time. A 6,500-year-old Neolithic village, Banpo, was discovered in 1953 on the eastern outskirts of the city proper, which contains the remains of several well organized Neolithic settlements carbon dated to 5600\u20136700 years ago. The site is now home to the Xi'an Banpo Museum, built in 1957 to preserve the archaeological collection.\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nXi'an became a cultural and political centre of China in the 11th century BC with the founding of the Zhou dynasty. The capital of Zhou was established in the twin settlements of Fengjing (\u4e30\u4eac) and Haojing, together known as Fenghao, located southwest of contemporary Xi'an. The settlement was also known as Z\u014dngzh\u014du to indicate its role as the capital of the vassal states. In 770 BC, the capital was moved to Luoyang due to political unrest.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nFollowing the Warring States period, China was unified under the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) for the first time, with the capital located at Xianyang, just northwest of modern Xi'an. The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang ordered the construction of the Terracotta Army and his mausoleum just to the east of Xi'an almost immediately after his ascension to the throne.In 202 BC, the founding emperor Liu Bang of the Han dynasty established his capital in Chang'an County; his first palace, Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae, \"Perpetual Happiness\") was built across the river from the ruin of the Qin capital. This is traditionally regarded as the founding date of Chang'an. Two years later, Liu Bang built Weiyang Palace (\u672a\u592e\u5bae, \"Never Ending Palace\") north of modern Xi'an. Weiyang Palace was the largest palace ever built on Earth, covering 4.8 square kilometres (1,200 acres), which is 6.7 times the size of the current Forbidden City and 11 times the size of the Vatican City. The original Xi'an city wall was started in 194 BC and took 4 years to finish. Upon completion, the wall measured 25.7 km (15.97 mi) in length and 12 to 16 m (39.37\u201352.49 ft) in thickness at the base, enclosing an area of 36 km2 (13.90 sq mi). In the year 190, amidst uprisings and rebellions just prior to the Three Kingdoms Period, a powerful warlord named Dong Zhuo moved the court from Luoyang to Chang'an in a bid to avoid a coalition of other powerful warlords against him.\nFollowing several hundred years of unrest, the Sui dynasty united China again in 582. The emperor of Sui ordered a new capital to be built southeast of the Han capital, called Daxing. It consisted of three sections: the Imperial City, the palace section, and the civilian section, with a total area of 84 km2 (32 sq mi) within the city walls. At the time, it was the largest city in the world. The city was renamed Chang'an by the Tang dynasty. In the mid-7th century, after returning from his pilgrimage to India, the Buddhist monk Xuanzang established a translation centre for Sanskrit scriptures.\nConstruction of the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda began in 652. This pagoda was 64 m (209.97 ft) in height, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras obtained from India by Xuanzang. In 707, construction of the Small Wild Goose Pagoda began. This pagoda measured 45 m (147.64 ft) tall at the time of completion, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras by Yijing. The massive 1556 Shaanxi earthquake eventually damaged the tower and reduced its height to 43.4 m (142.39 ft).The Nestorian Stele is a Tang Chinese stele erected in 781 that documents 150 years of early Christianity in China. It is a 279 cm tall limestone block with text in both Chinese and Syriac describing the existence of Christian communities in several cities in northern China. It reveals that the initial Nestorian Christian church had met recognition by the Tang Emperor Taizong, due to efforts of the Christian missionary Alopen in 635.Chang'an was devastated at the end of the Tang dynasty in 904. Residents were forced to move to the new capital city in Luoyang. Only a small area in the city continued to be occupied thereafter. During the Ming dynasty, a new wall was constructed in 1370 and remains intact to this day. The wall measures 11.9 km (7.4 mi) in circumference, 12 m (39.37 ft) in height, and 15 to 18 m (49.21\u201359.06 ft) in thickness at the base; a moat was also built outside the walls. The new wall and moat would protect a much smaller city of 12 km2 (4.6 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn October 1911, during the Xinhai revolution, revolutionaries attacked the Manchu fort in Xi'an city. Xinhai forces stormed the fort, killing some 20,000 Manchus, therefore successfully liquidated the entire population of Manchus in Xi'an city. The Hui Muslim community of northwestern China was divided in its support for the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. The Hui Muslims of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries and the Hui Muslims of Gansu supported the Qing.  The native Hui Muslims (Mohammedans) of Xi'an joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the Manchus. Only some wealthy Manchus who were ransomed and Manchu females survived. Wealthy Han Chinese seized Manchu girls to become their slaves and poor Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women to be their wives. Young pretty Manchu girls were also seized by Hui Muslims of Xi'an during the massacre and brought up as Muslims.A British missionary who witnessed the massacre commented that \"Old and young, men and women, children alike, were all butchered... Houses were plundered and then burnt; those who would fain have laid hidden till the storm was past, were forced to come out into the open. The revolutionaries, protected by a parapet of the wall, poured a heavy, unceasing, relentless fire into the doomed Tartar (Manchu) city, those who tried to escape thence into the Chinese city were cut down as they emerged from the gates.\"In 1936, the Xi'an Incident took place inside the city during the Chinese Civil War. The incident brought the Kuomintang (KMT) and Communist Party of China to a truce in order to concentrate on fighting against the Japanese Invasion. On May 20, 1949, the Communist-controlled People's Liberation Army captured the city of Xi'an from the Kuomintang force.Xi'an made headlines for being one of the many cities where the 2012 China anti-Japanese demonstrations occurred.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nXi'an lies on the Guanzhong Plain in the south-central part of Shaanxi province, on a flood plain created by the eight surrounding rivers and streams. The city has an average elevation of 400 metres (1,312 ft) above sea level and an annual precipitation of 553 mm (21.8 in). The urban area of Xi'an is located at 34\u00b016\u2032N 108\u00b056\u2032E. The Wei River provides potable water to the city.\nThe city borders the northern foot of the Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the south, and the banks of the Wei River to the north. Hua Shan, one of the five sacred Taoist mountains, is located 100 km (62 mi) away to the east of the city. Not far to the north is the Loess Plateau.\nAt the beginning of Han dynasty, Prime Minister Zhang Liang advised the emperor Liu Bang to choose Guanzhong as the capital of the Han dynasty: \"Guanzhong Plain, which is located behind Xiao Pass and Hangu Pass, connects Long (Gansu) and Shu (Sichuan). Lands of thousand miles rich in harvest be found here, as if this place belongs to the nation of heaven.\" (\u5173\u4e2d\u5de6\u5d24\u51fd\uff0c\u53f3\u9647\u8700\uff0c\u6c83\u91ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u6b64\u6240\u8c13\u91d1\u57ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd\u4e5f) Since then, Guanzhong is also known as the 'Nation of the Heaven'.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nXi'an has a temperate climate that is influenced by the East Asian monsoon, classified under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification as situated on the borderline between a semi-arid climate (BSk) and humid subtropical climate (Cwa). The Wei River valley is characterised by hot, humid summers, cold, dry winters, and dry springs and autumns. Most of the annual precipitation is delivered from July to late October. Snow occasionally falls in winter but rarely settles for long. Dust storms often occur during March and April as the city rapidly warms up. Summer months also experience frequent but short thunderstorms. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from around the freezing mark in January to 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 14.08 \u00b0C (57.3 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 31 percent in December to 47 percent in August, the city receives 1,536 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221220.6 \u00b0C (\u22125 \u00b0F) on January 11, 1955 to 41.8 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on June 21, 1998. A highest record of 42.9 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) was registered in another station on June 17, 2006.\n\n\n=== National Time Service Centre ===\nThe Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory was established in 1966. In 1975, according to the Geodetic Origin Report of the People's Republic of China, 'in order to avoid bias in the mensuration as much as possible, the Geodetic Origin would be in central mainland China.' Lintong (\u4e34\u6f7c), a town near Xi'an was chosen. Since 1986, Chinese Standard Time (CST) was set from NTSC. The NTSC in Lintong is 36 km (22 mi) away from Xi'an.\n\nNational Time Service Centre (NTSC), the Chinese Academy of Sciences is an institute which is mainly engaged in the service and research on time and frequency. NTSC takes charge of generating and maintaining the national standard time scale, disseminating the time and frequency signals. The autonomous standard time scales of universal time and atomic time and the dissemination techniques with LF radio and HF radio were established successively during the 1970s and 1980s, which meet all the requirements for different applications on the whole, such as the scientific researches, national economy, etc.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2007 Xi'an has a population of 4.07 million.\nCompared to the census data from 2000, the population has increased by 656,700 persons to 4.05;million. In contrast, the population in 2010 has steadily increased to 8.7 million and in 2016 the population is somewhat near 9 million for permanent residents.  The population is 51.66 percent male and 48.34 percent female. Among its districts, Yanta has the largest population, with 1.08 million inhabitants.The encompassing Xi'an-Xianyang metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 12.9 million, and locally as 13,569,700, of which 5,740,000 is urban.The majority of Xi'an residents are Han Chinese, who make up 99.1 percent of the city's total population. There are around 81,500 people belonging to ethnic minorities living in Xi'an, including 50,000 Hui people.During World War II, Xi'an became a destination for many refugees from other provinces of China, especially neighboring Henan Province. Because Xi'an was far inland, the invading Japanese army only managed a few aerial assaults on the city. As a result, Xi'an suffered minimal destruction. After 1949, the national government tried to balance the development in different regions of China, and relocated a number of factories and universities from other cities to Xi'an. Modern Xi'an Jiaotong University was relocated from its original campus in Shanghai.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Xi'an has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts and 2 counties:\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nXi'an has many areas that are easily accessible on foot. In many commercial, residential, educational zones in the city, especially in the shopping and entertainment districts around the Bell Tower, underpasses and overpasses have been built for the safety and convenience of pedestrians.\nElectric bikes are popular among students and offer easy transportation in and around the city for many residents. A bicycle-sharing network started operating in 2013 and today has 52,000 bikes, used by over 200,000 people per day. Taxi services are numerous, but many citizens of Xi'an still commute to work using the city's 270 official municipal bus routes serviced by a fleet of over 7,800 buses, with an average system-wide ridership of over 4 million people per day. The bus network is complemented by a rapidly expanding subway system that carries over 1.5 million commuters per day. There are more than 2 million registered automobiles in Xi'an; the growing number of personal automobiles also means traffic jams are a common urban issue.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nLine 2, running through the city from north (North Railway Station) to south (Weiqu Nan), was the first line opened to the public on September 16, 2011. Operations began on September 28, 2011. This line is 19.9 kilometres (12.4 miles) long with 17 stations. Line 1 opened on September 15, 2013. As a west\u2013east railway, its 19 stations connect Houweizhai and Fangzhicheng. Line 3 runs from northeast (Baoshuiqu) to southwest (Yuhuazhai) and opened on November 8, 2016. Line 4, which is basically parallel to Line 2 on its east, runs from the North Square of the North Railway Station [Beikezhan (Beiguangchang)] to south (Hangtianxincheng) and was available publicly on December 26, 2018.\nEight lines are planned to be finished around 2021. It will mainly service the urban and suburban districts of Xi'an municipality and part of nearby Xianyang City.The subway system covers some of the most famous attractions, such as Banpo Museum (Banpo Station, Line 1), Bell and Drum Tower (Line 2), Fortifications of Xi'an (Line 2), the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda (Line 3 and Line 4), the Daminggong National Heritage Park (Line 4) and Shaanxi History Museum (Line 2, 3 and 4), etc.The first metro departure time for Line 1, 2, 3 and 4 is 6:00, the last metro departure time for Line 3 and 4 is 23:00, for Line 1 is 23:30, and for Line 2 is 23:50.On December 30, 2008, a fire accident occurred that was extinguished within an hour and all workers evacuated safely. Sixty-six hours later, on January 2, another fire occurred at another station on Line 2.\n\n\n=== Taxi ===\nTaxis in Xi'an are predominantly BYD Auto made in Xi'an.\nMost, if not all, taxis in Xi'an run on compressed natural gas. For the taxis' fare, during the period of 06:00 through 23:00, \u00a59/2 kilometres (1.2 miles) for the fare fall and \u00a52.3/km later, at night \u00a510 for the fare fall and \u00a52.7/km later.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThere are 6 passenger transport railway stations in Xi'an. Xi'an railway station, located just north of Xi'an walled city, is one of the eight major national railway stations, and the main railway transportation hub of Shaanxi Province. The new Xi'an North railway station, situated a few miles to the north, is the station for the high-speed trains of the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an High-Speed Railway. With 34 platforms, it is the largest railway station in Northwest China. Construction of the station began on September 19, 2008. The station was opened on January 11, 2011. As of May 2012, Xi'an North Station is served only by the fast (G-series and D-series) trains running on the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an high-speed railway; one of them continues south to Hankou.\nThe city's other stations include Xi'an West, Xi'an East, Xi'an South, Sanmincun, and Fangzhicheng railway stations.\nXi'an Railway Station covers 597,000 square metres (6,430,000 square feet), has 5 passenger platforms, and 24 tracks. It provides 112 services to 80 000 people daily. Among the destinations served by direct trains from Xi'an are Beijing, Zhengzhou, Lanzhou, Baoji, and Mount Hua. China Railway High-speed 2 now run an express services from Xi'an to Baoji and Xi'an to Zhengzhou; with a total running time to Baoji of under 90 minutes, and 2 hours to Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an high-speed railway also serves Xi'an. Construction work began on September 25, 2005, the railway opened for service on February 6, 2010. The railway has made air service between Zhengzhou and Xi'an uncompetitive.

          "This is no ordinary city wall. It is massive in height, width and length and completely intact, thanks also to restoration. Max visitor number of 110,000 says it all! I visited on rainy afternoon. Views of the city were generally uninspiring but there's something awesome about",
          "The walls are over 600 years old and are just over 8 miles long. The South Gate is the most impressive. Most visitors get on to the walls from here. There are two museums inside the barbican and the archery tower of the South Gate which are open to the public. You can hire",
          "My preliminary plan was to take a night walk on top of the wall. But didn't plan well. But luckily, the second morning was cool, very comfortable to take a walk. General description: weekend fun & 2nd visit & 2 friends Visit: Morning market in Xi Cang ->breakfast -> city wall",
          "The ancient city wall is cool considering the history and you will want to spend time inside the walls with the trendy restaurants, bars and Muslim quarter but being on top of the wall isn't too exciting. The Wall length is 13.7 km and there are some nice towers and views",
          "It\u2019s quite wide. And it looks doable when you are on the city wall, but unless you get there early in the day and are fit-don\u2019t try! Check when sunset is as well. I got lost from our bus group by wandering and looking-the place closed around me and I was left wandering the walls",
          "This is another must do activity when you are in Xi\u2019an. While there are 4 gates to the ancient city, the main gate where most of the activities are housed today are in the South. It is actually possible to walk on the perimeter of city walls. Total distance is around 14km. We",
          "We visited the City Wall on a tour in August 2019. The wall is a large fortress-like wall that surrounds the city. You need to climb some stairs to get up onto the wall, but once on the wall, it's like taking a stroll around the City. The entire area is paved, and has small",
          "Xian city wall is well preserved and dates back to the ming dynasty. It has many beautiful gates. Rent a bike and enjoy the city from above.",
          "The old city of Xi'an was surrounded by a stone wall which has been rebuilt to its former glory. There is a wide walkway that you can ascend to and walk completely around the old city. If you prefer you can rent bicycles (one or two person) and take a fun ride around the wall",
          "There were several entrances and exits where you could climb up to this old city wall. The view from above was awesome and beautiful. You could rent a bicycle and cycle round or walk. We chose to walk for about an hour before we exited. There was minimal shelter on top of the",
          "My husband and I enjoyed our walk along the City Wall. The view was very nice, too. We saw some wedding photos being taken, the bride in very elaborate authentic clothing.",
          "we went up on a section of the wall and explored a bit on both sides. You do get great views from the wall. We should have planned to walk around the entire perimeter and take pictures.",
          "You can walk around or rent a bicycle to go around the city wall. It takes around 2-3 hours to cycle around, inclusive of some steps to take pictures. You can return your bicycle at any rental station along the way. A must go when you are in Xian.",
          "Visit in Sept 2015. There are also performance during certain time of the day. The place is also near to Xi'an street food where you can find lots of halal food there.",
          "For me, this was a highlight for Xi'an. The wall is enormous. It can be walked, but it would take three or four hours to do the entire circuit. the most enjoyable way to see it is by bike. I was with a guide, and was only allowed 1 1/2 hours to do the circuit; it was",
          "The Xian City Wall was build centuries ago to protect the central or Old Xian city, and from the top of the wall there are very nice views of both the old and new parts of Xian. The Xian City Wall was a significant part of history - it had served as the eastern gateway for the",
          "Cold but wonderful view of the city Wall. Great to see history come to life. Such a contrast between the use inside the wall then and now. Inside are older homes now.",
          "We hired a bike which took an hour to ride around the whole wall. They had tandem bikes too but we tried it and didn't think we could manage riding it the whole way round but they let us take a photo and then swap over to regular bikes. We stopped whenever we saw a great photo",
          "Came here in November and rented a bike once I got to the city wall top. Nice views of the city along the way. Or if you have time, I saw people walking but it does cover a few miles if I recall correctly. Also saw two couples having their wedding pictures taken here. The",
          "Fourteen kilometres around the original city and wide enough for chariots (well cyclists today!). A wonderful experience to have a different view of the city, see the lookout posts and compare with Hadrian's Wall, so much later but with some similarities. The moat is currently",
          "You don't have to get on the walls from the several main gates. We got on from a small gate next to Yong Xing Fang, and then walked a bit distance to the East Gate to hire a bicycle. Cycling made a whole experience very different.",
          "The City Wall was a nice site and there are many restaurants in the area. Go at night so you can see the Bell Tower lighting",
          "Cycling on top of this wall was a really unique experience. Being at eye level with real family homes was extremely interesting (don't worry, staring/privacy don't seem to be cultural concerns in China). It really felt like a window into the past, so be sure to rent a bike and",
          "Great Wall my dad love it and u can get a coin stamp on it. U can ride bikes on it but there is a age limit.",
          "This was definitely worth visiting and walking or cycling along. Great views of Xi\u2019an. Smog was a bit intense but once we purchased masks it was much easier to handle.",
          "We stopped here as part of a tour but really should have come separately as 45 minutes on a tour is not long enough. Renting a bike for the whole 14km would be the best way to see this and they are easily available on the wall as singles and mostly tandems.",
          "I enjoyed this city wall. It's very large and they have carts that can move you a bit. Many nice vistas from the wall. You must be able to navigate steep steps.",
          "This simple tour gave us an idea how the city of xian was in its history. It's amazing how the walls were built to protect the city from invaders. you have to climb up the walls, to get a glimpse of this magnificent city, and you can have bike rides as well.",
          "The old city wall once enclosed old Xi'an, but now is just an extensive and distinctive feature of the city center. We stayed close to the main gate, where dramatic music and light shows took place every evening. The pedestrian walks along either side of the old moat were both",
          "Beautiful view of older parts of city. Wish we had more time to walk all the way around. This is a very popular place for wedding photos. We saw many different couples in different wedding style outfits; some old, some new. It was very interesting as well and added an",
          "It was an amazing trip. We took the mini Train to go around. It really worth riding on it. Every angle of the view is different. You have to take this mini train to go to every corner. Walk is possible but might take you few hrs plus energy. Can also rent a bike but still need",
          "Took almost 3 hours to go around and totally worth the experience. Feels like walking in ancient times protecting the inner city. There are interesting views in every direction. Look out for the flags and symbols which are different in the 4 sides of the walls. Would suggest",
          "Rather than trying to cover as much as practically possible of the Xi'an City Wall in a rushed manner, one way of which is to perhaps rent a bicycle, I opted for a leisurely stroll along a stretch of the Wall. Just to immerse myself into the rich cultural heritage of the ancient",
          "Of all the things we did in Xian over the few days, we visited the city wall was by far the most fun. Not as crowded as the terra-cotta warriors you can enjoy a peaceful walk along the wall with great views of the city both old and new!",
          "Really brilliant place with historical significance, the wall was in pretty bad shape last 20 to 30 years but gradually restored to its present glory. A throwback to the great days of the Ming Dynasty and another reminder of how great the city of Chang An was in ancient times.",
          "The city wall looked grand from the outside and shall be where your money stops as well. Not worth going up the wall when you can't visit the commander's block interior. A total waste of money and time",
          "I recommend go before is get dark so you have it with daylight and later in the evening with the nice lanterns. After you was on the citywall, just go down and to the small riverside there you can have a very nice evening walk with all the nice lights.",
          "The wall is quite impressive to view from the outside if you think that this structure is 600 years old.We did not walk the complete wall but spend some time on the wall to observe the views and to get the feeling of what it must have been to be a soldier doing duty on the wall.",
          "We cycled from East gate to South gate and back to East gate where we have to met our tour guide, Coco there. The view and the atmosphere is soooo nice. The cool air is so refreshing. Entrance fee RMB54 and there is a bicycle rental kiosk at each gate. You can walk, cycle or",
          "Take the MRT to Yongningmen MRT Station, come out the exit can see the South Gate in front of you. Good to be on the city wall. We took the buggy on the wall, it took about 45 minutes for a round on the wall. My children felt asleep on the buggy because too bored. Buggy stops",
          "One of the best preserved walls in China. Very well maintained. You can even hire transportation along the wall in case you don't want to walk it. Great views.",
          "We arrived at sundown, which was chilly but made for absolutely stunning pictures. A beautiful calm stroll around one side of the wall was a lovely way to end the daylight in Xi'an!",
          "Take a great walk on a great wall (not the Great Wall!). Tickets are \u00a554 per person. It\u2019s fun to walk around the wall, which is 14 kilometers in total and entirely encircles Old Xi\u2019an.",
          "Took a bit ride around wall. Cost very little. However be prepared for the 14km ride and the city suffers badly with smog so not sure of exercising like this in that position is good for you.",
          "I went during the off season and it was so enjoyable. I only biked half of it and while I feel like I probably saw most of it even though I only did half I enjoyed peacefully biking it so much I wish I had done it all. I\u2019ll go back tomorrow at night to see it lit up",
          "Go inside and explore the beautiful architecture and statues. Then take a walk along the wall to see everything going on around you. It feels like you are going back in time.",
          "Rent a bike and cycle around the City Wall is a must try, it's quite unique experience to see great view of the city in different atmosphere. It is recommended to spend a lovely afternoon, the entire wall will be 14 km and will take 2 hours, it's a worth fun bike ride!!!",
          "Some PR genius in China realized 10 or 15 years ago that ordinary, dull grey cities could be made spectacular by the strategic addition of some lights. The Xian wall was, apparently, one of the first beneficiaries. When lit up, it's a charming, magical fairy tale sight. All",
          "Make sure you leave plenty time to enjoy this visit, we had around 2 hours here but it was nowhere near long enough for us.",
          "We came here in the early morning, the air was fresh and the wall was empty. It was great to see all the Chinese style buildings, lanterns and the wall itself was magnificent. Out of 5 cities we visited in China, XiAn is the most historic, I loved it.",
          "Xi'an City Wall is lovely and is well worth a visit. Great views from the top. Walked around some of it.",
          "This is a well preserved and reconstructed wall over nine miles in length. The size and structure are mind blowing. It is a great place for a vantage point to view the city or rent a bike and cycle some of all of it.",
          "We did the cycle of the entire wall which is about 14km but flat all the way around. Great views of the city and a lovely way to spend an afternoon. I would highly recommend!",
          "We rented bikes and rode around the entire length of the wall. It was a fun experience on bikes. Allow for time if you wish to walk the entire wall. It took us a hour and a half to complete on bikes.",
          "We had a morning tour of Xian Ancient City Wall (Cheng Qiang). It symbolises the Fortifications of Xi'an. It is a UNESCO's World Heritage Site since 2008. The wall is in a rectangular shape. You can walk or embark on a tourist shuttle ride on top of the wide walls for",
          "The Xi'an City Wall is a truly impressive construction, illustrating the defensive structure of ancient Chinese cities.Viewing one section is probably sufficient as each section of the wall is the same.",
          "This is a great experience, to marvel at the building of this wall, not as spectaular as the Great Wall of course but stil really worth doing and wonderful views of the city while walking along the wall.",
          "We had let our in-country travel agent (Top China Travel) know that we are active travelers and so, on top of a bike trip in the river area outside of Yangshuo, and hiking in the hills from Ping'An to Longji, we added this to our itinerary and it ended up being one of the many",
          "We didn't have time to do the whole 13.7km of the City wall, but the views are interesting. On one side you have the old town and the other the new town. Great places for photo opportunities. There were stopping places where you swapped bikes then carry on.",
          "This 13.7km long wall is the best preserved city wall in China (according to our guide!). It was interesting to compare the older buildings within the walls to the newer buildings on the outside. The moat surrounding the walls has been made into a park area. I would have liked",
          "Takes about one hour of pedalling on their single geared bikes on a rather bumpy paved but flat surface to cover a complete circuit. But half the visitors (of all ages) seemed to have chosen this method like us. An impressive wall but not so impressive views therefrom. Nothing",
          "Versus The Great Wall of China, this is a great example of how serious they were for protection for their city.",
          "A wall that goes around the whole of Xian city centre. The views aren't great with the development of taller buildings on the inside of the city but it must have been quite a sight in the old times. We walked a little way around it.",
          "We viewed it, from our coach, at night. It was lovely to see it all lit up. We were taken there, the following morning, with our group. It was interesting to see but much more beautiful, at night.",
          "My boyfriend and I rented a tandem bike and cycled around the whole wall I was very unsure at first but we had great fun! And the tandem bike was not too difficult to ride. A great fun way to spend a few hours! This took us about 2 hours but we stopped a few times and admired",
          "My husband and I rented a tandem bike and cycled around the whole wall. It was a fun way to kill a few hours. We stopped frequently to look around and have a snack. There's not a lot to see, but its still a fun activity. Be aware that if you are old they may not let you rent",
          "Come here and rent a bike to bike around the city wall. You'll cover more ground and it's just fun! Walking will take a long time as it is actually a wall around the inner city.",
          "I have traveled to a good number of countries and i can say with out reservation that Xian is one of my favorite places I've visited hands down. So much to do both modern and historic that you could spend your whole trip to China just in Xian. No doubt about it I will return!",
          "These city walls run for 14km in a rectangular shape around old Xi'an but there are several entry and exit points so you can walk (or cyle) as much or as little of it as you like. It's a nice way to while away an hour or two without really providing anything in the way of",
          "It is nicer than the great wall. Went there twice. one time walking and the second rode a bike around the entire wall. You cant rent the bikes on the wall. Beautiful views at night as well",
          "A really beautiful surrounding the mini gardens a lovely and quaint. It is very quiet in the night hence recommend to visit at night",
          "Long and nice wall for sightseeing, and walking around the wall. Can be crowded from time to time, especially holidays.",
          "Well I am perhaps a little overreacting.But you must keep in mind that it is the only preserved city wall, in China.We were delighted.",
          "In extension is much smaller than the great wall, but is much larger for the troops It is close to the city and the parts that survived are very well conserved.",
          "The central attraction of Xi'an this wall is visited by locals and tourists alike. While the walk can be uneven it is well worth watching ones step to appreciate the history and the view. Locals are very friendly and welcoming smiles were everywhere. Huge crowds were in the busy",
          "Visited City Wall and hired two cycles for maximum time. Please note. the roading on top of wall is \"cobblestones\" and some are sealed between cobbles but majority are hard to cycle on as 'bumpy' and juddery on body. We both took our own padded cycle shorts and changed into",
          "The city walk is the oldest remaining part of Xi'an middleage . It s huge and impressive beautiful at day and night times as we went both times. If you intend to walk long way you need to know it s at least 3.5 km before you can go out . Not enough exits and entrances The",
          "My husband and I biked the Xi'an City Wall when we visited in September. We rented a bike and it took us a little under 2 hours to go the full distance of the wall. The bikes are not in fabulous shape, so make sure you free yourself of other obstacles (like a large purse) so",
          "Enjoyed very much.it was educational and gave us great eal of insight Into China's history. The soldiers were amazing",
          "We really liked this walk between the South and West gates. High enough to see everything wide enough to dwadle and take photos. Bike hire available.",
          "We've all heard of the Great Wall, but the Ancient Wall of Xian is a worthy addition to your travelling list. Get a bike and cycle the 16km perimeter along the city wall. See the bell & drum towers which were used to indicate time. Allow at least 2hrs, probably a bit more.",
          "This wall is stunning. It is completely intact and very wide. You can even hire bicycles and cycle completely around is 11 km length if you wish.",
          "The city wall was very impressive, but the buggy rides offered were only for one side of the wall. It would have been great if there was a round trip with explanation. The buggy driver was extremely impatient and unfriendly.",
          "It is incredible to see the thickness of the walls, it's most impressive. One can cycle along the wall or go on a golf cart which was fun. The view is of the city which wasn't terribly thrilling but being on the historical wall was fascinating. The buildings on the inside of",
          "Just great fun hiring an old bike and cycling between gates. A complete city wall adds to the experience. We enjoyed the views and the exercise!",
          "For 54RMB you can climb up to the top and enjoy a walk along the 9 mile wall. Great views! For free you can admire the Gates, or walk along the moat walk with its guardhouses, all spectacularly lit at night. Definitely a highlight of Xi\u2019an.",
          "Visited the wall on a Misty day...but looked like a black and white paintings with blobs of reds here and there!Fascinating!",
          "Xian is an amazing city and the old city wall is truly awesome. If you can, walk or cycle parts or as much of it as you can. Its beautiful. And if you are there in the evening, the Bell and the Drum Towers are beautifully lit up.",
          "I walked close to 3.5 hours to complete it. I couldn't find the exit when i wanted to! I didn't cycle cos it looked bumpy and the rides old. I think it looks nicer at night. And would recommend sitting the trams for 80 RMB right from the start. Some parts are really nice and",
          "Climb up to the city wall and biking around the city wall. Watch the city wall beautiful lighting effect during the night, you will never regret it.",
          "We visited the city wall after seeing the terra-cotta warriors. While there, our tour guide arranged for us to have a tai chi lesson, which was great. But there is really nothing special nor spectacular about this site.",
          "This is a must-do when in Xi'an. Even if you don't have too much time, its worth it. We had only an hour and a half, but starting from the South Gate you can go a kilometer in either direction and get a taste of the old city on one side and the new one on the other. Sandwiches",
          "Walled cities were commonplace historically bit to see a wall intact and insuch a good state of preservation is exciting. If only the walls could talk. It is possible to hire a bike and cycle along the path at the top of the wall.",
          "One of the main highlights in Xi'An. You can walk on the walls, cycle or take a mini van! We visited the walls as part of a tour (through Travel China Guide).",
          "We decided not to cycle so our guide brought us to the south gate. Late afternoon or during the golden hour, is a good time to take a stroll as you may chance upon wedding couples on photography shoots. We caught a bride, resplendent in her red Chinese wedding outfit and it",
          "When we visited the wall, unfortunately it was raining, so decided to take the large golf cart. The views of the surrounding areas and the inner city were very good, especially all of the wonderful roof lines. The wall is lit up with yellow lights following its great shape at",
          "Got to the wall which is like a very mini Great Wall. LOL We did the 10 mile bike ride around the wall which is a lot larger than one would think. Great views of the city from each rampart point. The Great Wall has thousands of irregular steps and this was mostly flat.",
          "Took recommendation and hired a bike to go round walls on. Bike was dubious but was lot of fun and could see a lot more. Walls are very impressive and beautifully lit at night",
          "Xian is one among these hundreds of endless towns in China, but it's a special one: an old chinese capital. Nearby, the Terracotta warriors show this, and in Xian it's the fantastic medieval wall around the old town. Many people use the top of the wall for walks or hikes or",
          "This 600 year old wall built to protect the old town is best visited with a tour guide. We also drove around half the wall in a buggy which is the best way to see this architecture. Worth doing whilst in Xi\u2019an.",
          "I rented a bike and rode south to north towers round trip. A tour guide suggested I do this because there\u2019s a no bike zone on the East side before you get to the south tower bike drop off. You have to walk your bikes down and around and it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle to me but it",
          "Great View and lot of cultural activity while you visit. A favorite wedding photo spot. A guide to share the history is good but for the most part, just walk around and observe the city sights and people.",
          "This is one of the main attractions at Xi'an. The walls and buildings are impressive. You can take long walks along the top of the wall with nice city views. However, that's about it. At appointed times a few warriors in traditional costume march around, but don't really do",
          "After an amazing visit of the Terracotta Warriors, Xi'an city walls were a welcome moment for me. The area is vast and I didn't expect such a long private walk. Unfortunately all of the exits were closed off. I would have liked to stop to see the Guagren lamastery and temple.",
          "The walk/climb up to the old City Wall was very interesting, with the approach subway arcade featuring many photos of visits from dignitaries around the world. From the North Tower access on the wall, you can see down the main street to the South Tower in the distance. It is",
          "It was a bit pricey, and during summer HOT! There wasn't much to do, and the smog made views during the day a little rough. The activities on the wall early and late were neat to watch _ ti chi etc.The lights at night were beautiful, though many hotels inside the city walls gave",
          "It's fun and not too crowded to cycle all the way round the walls. The bikes for hire are fine. Great views of old and new cityscapes.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. See the old town inside the wall and the massive buildings outside the wall. You can walk / bike ride or even electric cart around the wall. It\u2019s was a rainy overcast day when we went but it still was lovely to see.",
          "Unless you are just into bicycle riding there isn't much to see. The lights at night are nice enough but I guess I just missed the point.",
          "Very nice and beautiful place. Would recomnend visitors to visit the place. Try to go during autumn or winter to experience the scenery.",
          "One of those must see things, but a huge fuss about very little. We spent only about 20 minutes here - it was very hot. You an cycle along the wall, but not much to see. The Xian skyline is not that great.",
          "We had a beautyfull morning, walking on the wall, wich is 13 km long. We only made at short walk an saw many interesting things. People making gynmastik in a park. People getting their hair cut and market.",
          "We spent about an hour trying to figure out where we could up on it... then when we finally figured it out, about 9:15 p.m., found out that it closed at 9:00. Very frustrating. Maybe if we spoke Chinese it would have been much easier. The people tried to help us, but there was a",
          "This city wall has a long history and it's a must do for me. We walked only on one part of the wall from the South Gate as it is such a hot day.",
          "This is definitely worth an hour of your time if you are in Xi\u2019an. It is pleasant to walk along the walls and see the city below. It seems more relaxing than the rest of the city. Be warned there are a number of steps to walk up to see the city walls. Worth a visit",
          "Entering the gate into a square,you can walk up lots of steps to alevel walkway,very wide along the walls,decend at each ending,the views are good on a clear day viewing street life below,we spent one and a n hour here,that was enough,walking,but dodgeing electric tour",
          "Well preserved with an interesting history. A must for visiting tourists. Just stroll around or ride a bike.",
          "We started at the South Gate and walked around to the West Gate. A leisurely walk with stops for pictures took about and hour and a half. Getting a cab at the West Gate proved a bit challenging because of rush hour and construction. But we got one eventually after walking a bit.",
          "An evening walk on the night of the sponsored half marathon round the wall - very crowded - and it looked brilliant when lit up.",
          "While in Xi'an a visit to the City Wall is a must. The Wall is very well restored. I don't remember it was accessible 30 years ago when I was the very first time in Xi'an. Whenever time permits I recommend not only to take a walk on the City Wall, but to hire a bike for 3 hours.",
          "Xi an wall was lit up and I enjoyed the view from my hotel window at night (Titan Hotel). Our tour guide, Gao was very knowlegable about the history of the dynasties and told us legends of the various emperors that added so much more colour to the historical site. Through out",
          "This is really a must see even if you are in town for only 1 day. Get on top of the city wall. Its SO wide! We rode bikes (they have tandem!) around about 1/4 of the wall. So much to see from up there. Do it!",
          "Now this was a great experience. Riding a bike on the city wall was truly something unique. You can ride along the wall for a couple of stations and pay only for the distance you've ridden or you can go around the whole wall, which is not too far about 14 Km. For the non-bikers,",
          "Cycle available for rent once you are on wall - was around 35 yuan. Takes 1.5 hours for doing the full wall. If the weather is good then can be a good experience",
          "Although only a small section of the wall remains it is a must visit. You can cycle round or take a golf trolley. Compare both sides of the wall. The old with the new.",
          "am amazing insight into the culture of china and its people who have come a long way in only 30 years..",
          "The massive construction of such a fortification was way ahead of its time way back then. Interesting construction and defensive measures taken to protect the kingdom. Like everything about China, this is another example of how advanced the Chinese were and are.",
          "This is well worth a visit. There are a few steps at the start but the views and experiencing the wall are well worth it. You can hire cycles and ride the wall, we also so a small trolley going around. There was even a coffee shop up there.",
          "Very nice walk. We only walked one length of the wall but nice walk. Lovely photos. You can take a cart around rather then walking which is good if you want to go around the whole wall. Looks beautiful with all the lights at night. Cheap excursion. Toilets along the way. Took us",
          "If you\u2019re going to visit this impressive wall, give yourself enough time for either a long walk or even a bike ride round the entire length. I say this because the entrance is equivalent to six or seven pounds each l. Obviously reconstructed but this is the original wall. Great",
          "The wall is neither high nor very old, and has very little history or actually anything worth seeing about it. It\u2019s quite a nice way to see the city if you can endure the baking heat and total absence of shade but at about $11 per person it just ends up feeling like another way",
          "It is worth to rent a bicycle to ride on the walls of the ancient city. The ride is 13.74 kms and ypu will be able to see a birds eye view of the entire ancient city and what lie just outside the wall.",
          "The Xi\u2019an city wall has been beautifully restored and is must see part of any visit to the city. The walls encompass the old city and cover some 14km. You can walk or rent a bike to travel the wall. Sadly we didn\u2019t have time on this trip, but will return to walk the wall in",
          "Unlike other Chinese cities, X\u2019ian made the good decision (I think) to maintain this wall in its entirety. 14km is the length of the wall with 4 entry points being the original North, South, East and West. The city have built 13 more entry points for roads through the wall to",
          "Great morning spent cycling round the walls of Xi'an. Takes about 90 mins although you have the bikes for 3hrs.",
          "The locals call this the Ming Wall. It is massive and a guide would be helpful to interpret the military significance of parts of the wall. It is well-maintained and one can imagine how it must've been like back in the day.",
          "Xian city wall is best done at night. we toured with odynovo on a private tour. our guide fille was excellent. she suggested we see the wall at night. it was great. all the lights were on and it was amazing. we went back during the day, and it was not the same",
          "Rent a bike and ride some or all of the wall; it's a good way to get a feel for the scope of the wall, the history and to be above the city... The bikes are pretty well worn but they work.Don't forget your hat and sunscreen if you go in summer. Lots of steps and walking.",
          "Most well preserved city walls from the Ming era. Worth a walk during the day, photos of the walls at night with lights lit are spectacular.",
          "It is a good way to get a different perspective of Xi'an from above. You can rent bicycles and ride around the wall. It is large so would probably not be needed to cycle the whole way around, but it is nether less worth it. There are different watch towers and also pagodas",
          "Just returned from a 6 days trip to Xian. Stay was too long as there was no scheduled flight back. Had Mary as our guide, based on favourable review on this website. No regrets, she's friendly, chatty, knows her stuff like the back of her palm. Have visited China many times.",
          "If in Xi'an must go to the city wall. If you have a chance, ride a bicycle or rent a golf cart to tour the top of the wall.",
          "We went all around by bike. It is 14 kilometers and 12 meters tall. The views of old and new city are great.",
          "These are nicely maintained and very substantial walls. But it was very hot up there, with little shade. No one was inclined to walk far or hire a bike in that heat. But pricing! ! Almost the same as Forbidden City or the Great Wall!!! That's way way overstating their",
          "We spent about 2 hours around the south gate area. It was a blazing hot day so be prepared with hats or a brolly as there aren't that many shady areas. I thoroughly enjoyed the walk and the scenery from the wall. The views were quite magnificent.",
          "This is a great walk around the wall to do. Take your time and look around the city from height. There is a show here weekly but you need to book in for it. Subway is close by so easy to get to",
          "It takes less than 2 hours to ride a rental bike around the entire 8K of this remarkable wall. It's worth doing the whole thing to get the full appreciation of its scale and design. Be advised that halfway through you turn in your bike, walk about 1/4 mile along the wall armed",
          "We had a short walk along the wall and then hired bikes and cycled along - very easy to do and quite fun. There are places to buy a drink along the way ion a very hot day or take your own. Easy cycling (I am a 50 year old woman and not a cyclist!); flat and not very bumpy, the",
          "The last city with remaining wall. It is a sight to see and to walk on this history is amazing! There are many shops and eateries just be prepared to do a lot of walking!",
          "Most impressive set of complete city walls that I've ever seen - massively thick, allowing a three lane highway width on the top ! Hiring a bike was easy from the South Gate - charge of about 20CNY each bike - 25CNY for a tandem - for 3 hours. 100CNY (\u00a38/9USD) returnable",
          "We toured China and spent time on top of the City wall during our time in Xi'an. The wall is restored and easily walkable (or bike-able). Unfortunately for us, it had rained and all the bike rental places were closed so we could only walk. Really nice views both inside to the",
          "The walk is very nice though crowded. The ticket is expensive but worth it. There are bikers also, so sometimes difficult to walk for people on foot. There should be a lane for bikers or special hours..... There are shops around to buy coke etc...",
          "It's was my 2nd times to Xi'an. Missed to visit City Wall during my 1st visit. This time, I managed to come here, paid some $$ to fuifill my dream to cycling on City Wall. 4KM cycling journey to experience the beauty of Xi'an. Suggest you to visit there during Spring.",
          "The wall is a rectangle 14 klm and our guide told us holds a population within the wall of 17 million if you count the suburbs outside the total would be 30 million people, this is mind blowing for those of us from Australia. Well worth the climb up stairs to view this",
          "Not overly impressed with this one, as basically, it's just a perimeter wall around the city. If I had to visit it again, I would hire one of the local bikes on offer and cycle it, but apart from that, nothing special here..",
          "Just rent a bike and spend some time on the top of the walls. Enjoy the views, happy people! The ride is very easy but count with roughly 16 km.",
          "This is neat Walk the wall or get a bike on top and cycle around. If you want a helmet you had best bring your own or buy one over there Great experience and easy walk. Just check before exit points. Some of the exits are closed off",
          "Going at night would be ideal for the city lights are fantastic. But even in the afternoon, and quite hot gave us a special feel of the wall and its city surrounds. Some took a bicycle for an even more exciting experience.",
          "The wall opens st 8am. We were there right at 8. We were practically on the wall alone. It was so quiet and peaceful. They play zen music through speakers. It was a wonderful way to start my day. We also had the opportunity to see people doing morning exercises in many places",
          "The city walls are spectacular and it\u2019s easy as pie to pay the entrance fee (at the South Gate for example) then walk up and find the bike hire place (usually one at each gate). It\u2019s currently 45RMB to rent a bike for three hours (I think tandems are 90). The bikes are a bit",
          "Beijing has the Great Wall but Xi'an has the complete wall still exiting. At night when the lights come on it is really something to see. There is so much history on this wall and with the inner city still maintaining to the height standard it makes everything that much better.",
          "We road bikes on the wall and we\u2019re able to see a lot of the city. Make sure you head in the direction of the moat for the best views.",
          "My family visited there on June 23 afternoon. It\u2019s great place to seeing ancient dynasty city wall. It\u2019s one of the must visit place in Xi\u2019an.",
          "While my husband wanted to bike on the wall around its entirety, I was not up to the challenge and I think the views would have been pretty repetitive. We started at the South Gate and walked along to the East Gate. Along the way there are refreshment and bike vendors. Bikes and",
          "Loved the cycling trip and City wall . It's beautiful and very nicely maintained . The contrast between old and new city is beautifully maintained .",
          "To see if you have enough time. it is possible to rent bicycles on get up on electric buses.All the visit is almost 40 Km but you can do also only a small section",
          "The Xi'an City Wall is built around a good chunk of the city. I would highly recommend renting a bike if you plan on going around the wall. I would also recommend not going during Golden Week. This wall becomes a wall of tourist and even renting the bike becomes more of a hassle",
          "Simply Wow!!! So much history this wall has been carefully restored and is fantastic, we walked from the South Gate to the East gate and back taking in the museum, well worth the 100rmd the wall is 14 km can be walked but it was 37c on the day we were there, bike are for hire",
          "14 kms long, you can walk, bike... Pretty quiet and relaxing up there - but super hot in summer time.",
          "We walked around a little of the City Wall and we ended up taking a small golf cart trolley cart around the wall. We enjoyed our day here",
          "We took a bullet train from Beijing to Xian, 6 hrs. The next morning we were driven, 1.5 hrs. to the Warriors. MANY people, cars, traffic and noise! Not something Midwesterners from America are used to. However, this was an INCREDIBLE sight to see. We opted to hire a local",
          "Massive structure, beautifully restored. a good walk around the old city, you can hire a bicycle too if walking is too much!",
          "Love the city wall because it was not crowded when we visited. It is magnificent and well maintained. We took a ride on the tourist tram round the wall to save time. The tram stopped at various spot and towers for viewing and photo-taking. After the tram we sat down to enjoy",
          "It is a good way to get a glimpse of the city. We were supposed to cycle on the wall. The wall is wide enough and level to do so. But unfortunately it was too cold that day and we were unprepared to handle the cold so we just walked.",
          "The Xi\u2019an City Wall is a great way to see the city. You can go all the way around the city on top of the wall, there are great views everywhere. We rented bikes, a great way to experience the wall. It takes a long time to go around so the bikes are a good way to go. Make sure",
          "When you do ride a bike, make sure they air up the tires, and don't go in the heat of the day. It will take almost 3 hours to ride around the whole wall because you have to get off at one point, cross, and then come back on. There are some little vendors all across the wall,",
          "We spent a lovely morning here (our tour company TCT has also organised a Tai Chi lesson) & we would have happily spent all day to walk the length had we had more time in Xi\u2019an",
          "Xian is an ancient city and is protected by the walls around the city.You can get up there and take a stroll or rent a bicycle and cycle the whole entire surrounding of the city(very big area).It is so well preserved and in the evening ;place is lighted up :it is beautiful",
          "It is wide and offers some great views into and out of the city center. It's definitely a more mellow activity after the crowds of the Terracotta Warriors and Huaqing Palace.",
          "The whole city wall is still intact. It is fun, you can rent individual or tandem bikes and bike the whole thing, about 8 miles or so. Cost about 150 yuan per bike plus a deposit of about 50 yuan that you get back at the end. You get the bike for around 2-3 hours. It is also",
          "One of the only complete city walls and to walk on it gives a good view of the city You can rent bicycles on the wall and there are places to purchase drinks on the wall. Worth doing",
          "The walk along the city wall is amazing. The wall is so big that one easily forgets it\u2019s a wall we are walking on! Amazingly well kept and it showcased the times of the warring states in centuries past. At night it is lit up and what a spectacular scene! Well worth seeing . I",
          "Went there in Dec last year. Quite a nice view looking down at the city from the wall. However, it was way too cold to even complete 300m of distance. The chilling wind was howling and 'cut' your face. The chill went right into your bones. Even the locals couldn't take the cold!",
          "8.2 kilometres of intact city wall which you can walk or cycle around or if joining at the South Gate there a golf caddies that can take you around. Not all of the gates accessing the wall have cycles for hire",
          "Although doing this 2 hour biking around the city wall during summer is a very tiring and sweat breaking experience it is still worth it. Especially when travelling with young children, this is a nice activity. The bikes can be rented / returned at several points. The ride all",
          "Amazing to walk the City Wall. Clean and beautiful! Loved all the lanterns. At night the lights are switch on - such a pretty picture!",
          "We cycled around the city wall. I highly recommend this way of visiting the Xi'an City Wall. The perimeter is about 14 km. Along the way you pass the four main gates, and some watchtowers.",
          "Don't know how to start reviewing this place :) The fact that walls are 14 kilometers long is amazing alone, not to mention everything else there. Walls are more than 10 meters high and wide, so you can rent a bicycle and ride along, which is amazing experience! Don't miss to",
          "Group touring can be cumbersome and frustrating. Two of us skipped the arranged evening activity and took advantage of the City Wall bike rental. Peddling along the wall, we were able to observe city activity, stretch out legs and feel wind in our faces on a hot night. We were",
          "You can walk, push-bike, or ride a golf cart along the top of the wall. It's as wide as a six lane highway between the gates, and even wider at the gates and courtyards. It's an engineering masterpiece, and has to be seen to fully appreciate ancient building skills.",
          "This is so cool to go up onto this ancient city wall. Not only does it give you a beautiful view of the city, but it's a great place just to walk and view the beauty of Xi'an. I enjoyed it in the evening when it was cooler and several in our group rented bikes and biked the",
          "This is nice looking place at sunset time. The wall and drumm tower is nicely lighted. You can rent a bicycle and drive at wall.",
          "Took us a while to find the correct entry point but when we did we were very happy. Toilets were clean, signage was good and there were regular places to eat and drink. The scale of the wall is amazing. It was a very hot day so I regret that we did not come back at night as",
          "Took an evening stroll along the wall, which is well-preserved. There are several interesting night spots along the way.",
          "The best view is from outside at night , it is not really good view from the top, ridiculous expensive compared with other tourist spot around China , imagine it is almost the same price as forbidden city and the Great Wall",
          "City wall is highly impressive and an unmissable spot to visit. The view was amazing. The bicycle ride was exhilarating.",
          "This was an unexpected visit for our tour group when our itinerary needed to be adjusted due to weather that caused flight delays. We only did part of the wall (4 miles) and were given the option to ride a bike or golf cart. While I opted for the golf cart, I wish I had ridden",
          "The city wall is very wide and fairly long.There is a bike rental place and it's fun to take a ride. If you are over 60 don't tell them. Otherwise they have no insurance for you and won't let you ride!",
          "A fascinating place. Walk on the walls. There are bikes and golf buggies as well. Great view of Xian.",
          "Drove through it.not much to say it is there.it surrounds to city center. You supposedly can walk it. I would take a bike.",
          "We went late in the day and rented bikes to go around the 13.7km wall. Wonderful views. This a must see when in Xi\u2019an.",
          "Rent a bike and ride the city wall in the evening. See the sunset and then wait for the lighting up of the city wall and its nearby building.",
          "I didn\u2019t want to miss what our guide indicated is the only remaining city wall standing. It is so neat to learn about the history of why the wall was built and how. Love that you can rent bikes to traverse the whole 9 ish miles. It\u2019s a very bumpy ride though. Loved the visual",
          "We bought a ticket to go up at the South Gate. We went up around 19:00 and it wasn\u2019t too busy. The view with the sun setting was lovely. We walked around a bit until we came to the bike rentals. You\u2019ll see the bikes first, and then the ticket office is just past the bike",
          "We visited the Ancient City Wall in the late afternoon and it\u2019s unreal, we hired a bike and rode around the wall. It has some wonderful views and by the time we finished our ride it was dark and the lights were fantastic. Would recommend this place to anyone and they will have a",

          "The 4 sides of the City Wall is about 13-14km, and hire a bicycle (on top of the Wall) to go one round at leisure pace is the best way to take in the very different views all around the 4 sides or around the City. There are signs of what next to the Wall, & it's informative. It",

          "Our guide suggested a bike ride around on the old Xian City Wall. It turned out to be a highlight of our trip. The ride took about two hours but it was easy riding - flat and wide street. There were cafes and bathrooms along the way. A perfect way to see the city. Highly",
          "Travelled to Xi'an on a private tour and was taken to the City Wall. When you go onto the city wall or into the Gate House and look out, you can get a feel for the ancient Xi'an and the modern city it has become. I was lucky enough to have this attraction all to my self which",
          "This was one of the best experience in Xi\u2019an! Our group rented bikes and toad around the city wall.

          "This was a great site to see while exploring the city of Xi'an. There's lots of preserved history and it gives you a great visual of what was once there in the city of Xi'an. There are quite a bit of old buildings on the wall and different weapons they used for defense. Here",
          "Great place to visist and imagine how life would have been centuries ago with great views of the city. If possible dont miss cycling on top of the city wall. That adds a truly different pespective to the whole experince.",

          "We approached the City Walls with some expectations from the various reviews read prior to the visit, and WOW, a picture paints a thousand words indeed. Absolutely beautiful and grand site with amazing views. The sheer size of the walls within means the vast number of visitors",
          "The city wall in Xi'an is the only complete wall left in China. It has been beautifully restored & worth the visit. We wandered a small portion as we didn't have time to walk the full circuit & it was hot! There were good information plaques to read at various points",

          "We chose to walk around the city wall of Xi'an. It covers about 15km and is the most complete city wall left in China. It is very wide and well-kept. The different buildings on the wall are interesting but the real reason to go is to walk the wall!",
          "A great day .However our tour guide didnt give us enough time to explore which was very disappointing as the group hired bikes and were really having a great time. The place itself is another example of how China operates with a great story . Another must do",

          "It gives you a good feeling walking around the city walls in Xian which is one of the few cities in China where they still exist. It would be fun to hire a tandem and cycle around the walls but unfortunately when we visited there was a nasty wind so cycling was out of the",
          "What a lovely walk around the walk. Great views, beautiful lanterns. You can hire a bike and ride around but no need to. Avoid getting food or drink up there as crazy expensive.",
          "I new that we were going to ride bicycles on this city wall. But the sheer size of it made this a real adventure. For 1,5 hours in the blistering sunshine we all were just tired. And for Dutch people who are used to cycle every day that says something. But a really beautiful",
          "Rent a bike and cycle the 14km all around the old city wall - what a nice way to see the city, old and new, guardhouses, 4 main gates, etc.",
          "Encircling the rectangled city center of Xi'an, it has totally 18 city gates, but they are not all open for visitors. Visitors can ascend the Wall from the South Gate, Small South Gate, East Gate, West Gate, North Gate, Heping Gate, Wenchang Gate and Hanguang Gate. You can",
          "The evening view is amazing. We rented a bicycle from 7pm and managed to get the day, evening and night views. It takes approximately 2 hours to cycle through all 4 sides of the wall. The surface can be quite bumpy and the rented bike had quite some resistance, hence the whole",
          "Xi'an is the :Cultural Heart\" of China. The city. comes alive at night The building pictured here is ablaze with colour after dark. What you're seeing now is another in a long line of \"tourist cell phone shots\", Bring a REAL camera and a tripod! I will try to post photos in",
          "Is was so awesome to see a structure built so long ago and still looking the way it is. Walked around alot of it and some stunning views",
          "This complete city wall is truly an experience to be had. Pay attention to the history and purpose of this wall and take your time traversing it. Look at the stones of the floor and you will see dating on some of them back to the 1800's. Enjoy the view of the surrounding city",
          "Apparently this is the only complete city wall remaining in China. If we had had more time it would have been good to walk round it more. Prettily lit up at night.",
          "This is the most complete ancient city wall in China. Entrance ticket is RMB 54. We get up from the south gate. It'll be hard to tour the whole city wall by walking. Recommended to rent a bike and it will easier.",
          "We went to the south gate of the wall where we could easily rent bikes, paying with cash (45 yuan per bike). Really great to take the tour on top of the amazing ancient city wall (14 km.). Nice views over the city. It sends you back in time and at the same time you could see",
          "We spent only an hour exploring one section of the wall, very interesting information to read about the wall and why it was built. Next visit I would consider hiring a bike to ride the perimeter.",
          "Others have written extensively but the city wall iscertainly worth the effort to visit. The south entrance is possibly the best with moat intact. We spent an hour at both the western and southern. The entire perimeter ( approx 13.7 km) is in good condition not simply keeping a",
          "We entered the wall at the West Gate at 4.30pm, and hired bikes to go around the wall. It was very easy, and self explanatory. A storm built up while we were there, and it was very dusty, but this added to the experience. Quite a long way between shelters, so beware if you get",
          "It is amazing to walk around the xian city wall and knowing it is from the Ming Dynasty times. Built around 1370. It is about 75 easy steps to the top, an easy climb and well worth it. Good view over both the old and new Xian townships. There is a pretty garden around it where",
          "Great for the entire family! The Xi'an city wall forms a barrier around the old city, it is a 13.7 kilometer rectangle and has a deep moat in front of it. The wall was used for protection and was completed by the first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty in the 1300's! There are",
          "The wall is excellent. We started the day with a Tai Chi lesson at the base of the main entrance and then spent a little time walking through the park adjoining it watching the locals, strolling, 'square' dancing, singing or playing ping pong. We then went up onto the wall",
          "The wall is huge. At least 13 kilometers around so to see it all the extra 45 rmb for 3 hours is well worth it. It is a pleasant way to avoid the crowds while riding between the North and South gates. If you rent your bike anywhere but the South Gate, you will have to turn it in",
          "Great walk or bike ride on the wall. Perfect place for photos as you look around the city of Xian. Friendly people and not as crowded as Beijing or Shanghai.",
          "It is nice that they have renovated the wll around the old city of Xian. For us it was not more than a wall with gates.",
          "Contrary to my expectations about Xi\u2019an as a \u201csmaller\u201d town in China, its a bustling city complete with 4-lane roads and large brand name stores! The wall is a nice reprieve, no vehicles allowed and a pleasant breeze. The most pleasant experience was when they refunded us for",
          "Concur with views of Larry C (2 days ago). The wall has been \"restored\" meaning recreated as a memorial to the incident in 1643AD. We looked around the area by the main gate area only as on a package tour so not enough time to hire a bike (members of our group tried to hire a",
          "Xi'an used to exist as a smaller city with a wall with multiple gates at the end of the silk road. We were able to go through one of the gates and wander along parts of the wall. It's a cool place. On the wall you can see a huge bell that was previously used to sound alarms and",
          "Xi'an has such a long and amzing history that I was not aware of before this trip. In a sense, this was the other end of the Silk Road. I would love to come back to Xi'an for a week or two and just explore the wall, and museums and archeological sites..",
          "The thought of visiting this wall was one of the reasons for going to Xi'an, after all this is the wall that enclosed the original capital city of China and this is where the silk road started, so we are told. However, this is such an anti climax, it looks so modern it is hard",
          "Thrilled to walk on an ancient city wall that I see only in movies. Tried to imagine how it protected the city in case of invasion. Locals are lucky to have it now for recreation and enjoyment - walking, jogging, biking or simply viewing. .",
          "Cycling the city wall of Xi'an was fun - great way to get a sense of the city & its fortification. Flat cycle, comfortable bikes - didn't need gears. Well worth the effort",
          "we rent the bicycle at night, and round the whole wall.. around 2 hour to finish it. almost 14km to cycle and very fun & enjoy",
          "We joined the city walls at South Gate. These are seriously substantial walls as there are a lot of steps leading up from street. Once on the wall it's really wide, like a big street, and bicycle hire is available. We found the road surface of cobblestone quite awkward to walk",
          "Xian is the old capital of China. Ancient City Wall is the best preserved city wall of China. Wonderful to stroll around or take a cycle for hire to complete the circle of 14 kilometers. The wall is 12 meters high and 18 meters wide and well maintained. While strolling you can",
          "Super easy to get around the entire wall. We rented bikes on the wall at the South Gate and did the perimeter. It was about 8.5 miles. Fun!",
          "A walk around the city wall.. A hot day. Went with a tour group but took only a few pictures of the surrounding",
          "You can spend as little or as long as you want. I had fun taking pictures of at least 3 brides there for their \"Wedding Pose\". It is another fascinating look at Chinese Customs and culture.",
          "Couldn't imagine how on earth did the Chinese built this. Even on bicycle, round trip is not an easy task.",
          "One of the must visit sites in Xian but if you intend to complete the city wall by walking...you need to set aside at least 3 to 4 hours. It\u2019s approximately 15km or so...",

          "We walked on the top of the wall during the morning but also drove by it at night time. During the day the wall provides great views of the city, especially along the moat. There are also small shops. At night time the wall and the pagodas are lit up thus providing",
          "We walked endlessly on the city walls. Our starting checkpoint had no bike stations. Please choose your starting checkpoint where bikes are available. Rental rate is CNY45 per bike, start after breakfast or after lunch. It\u2019s good that they don\u2019t retain our passports for the",
          "Amazing construct of a wall to protect the city from enemies or attacks. The wall was well maintained with some new bricks. It\u2019s approximately 13km in distance and one can rent a bike all over the city wall.",
          "Entered through one of the old gateways into the old city, east access up steps to the walls which gave good views of the old city and the new tower blocks.",
          "I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect with the wall. I have been to York and thought it might be like a section of the wall but wider. The reality is, it\u2019s a 16km solid, wide, fairly well maintained castle for all intents and purposes. Think the Great Wall, but flat. We hired bikes and",

          "Xi\u2019an City Defence Wall was ok, nice to see it still standing and in good repair though. One can walk it for 4 hours free; problem was we had an hour only. Bike around in less but pay (bumpy on the cobbles) and enjoy the view. One side lots of trees, the other prettier was the",
          "This was an amazing walled city. If you get a chance rent a bike and bike around the wall. It will make you feel young again and the view of the city is wonderful. It's an easy peddle. Go got it.",
          "The Xi'an City Walls are touted as being 600 years old - in actual fact they're almost an entirely modern rebuild.Saying that, they still look pretty cool and ancient and there are lots of oldie-worldie turrets and towers to explore. You can even rent a bike and ride around",
          "Take a bicycle is worth it. We really enjoy it, and in the night was amazing, we took the bicycles around 18 and stay until 21:30.",
          "This is a really nice way to see the city at a slight elevation. You can walk various sections of it and exit without having to do a full circuit. You can also cycle around it with a bike for a quicker experience. You can purchase a combination ticket for the wall and museum",
          "The city wall is a lovely place to walk, gives you a great view of the town, you can hire a bicycle to ride along the wall, a few stalls along the top, very easy to walk along and in good condition, we went with a tour, if I ever went back, would like to walk the whole wall,",
          "We went here on a very sunny day, which was super nice. Though it was during the national holidays, a lot of people. But the wall is quite big so we still had space. We decided not to walk around the whole wall, you can if you want; but it's a long walk. This is not the actual",
          "During the Ming Dynasty, Xi\u2019an was once the capital of China, and protected by the 12-metre high, 12 to 14 metres in width, fortified wall protecting an area of 14 square kilometres. The width and relatively flat surface allowed for the quick movement of troops to any required",
          "Great place, easy to walk around and look at the old fortress which is in good condition in the middle of town. Small enough to walk around/through yet it is an imposing wall to keep the city safe. The architecture is 'brutal' but significant and it is interesting that buildings",
          "Really recommend walking around at least part of the wall. Great views of Xian as well as the wall itself. A welcome relief from the crowds - you could really stride out.",
          "An absolute blast. 14km circuit around the town wall. Basically all-flat but bumpy. You don\u2019t even need to be in good shape. Best part; you can grab a beer when you return your bike! Do it.",
          "My daughter and I cycled round the walls - it is 14 kms I think - but it is flat. The views are amazing and you can really take in the atmosphere of this amazing structure. Well worth the effort.",
          "we were not taken to the city wall but we saw from distance as the time was not enough for us, Nice to see place",
          "Regarded initially as a potential demanding experience it proved to be pleasant and enjoyable. A little help from the sun, the quality of the rented bike, and a nice and serene atmosphere made the riding of the 13, 74 a thing to remember. Highly recommended",
          "We visited here on our tour, unexpected pleasant surprise. The Old City Wall is a great place to get a view of Xi'an from a different perspective. Unless you intend to walk a great portion of this wall, you will only need an hour or so to get a feel for it. Many tour groups",
          "A very impressive and massive structure, about 9 miles long and 46 feet wide. The wall has been rebuilt/reconstructed, but that doesn't take away the ancient feeling of this 600-year-old wall. The city wall is a excellent place to visit and allow yourself a couple of hours.",
          "Took a walk for about half of its length. It was crowded therefore we decided to skip the bike ride. It is was nice to see the city from the wall, however the wall itself is is quite similar except the gates. I guess you could stay away from the crowds if you go early in the",
          "Amazing way to see the city. Make sure it is not too hot as there is little shelter on top of the wall. Rent a bile and escape the crowds at the major gates. Stop for breaks along the way and bring water!",
          "The Xi'an City wall Is an amazing sight to see especially in the evenings as the sun sets and as the wall lights and lamps go on. The wall provides a beautiful opportunity to take a walk or bike ride with your friends or even solo as you enjoy scenic sights of the ancient builds",
          "The wall was much longer than I expected. If you don\u2019t have at least half day on it, you\u2019d better to hire a bicycle. We planed to walk to the next exit, it took us near one hour. Personally I don\u2019t think it is a must-see attraction, unless you do wish to see the old town in a",
          "Do the bicycle tour on the top of the wall. No traffic to contend with, and you get to look down on Xi'an from about 40 feet up. Look for the people excising in the park along the river front below you",
          "My wife and I visited Xi'an in Oct '17 and had the privilege to walk on the Old City Wall. It was so good, we had to return and so we did just a few weeks ago. This Old City Wall is so old, it is 40ft high, 12-14m wide at the top, with a 15-18m wide at the base. It is 14kms",
          "We rented bicycles to ride the 13.87 km around the top of the wall. This is a good way to get an overview of the city; you can see the old parts and the new parts and how they interact. It's also much faster than walking, leaving lots of time to see other fascinating things in",
          "Would\u2019ve liked to bike the wall but I didn\u2019t get a chance. Nicely restored wall. Impressive to see. Walk a section and take some photos",
          "I am glad the people in Xi\u2019an keep their wall. It was impressive and such a historical site. A must to see.",
          "We went there around 5pm - it was not too crowded - we rented bicycles and rode around the whole wall. Very. Ice time",
          "We biked on the top (about 1 hour for the entire route). The views are good and can see the entire city from a height.",
          "The city wall is a popular place for visitors and deservedly so. It was a busy and lively place with walkers and bike riders alike. The height of the wall makes for good views and a lot is going on around the wall, with ballroom dancers and a saxophone player adding to the",
          "... Xi'an City Wall is one of the oldest, largest and best preserved in all of China ... and if that isn't a good enough reason to visit ... it's also (or it was when we were there) a serene respite from Xi'an city. Myself and teen daughter visited the almost deserted city wall",
          "We only had about 50 minutes here, and toured with our own guide as part of an SNA tour. It was very interesting! You can hire a bike and ride the wall (the walls are very wide) or you can just walk around like we did.",
          "You can rent sinlge or tandem bikes on top of the wall at most of the main gates. We rented at the south gate. You must pay to get on to the wall and then you can pay to rent bikes. I think you get up to 3 hours with the bikes, but you won't need it. it's only around 14",
          "The city wall is most impressive - very wide and you can walk or rent a bicycle and ride all the way around. Lovely views and watch towers.",
          "We were looking forward to go cycling on the city wall with our kids, as recommended in previous reviews. However, only kids from 12 years and up are allowed! This was quite a disappointment for us and the kids! Still, it is nice to take a walk there and look at the ancient",
          "We did only spent a small time hear but that was all the time you needed. There is a couple of market stalls and not much else a building and a few photo opportunity. nice to see up close part of a tour but not the great wall.",
          "We travelled with three other families all with 11 year old girls - we hired bikes and rode the wall! Note: will take 1-1.5 hrs... must be physically fit - some toilets and kiosk to buy water on the way - is pretty bumpy ride on the old original stones... so be prepared!! But",
          "We arrived in Xi'an at night and the city wall was all lit up highlighting the massive size of this structure. We visited during the day and were not disappointed as the height offered us a great view of parklands and the city within the wall as well as the novelty of seeing",
          "What a great way to while away an afternoon. The wall is quite big and long so you can either walk it or grab a bike for a nice leisurely ride around. Our guide filled us in on the history surrounding us then we all explored different areas. Give yourself at least 2 hours here",
          "This is an amazingly wide wall but the views are not spectacular. Nice for a walk or cycle as a break from the rush of the city.",
          "It was an amazingly beautiful and warm day and we decided to rent bikes. We cycled around 3/4 of the wall in about 1.5hrs and it was so cool. Lots of things to see and nice spots to take photos. There were a few photo shoots going on and loved all the girls in their red dresses,",
          "Beautiful structure , intact .Transports you in time. Extends for 7 miles around downtown , has nice view.",
          "Our tour included stop at the City Wall. Information about the construction of the wall is helpful to fully appreciate it, so if you have a guide, that will make the visit more meaningful. It's big (there are steps....there are steps everywhere in China!!!!) and there aren't",
          "Most probably the best thing to do in Xian. Recommend to hire a bike and enjoy the scenery all around. Cheap and nice.",
          "A visit to the City Wall places you at the intersection of old Xi'an and new Xi'an. We rented bikes and it took about an hour to take a leisurely trek across the top of the wall. Because of construction, we had to dismount our bikes and start again a few hundred meters away;",
          "the only totally intact walled city. Great condition and well worth the walk Ride a bike if you cant wall the 14km",
          "The city wall is a centre piece of Xi\u2019an. It is also the number 1 ring road. We visited one section only and they were also doing maintenance on part of the moat. It would have been good to hire a bike and go around the whole circuit. A magnificent testimony to those who built",
          "I went there during winter and it was desertic which was actually really beautiful. It is a huge place and I wish I had taken a bike, I think it is a good idea to do so if you want to see more of it. It\u2019s nice to go with a guide so you can learn some history out of it!",
          "One does not find a lot of city walls both large enough and in good shape enough to ride around it on a bicycle, but this one is. Its roughly a 8.5 mile trip though on what is essentially trail bikes, so its not the most comfortable ride for that long a cycling. My suggestion",
          "Six hundred years old and looking like it was built yesterday. The wall is 14 km circumference of the inner city and it looks like it can be covered by bicycles available for rent. It is clear the Chinese cherish their heritage",
          "I\u2019ve actually been to the City Wall several times throughout the year. The top of the wall is quite wide where you can rent bikes and travel the entire wall around the city. Bright colorful lights accentuate the majority of the wall with places to shop or have a snack and",
          "This is an architectural wonder and a stunning place to visit. Hard to describe just how immense and powerful these walls are. There are so well preserved that you really do get a feel for the scale and size of what it must have been like back in the day. You could spend",
          "A beautiful old city. The city wall is amazing. You can hire bikes to ride all around the wall. A must see.",
          "Now this is not the Great Wall of China, but I tell you, it feels like you're walking along a wall of a castle, which of course its not. Its a great place to walk or cycle or just sit and look over the city, depends on which side you're sitting. There is something different",
          "I really enjoyed my walk along a section of this historical wall. It was amazing to see the old city fortress up close with the modern day buildings in the background. It is like stepping back in time.",
          "Since a portion of the wall was very close to our hotel we walked over to visit it. As walls go, it was in very good condition and worth the short walk.",
          "You can rent bikes single and tandem and bike the wall. it's like 16K all the way around and allows you to get great views of the inner city. As well as the Buddist temple. A lot of wonderful places to take pictures. This wall surrounds the city....amazing You can park 2 M1",
          "The wall has been rebuilt/reconstructed, but that doesn't take away the ancient feeling surrounding the wall. If you can, look up some information ahead of time or hire a tour guide, I learned a lot of interesting history surrounding the wall and why it was rebuilt. There are",
          "Xian was ancient capital of China. It was fortification fort the palace to protect from the enemies. It was built by Hongwu Emperor Zhu.",
          "The wall runs all round the center of the city and is quite a walk. We managed half of just one portion and it was too tiring in the hot sun. Luckily, there was a stall renting bicycles that were the beefier MTB type rather than the street ones and it came in handy on the",
          "Its well worth renting a bike (45RMB) so you can cover the whole of the city walls as they are 8 miles long.",
          "Massive wall of approximately 14kms. We did a round on the wall by bike in just over an hour. One of the fastest rounds apparently, but a very nice one. Not to much to see from the wall, guess it\u2019s even better strolling the the quarters. It\u2019s the experience that leads to the",
          "The city wall around Xi'an is very impressive. It is tall and wide. So large infact that there are bicycle rentals places to ride a bike and ride around the whole thing. Even with a bike it'll take an hour or so to get around the circumference (unless you are reaching.) Each",
          "Part of the wall built during Ming dynasty is still preserved. This is obvious if you enter from south gate. During day time, it could be very hot. Remember to bring along a hat or umbrella. Bike rental service is available. It's only 13.3km to circle the city wall once. During",
          "Enjoyed this part of our city tour by bicycle 13 kilometres ride on the 12 metre wide road on top of the wall. So well preserved and clean as is the whole city with wonderful medieval buildings and beautiful gardens.",
          "When you think about this wall and that it is over 600 years old, it is amazing! We walked around on the top of it for a while and then saw there was a bicyle rental place on top of it. If we had the time, we certainly would have done that. It would be a great way to see the",
          "Hard to imagine such construction built without modern machinery. Garrisons still intact. Although the cobble stones are worn, the wall and all of its gates are beautiful.",
          "We spent our last morning here with a local guide prior to taking the high speed train back to Beijing. Do not miss going here. It dates to the Ming Dynasty and there is so much history.",
          "It was great to see the only complete city wall existing. Climb up and the walk the whole circumference or just a bit- upto you. Its around 14km so after a while the views stop being a highlight but if you want to get off remember you can only do so at certain points so plan for",
          "Its a MUST see in Xian. This is what makes this city a unique travel point. 14 Km in diameter, 12 meters thick at the top level 18m at the ground level and 20 meters tall. Price: 54 RMB one day ticket for adult 90 RMB double bike !!deposit of 100 RMB for one bike!! 35 RMB",
          "My hotel was near an entrance to the city wall. I got some cash, bought a ticket, and hiked up the stairs to the top of the wall. It is about 9 miles around and all along the way are placards in Chinese and English describing places, people, and events pertinent to particular",
          "Rent a bike and go around the wall. it's a great trip. Make sure you take lots of water ! It should take you about an hour and a half ... but expect a good couple of hours as you'll surely stop many times to see what is happening on both sides of the wall",
          "I've walked sections of it twice, but my dream is to rent a bike and cycle the entire city wall. The wall is 12-14 meters wide at the top, so even a wobbly cyclist like me should be able to stay out of trouble. I estimate it should take less than an hour to cover the 8-mile",
          "This was an unexpected surprise on our tour of Xi'an. Very impressive & massive fortress walls, about 8.5 miles long and 46 feet wide. Very well preserved - a nice walk or bicycle ride offers great views of the gates, towers, and the city, as well as the park surrounding the",
          "The climb to the top was short. The view was clear. Some people were riding bikes or strolling along the top. Because of the height, it was possible to take some very photos of the city.",
          "We were all amazed at the size of the wall. It is set as a square with 4 gates, with the road running through the gate meeting in the centre. All roads inside the wall meet at the centre structure, (I can't remember what it is called).",
          "This can be done without a guide- plenty of walking or cycling with stunning views. It would take a few hours to cycle or walk the full perimeter so would recommend just selecting a portion to do. Easy to acces",
          "There isn't much to say about this place really. They are city walls after all. They are restored so they are nice and safe to walk around and have some funky cartoon statues which myself and my guide enjoyed taking pictures with.",
          "Nothing much to see but it will be interesting if you will imagine how it was when you hear the story/usage of the structure in the olden time.",

        "wiki": "Xi'an (UK:  shee-AN, US:  shee-AHN; Chinese: [\u0255\u00ed.\u00e1n] (listen)), also known as Sian, is the capital of Shaanxi Province. A sub-provincial city on the Guanzhong Plain in Northwest China, it is one of the oldest cities in China, the oldest prefecture capital and one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals, having held the position under several of the most important dynasties in Chinese history, including Western Zhou, Qin, Western Han, Sui and Tang. Xi'an is the starting point of the Silk Road and home to the Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shi Huang.Since the 1980s, as part of the economic growth of inland China especially for the central and northwest regions, the city of Xi'an has re-emerged as a cultural, industrial, and educational centre of the entire central-northwest region, with many facilities for research and development, national security and space exploration. Xi'an currently holds sub-provincial status, administering 11 districts and 2 counties. As of 2018 Xi'an has a population of 12,005,600 and the Xi'an\u2013Xianyang metropolitan area a population of 12.6 million. It is the most populous city in Northwest China, as well as the third most populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Chengdu. In 2019, it was named as one of the 7 main emerging megacities, or megalopolises, in China and designated as a metropolis that also consists of areas surrounding the city itself (citation needed). According to GaWC 2020, Xi\u2019an is ranked Beta-, an increase from Gamma last year. \n\n\n== Name ==\n\"Xi'an\" is the atonal pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of its name \u897f\u5b89, which means \"Western Peace\". (The apostrophe \u2013 known in Chinese as a \u9694\u97f3\u7b26\u865f, g\u00e9y\u012bn f\u00fah\u00e0o \u2013 should be included to distinguish its pronunciation from the single syllable xian.) The name was adopted in 1369 under the early Ming dynasty. Jesuit missionaries recorded its name as \"Si-ngan\" or \"Si-ngan-fou\" from its status as the seat of a prefecture (\u5e9c, f\u01d4). This form still appears in the Latin name of the Catholic diocese of Xi'an, archidioecesis Singanensis. The name was later romanized as \"Hsi-an\" by Wade & Giles and as \"Sianfu\" or \"Sian\" by the Qing imperial post office, both of which were common until the general adoption of pinyin.\nThe area of present-day Xi'an has been the site of several important former Chinese cities. The capital of the Western Zhou were the twin cities of Feng and Hao, known collectively as Fenghao, located on opposite banks of the Feng River at its confluence with the southern bank of the Wei in the western suburbs of present-day Xi'an. The Qin capital Xianyang was erected north of the Wei during the Warring States period and was succeeded by the Western Han capital of Chang'an (\u9577\u5b89), meaning \"Perpetual Peace\", which was located south of the Wei and covered the central area of present-day Xi'an. During the Eastern Han, Chang'an was also known as Xijing (\u897f\u4eac) or the \"Western Capital\", relative to its position to the main capital at Luoyang. Under the Sui, its name became Daxing (\u5927\u8208, \"Greatly Prosperous\") in AD 581. Under the Tang, the name reverted to Chang'an in 618. Under the Mongolian Yuan dynasty (13th & 14th centuries), it held a succession of names: Fengyuan (\u5949\u5143), Anxi (\u5b89\u897f, \"Peaceful West\"), and Jingzhao (\u4eac\u5146). The Ming name \"Xi'an\" was changed back to Xijing (\"Western Capital\", as above) between 1930 and 1943.\nXi'an currently does not have a widely accepted one-character abbreviation as many other Chinese cities do. Its license plates are simply marked with \u9655A, based on the name of its province.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nXi'an has a rich and culturally significant history. The Lantian Man was discovered in 1963 in Lantian County, 50 km (31 mi) southeast of Xi'an, and dates back to at least 500,000 years before the present time. A 6,500-year-old Neolithic village, Banpo, was discovered in 1953 on the eastern outskirts of the city proper, which contains the remains of several well organized Neolithic settlements carbon dated to 5600\u20136700 years ago. The site is now home to the Xi'an Banpo Museum, built in 1957 to preserve the archaeological collection.\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nXi'an became a cultural and political centre of China in the 11th century BC with the founding of the Zhou dynasty. The capital of Zhou was established in the twin settlements of Fengjing (\u4e30\u4eac) and Haojing, together known as Fenghao, located southwest of contemporary Xi'an. The settlement was also known as Z\u014dngzh\u014du to indicate its role as the capital of the vassal states. In 770 BC, the capital was moved to Luoyang due to political unrest.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nFollowing the Warring States period, China was unified under the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) for the first time, with the capital located at Xianyang, just northwest of modern Xi'an. The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang ordered the construction of the Terracotta Army and his mausoleum just to the east of Xi'an almost immediately after his ascension to the throne.In 202 BC, the founding emperor Liu Bang of the Han dynasty established his capital in Chang'an County; his first palace, Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae, \"Perpetual Happiness\") was built across the river from the ruin of the Qin capital. This is traditionally regarded as the founding date of Chang'an. Two years later, Liu Bang built Weiyang Palace (\u672a\u592e\u5bae, \"Never Ending Palace\") north of modern Xi'an. Weiyang Palace was the largest palace ever built on Earth, covering 4.8 square kilometres (1,200 acres), which is 6.7 times the size of the current Forbidden City and 11 times the size of the Vatican City. The original Xi'an city wall was started in 194 BC and took 4 years to finish. Upon completion, the wall measured 25.7 km (15.97 mi) in length and 12 to 16 m (39.37\u201352.49 ft) in thickness at the base, enclosing an area of 36 km2 (13.90 sq mi). In the year 190, amidst uprisings and rebellions just prior to the Three Kingdoms Period, a powerful warlord named Dong Zhuo moved the court from Luoyang to Chang'an in a bid to avoid a coalition of other powerful warlords against him.\nFollowing several hundred years of unrest, the Sui dynasty united China again in 582. The emperor of Sui ordered a new capital to be built southeast of the Han capital, called Daxing. It consisted of three sections: the Imperial City, the palace section, and the civilian section, with a total area of 84 km2 (32 sq mi) within the city walls. At the time, it was the largest city in the world. The city was renamed Chang'an by the Tang dynasty. In the mid-7th century, after returning from his pilgrimage to India, the Buddhist monk Xuanzang established a translation centre for Sanskrit scriptures.\nConstruction of the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda began in 652. This pagoda was 64 m (209.97 ft) in height, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras obtained from India by Xuanzang. In 707, construction of the Small Wild Goose Pagoda began. This pagoda measured 45 m (147.64 ft) tall at the time of completion, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras by Yijing. The massive 1556 Shaanxi earthquake eventually damaged the tower and reduced its height to 43.4 m (142.39 ft).The Nestorian Stele is a Tang Chinese stele erected in 781 that documents 150 years of early Christianity in China. It is a 279 cm tall limestone block with text in both Chinese and Syriac describing the existence of Christian communities in several cities in northern China. It reveals that the initial Nestorian Christian church had met recognition by the Tang Emperor Taizong, due to efforts of the Christian missionary Alopen in 635.Chang'an was devastated at the end of the Tang dynasty in 904. Residents were forced to move to the new capital city in Luoyang. Only a small area in the city continued to be occupied thereafter. During the Ming dynasty, a new wall was constructed in 1370 and remains intact to this day. The wall measures 11.9 km (7.4 mi) in circumference, 12 m (39.37 ft) in height, and 15 to 18 m (49.21\u201359.06 ft) in thickness at the base; a moat was also built outside the walls. The new wall and moat would protect a much smaller city of 12 km2 (4.6 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn October 1911, during the Xinhai revolution, revolutionaries attacked the Manchu fort in Xi'an city. Xinhai forces stormed the fort, killing some 20,000 Manchus, therefore successfully liquidated the entire population of Manchus in Xi'an city. The Hui Muslim community of northwestern China was divided in its support for the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. The Hui Muslims of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries and the Hui Muslims of Gansu supported the Qing.  The native Hui Muslims (Mohammedans) of Xi'an joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the Manchus. Only some wealthy Manchus who were ransomed and Manchu females survived. Wealthy Han Chinese seized Manchu girls to become their slaves and poor Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women to be their wives. Young pretty Manchu girls were also seized by Hui Muslims of Xi'an during the massacre and brought up as Muslims.A British missionary who witnessed the massacre commented that \"Old and young, men and women, children alike, were all butchered... Houses were plundered and then burnt; those who would fain have laid hidden till the storm was past, were forced to come out into the open. The revolutionaries, protected by a parapet of the wall, poured a heavy, unceasing, relentless fire into the doomed Tartar (Manchu) city, those who tried to escape thence into the Chinese city were cut down as they emerged from the gates.\"In 1936, the Xi'an Incident took place inside the city during the Chinese Civil War. The incident brought the Kuomintang (KMT) and Communist Party of China to a truce in order to concentrate on fighting against the Japanese Invasion. On May 20, 1949, the Communist-controlled People's Liberation Army captured the city of Xi'an from the Kuomintang force.Xi'an made headlines for being one of the many cities where the 2012 China anti-Japanese demonstrations occurred.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nXi'an lies on the Guanzhong Plain in the south-central part of Shaanxi province, on a flood plain created by the eight surrounding rivers and streams. The city has an average elevation of 400 metres (1,312 ft) above sea level and an annual precipitation of 553 mm (21.8 in). The urban area of Xi'an is located at 34\u00b016\u2032N 108\u00b056\u2032E. The Wei River provides potable water to the city.\nThe city borders the northern foot of the Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the south, and the banks of the Wei River to the north. Hua Shan, one of the five sacred Taoist mountains, is located 100 km (62 mi) away to the east of the city. Not far to the north is the Loess Plateau.\nAt the beginning of Han dynasty, Prime Minister Zhang Liang advised the emperor Liu Bang to choose Guanzhong as the capital of the Han dynasty: \"Guanzhong Plain, which is located behind Xiao Pass and Hangu Pass, connects Long (Gansu) and Shu (Sichuan). Lands of thousand miles rich in harvest be found here, as if this place belongs to the nation of heaven.\" (\u5173\u4e2d\u5de6\u5d24\u51fd\uff0c\u53f3\u9647\u8700\uff0c\u6c83\u91ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u6b64\u6240\u8c13\u91d1\u57ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd\u4e5f) Since then, Guanzhong is also known as the 'Nation of the Heaven'.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nXi'an has a temperate climate that is influenced by the East Asian monsoon, classified under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification as situated on the borderline between a semi-arid climate (BSk) and humid subtropical climate (Cwa). The Wei River valley is characterised by hot, humid summers, cold, dry winters, and dry springs and autumns. Most of the annual precipitation is delivered from July to late October. Snow occasionally falls in winter but rarely settles for long. Dust storms often occur during March and April as the city rapidly warms up. Summer months also experience frequent but short thunderstorms. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from around the freezing mark in January to 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 14.08 \u00b0C (57.3 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 31 percent in December to 47 percent in August, the city receives 1,536 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221220.6 \u00b0C (\u22125 \u00b0F) on January 11, 1955 to 41.8 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on June 21, 1998. A highest record of 42.9 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) was registered in another station on June 17, 2006.\n\n\n=== National Time Service Centre ===\nThe Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory was established in 1966. In 1975, according to the Geodetic Origin Report of the People's Republic of China, 'in order to avoid bias in the mensuration as much as possible, the Geodetic Origin would be in central mainland China.' Lintong (\u4e34\u6f7c), a town near Xi'an was chosen. Since 1986, Chinese Standard Time (CST) was set from NTSC. The NTSC in Lintong is 36 km (22 mi) away from Xi'an.\n\nNational Time Service Centre (NTSC), the Chinese Academy of Sciences is an institute which is mainly engaged in the service and research on time and frequency. NTSC takes charge of generating and maintaining the national standard time scale, disseminating the time and frequency signals. The autonomous standard time scales of universal time and atomic time and the dissemination techniques with LF radio and HF radio were established successively during the 1970s and 1980s, which meet all the requirements for different applications on the whole, such as the scientific researches, national economy, etc.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2007 Xi'an has a population of 4.07 million.\nCompared to the census data from 2000, the population has increased by 656,700 persons to 4.05;million. In contrast, the population in 2010 has steadily increased to 8.7 million and in 2016 the population is somewhat near 9 million for permanent residents.  The population is 51.66 percent male and 48.34 percent female. Among its districts, Yanta has the largest population, with 1.08 million inhabitants.The encompassing Xi'an-Xianyang metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 12.9 million, and locally as 13,569,700, of which 5,740,000 is urban.The majority of Xi'an residents are Han Chinese, who make up 99.1 percent of the city's total population. There are around 81,500 people belonging to ethnic minorities living in Xi'an, including 50,000 Hui people.During World War II, Xi'an became a destination for many refugees from other provinces of China, especially neighboring Henan Province. Because Xi'an was far inland, the invading Japanese army only managed a few aerial assaults on the city. As a result, Xi'an suffered minimal destruction. After 1949, the national government tried to balance the development in different regions of China, and relocated a number of factories and universities from other cities to Xi'an. Modern Xi'an Jiaotong University was relocated from its original campus in Shanghai.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Xi'an has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts and 2 counties:\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nXi'an has many areas that are easily accessible on foot. In many commercial, residential, educational zones in the city, especially in the shopping and entertainment districts around the Bell Tower, underpasses and overpasses have been built for the safety and convenience of pedestrians.\nElectric bikes are popular among students and offer easy transportation in and around the city for many residents. A bicycle-sharing network started operating in 2013 and today has 52,000 bikes, used by over 200,000 people per day. Taxi services are numerous, but many citizens of Xi'an still commute to work using the city's 270 official municipal bus routes serviced by a fleet of over 7,800 buses, with an average system-wide ridership of over 4 million people per day. The bus network is complemented by a rapidly expanding subway system that carries over 1.5 million commuters per day. There are more than 2 million registered automobiles in Xi'an; the growing number of personal automobiles also means traffic jams are a common urban issue.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nLine 2, running through the city from north (North Railway Station) to south (Weiqu Nan), was the first line opened to the public on September 16, 2011. Operations began on September 28, 2011. This line is 19.9 kilometres (12.4 miles) long with 17 stations. Line 1 opened on September 15, 2013. As a west\u2013east railway, its 19 stations connect Houweizhai and Fangzhicheng. Line 3 runs from northeast (Baoshuiqu) to southwest (Yuhuazhai) and opened on November 8, 2016. Line 4, which is basically parallel to Line 2 on its east, runs from the North Square of the North Railway Station [Beikezhan (Beiguangchang)] to south (Hangtianxincheng) and was available publicly on December 26, 2018.\nEight lines are planned to be finished around 2021. It will mainly service the urban and suburban districts of Xi'an municipality and part of nearby Xianyang City.The subway system covers some of the most famous attractions, such as Banpo Museum (Banpo Station, Line 1), Bell and Drum Tower (Line 2), Fortifications of Xi'an (Line 2), the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda (Line 3 and Line 4), the Daminggong National Heritage Park (Line 4) and Shaanxi History Museum (Line 2, 3 and 4), etc.The first metro departure time for Line 1, 2, 3 and 4 is 6:00, the last metro departure time for Line 3 and 4 is 23:00, for Line 1 is 23:30, and for Line 2 is 23:50.On December 30, 2008, a fire accident occurred that was extinguished within an hour and all workers evacuated safely. Sixty-six hours later, on January 2, another fire occurred at another station on Line 2.\n\n\n=== Taxi ===\nTaxis in Xi'an are predominantly BYD Auto made in Xi'an.\nMost, if not all, taxis in Xi'an run on compressed natural gas. For the taxis' fare, during the period of 06:00 through 23:00, \u00a59/2 kilometres (1.2 miles) for the fare fall and \u00a52.3/km later, at night \u00a510 for the fare fall and \u00a52.7/km later.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThere are 6 passenger transport railway stations in Xi'an. Xi'an railway station, located just north of Xi'an walled city, is one of the eight major national railway stations, and the main railway transportation hub of Shaanxi Province. The new Xi'an North railway station, situated a few miles to the north, is the station for the high-speed trains of the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an High-Speed Railway. With 34 platforms, it is the largest railway station in Northwest China. Construction of the station began on September 19, 2008. The station was opened on January 11, 2011. As of May 2012, Xi'an North Station is served only by the fast (G-series and D-series) trains running on the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an high-speed railway; one of them continues south to Hankou.\nThe city's other stations include Xi'an West, Xi'an East, Xi'an South, Sanmincun, and Fangzhicheng railway stations.\nXi'an Railway Station covers 597,000 square metres (6,430,000 square feet), has 5 passenger platforms, and 24 tracks. It provides 112 services to 80 000 people daily. Among the destinations served by direct trains from Xi'an are Beijing, Zhengzhou, Lanzhou, Baoji, and Mount Hua. China Railway High-speed 2 now run an express services from Xi'an to Baoji and Xi'an to Zhengzhou; with a total running time to Baoji of under 90 minutes, and 2 hours to Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an high-speed railway also serves Xi'an. Construction work began on September 25, 2005, the railway opened for service on February 6, 2010. The railway has made air service between Zhengzhou and Xi'an uncompetitive. All passenger flights between the two cities were suspended within 48 days of start of regular high-speed rail service.\n\n\n=== Expressways ===\nXi'an currently has three ring road systems, the Second Ring road and the Third Ring road which encircle the city. These ring roads are similar to freeways, except where there are traffic signals on the Second Ring road.\nAs a tourist city, Xi'an has built expressways to Lintong, Tongchuan and Baoji, with well-maintained roads to famous scenic spots in suburban counties and to the north slope of the Qin Mountains. Since its construction in September 2007, the G5 Beijing\u2013Kunming Expressway connects Hanzhong and Xi'an through the Qinling.\n\nChina National Highway 108\nChina National Highway 210\nChina National Highway 211\nChina National Highway 312\n\n\n=== Air ===\nXi'an Xianyang International Airport (airport code: XIY) is the major airport serving the city and it is the largest airport in the northwestern part of China. It is 41 kilometres (25 mi) northwest of Xi'an city centre, and 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) northeast of the centre of Xianyang. China Eastern Airlines, Hainan Airlines and China Southern Airlines are the main airlines using the airport. Terminal 3 and the second runway were opened on May 3, 2012.International Routes:\nThere are direct flights from Xi'an to many major cities in Asia, including Bangkok, Busan, Fukuoka, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Osaka, Sapporo, Singapore Seoul, and Taipei.\nFirst direct route between Xi'an and Europe was launched by Finnair on June 14, 2013. There are 3 three frequencies per week via Helsinki hub to many major cities in Europe during the summer season.\nUnited Airlines begun non-stop service to San Francisco since May 2016.\nGermany's Fraport, the operator of Frankfurt Airport, has paid 490  million yuan to obtain a 24.5  percent stake in the Xianyang International Airport, offering opportunities to upgrade and expand the facility.\n\nOn June 6, 1994, China Northwest Airlines flight 2303 broke up in mid-air and crashed near Xi'an, en route to Guangzhou from Xian. A maintenance error was responsible. All 160 people on board died. As of 2016, it remains the deadliest airplane crash ever to occur in mainland China.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe culture of Xi'an descends from one of the world's earliest civilizations. The Guanzhong Ren (simplified Chinese: \u5173\u4e2d\u4eba; traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u4e2d\u4eba; pinyin: Gu\u0101nzh\u014dng r\u00e9n) culture is considered the cultural antecedent of Xi'anese; their features are satirized as the \"Ten Strangenesses of Guanzhong Ren\" (simplified Chinese: \u5173\u4e2d\u5341\u5927\u602a; traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u4e2d\u5341\u5927\u602a; pinyin: Gu\u0101nzh\u014dng sh\u00ed d\u00e0 gu\u00e0i). Xi'an is also known for the \"Eight Great Sights of Chang'an\" (simplified Chinese: \u957f\u5b89\u516b\u666f; traditional Chinese: \u9577\u5b89\u516b\u666f; pinyin: Ch\u00e1ng'\u0101n b\u0101j\u01d0ng), a collection of scenic areas in the region. Xi'an guyue is named for Xi'an.\n\n\n=== Arts district ===\nMuch like Beijing 1798 and Shanghai 1933, Xi'an has an art district called Textile Town (Chinese: \u7eba\u7ec7\u57ce; pinyin: F\u01cengzh\u012b ch\u00e9ng). The district derives its name from the many textile factories built there since the 1950s. Today it is no longer a centre for the textile industry but a new art factory with 4 workshops in total.\n\n\n=== Resident artists ===\nXi'an is home to contemporary Chinese stars such as Xu Wei, Zhang Chu and Zheng Jun.\n\n\n=== Xi'an cuisine ===\n\nYangrou paomo (flat bread soaked in lamb soup; simplified Chinese: \u7f8a\u8089\u6ce1\u998d; traditional Chinese: \u7f8a\u8089\u6ce1\u9943; pinyin: Y\u00e1ngr\u00f2u p\u00e0om\u00f3) is a well known Xi'anese dish.\nLiang pi (cold rice noodles; simplified Chinese: \u51c9\u76ae; traditional Chinese: \u6dbc\u76ae; pinyin: li\u00e1ngp\u00ed ) are wheat or rice noodles served cold with vinegar and chili oil. \nBiangbiang mian, also known as youpo chemian (simplified Chinese: \u6cb9\u6cfc\u626f\u9762; traditional Chinese: \u6cb9\u6f51\u626f\u9eb5; pinyin: Y\u00f3up\u014d ch\u011bmi\u00e0n), are thick and long hand-pulled noodles, often served with red hot pepper.\nRoujiamo (meat buns; simplified Chinese: \u8089\u593e\u998d; traditional Chinese: \u8089\u593e\u9943; pinyin: R\u00f2uji\u0101m\u00f3) is a type of steamed bun, filled with meat (usually pork, but other types of meat may also be found).

Chang'an was filled with cuju football fields, in the backyards of large mansions, and some were even established in the grounds of the palaces. The level of female cuju teams also improved. Records indicate that once a 17-year-old girl beat a team of army soldiers.

        "wiki": "Xi'an (UK:  shee-AN, US:  shee-AHN; Chinese: [\u0255\u00ed.\u00e1n] (listen)), also known as Sian, is the capital of Shaanxi Province. A sub-provincial city on the Guanzhong Plain in Northwest China, it is one of the oldest cities in China, the oldest prefecture capital and one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals, having held the position under several of the most important dynasties in Chinese history, including Western Zhou, Qin, Western Han, Sui and Tang. Xi'an is the starting point of the Silk Road and home to the Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shi Huang.Since the 1980s, as part of the economic growth of inland China especially for the central and northwest regions, the city of Xi'an has re-emerged as a cultural, industrial, and educational centre of the entire central-northwest region, with many facilities for research and development, national security and space exploration. Xi'an currently holds sub-provincial status, administering 11 districts and 2 counties. As of 2018 Xi'an has a population of 12,005,600 and the Xi'an\u2013Xianyang metropolitan area a population of 12.6 million. It is the most populous city in Northwest China, as well as the third most populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Chengdu. In 2019, it was named as one of the 7 main emerging megacities, or megalopolises, in China and designated as a metropolis that also consists of areas surrounding the city itself (citation needed). According to GaWC 2020, Xi\u2019an is ranked Beta-, an increase from Gamma last year. \n\n\n== Name ==\n\"Xi'an\" is the atonal pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of its name \u897f\u5b89, which means \"Western Peace\". (The apostrophe \u2013 known in Chinese as a \u9694\u97f3\u7b26\u865f, g\u00e9y\u012bn f\u00fah\u00e0o \u2013 should be included to distinguish its pronunciation from the single syllable xian.) The name was adopted in 1369 under the early Ming dynasty. Jesuit missionaries recorded its name as \"Si-ngan\" or \"Si-ngan-fou\" from its status as the seat of a prefecture (\u5e9c, f\u01d4). This form still appears in the Latin name of the Catholic diocese of Xi'an, archidioecesis Singanensis. The name was later romanized as \"Hsi-an\" by Wade & Giles and as \"Sianfu\" or \"Sian\" by the Qing imperial post office, both of which were common until the general adoption of pinyin.\nThe area of present-day Xi'an has been the site of several important former Chinese cities. The capital of the Western Zhou were the twin cities of Feng and Hao, known collectively as Fenghao, located on opposite banks of the Feng River at its confluence with the southern bank of the Wei in the western suburbs of present-day Xi'an. The Qin capital Xianyang was erected north of the Wei during the Warring States period and was succeeded by the Western Han capital of Chang'an (\u9577\u5b89), meaning \"Perpetual Peace\", which was located south of the Wei and covered the central area of present-day Xi'an. During the Eastern Han, Chang'an was also known as Xijing (\u897f\u4eac) or the \"Western Capital\", relative to its position to the main capital at Luoyang. Under the Sui, its name became Daxing (\u5927\u8208, \"Greatly Prosperous\") in AD 581. Under the Tang, the name reverted to Chang'an in 618. Under the Mongolian Yuan dynasty (13th & 14th centuries), it held a succession of names: Fengyuan (\u5949\u5143), Anxi (\u5b89\u897f, \"Peaceful West\"), and Jingzhao (\u4eac\u5146). The Ming name \"Xi'an\" was changed back to Xijing (\"Western Capital\", as above) between 1930 and 1943.\nXi'an currently does not have a widely accepted one-character abbreviation as many other Chinese cities do. Its license plates are simply marked with \u9655A, based on the name of its province.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nXi'an has a rich and culturally significant history. The Lantian Man was discovered in 1963 in Lantian County, 50 km (31 mi) southeast of Xi'an, and dates back to at least 500,000 years before the present time. A 6,500-year-old Neolithic village, Banpo, was discovered in 1953 on the eastern outskirts of the city proper, which contains the remains of several well organized Neolithic settlements carbon dated to 5600\u20136700 years ago. The site is now home to the Xi'an Banpo Museum, built in 1957 to preserve the archaeological collection.\n\n\n=== Ancient era ===\n\nXi'an became a cultural and political centre of China in the 11th century BC with the founding of the Zhou dynasty. The capital of Zhou was established in the twin settlements of Fengjing (\u4e30\u4eac) and Haojing, together known as Fenghao, located southwest of contemporary Xi'an. The settlement was also known as Z\u014dngzh\u014du to indicate its role as the capital of the vassal states. In 770 BC, the capital was moved to Luoyang due to political unrest.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nFollowing the Warring States period, China was unified under the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) for the first time, with the capital located at Xianyang, just northwest of modern Xi'an. The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang ordered the construction of the Terracotta Army and his mausoleum just to the east of Xi'an almost immediately after his ascension to the throne.In 202 BC, the founding emperor Liu Bang of the Han dynasty established his capital in Chang'an County; his first palace, Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae, \"Perpetual Happiness\") was built across the river from the ruin of the Qin capital. This is traditionally regarded as the founding date of Chang'an. Two years later, Liu Bang built Weiyang Palace (\u672a\u592e\u5bae, \"Never Ending Palace\") north of modern Xi'an. Weiyang Palace was the largest palace ever built on Earth, covering 4.8 square kilometres (1,200 acres), which is 6.7 times the size of the current Forbidden City and 11 times the size of the Vatican City. The original Xi'an city wall was started in 194 BC and took 4 years to finish. Upon completion, the wall measured 25.7 km (15.97 mi) in length and 12 to 16 m (39.37\u201352.49 ft) in thickness at the base, enclosing an area of 36 km2 (13.90 sq mi). In the year 190, amidst uprisings and rebellions just prior to the Three Kingdoms Period, a powerful warlord named Dong Zhuo moved the court from Luoyang to Chang'an in a bid to avoid a coalition of other powerful warlords against him.\nFollowing several hundred years of unrest, the Sui dynasty united China again in 582. The emperor of Sui ordered a new capital to be built southeast of the Han capital, called Daxing. It consisted of three sections: the Imperial City, the palace section, and the civilian section, with a total area of 84 km2 (32 sq mi) within the city walls. At the time, it was the largest city in the world. The city was renamed Chang'an by the Tang dynasty. In the mid-7th century, after returning from his pilgrimage to India, the Buddhist monk Xuanzang established a translation centre for Sanskrit scriptures.\nConstruction of the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda began in 652. This pagoda was 64 m (209.97 ft) in height, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras obtained from India by Xuanzang. In 707, construction of the Small Wild Goose Pagoda began. This pagoda measured 45 m (147.64 ft) tall at the time of completion, and was built to store the translations of Buddhist sutras by Yijing. The massive 1556 Shaanxi earthquake eventually damaged the tower and reduced its height to 43.4 m (142.39 ft).The Nestorian Stele is a Tang Chinese stele erected in 781 that documents 150 years of early Christianity in China. It is a 279 cm tall limestone block with text in both Chinese and Syriac describing the existence of Christian communities in several cities in northern China. It reveals that the initial Nestorian Christian church had met recognition by the Tang Emperor Taizong, due to efforts of the Christian missionary Alopen in 635.Chang'an was devastated at the end of the Tang dynasty in 904. Residents were forced to move to the new capital city in Luoyang. Only a small area in the city continued to be occupied thereafter. During the Ming dynasty, a new wall was constructed in 1370 and remains intact to this day. The wall measures 11.9 km (7.4 mi) in circumference, 12 m (39.37 ft) in height, and 15 to 18 m (49.21\u201359.06 ft) in thickness at the base; a moat was also built outside the walls. The new wall and moat would protect a much smaller city of 12 km2 (4.6 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn October 1911, during the Xinhai revolution, revolutionaries attacked the Manchu fort in Xi'an city. Xinhai forces stormed the fort, killing some 20,000 Manchus, therefore successfully liquidated the entire population of Manchus in Xi'an city. The Hui Muslim community of northwestern China was divided in its support for the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. The Hui Muslims of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries and the Hui Muslims of Gansu supported the Qing.  The native Hui Muslims (Mohammedans) of Xi'an joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the Manchus. Only some wealthy Manchus who were ransomed and Manchu females survived. Wealthy Han Chinese seized Manchu girls to become their slaves and poor Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women to be their wives. Young pretty Manchu girls were also seized by Hui Muslims of Xi'an during the massacre and brought up as Muslims.A British missionary who witnessed the massacre commented that \"Old and young, men and women, children alike, were all butchered... Houses were plundered and then burnt; those who would fain have laid hidden till the storm was past, were forced to come out into the open. The revolutionaries, protected by a parapet of the wall, poured a heavy, unceasing, relentless fire into the doomed Tartar (Manchu) city, those who tried to escape thence into the Chinese city were cut down as they emerged from the gates.\"In 1936, the Xi'an Incident took place inside the city during the Chinese Civil War. The incident brought the Kuomintang (KMT) and Communist Party of China to a truce in order to concentrate on fighting against the Japanese Invasion. On May 20, 1949, the Communist-controlled People's Liberation Army captured the city of Xi'an from the Kuomintang force.Xi'an made headlines for being one of the many cities where the 2012 China anti-Japanese demonstrations occurred.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nXi'an lies on the Guanzhong Plain in the south-central part of Shaanxi province, on a flood plain created by the eight surrounding rivers and streams. The city has an average elevation of 400 metres (1,312 ft) above sea level and an annual precipitation of 553 mm (21.8 in). The urban area of Xi'an is located at 34\u00b016\u2032N 108\u00b056\u2032E. The Wei River provides potable water to the city.\nThe city borders the northern foot of the Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the south, and the banks of the Wei River to the north. Hua Shan, one of the five sacred Taoist mountains, is located 100 km (62 mi) away to the east of the city. Not far to the north is the Loess Plateau.\nAt the beginning of Han dynasty, Prime Minister Zhang Liang advised the emperor Liu Bang to choose Guanzhong as the capital of the Han dynasty: \"Guanzhong Plain, which is located behind Xiao Pass and Hangu Pass, connects Long (Gansu) and Shu (Sichuan). Lands of thousand miles rich in harvest be found here, as if this place belongs to the nation of heaven.\" (\u5173\u4e2d\u5de6\u5d24\u51fd\uff0c\u53f3\u9647\u8700\uff0c\u6c83\u91ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u6b64\u6240\u8c13\u91d1\u57ce\u5343\u91cc\uff0c\u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd\u4e5f) Since then, Guanzhong is also known as the 'Nation of the Heaven'.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nXi'an has a temperate climate that is influenced by the East Asian monsoon, classified under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification as situated on the borderline between a semi-arid climate (BSk) and humid subtropical climate (Cwa). The Wei River valley is characterised by hot, humid summers, cold, dry winters, and dry springs and autumns. Most of the annual precipitation is delivered from July to late October. Snow occasionally falls in winter but rarely settles for long. Dust storms often occur during March and April as the city rapidly warms up. Summer months also experience frequent but short thunderstorms. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from around the freezing mark in January to 27.0 \u00b0C (80.6 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 14.08 \u00b0C (57.3 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 31 percent in December to 47 percent in August, the city receives 1,536 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221220.6 \u00b0C (\u22125 \u00b0F) on January 11, 1955 to 41.8 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on June 21, 1998. A highest record of 42.9 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) was registered in another station on June 17, 2006.\n\n\n=== National Time Service Centre ===\nThe Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory was established in 1966. In 1975, according to the Geodetic Origin Report of the People's Republic of China, 'in order to avoid bias in the mensuration as much as possible, the Geodetic Origin would be in central mainland China.' Lintong (\u4e34\u6f7c), a town near Xi'an was chosen. Since 1986, Chinese Standard Time (CST) was set from NTSC. The NTSC in Lintong is 36 km (22 mi) away from Xi'an.\n\nNational Time Service Centre (NTSC), the Chinese Academy of Sciences is an institute which is mainly engaged in the service and research on time and frequency. NTSC takes charge of generating and maintaining the national standard time scale, disseminating the time and frequency signals. The autonomous standard time scales of universal time and atomic time and the dissemination techniques with LF radio and HF radio were established successively during the 1970s and 1980s, which meet all the requirements for different applications on the whole, such as the scientific researches, national economy, etc.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs of 2007 Xi'an has a population of 4.07 million.\nCompared to the census data from 2000, the population has increased by 656,700 persons to 4.05;million. In contrast, the population in 2010 has steadily increased to 8.7 million and in 2016 the population is somewhat near 9 million for permanent residents.  The population is 51.66 percent male and 48.34 percent female. Among its districts, Yanta has the largest population, with 1.08 million inhabitants.The encompassing Xi'an-Xianyang metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 12.9 million, and locally as 13,569,700, of which 5,740,000 is urban.The majority of Xi'an residents are Han Chinese, who make up 99.1 percent of the city's total population. There are around 81,500 people belonging to ethnic minorities living in Xi'an, including 50,000 Hui people.During World War II, Xi'an became a destination for many refugees from other provinces of China, especially neighboring Henan Province. Because Xi'an was far inland, the invading Japanese army only managed a few aerial assaults on the city. As a result, Xi'an suffered minimal destruction. After 1949, the national government tried to balance the development in different regions of China, and relocated a number of factories and universities from other cities to Xi'an. Modern Xi'an Jiaotong University was relocated from its original campus in Shanghai.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Xi'an has direct jurisdiction over 11 districts and 2 counties:\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nXi'an has many areas that are easily accessible on foot.

A bicycle-sharing network started operating in 2013 and today has 52,000 bikes, used by over 200,000 people per day. Taxi services are numerous, but many citizens of Xi'an still commute to work using the city's 270 official municipal bus routes serviced by a fleet of over 7,800 buses, with an average system-wide ridership of over 4 million people per day. The bus network is complemented by a rapidly expanding subway system that carries over 1.5 million commuters per day. There are more than 2 million registered automobiles in Xi'an; the growing number of personal automobiles also means traffic jams are a common urban issue.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nLine 2, running through the city from north (North Railway Station) to south (Weiqu Nan), was the first line opened to the public on September 16, 2011. Operations began on September 28, 2011. This line is 19.9 kilometres (12.4 miles) long with 17 stations. Line 1 opened on September 15, 2013.

For the taxis' fare, during the period of 06:00 through 23:00, \u00a59/2 kilometres (1.2 miles) for the fare fall and \u00a52.3/km later, at night \u00a510 for the fare fall and \u00a52.7/km later.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThere are 6 passenger transport railway stations in Xi'an. Xi'an railway station, located just north of Xi'an walled city, is one of the eight major national railway stations, and the main railway transportation hub of Shaanxi Province. The new Xi'an North railway station, situated a few miles to the north, is the station for the high-speed trains of the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an High-Speed Railway. With 34 platforms, it is the largest railway station in Northwest China. Construction of the station began on September 19, 2008. The station was opened on January 11, 2011.

The Zhengzhou\u2013Xi'an high-speed railway also serves Xi'an. Construction work began on September 25, 2005, the railway opened for service on February 6, 2010. The railway has made air service between Zhengzhou and Xi'an uncompetitive. All passenger flights between the two cities were suspended within 48 days of start of regular high-speed rail service.\n\n\n=== Expressways ===\nXi'an currently has three ring road systems, the Second Ring road and the Third Ring road which encircle the city. These ring roads are similar to freeways, except where there are traffic signals on the Second Ring road.\nAs a tourist city, Xi'an has built expressways to Lintong, Tongchuan and Baoji, with well-maintained roads to famous scenic spots in suburban counties and to the north slope of the Qin Mountains. Since its construction in September 2007, the G5 Beijing\u2013Kunming Expressway connects Hanzhong and Xi'an through the Qinling.\n\nChina National Highway 108\nChina National Highway 210\nChina National Highway 211\nChina National Highway 312\n\n\n=== Air ===\nXi'an Xianyang International Airport (airport code: XIY) is the major airport serving the city and it is the largest airport in the northwestern part of China.

First of all, the feather-stuffed ball was replaced by an air-filled ball with a two-layered hull. Also, two different types of goalposts emerged: One was made by setting up posts with a net between them and the other consisted of just one goal post in the middle of the field. Chang'an was filled with cuju football fields, in the backyards of large mansions, and some were even established in the grounds of the palaces. The level of female cuju teams also improved. Records indicate that once a 17-year-old girl beat a team of army soldiers. Cuju football became popular among the scholars and intellectuals, and if a courtier lacked skill in the game, he could pardon himself by acting as a scorekeeper.\n\nProfessional sports teams in Xi'an include:\n\nChinese Pingpong Association Super League\nShaanxi Galaxy (\u9655\u897f\u94f6\u6cb3)Former Professional sports teams in Xi'an:\n\nChinese Jia-A League\nShaanxi Guoli F.C.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Terracotta Army is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210\u2013209 BCE with the purpose of protecting the emperor in his afterlife.\nThe figures, dating from approximately the late third century BCE, were discovered in 1974 by local farmers in Lintong County, outside Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. The figures vary in height according to their roles, with the tallest being the generals. The figures include warriors, chariots and horses. Estimates from 2007 were that the three pits containing the Terracotta Army held more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses, and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which remained buried in the pits near Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum. Other terracotta non-military figures were found in other pits, including officials, acrobats, strongmen, and musicians.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe construction of the tomb was described by historian Sima Qian (145\u201390 BCE) in Records of the Grand Historian, the first of China's 24 dynastic histories, which was written a century after the mausoleum's completion.  Work on the mausoleum began in 246 BCE soon after Emperor Qin (then aged 13) ascended the throne, and the project eventually involved conscripted 700,000 workers. Geographer Li Daoyuan, writing six centuries after the first emperor's death, recorded in Shui Jing Zhu that Mount Li was a favoured location due to its auspicious geology, \"famed for its jade mines, its northern side was rich in gold, and its southern side rich in beautiful jade; the first emperor, covetous of its fine reputation, therefore chose to be buried there\". Sima Qian wrote that the first emperor was buried with palaces, towers, officials, valuable artifacts and wondrous objects. According to this account, 100 flowing rivers were simulated using mercury, and above them the ceiling was decorated with heavenly bodies below which were the features of the land. Some translations of this passage refer to \"models\" or \"imitations\"; however, those words were not used in the original text, which makes no mention of the terracotta army. High levels of mercury were found in the soil of the tomb mound, giving credence to Sima Qian's account. Later historical accounts suggested that the complex and tomb itself had been looted by Xiang Yu, a contender for the throne after the death of the first emperor. However, there are indications that the tomb itself may not have been plundered.\n\n\n=== Discovery ===\nThe Terracotta Army was discovered on 29 March 1974 by farmers digging a water well approximately 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) east of the Qin Emperor's tomb mound at Mount Li (Lishan), a region riddled with underground springs and watercourses. For centuries, occasional reports mentioned pieces of terracotta figures and fragments of the Qin necropolis \u2013 roofing tiles, bricks and chunks of masonry. This discovery prompted Chinese archaeologists, including Zhao Kangmin, to investigate, revealing the largest pottery figurine group ever found. A museum complex has since been constructed over the area, the largest pit being enclosed by a roofed structure.\n\n\n== Necropolis ==\n\nThe Terracotta Army is part of a much larger necropolis.  Ground-penetrating radar and core sampling have measured the area to be approximately 98 square kilometers (38 square miles).The necropolis was constructed as a microcosm of the emperor's imperial palace or compound, and covers a large area around the tomb mound of the first emperor. The earthen tomb mound is located at the foot of Mount Li and built in a pyramidal shape, and is surrounded by two solidly built rammed earth walls with gateway entrances. The necropolis consists of several offices, halls, stables, other structures as well as an imperial park placed around the tomb mound.\nThe warriors stand guard to the east of the tomb. Up to 5 metres (16 ft) of reddish, sandy soil had accumulated over the site in the two millennia following its construction, but archaeologists found evidence of earlier disturbances at the site. During the excavations near the Mount Li burial mound, archaeologists found several graves dating from the 18th and 19th centuries, where diggers had apparently struck terracotta fragments. These were discarded as worthless and used along with soil to backfill the excavations.\n\n\n=== Tomb ===\n\nThe tomb appears to be a hermetically sealed space roughly the size of a football pitch (c. 100 \u00d7 75 m). The tomb remains unopened, possibly due to concerns over preservation of its artifacts. For example, after the excavation of the Terracotta Army, the painted surface present on some terracotta figures began to flake and fade. The lacquer covering the paint can curl in fifteen seconds once exposed to Xi'an's dry air and can flake off in just four minutes.\n\n\n== Excavation site ==\n\n\n=== Pits ===\n\nFour main pits approximately 7 metres (23 ft) deep have been excavated. These are located approximately 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) east of the burial mound. The soldiers within were laid out as if to protect the tomb from the east, where the Qin Emperor's conquered states lay.\n\n\n==== Pit 1 ====\nPit 1, which is 230 metres (750 ft) long and 62 metres (203 ft) wide, contains the main army of more than 6,000 figures. Pit 1 has eleven corridors, most more than 3 metres (10 ft) wide and paved with small bricks with a wooden ceiling supported by large beams and posts. This design was also used for the tombs of nobles and would have resembled palace hallways when built. The wooden ceilings were covered with reed mats and layers of clay for waterproofing, and then mounded with more soil raising them about 2 to 3 metres (6 ft 7 in to 9 ft 10 in) above the surrounding ground level when completed.\n\n\n==== Others ====\nPit 2 has cavalry and infantry units as well as war chariots and is thought to represent a military guard. Pit 3 is the command post, with high-ranking officers and a war chariot. Pit 4 is empty, perhaps left unfinished by its builders.\nSome of the figures in Pits 1 and 2 show fire damage, while remains of burnt ceiling rafters have also been found. These, together with the missing weapons, have been taken as evidence of the reported looting by Xiang Yu and the subsequent burning of the site, which is thought to have caused the roof to collapse and crush the army figures below. The terracotta figures currently on display have been restored from the fragments.\nOther pits that formed the necropolis have also been excavated. These pits lie within and outside the walls surrounding the tomb mound. They variously contain bronze carriages, terracotta figures of entertainers such as acrobats and strongmen, officials, stone armour suits, burial sites of horses, rare animals and labourers, as well as bronze cranes and ducks set in an underground park.\n\n\n== Warrior figures ==\n\n\n=== Types and appearance ===\n\nThe terracotta figures are life-sized, typically ranging from 175 cm (5.74 ft) to about 200 cm (6.6 ft) (the officers are typically taller). They vary in height, uniform, and hairstyle in accordance with rank. Their faces appear to be different for each individual figure; scholars, however, have identified 10 basic face shapes.  The figures are of these general types: armored infantry; unarmored infantry; cavalrymen who wear a pillbox hat; helmeted drivers of chariots with more armor protection; spear-carrying charioteers; kneeling crossbowmen or archers who are armored; standing archers who are not; as well as generals and other lower-ranking officers. There are, however, many variations in the uniforms within the ranks: for example, some may wear shin pads while others not; they may wear either long or short trousers, some of which may be padded; and their body armors vary depending on rank, function, and position in formation. There are also terracotta horses placed among the warrior figures.\n\nOriginally, the figures were painted with: ground precious stones, intensely fired bones (white), pigments of iron oxide (dark red), cinnabar (red), malachite (green), azurite (blue), charcoal (black), cinnabar barium copper silicate mix (Chinese purple or Han purple),  tree sap from a nearby source, (more than likely from the Chinese lacquer tree) (brown). Other colors including pink, lilac and one unknown color. The colored lacquer finish and individual facial features would have given the figures a realistic feel, with eyebrows and facial hair in black and the faces done in pink.However, in Xi'an's dry climate, much of the color coating would flake off in less than four minutes after removing the mud surrounding the army.Some scholars have speculated a possible Hellenistic link to these sculptures, because of the lack of life-sized and realistic sculptures before the Qin dynasty. They argued that potential Greek influence is particularly evident in some terracotta figures such as those of acrobats, combined with findings of European DNA in Xinjiang and rare bronze artifacts made with a lost wax technique known in Greece and Egypt. However, this idea is disputed by scholars who claim that there is \"no substantial evidence at all\" for contact between ancient Greeks and Chinese builders of the tomb. They argue that such speculations rest on flawed and old \"Eurocentric\" ideas that assumed other civilizations were incapable of sophisticated artistry and thus foreign artistry must be seen through western traditions.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe terracotta army figures were manufactured in workshops by government laborers and local craftsmen using local materials. Heads, arms, legs, and torsos were created separately and then assembled by luting the pieces together. When completed, the terracotta figures were placed in the pits in precise military formation according to rank and duty.The faces were created using molds, and at least ten face molds may have been used. Clay was then added after assembly to provide individual facial features to make each figure appear different. It is believed that the warriors' legs were made in much the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were manufactured at the time. This would classify the process as assembly line production, with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired, as opposed to crafting one solid piece and subsequently firing it. In those times of tight imperial control, each workshop was required to inscribe its name on items produced to ensure quality control. This has aided modern historians in verifying which workshops were commandeered to make tiles and other mundane items for the terracotta army.\n\n\n=== Weaponry ===\n\nMost of the figures originally held real weapons, which would have increased their realism. The majority of these weapons were looted shortly after the creation of the army or have rotted away.  Despite this, over 40,000 bronze items of weaponry have been recovered, including swords, daggers, spears, lances, battle-axes, scimitars, shields, crossbows, and crossbow triggers. Most of the recovered items are arrowheads, which are usually found in bundles of 100 units. Studies of these arrowheads suggests that they were produced by self-sufficient, autonomous workshops using a process referred to as cellular production or Toyotism. Some weapons were coated with a 10\u201315 micrometer layer of chromium dioxide before burial that was believed to have protected them from any form of decay for the last 2200 years. However, research in 2019 indicated that the chromium was merely contamination from nearby lacquer, not a means of protecting the weapons. The slightly alkaline pH and small particle size of the burial soil most likely preserved the weapons.The swords contain an alloy of copper, tin, and other elements including nickel, magnesium, and cobalt. Some carry inscriptions that date their manufacture to between 245 and 228 BCE, indicating that they were used before burial.\n\n\n== Scientific research ==\nIn 2007, scientists at Stanford University and the Advanced Light Source facility in Berkeley, California, reported that powder diffraction experiments combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and micro-X-ray fluorescence analysis showed that the process of producing terracotta figures colored with Chinese purple dye consisting of barium copper silicate was derived from the knowledge gained by Taoist alchemists in their attempts to synthesize jade ornaments.Since 2006, an international team of researchers at the UCL Institute of Archaeology have been using analytical chemistry techniques to uncover more details about the production techniques employed in the creation of the Terracotta Army. Using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry of 40,000 bronze arrowheads bundled in groups of 100, the researchers reported that the arrowheads within a single bundle formed a relatively tight cluster that was different from other bundles. In addition, the presence or absence of metal impurities was consistent within bundles. Based on the arrows\u2019 chemical compositions, the researchers concluded that a cellular manufacturing system similar to the one used in a modern Toyota factory, as opposed to a continuous assembly line in the early days of the automobile industry, was employed.Grinding and polishing marks visible under a scanning electron microscope provide evidence for the earliest industrial use of lathes for polishing.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\nThe first exhibition of the figures outside of China was held at National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) in Melbourne in 1982.A collection of 120 objects from the mausoleum and 12 terracotta warriors were displayed at the British Museum in London as its special exhibition \"The First Emperor: China's Terracotta Army\" from 13 September 2007 to April 2008. This exhibition made 2008 the British Museum's most successful year and made the British Museum the United Kingdom's top cultural attraction between 2007 and 2008. The exhibition brought the most visitors to the museum since the King Tutankhamun exhibition in 1972. It was reported that the 400,000 advance tickets sold out so fast that the museum extended its opening hours until midnight. According to The Times, many people had to be turned away, despite the extended hours.  During the day of events to mark the Chinese New Year, the crush was so intense that the gates to the museum had to be shut. The Terracotta Army has been described as the only other set of historic artifacts (along with the remnants of wreck of the RMS Titanic) that can draw a crowd by the name alone.\n\nWarriors and other artifacts were exhibited to the public at the Forum de Barcelona in Barcelona between 9 May and 26 September 2004. It was their most successful exhibition ever. The same exhibition was presented at the Fundaci\u00f3n Canal de Isabel II in Madrid between October 2004 and January 2005, their most successful ever. From December 2009 to May 2010, the exhibition was shown in the Centro Cultural La Moneda in Santiago de Chile.The exhibition traveled to North America and visited museums such as the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, California, Houston Museum of Natural Science, High Museum of Art in Atlanta, National Geographic Society Museum in Washington, D.C. and the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. Subsequently, the exhibition traveled to Sweden and was hosted in the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities between 28 August 2010 and 20 January 2011. An exhibition entitled 'The First Emperor \u2013 China's Entombed Warriors', presenting 120 artifacts was hosted at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, between 2 December 2010 and 13 March 2011. An exhibition entitled \"L'Empereur guerrier de Chine et son arm\u00e9e de terre cuite\" (\"The Warrior-Emperor of China and his terracotta army\"), featuring artifacts including statues from the mausoleum, was hosted by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts from 11 February 2011 to 26 June 2011. In Italy, from July 2008 to 16 November 2008, five of the warriors of the terracotta army were displayed in Turin at the Museum of Antiquities, and from 16 April 2010 to 5 September 2010 were exposed nine warriors in Milan, at the Royal Palace, at the exhibition entitled \"The Two Empires\". The group consisted of a horse, a counselor, an archer and six lancers. The \"Treasures of Ancient China\" exhibition, showcasing two terracotta soldiers and other artifacts, including the Longmen Grottoes Buddhist statues, was held between 19 February 2011 and 7 November 2011 in four locations in India: National Museum of New Delhi, Prince of Wales Museum in Mumbai, Salar Jung Museum in Hyderabad and National Library of India in Kolkata.Soldiers and related items were on display from 15 March 2013 to 17 November 2013, at the Historical Museum of Bern.Several Terracotta Army figures were on display, along with many other objects, in an exhibit entitled \"Age of Empires: Chinese Art of the Qin and Han Dynasties\" at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City from 3 April 2017, to 16 July 2017. An exhibition featuring ten Terracotta Army figures and other artifacts, \"Terracotta Warriors of the First Emperor,\" was on display at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, Washington, from 8 April 2017 to 4 September 2017 before traveling to The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to be exhibited from 30 September 2017 to 4 March 2018 with the addition of augmented reality.An exhibition entitled \"China's First Emperor and the Terracotta Warriors\" was at the World Museum in Liverpool from 9 February 2018 to 28 October 2018. This was the first time in more than 10 years that the warriors travelled to the UK.\nAn exhibition tour of 120 real-size replicas of Terracotta statues was displayed in the German cities of Frankfurt am Main, Munich, Oberhof, Berlin (at the Palace of the Republic) and Nuremberg between 2003 and 2004.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of World Heritage Sites in China\nQin bronze chariot\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nClements, Jonathan (18 January 2007).

          "We visited as part of an organised tour. It\u2019s a large site and takes roughly 2 hours to explore. The Warriors are in three different covered pits where ongoing archaeological digs can be seen. Have your breath taken away at the sheer number of warriors (more than 6000) all",
          "DO NOT GO HERE! Just skip it! I went on 8/15 and I had a horrible experience. I have a green health QR code but because I\u2019m a foreigner they took me out of line and and wrote down my passport number. Basess discrimination. I had to buy a physical ticket because I\u2019m not Chinese.",
          "Obviously a very impressive place. The sheer scale of the Terracotta Army can only be appreciated with a visit. This is a treasure of Chinese culture. However, the place is enormous and the number of people is really oppressing. The whole thing is very commercialised and there",
          "My wife has wanted to see the Warriors since she heard about them 20 years ago! It was well worth the wait! We would recommend getting a tour guide while you have questions and they wait outside the ticket office. We found a great one in Emily who spoke excellent English and has",
          "Visited the warriors and we were not disappointed. We had our own guide, arranged beforehand and was able to learn so much. Living in china has enabled to see so many things we thought we\u2019d never see including these. The main pit is humongous and the warriors all lined up is",
          "Imagine standing in a large shed that can fit 3 A380s side by side. Then, imagine the jets are replaced by Emperor Qin\u2019s terra-cotta army facing you. Archers, soldiers, generals, chariots and all facial expressions and features of each soldier are muddled Ina actually soldier",
          "This is definitely a must see attraction. In fact, it is worth one\u2019s while to just make a trip to Xi\u2019an to see this UNESCO world heritage site. The warriors are so life like that you can imagine the amount of effort that went into making them centuries ago. There are 3 halls",
          "To get to see one of China's most iconic sights you'll need to head to the city of Xi' An and get a bus from there which will drop you off not too far from the museum, make sure to bring enough of the local currency with you and also make sure you come at a time when the whole",
          "No visit to Xian is complete without visiting this famed world heritage site from the Qin dynasty built for the Qin Emperor (Qin Shi Huang). Take approx. 1-2 hours to visit this place.",
          "I visited the terracotta warriors on a group trip and is was amazing. I had not realised the scale of the exhibition and learning about it was fascinating. We were able to just look around but many groups were having tour guides explain more in detail about the history. It was",
          "Very crowded when we visited, not organised at all , very rude and pushy people, BUT it was a public holiday so expected I guess. Well wortht it though what an amazing site, one visit takes it all in.",
          "Quite a sight, row upon row of warriors. An unique experience. There is a theater that has a video presentation of the story behind the warriors. Well worth seeing. We were unaware that almost all of the figures were smashed by later emperors. I think only one was left intact.",
          "This is probably the main attraction in Xian. We took a bus from the railway station. had to queue up with lots of people but buses move as soon as it was full. Had to pay 120 yuan per person, but free for seniors 65 years and above. Quite interesting to see the various",
          "A collection of several thousand life-size figures, made of terracotta (burnt clay), depicting soldiers, officers and horses found in the tomb of the first Chinese emperor Qin Shi. During the funeral of the emperor in 210 BCE the whole army was also placed in underground rooms.",

          "Visited August 2017: One of the greatest archeological discoveries of modern time. An extraordinary underground treasure, an entire army of life size terrain cotta soldiers and horses interred for more than 2,000 years. A must see!",
          "The Terracotta Army museum certainly lived up to our expectations. You queue patiently through security, and then for a ticket, and then to enter the exhibition, and then to view the statues - all the time swept along in an organic seething tide of humanity. I believe my wife\u2019s",

          "A UNESCO world heritage site discovered in 1974. It has three pits with terracotta warriors supposed to be protecting the first emperor after his death. There is a free light and sound show in one of the adjacent halls. If you first see the show its easier to understand the",

          "This was one of the highlights of our trip to China and it was an awesome experience. The layout was excellent and seeing the warriors was amazing.",
          "This is what we have been traveling for almost 1.5 hours from X'ian. Amazing historical site, well preserved. You better have a guide to walk you through the various buildings. Also, do not miss the Bronze largest statues (the horses and carriages).",

          "Words cannot really show just how magnificent this museum is. We could have stayed all day and still not had enough!! Our guide Susan (from China Highlights) was a real inspiration with her knowledge and anecdotes. She let us take our time and patiently answered so many",
          "I\u2019ve been wanting to see the Terracotta warriors for years and I certainly wasn\u2019t disappointed. The history of them is brilliant, I can\u2019t wait until they uncover the rest of them, it\u2019s like a mystery jigsaw.",
          "These was on my bucket list and I have never been so scared of big crowd in my life. We went the first week of November and found out that it was the golden week. So a lot more Chinese people in the pit rooms. Very dangerous for tourists ect on the stairs. We almost got hurt and",
          "Even in the winter the museum was busy and you need to push your way to the front at times to get a good view. It must be unbearable in the summer. However, it\u2019s proper bucket list stuff and you need to take your time to properly realise just what you are looking at even with a",
          "Incredible history with these 2000 yr old statues. The condition of them is incredible. The history even more interesting. Our young boys were just as engrossed in the story and artifacts as we were. You won\u2019t be disappointed. There is also a nice little village near where you",
          "First time for me and my family to travel to Xian, China. we joined the tour for the Terracota WArriors. it was stunning. YOu are literally witnessing history. It helped a lot that our guide, Robbie, was very knowledgeable with history, and made the tour very interesting.",
          "I had the opportunity to visit Xi'an, and this was clearly the first thing on the list! There are a number of English-speaking tour companies in the city who will manage all the logistics of going and returning for you - our tour included an excellent Chinese lunch in the town",
          "Another item off the bucket list. Since this is a sacred burial site, out of respect, the living should not be in the same picture as the dead tho the temptation is great. This site required over 700,000 craftsmen to build all the various figures. Some of the figures were",
          "This place is constantly evolving, due to the workshop restructuring the artefacts and the excavations that will bring even more warriors to light. It is well organised and tour guides offer their services, which I think is good to take. My guide spoke a good English and told me",
          "We visit this sightseeing place on a saturday. The crowd was not that busy and there was enough space for everybody to look around. Only the grouptours take up a lot of space sometimes. In general it was impressive to see. We took the audioguide and it was a good general",
          "One of the wonders of the world! Everyone of them look so different and real. Words can hardly describe the feeling of going through this place. Came in winter, perhaps a low and better season to really experience this place.",
          "The Terra Cotta warriors was the highlight of our visit to Xi'an but I would be remiss if I didn't mention Celine our Tour Guide.What a personable individual.She is very knowledgeable and ever ready to please.Nothing was too much for her.From the tai chi lessons to the meal in a",
          "We had heard about the TerraCottas and thought it would be a good thing to see. Being there in person allows you to see the magnitude of the \u201carmy\u201d. The incredible work that goes into reconstructing each soldier is just amazing. Lots of air travel to get there but it\u2019s worth it.",
          "This is a must-see place. The entire layout plus the excavation done to piece together and unveil the terra-cotta warriors and chariots are mind boggling. The explanations by the guides are also very extensive and informative. Visited up a time whereby there are not too many",
          "This is indeed the work of divine intervention. The clay soldiers were so life like and each having different facial features. The kiln firing technology was exhibited to extreme heights. As there were no board explanation of the military formation, hiring a good guide is",
          "Just spectacular and everything that's said that's great about this place is true. Just seeing the real warriors live and in person simply makes us realise why it's one of thr 8 wonders of the world. Truly a visit not to be missed and a must see for everyone planning a visit to",
          "If you are interested in Chinese and world history, this is truly a remarkable place to visit. My advice would be to get here early, when it opens at 8.30 before the hordes arrive, which is around 10 am. I hired a guide and I am glad I did. I also enjoyed drinking tea above the",
          "The Terra Cotta Warriors were fascinating! As good as your expectations might have been, the actual site was much, much more fascinating and spell-binding. We could have spent much more time there than we had scheduled or allotted. Of the three \"pits\", Pit #1 is the most",
          "Highly recommend visiting this museum. So hard to believe until you see it in person...how they did this all those years ago? Incredible",
          "I was waiting a long time to visit this world heritage site and it was worth the wait. You can visit 3 pits in a well-organized setting. Pit1 is the largest and most impressive with about 1500 restored worriers as well as being an active archeological site for years to come.",

It\u2019s normally advised to prebook to avoid queues and sometimes missing the ticket due to high",

          "Very overrated tourist trap. Spent less than an hour here. 45 min ride from the city center was not worth the price of admission. Got a photo and left. The exit walk back full of overpriced cheap junk and food stalls was ridiculous. Big disappointment for sure.",

          "It is a visit worth to make. The museum was built as a cover for the site where the Terracotta warriors were found. And the work that still is being done is quite impressive. The farmer that made the discovery of the warriors in his land is still alive and present there also.",
          "It is massive, the first and most excavated is the Size of 4 football fields. It contains thousands of soldiers. The second and third buildings are still being worked. The complex is massive a whole city has developed around the soldiers. Souvenirs, restaraunts and more.",

          "This was awesome. I had no idea as to how large the site is, and it's only partially excavated. The amount of work entailed in what they have revealed so far is stunning. God knows how many more decades it will take to fully reveal this amazing site. Give yourself a decent",

          "This has to be 1 of the 2 best placed we visited on our tour in China. Our guide gave an excellent explanation of the terra-cotta warriors. But nothing prepared us for the incredible site we visited. There was a collective gasp from our group when we entered Pit 1 and saw",

          "Like so many things we have seen so far in China this is on a grand scale. It would appear that modern China is just emulating the over the top historic displays. One of the must see attractions in China and to know that there is so much more to excavate shows it is only the",

          "It was very interesting the history about the warriors and how they were buried was amazing. There were 100s of people and once you have seen the first pit then the other 2 are the same. We bought a couple of warriors there which are cheaper than other places we have seen since.",

          "Visiting Terracotta Army Museum was the highlight of my visit in Xi'an. It was just unbelievable to see all the \"life-like\" statues under several roofs. I probably took more pictures of this place than anywhere else on my recent trip to China.",
          "There is nothing else like this in the world. Impressive in every way. Start with the theater in the round film to get the historical context. Then to the pits, and on to the museum where the best artifacts are restored and beautifully displayed. TIPS: 1. Order tickets in",

          "This place is utterly fantastic. I never imagined anything so immense and dramatic. It really should be the 8th wonder of the world. People ask me what I was most impressed with during my tour of China and this is it... It's just astounding. Try to go when it's not too",

          "Every review you read tells how awesome this experience of the Terracotta Warriors is and rightly so. No matter how many photos you see or videos you watch; nothing grabs you like being present there. The crowds move and we were not flustered. A must on your bucket list!",

          "We stopped in Xian mainly to visit the Terracotta Warriors, but in addition to that outstanding exhibit, we found much to like in Xian. The walk/climb up to the old City Wall was very interesting, with the approach subway arcade featuring many photos of visits from dignitaries",
          "This was one of several awesome adventures for our family in China this summer - but it is this one that continues to ignite the most excitement and curiosity. We camped on the great wall, ate all the dumplings, and visited a dozen impeccable parks and palaces. Admittedly, China",
          "this mausoleum must visit, this is one of the world heritage site almost 600 years of age. The collection of terracotta sculptures are amazing.... we took alot of pictures",
          "We went to the The Museum of Terracotta Warriors and Horses as part of a tour of China. Wow. We were looking forward to going and I had done a lot of reading before going about the site but when we got there it was beyond my wildest expectations! I could have spent a day",
          "This is incredible. You read about it but until you are there you just don\u2019t realise the scale of this and the amount of work to be done. Worth going with a guide. We went with shangra-la hotel who organised this. Great day with penny",
          "You know what this place is about. You've seen pictures with enough detail and possibly a documentary out two. However, the sight of this is still something else. As we were traveling with kids we went to the hotel and joined a tour group. Half the trip was wasted taking us to a",
          "We found the extent and detail of the terracotta warriors almost unbelievable. Having seen the travelling exhibition in the UK, we were really not prepared for what is such an amazing historical sight. To see the sheer number of warriors, horses etc, and to be so aware in situ",
          "One of the highlights of our tour. No matter how many pictures you may have seen it is impossible to capture the vastness of the warrior exhibits in three different settings. This work in progress will only improve over time.",
          "You can't help but be \"blown away\" when you first see vastness of the multitude of soldier-statues. It definitely is ine of the man-made wonders of the world. Ofcourse, this is why you are in Xi'an...and you will noit be disappointed.Simply astoshing!!",
          "Well worth dealing with the crowds and the heat to see this piece of history, absolutely incredible and amazing.",
          "We visited using a local tour company arranged by the hotel. We visited on a Monday morning, so not too many people. Museum is laid out in 3 large hangers. The first one had the largest display, and was the most crowded. Excellent display of mostly intact soldiers and horses.",
          "The Terra-cotta Warrior exhibit is stunning. No matter how much you read about this exhibit it still takes your breath away at the massive undertaking of building all the statues. The details of each warrior is truly amazing. It's a different exhibit that you really need to",
          "Great viewing opportunities with elevated walkway. Easy to take lots of photos. The warriors and horses are truly amazing.",
          "We spent 4 hrs pushing and shuving in a sea of people trying to see the terracotta army. We paid about 250 euros to get to the town (hotel, flights, buses, entrance fees) to see zero!! If there would have been panic or a stampede we would have been killed! So that shows you how",
          "Jaw dropping, amazing history is a must see if you go to Xi'an, China. So amazing the work that was done, the warriors that were built and the archaeologists that are bringing them to life. The 8th Wonder of the World - you have to go",
          "An amazing collection of artifacts made by wonderful craftsmen. Fascinating to see how the restoration is being carried out.",
          "Rita Jiang, China Discovery, after a request from my wife, planned a two week trip for us to Beijing, Xi'An, Shanghai and a Three Gorges boat cruise on the Yangtze river. We opted for the organised daily group activities which made us feel secure and required no effort form our",
          "This is a must see for any visitor to China. Unfortunately, we visited during the celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the republic so it was terribly crowded. The shopping mall on exit is an experience in itself.",
          "It is really not that interesting. A lot of people, very touristy, you have to stand super far from the army and overall it's just not that impressive. Easily my worst experience in China. Not worth the time it takes to get there",
          "Terracotta Warriors Museum was an extraordinary experience, to see a 2200 year old history was more special when you meet the farmer who discovered it. Recommend",
          "So,this farmer decides to dig up a well in his property and stumbles upon rows of clay warriors . How incredible is that ? We went there on a Saturday and the place was swarming with people. If you are patient enough, wait for a couple of minutes to get to the aisles and you can",
          "Not in my wildest dreams could I ever have envisaged the extent of this tomb. I remain in awe. There are loads of people but it is simply spectacular and well worth the crowds and the pushing and shoving! Just be patient, the tour groups do move on and you will have an",
          "The Terracotta Warriors did not disappoint. We went during China National Holiday so it was very busy. They area was very organized and quickly moved the crowds thru the Pit areas. You can\u2019t be shy, you have to push your way to front to get pictures.",
          "We have seen pictures of the terra cotta warriors, but had never thought, that it was so big. And they are still working on pieces. It will take years. Fantastic history about the finding of the soldiers. And fantastic history about the emperor, who ordered this done. And yes,",
          "Not to be missed when in Xian. Amazing to see how they are going about unearthing this which was commissioned by an emperor to protect him during the afterlife.",
          "This is an extraordinary experience and you'll feel like a warrior after you battle the crowds to get to the railing to see the warriors. A guide is highly recommended -- they can get you in and out before you're crushed. Maybe. I am absolutely recommending you see this but I'm",
          "Why go to Xi an? Historical City but main attraction is the Terrakotta Army Museum. You have not been to China if you have not been here",
          "It's a fascinating piece of history... and an experience to see. The main problem is that with the throngs of people, it's hard to get a look. You push your way to the front, and see that the statues are still not close to you, you look for a few seconds, then get pushed out of",
          "What an extremely interesting place. We learnt that you could either do this independently or on a tour either which will get you to the same place and see the same sights. The terracotta warriors are truly fascinating but I was personally left feeling-was that it! Do not be",
          "Granted this might be sacrilegious, but I've been twice and each time come away completely underwhelmed. Granted, the most recent trip was during October Chinese holiday (don't, just dont go then) and it was dangerously over-crowded. They need to restrict entry at times like",
          "Seeing and being in this awesome site is unbelievable. Definitely a MUST do when you are in Xian and it is about 1 hour drive from the city. There is a big crowd when we arrive so go early.",
          "It is a must visit site in Xian it is so awesome and still the site is been explored. It is big complex one would marvel the magnitude of work and artistry and formation etc. Mind boggling.",
          "From Xi'an railway station take 306 bus to terracotta warrior museum as it's a direct bus and it's one of the amazing places which I have seen more than 7000 terracotta statues are here .",
          "Wow thus didn\u2019t disappoint. Yes there are crowds to deal with but be patient and you can see all you need to see across the 3 pits. We had the advantage of a guide in Pit 1 (Sophie) who added to the understanding and enjoyment. The place is just fascinating and the more you see",
          "The three pits were easily accesses able,queing was well laid out,no1 pit the one we see on all shots of the Warriors. When you entre you will not believe the enormous pits containing the excavated figures,plus horses,One hour in here,photos aloud. No2,and no3 pits are",
          "I have rarely seen anything so interesting and so revealing of the ancient history of a culture. We are so privileged to have seen this exhibit which must truly rank among the wonders of the world.",
          "The history behind this museum is nothing but amazing, to think no 2 are the same. What a task for the archaeologists, the world thanks you all.",
          "Pictures just don't convey the scale of this site. I have been waiting to see the Terra Cotta Warriors since they were discovered in 1974 but I was amazed at how being there changed my perception of the site.",
          "We came on a very rainy day and were met in the parking lot by sellers offering umbrellas and shoe covers. If you wear sneakers or other non-waterproof shoes and it is wet, get the shoe covers. There's a lot of outdoor walking, along with indoor. I was happy with a waterproof",
          "Okay, you've seen it on TV...but you cannot appreciate it until you see it in person. There is more to this site than what you've seen. This entire site is phenomenal! Trust Me!",
          "One cannot visit Xi_An without visiting the Terra-cotta warriors museum. Incredible to learn that the discovery took place by chance by farmers digging a nearby field in search for water...Our guide spared no energy to explain everything about the pits, discoveries, present work",
          "The fact that mere farmers stumbled upon and uncovered these warriors is astounding! Seeing how many there are is amazing. You can get pretty close to the encased ones, but the ones in rows you\u2019ll still be a little ways from. The crowds here were pretty bad so I would suggest an",

          "It is really incredible to see the Terracotta Army Museum. I have spent three hours there and taken a lot of wonderful photos. Anyone who comes to Xian should not miss the site. Of course, no one wants to miss it. I took a day tour and learned the history from the guide,",
          "So glad I finally got to see these. Just breathtaking. Lots to see there, well worth the visit & still excavating.",
          "Truly special place. You can go through on a guided tour but honestly much of the information you can read yourself. Highly recommended you get there early to avoid the crowds.",
          "This is undoubtedly a fantastic landmark. It is quite mind-blowing to see the famed Terra-Cotta Warriors up close but then again I am quite mystified by all things ancient and mysterious. The trip from the bus station in Xi'an to the site is quite painless and entry is well",
          "this was an amazing experience and well worth a visit, with a good tour guide you will understand why so many are broken..",
          "this museum is so fantastic that it's almost unbelievable. To think that this was all build hundreds of years ago is almost unimaginable - you have to see it to believe it.",
          "This was very interesting and informative of their culture not to be missed. I wasn't disappointed coming here",
          "Saw the travelling exhibit in Chicago several years ago. What a spectacular discovery. Museum is set up very well and you can visualize what it must have been like over 2000 years ago. Amazing discovery just 40 years ago.",
          "There is only one non-Chinese word in their language, and that is Terra-cotta. As our guide explained, the Chinese could not come up with a word in Chinese to describe this magnificent site. The shear size of the area is mind boggling, then you find out that they\u2019ve only dug up",
          "This is a truly amazing experience. Nothing prepares you for the enormity of the building and what you see within it. We arrived in the morning and it was crowded. But if you you just take your time you will get to the front and be able to take awesome photos. Amazing.",
          "Very good tour. Very exceptional guide James. Very interesting and lots of different parts to look at. Spent around 4 hours there.",
          "Its amazing that they first found out about this around 40 years ago... Even tho it most likely have existed here for thousands of years! Well, it is history, so if you are interested in that kind of thing you should definitely visit!",

          "This is a must see take your time and go around this. In peak season this place becomes busy and ques for ages. The 1st pit has the most in it take your time in this one. There are plenty of food vendors outside the area and a cafe inside with alot of places to buy some books",

          "We visited the TC Warriors in May on a weekday, which we were told was a light attendance day. If that is the case, go on a weekday, because it was packed. The statues are amazing in detail and you will find your mind asking so many \"why\", \"how\"...questions. It is very well",
          "The vastness of the area was hard to comprehend. We had no idea it was as big and laid out beautifully for everyone to see. The variety of the figures and horses was incredible.",
          "Impressive. Puzzling. Awe inspiring. The incredible detail is astonishing. Do not expect to get close to them. You are looking down into the pits at them, standing in lines. Very crowded but well worth the effort.",
          "Let's face it, everyone comes to Xi'an for one thing only - the warriors. Boy does it not disappoint, well worth a day of anyone's time. Pit 1 is the largest, and most famous, be you also get pits 2, 3 & 4, along with exhibits of chariots in another building. Words can't",

          "Our group of 16 travelled by coach through the countryside to the site. Quite a long walk around the site to reach the entrance to the archaeological site, but worth every step! On my bucket list for many years the Terracotta Warriors exceeded my expectations - took many photos.",
          "First time visit to this place. Will definitely go back to spend more time there. Really amazing and eye-opening experience. We had a very good chinese speaking tour manager assigned to 2 of us. Make sure you get one. So interesting to listen and learn so much about Qin Shi",
          "Amazing place and so much history it\u2019s impossible to take it all in. You will need a guide to explain all the exhibits. As others have said before the place is a reasonable distance from the city (an hour or so). It\u2019s quite a large complex but it\u2019s relatively straight forward.",
          "This is definitely a must see when visiting China. I had seen pictures but was blown away by the scale of the site. The tremendous amount of work that went into making all of the figures is unfathomable. We went with a private tour which was the best way to see it. Our",
          "I really enjoyed the place, a lot os interesting history about both the terracotta army and the emperor. The kids were bored... Do read about the army and the emperor beforehand, but a mustsee!",
          "It's very crowded, and if you do not have an English speaking guide to explain things to you, you may lose a lot of history.",
          "1- Entry fees : 120 RMB for adults ( per person), children gets FREE entry, you can buy the ticket on the spot. 2- Don't go there very early in the morning : The place is very crowded, many tourists go there all year round, don't expect the place to be less crowded at any other",
          "Excellent to see. Much better in real life. It\u2019s best to get a guide it only costs about \u00a325 otherwise it\u2019s easy to skip thru in a hour or so without getting the history of the place. Also if the guide take you to jewellery shops do not buy!!",
          "This is one of the places I definitely wanted to visit while in China. It was amazing! It is just incredible that this army of soldiers, archers and horses has been there for more than 2000 years. Every statue is unique. There are currently 3 pits you can visit. Excavation and",
          "In general, forming queues and taking turns does not seem to be valued in Chinese culture. Where there are going to be a lot of people, such as boarding the subway or seeing an exhibit, you have two choices: be patient, understand that this is cultural and not personal, and in",
          "I saw the terracotta army on the discovery channel when I was young and I always dream that one day I would visit this place.My dream was actually fulfilled some 40+years later and was so happy standing in front of the main hall ;looking at these awesome army statues. This place",
          "The Warriors themselves are absolutely phenomenal, but the experience of this place is torturous. Entering the first building and descending into the basement, people find themselves in a very dark room completely crowded with people jostling their way forward to take blurry",
          "So firstly I need to say the terracotta army itself is amazing and a must see. There's nothing much more to say about them. Pit 1 is the main attraction so aim to check this out first. The issues come in with a) being a foreigner b) the signage. So as a foreigner living in China",
          "Wow. Words cannot describe what there is to see here. Absolutely amazing place. If you have difficulty walking long distances you should utilize the wheelchair service that is available. It is very helpful and handy",
          "Great history and culture site but extremely crowded with lots of pushy people. Try to get there earlier and learn to be pushy yourself or you will see nothing but people.",
          "Please go supper early, like, as soon as they open. If you wait at all by 1000 am it will be so crowded you have to fight your way through the exhibits to just take a few photos. Also, I recommend going during the spring or fall. Don't make my mistake, I went during July,",
          "I have wanted to see the Terracotta Warriors since word of their discovery got out. Twenty years ago, I saw a small touring exhibit of them in Johannesburg, South Africa. and when I say small, I mean small, less than ten statues and a few artifacts. The neat thing, though, was",
          "We travelled to the Terracotta Army via the bus from the railway station Cost 7 yuan each way Just get to the station and turn right Bus 306 and join the queue Better to go early The entrance to pit 1 is the most busy but worth the wait to see this most impressive army",
          "One of the MOST interesting and best museums I ever visited (and I visit lots of them...). Just take in mind: it is VERY crowded (around 60000 visitors per day) and in most of the pits there is no air condition - so be prepared.",
          "The moment you arrived you feel taken back to the times of the first emperor of China. So much history and so much to see. I wished I had read up on the history before I went to Lintong. However I made up for it and did a lot of reading on it after. today I am still overwhelmed",
          "Definitely one of the wonders of the world, why did the Emperor do this ? Go and see it , you will be amazed",
          "What an amazing experience, it has to be on the list of places to visit, we went during the summer period, expect temps to be high within the grounds of the terra cotta warriors, a lot of walking is involved but worth every step.",
          "Don\u2019t hesitate\u2014this tour is great. No shopping and very flexible. Mr John is super friendly and a good driver. Rosa is knowledgeable, funny, and knows how to navigate the crowds. Five stars!!",
          "I was here in the late 70s and was amazed at the changes in the place. It\u2019s quite a walk from the entrance to the warrior site but there is a shuttle for those not wanting to walk. It is really busy especially the chariot area. For those wanting to travel independently there are",
          "Not much to say about this Wonder of the World. It\u2019s a must-some bucket list experience unlike any other.",
          "We went with a guide (thankfully) along with three small children and my mother. There was a fair bit of walking initially and we found the crowds quite challenging but overall a good site. The scale can be evidenced by the number of shops and restaurants around the site. A",
          "I've been reading about this place my whole life, but nothing can prepare you for the impression when you see real terracotta army right in front of you! It's easy to get there from Xi'an by local buses which departure all the time, or by a taxi. The fact that all those",
          "Spectacular. Worth the hour and a half drive. Be mindful of big crowds....up to 38,000 per day. The locals can be very pushy. Make sure you take toilet paper as it\u2019s often not provided......limited western style toilet facilities.",
          "I have nothing new to say about the Terra-cotta warriors that isn\u2019t already reviewed, just want to warn other travelers not to stray from the white 306 public bus! We were in the (long) line for the white 306 bus to take us to the warriors, when someone dressed as safety patrol",
          "Great visit! Loved everything about the trip. Takes your breath away. Avoid summer days. I was there when it was 100 degrees F. Avoid it. But other than that awesome. Only need 2-3 hours maxz",
          "One of the most important place to visit if you are travelling to China. A live proof of Chinese dynasty.",

          "If you in the Xi'an area, it's a must-see. If you're in China, you need to make every effort to get here as it's absolutely stunning. Of course, I have read about this site in the past, but seeing it in person was really something. If you go during the peak season (summer), be",

          "I visited the Terracotta Warrior museum with my grandparents and my tour guide. The 1 star rating was earned due to us being able to see just how big it was and how the archeologists have been able to piece the warriors back together. If that had not been the case then I",
          "This is one of the places what is must see when visiting Xi\u2019an. Amazing what human hands ja done. Go early morning the ticket selling starts 08:30 and from downtown takes about 1h via taxi.",
          "We visited this place during our trip around China! It is very beautiful, we were told a lot about its history by our tour guide Sara which was awesome and it is definitely a place you have to see once in life.",
          "this site is so amazing and a good job with restoration. was very crowded, but worth it. see all three sites",
          "A must- experience site for all ages. Be aware that the crowds can make it difficult to jockey in to see everything and impossible to linger anywhere. But maybe that\u2019s only in summer, when we e visited. Still worth it.great place for shopping for presents to bring home.",
          "This was one of the highlights of our trip to China. It was difficult to navigate through the huge crowds, but a little bit of aggression helped us get up close to see into the pits. There are 3 pits that have been partially excavated. But work has halted until they can improve",
          "In summertime, the crush of crowds makes what should be a spectacular intake of an icon of world culture quite an ordeal. It\u2019s worth it, if only to say you have done it and survived. Fortunately, we had a private driver. Dealing with transport to fet out and back and resist",
          "I am of the view that Xian Terracotta warriors are China's greatest tourist attraction after the Great Wall of China. My impression is I was stunned and amazed.",
          "Well worth the travel to see the warriors, they were amazing . Avoid any Chinese public holidays as they get ultra busy and it is difficult to see as there are big crowds of people. Lots of food in the area to buy. A great day out.",
          "Our tour group visited here while in Xi'an and it was definitely worth the visit. While we only visited Pit 1, having a guide to explain what we were seeing was invaluable. There are interpretative signs, but the guide was able to point out other things. Pit 1 is a huge",
          "If you start in Pit 3, which you probably will because it's the largest, don't be put off if its so crowded at the front entrance. It's a most incredible view and people jostle to see it. But the crowds thin out from there and there is plenty to see in this hangar size",
          "An amazing site. You don\u2019t need too much time 1-2 hours at MOST but get their EARLY - seriously - when they open. The crowds (especially in the summer) are like DISNEY on STEROIDS. You will get \u201ctrampled\u201d if you don\u2019t get in and get out. Also - get a PRIVATE GUIDE - they",

We got the bus from train station (\u00a32 each) and left our bags in left luggage. Took hour to reach the site and we got a",
          "Walking into that first site (the size of an airport hangar!) took my breath away. It's the stuff you see on documentaries on the TV. Never in a million years did I think I'd see it in person, it's just spectacular! Sharpen your elbows when you head to see the atrowman found",
          "Everyone knows about the Terracotta Warriors, therefore no one wants to visit Xi'an and miss coming here. The entire place runs off reputation though. It's not really a museum, it's three covered pits and a very poor exhibition gallery (plus the park and mausoleum that you'll",

          "We came here as it was on our bucket list and probably the main reason people come to Xi'an. The crowds are huge and the warriors are spread across 3 different halls, with poor A/C, so it gets both crowded and hot. The 1st hall contains the most warriors in large lines, the",

          "One of the magnificent archaeological finds in the world - more than 7,000 life-size terracotta figures of warriors and horses arranged in battle formations. Wonderful experience! It is a must see attraction in Xian, and would need at least half a day. Recommend the fast &",
          "Came here with Wendy Wu tours. Great experience and not to be missed if you are visiting China. It was crowded but I was able to get a good look at the warriors.",
          "Part of our recent tour to China was to visit the warriors in Xi'an. What a magic place and completely mind blowing. Xi'an itself is a lovely place and worth a trip but visiting the Terracotta Warriors was a wonderful experience. If you get a chance take it.",
          "This was the second visit to this magnificent place, the first visit was in 1993 and how much has changed since!!",
          "Wow! What an amazing place! How were these wonderful warriors made considering the tools and equipment available back then! Unbelievable! A great museum to visit!",
          "We visited Xi'an and the Terracotta Warriors in a 24 hour trip. We arrived by train. We booked a local guide David Zhang his contact is: davidxatour@163.com It was a busy day, but we saw everything. Xi'an is beautiful at night, the walled city is lit up with yellow and red",
          "This was one of those life altering experiences. Marvelling at these figures was amazing and the story behind these figures even more amazing. We thought the Great Wall was sensational and it was however viewing these warriors was even more sensational.",
          "This certainly was a once in a lifetime experience for us (I went with a tour). There is still work to do (to recover more pieces) and it looks like it might take another decade or two to do so. However, whatever has been discovered so far is impressive. If you are in China, I",
          "This truly was an amazing experience. Hard to imagine without seeing first hand. We were led by a tour guide so makes the experience more enjoyable.",
          "You won't believe how fantastic this attraction is until you've seen it. For all the pix you've seen, the scale still comes as a surprise and only about a third of the site has so far been excavated. There are three separate museums on the site but the main one houses the",
          "I would recommend having a tour. The crowds are insane and it helps to have someone guide you around and also explain each pit and many of the details. I would arrive when the gates open. It\u2019s get very crowded.",
          "What a wonderful experience and we also met the one surviving farmer who initially found the warriors whilst digging a well",
          "A highlight of any China trip will be the Terracotta Warriors and Horses. These statues are truly amazing and almost impossible to conceive the how and why. They are awe-inspiring and majestic!! We took a private tour which made the day easy and allowed us to go at our own pace",
          "Amazing. Hard to believe the scale until you've seen thousands of unique soldiers standing silently at attention. Almost as amazing is the crush of crowds at the entry way! But the crowds give way as you move to the side of the display. I'd head for the chariot building first to",
          "I had a great tour with only a few people, better than just a big bus load of strangers. Each of us were from all over the world with one thing in common -- to see the Terra Cotta Warriors. By the end of the tour, we talked as if we have been friends all of our lives --",
          "We had a great time once inside the attraction. The Warriors are amazing and the audio guide was quite informative. However, getting there/back and the site grounds are not tourist friendly if you are not with a tour group.",
          "Was on the bucket list and now ticked off .Was incredible to learn the story of the lucky farmer .However the guy who originally made the discovery died last year so who is that signs the books after you buy them .Another Chinese money spinner oh s the shops but the museum",
          "I think it helps to read something about the history behind visiting. We had a guide and I would highly recommend using one. It was very busy and we visited early morning. Sometimes difficult in places to get decent photos due to the crowds but an amazing site.",
          "Absolutely amazing spectacle and piece of history. The restoration process is nearly as amazing as the original Terracotta Warriors. There are plenty of restaurants nearby",
          "If you are in China you cannot miss this top sight which is well laid out with plenty of signage. There are many beautifully restored warriors and some horses and there are three different sections to see and compare. Chinese archeology department should be pleased with",
          "Although it poured with rain all day the trip to inspect the \u201cwarriors\u201d was absolutely worth it. Clearly it is an ongoing work in progress with much excavation and restoration work still to be done. That said the meticulous work so far has uncovered the greatest find of the",
          "Should be on everyone's bucket list! There are 3 main pits which have got to be seen to be believed, The first pit - the biggest also has a marking on the side where the farmer found the first warrior whilst digging a well, but did not tell anyone about it. It is amazing to see",
          "Absolutely fantastic! Definitely worth taking a day tour as you learn so much about each pit. It's extremely busy so try to get their early.",

          "This is obviously one of those places you have on your global checklist, and is probably the reason you\u2019re in Xian, so the expectations are easily high. We however, were very impressed, and in many regards found the experience over expectations. First of all, make sure you have",
          "Even with all the photos you see nothing compared to seeing it in person. Tip is to get there first thing in the morning to try and avoid the crowds. We also had a tour guide which we really helpful as she explained so much as we walked around. The main hall was incredible with",
          "What a display! you should look away from the crowds just \u201cthink them away\u201d and you\u2019l have a once in a lifetime experience. Something I had several times in China by the way. It is mind-blowing what this discovery shows about the history of China.",
          "Clich\u00e9 title, but really - discovered only by accident in 1974 - you need to read a good book on the First Emperor to appreciate the whole site - maybe a good guide will do justice. Not 5 stars as the beautiful and well appointed museum don't do much more than display the",
          "Extremely crowded! Everybody pushes. No tripods or flash allowed. You are a long way from the Terra-cotta Warriors, shooting down most of the time. See the above photo.That's a Wide Angle lens. My 10-24 Tamron,shots look the same. No Detail. I can't seem to be able to post mine",
          "The main reason why I visited Xi'An, to visit the terracotta army. It is crowded with tourist, but you will manage to get closer to the terracotta army once the batches of tourist move away.",

          "We spent the morning exploring the The Muesum of Qin Terracotta Warriors and an absolute amazing experience, we were fortunate it wasn\u2019t extremely busy when we went although still plenty of tourists. Well we\u2019ll set out, and very touristy is some parts. Well worth the visit",
          "Well worth a visit The warriors are all being rebuilt. Grounds are beautiful. The hall of various stages of restoration are very interested. Such defication",
          "Such a great place to visit. Its hard to wrap your head around how there are so many soldiers buried in the ground and why sometimes, but this place is amazing. There is so much history here. I would suggest a tour guide if you don't speak Chinese, because I don't remember",
          "We went in February and while it was cold walking the grounds, you are inside most of the time. Hire a tour guide. The crowds other times of the year can be so overwhelming that you will have a hard time seeing all of the pits and I\u2019m not sure there is any air conditioning.",
          "The easiest and the cheapest way is go to Xian railway station and find the bus terminal in front of Xian tourist information booth. Look for the white bus No 306 and board the bus which will take you straight to the terracota warrior museum in 1 hour. You pay only 7 Rmb per pax",
          "It lived up to the hype\u2026 We had a private tour guide who was very informative but I noticed there was very little information in the mausoleums/ museums if you were flying solo, so would pick up leaflets or audio guide to get the full experience because the history is",
          "you should go further than the first stunning view in front of the army. The place is big enough and have a look at eg the warriors in hospital beds they are restoring ! It is hard to figure out why this emperor started to prepare his burial 30 years before he died , had these",
          "We were dropped of at bus parking area and walked about 15 minutes to the 1st pit. There is 3 pits to walk through. Pit 1 houses most of the warriors (about 1600) Pit 3 shows mostly warriors still in pieces under restoration and Pit 2 you see mostly mounds of clay and trenches",
          "Wendy Wu national guide - Ivan - arranged all the transport and tickets, which saved us a lot of time in queueing (we had faster access into the site). When we arrived inside the covered area where the first pit of soldiers, horses and chariots are displayed, it really does take",
          "This is the reason for visiting Xi'an - apparently for everyone. The main pavilion was very crowded and it was difficult to find places to see the warriors and to take pictures. While it was not a weekend there were a large number of school groups visiting. They were well",

          "This has to be considered the eighth man-made wonder of the world! I would put this workmanship against any of the other wonders. Amazing that this army was built 210 BC! Kudos to the scientists who put these Humpty Dumptys back together again! Seamlessly!",

So, try to go during the less busy season and definitely avoid Chinese holidays, but it's absolutely worth the effort to see the real terracotta warriors!!!",

I don't even want to know what it would have been like on one of the busy days where it wasn't raining or during the busy season.",

Buy your ticket there. No need for any tour package",

          "This is not to be missed if you are in Xi'an.  Walking into pit #1 I was blown away.  You can visit 3 of the pits, but #1 has the best reconstructed Warriors.  The other pits show the condition as they are excavated.  We arrived at opening time and were able to see everything before the crowds arrived.",

          "While it's awesome to see these thousands of clay warriors, we must also reflect on the audacity of the emperor requiring hundreds of thousands of people to work on his tomb. Before you arrive, read up on the history of how and why this \u2026",

          "Timing is everything.   My timing was off.  There just before end of summer school holidays and crowds were overwhelming.   Would hate to be in the area and not go there but a NatGeo program might be more meaningful",
          "It is amazing to see the size of the site where the warriors are buried! They have excellent displays of some of the best examples so you can get a close look. There are also areas where they reassemble the pieces. There wasn't anyone working during the national holiday when I was there. Very crowded and expensive souvenir shops!",

          "This amazing find stands up to the anticipation.",
          "There are about 3 halls. The main hall is the only one worth seeing, the others are a repeat with less soldiers. Nice place to visit if you're going to Xi'an",
          "It was nice to see the warriors in person.  I was hoping to see some with the reconstructed colors that I had read about.  Especially anything relating to Han Purple or Han Blue which are really exotic chemicals.",
          "Awesome place with awesome history! Can only be one of its kind",
          "The terracotta museum is no wonder termed the eighth wonder of the world. The thousands of armies lined up, smiling, head held high, the honor and pride reflecting on their faces and their postures is a sight to behold.\nBeware of the crazy \u2026",

          "Seing this museum first gave us more insight and understanding of the terracotta warriors.",
          "A unique museum, nicely arranged. Although I have been there about 25 times before, I always feel awe whenever I visit it. I thoroughly enjoyed it, in spite of the HUGE crowds of noisy tourists",
          "Thousands years old terracotta yet still standing until today. Beautifully craft. The technology and craftmanship is incomparable. Ticket price is reasonable. Staff on site is helpful and friendly. Clean rest room. Recomended for kids and family! 100% edutainment!",

          "Amazingly well done but it takes a while to get there.",
          "The Museum of Qin Terracotta Warriors and Horses West Gate is definitely worth the track over to Xi'an if you have the time. The iconic Terracotta Warriors do not disappoint. They were amazing to see up close and read about this history \u2026",

          "Very interesting historic place with very knowledgeable your guides",
          "Very impressive place. Pay attention on those strange pits between rows of warriors are real tombs of peasants. Ancient officials allowed to bury peasants there in order to keep the place with terracotta army in secret.",

          "Simply amazing!  Also take time to go by the farmers house just outside the entrance that discovered the warriors digging a well.   Truly a sweet hospitable humble man for being the most famous farmer in the world.",
          "Need to be really careful not to misplace your ticket after entry. There will be another entrance that will require you to show the ticket again. This spoilt the entire experience as you need to buy another ticket to go into the second area, when it is impossible to enter the first area anyway.",
          "I understand how pathetic my 3 stars look considering how recognisable the monument is, its enormous scale, its historical significance, thousands of lives sacrificed to build it and the fact that after this review I could never go back to \u2026",
          "The history speaks for itself. Then we all had a fantastic feed. Made for a unforgettable day",
          "Amazing place. We spent over 6 hours walking around. There are large crowds but you can time them for viewing as most move in large groups as part of a tour.  We went there with a tour but decided to stay longer as the tour was for only two \u2026",

          "If you really want to see people. Clay ones and real ones...... I can't stress enough that this place is CROWDED! It is packed to the brim. If you do manage to squeeze yourself through the crowd to see the warriors, then good for you. But \u2026",

          "Amazing, crowds can be challenging",
          "An amazing piece of history. To see 1000 of the 7000 statues and how old they are is impressive.\n\nAbsolutely worth visiting just try and go when there aren't many tours so weekdays and get there early.\n\nDoesn't take too long to see it all. The main pit is the most impressive. You could easily fit this in a half day if you needed to.",

          "It's kinda cool, but not as good as what they show on TV. You can't get up close to the actual warriors, so in another building you can see a standard artifact behind a glass barrier. For archeologists this must be great. The audio tour \u2026",
          "Good place to visit and learn but it is so busy",
          "Wow! What an amazing place to visit. Don't miss this historical wonder",
          "A lot of clay warriors. And even more people to look at them. There is a strong effort to provide english explanations, just sometimes I would have wished for more or deeper information.",
          "One of the 8 wonders of the world, the terracotta warriors are impressive especially those in pit #1. The mausoleum of the Qin First Emperor is rather disappointing though.",
          "a wonderful museum, I would recommend read up and NOT use a guide who will waste your money and time",
          "It's a done it checklist place. Not a history buff. The figurines each has a unique face. Gray. In a giant ditch. Very crowded. Did not give me the wow factor",

          "To much people in lines. Historically interesting but didn\u2019t gave me that much anything else.",
          "World Wonder no doubt, have to see them close enough with your own eyes.",
          "This was quite excellent and the second time I have visited. It really is a wonder of the world and I would recommend anyone going to China to check it out. For foreigners be wary though, it gets *very* busy. Be prepared to to abandon all \u2026",
          "A must see. Amazing.",
          "This place is amazing!!  I think the thing I found most refreshing is the level of care and protection afforded to this most amazing piece of history.  Something you just see to take yourself back thousands of years.",
          "Amazing. Too much to take in in one visit. Pictures do not compare to being there.",
          "Unbelievable clay work 2000+ years back . Over 8000 figures each with a different face & body build . Excavations still in progress . Mystery of history continues .",
          "Amazing. Go early to try and avoid crowds.",
          "Explicit and truly well done. The Chinese have really done well to preserve this national treasure.\n\nIt's a whole days activity. Even though I went on a very busy day, everything was very smooth. It was crowded, but the Museum had the capacity to take it all.",

          "So much history.  Well worth going",
          "Good information by QR code, sadly it\u2019s only in Chinese. You must download english wikipedia and read it. Toilets are really hard to find. Restaurants around here are expensive, but they also provide toilets at some shops. Super bad thing is hazardous pollution , you must prepare masks.",
          "Must get a tour guide to explain the historical aspect. Makes its more interesting",
          "Very nice place to visit.  I did it by myself from Xi'an.",
          "Breathtaking, highly recommend using a guide since it's more enlightening than just seeing a bunch of clay dolls",
          "I gave 3 stars because its a historically\nsignificant site. And never go around Chinese holidays.",
          "Super Nice! Amazing",
          "Worth the 7000 mile trip. Looks just like it does in the history books. Would recommend to avoid going on a Chinese holiday as it can get amazingly crowded.",
          "The terracotta sculptures witness the unparalleled feat of craftsmanship, mathematical precision and engineering . Nothing is omitted.",
          "A guide is highly recommended as there are few signage for explanation. Chinese speaking guides can be easily found at the entrance. The level of detail on the terracotta army is insane.",

          "Incredible place. Crowed.",
          "Very cool. But soooooo crowded.",
          "Our tour guide made the experience amazing. The staff there are helpful and friendly, and even gave us a service survey in order to pinpoint where they could do better. It was a culturally rich experience and I will definitely be visiting again.",
          "It's hard to relate a star rating to such an important site. In my case, I'm rating it out of what it could be, and not it's pure value because that would give it an unfair advantage given what it is. But this is nice - touristy and pricey \u2026",
          "Unbelievable place to visit. Seeing it on TV or films doesn't do it justice, you have to go there if you get the chance to appreciate the size of the army.  To think this all came about from a farmer digging a well for water for his farm. Like all attractions in China the place is immaculate and we'll run.",
          "Had never been there before until now...what an experience!! Had heard about how finely sculpted were these statues and when I looked at them closely, my goodness how on earth they did it over thousand years ago with limited tools!!",

          "One off the bucket list...interesting historical time",
          "We hired an English speaking tour guide that was very helpful.  If we didn't have him, I think there is a lot of important information we wouldn't have learned.  There are many nice buildings. Spoiler alert-I didn't know that the warriors had all been smashed a very long time ago",

          "Historical!people who loved history should come here",

          "Great warriors, understand the bigger history of China with this place.",
          "Like the pictures you can see online, but more crowded and with a worse view.",
          "The museum is amazing. The history in this place is something that you have to see to appreciate. Is incredible.",
          "Very cool.   The site is enormous and was a highlight of my trip.  Find the side street where the farmer who discovered it has a shop-He will autograph a book and shake your hand for 150 Yuan (as of the writing of this review).",

          "Had a blast here learning more about my culture. Get a tour guide so you learn everything. Do not go in month of July - go in May or June or anytime before because July is when students are on break. Gift shop says that they sell Terra \u2026",

          "Fabulous place, the scale of the whole undertaking is amazing. We took the local bus 306 tourist bus 5 from the North Railway Station which was super easy. Look for the bus that know one is trying to hustle you on as the fake ones have the same number signs. It's much more of an urban bus then a coach but for \u00a57 it's a bargin",

          "The main shopping street in the Muslim Quarter is fantastic - loads of shops selling street food lots of noise and great atmosphere. Really good inside market are adjoining it. Very close to city centre, but strangely not mentioned by tour guide.",
          "While the Muslim Quarter is really only a two block long shopping street, it's like New York's Chinatown compressed into a small space. This seems to be the center of knockoffs. Here's proof positive that China is not interested in anyone's copyright laws. Whatever electronic",
          "We came here as a big group of tourists on a coach, which was waiting for us outside, so we did not have enough time to explore it properly. We had a nice walk to the top and back and did buy some bargains. You have to really negotiate prices and they will drop 80% of asking",
          "This is an great place to go shopping for souvenirs, food, food, and more food. Plenty of street vendors. Be a bit careful on what you since some of the vendors have been there all day , but overall good experience even if all you do is walk around.",

          "This is one busy and fun market/bazaar. There is a wide variety of products and food to see and sample. People watching is also excellent here. Look for the narrow alley leading to the Mosque",
          "Interesting smells, sites, and goods on sale. Definitely a must if visiting Xian, however the market is not as good as the last time I visisted China which was ten years ago so the cheap markets with good knock offs maybe a thing of the past. But defintiey a few good bargains",
          "So much delicious food to choose from. There was so much street food to choose from. Great experience!",
          "We visited in the evening after a long day of walking around in Xi'an. The market with its fragrant food, siizzling meat skewers and the bustle was in instant pick-me-up. We had the dumplings, the spicy potatoes, lamb skewers and takoyaki. The dumplings for 15 RNB and the spicy",
          "We went to this area later in the evening around 9 pm, and we really enjoyed the atmosphere. There was lots of different foods being made and tried all around us, it was really cool to see. We tried a few things like really cold sesame balls and squid on a stick. You can also do",

          "Of all the places I have visited in China, this was the best in terms of food. Food made right in front of you and since I only eat halal food, I enjoyed a variety. Would definitely recommend this place for my Muslim brothers and sisters",
          "With loads of street food stalls to catered all locals and tourists. Mainly selling lamb and beef dishes.",
          "A great place to eat! There are so many food stalls offering a large variety of delicious edibles. It is an interesting place for a ramble and to catch a bargain. We went at night and it was well lit up and had a terrific vibe. It was very crowded and there were long queues at",
          "Very good place to visit for a bargain. As you enter the street from the Drum tower keep an eye out for the lane-way on the left where a lot of the cheaper shops are and bargain hunters paradise. Great selection of street food around here if your adventurous to try it!",
          "once I visited this place - I came back every night. I love the open street vendor atmosphere, and the food was the best I had in Xian. This was perfect after long days trekking Mt Huanshan",

          "As Buddhists are pre-dominantly in China, it is interesting to see a different kind of sub-culture in China. The Muslim quarter is located near the Xi\u2019an Bell Tower, within 15 mins walk. It\u2019s a busy street full of unusual street food for those who are adventurous to try. There",
          "When you are done visiting the Terracotta Warriors, THIS should be next on your list. It is difficult to describe, a bit like stepping back in time with people who are so kind and gentle and food that is beyond delicious....I find it difficult to find the right words to truly",
          "different items. You must always haggle, though. Never pay even half of what is asked. BE AWARE- this is NOT the place to buy real antiques real anything. I picked up some Chinese soccer jerseys but they were obviously knock offs. Its also why I only paid about $7 a shirt",
          "What an experience! This place is great for the street food, so much to choose from! would highly recommend the 'burgers' these were yum! Also a great place to pick up souvenirs but you might need to hackle! This place can get very busy but it is worth it for the experience.",

          "You must go! You cannot come to Xi'an and not visit this. Just half an hour and you can wander through this. I loved it, cheap food, street food. It was full of life and people. A cultural experience that I enjoyed. I ate \"Drum Rice\" because it's located near the Drum",
          "Even in a light drizzle of evening rain, the Muslim Quarter/Street is fun for its Las Vegas-style neon lights, food, sweets, drinks, hawkers, steaming cauldrons and woks of any and everything, clouds of smoking dry ice, local fare of fish/beef/shrimp/chicken-on-a-stick ready to",
          "Big crowds but great food choices along with shopping for crafts and souvenirs. ONe of Xian's must see sites.",

          "Very interesting and surprised us with a Mosque that is around for 13 centuries. Chinese people, probably descendants of Arabs from the begining of the Silk Route are the people that still going today going there to pray. The Market is reasonable, as im most Chinese Markets you",

          "The city offers a vibrant heart in the old quarter as the Muslim quarter is a part of . Night life is awesome, food stalls and great people to discover. Xi'an people are direct but so sweet and caring . The food is just delicious ... I didn't have time to taste all though I wish",
          "This shopping street is vibrant and lively. It\u2019s glitzy, yet authentic. I could stroll here for hours just taking in the sights and smells and sounds. The Grand Mosque is nearby.",
          "We had a spare hour to explore and were directed to the Muslim quarter. It was a bustling street, we frequently had to hop out of the way of passing mopeds. We loved the look of all the different foods for sale - but were cautious about eating anything we were not sure had been",

          "An hour and a half is not nearly enough time to spend here. So many fascinating stalls capture the imagination. Lots of stalls offering a variety of items, bargining is recommended although I didn't do so when buying ink paintings from a guy using just his hands to create the",
          "Must see because it is bustling , rowdy and vibrant Muslim quarter. The food is great to obe because I like the spices! Crowded place tough, and it just takes the whole experience down by many notches. Thank god I had my own guide with me, otherwise I would have been at a lost",
          "We were amazed at how clean the streets were. There are plenty of stores with a wide variety of food and beverages to sample. A must-do is to buy the plum tea (bring-home packets). That seems to be the local speciality and is a favourite amongst family members.",
          "The place is a tourist trap. The atmosphere is vibrant and bustling. Sell the same stuff. Squid, yogurt, re-mo, beef etc. It gets crowded in the afternoon and evening.",
          "Don't miss a walk through the Muslim Quarter, especially at sunset when the streets start filling and the vendors are all out. Bargain like crazy, do taste the local foods (we were a good-sized group who ate a lot of 'street samples' and none to the worse), and when the lights",
          "This was generally a good experience however there really isnt any need to walk the whole area because its just repeats of the same shop/food stall over and over. Very good mutton soup dishes!",
          "Visited here as a part of our Exoticca tour, with our guide Sumana. So many food stalls with all sorts of food. Very vibrant with all sorts of food smells and colours. A cultural treat in someways to see how they live. Advised by our guide not to try what was on offer. It\u2019s a",
          "Crowded, colorful and fascinating, this is an area that is simply wonderful to spend a few hours in. The variety of foods available is astounding--you can eat at a restaurant, or from the many stalls in the area, The Mosque is unique and really must be visited.",
          "Great place to shop and try local food. Most things can be bought at a great price! If you know how to barter.",
          "So many sights sounds and smells to take in. Confectionary, dried fruit, nuts, dumplings, ice creams, various bbq'd meats and seafood, bread, clothing, jerky etc etc. Then there is the buzz and noise of the motorcycle horns as the riders force their way through the crowds at",
          "If you have been before in a bazar then you know what to expect. Very busy, cheap souvenirs, fake bags... The best part is the street food... If you are brave enough to try it! :) If you have a very busy schedule and you miss it don't feel too guilty. There is also a",
          "We had a street food tour around this area and our guide took us past all of the stalls on the main street. Seafood and meat are sitting out with no refrigeration and low turn over so I would be wary. Tourists just come to see what it's all about. The food is pretty",
          "We were fascinated by the shops and market atmosphere. Lots of interesting things going on to observe. Lot of variety in shops etc . Could walk for several hours but an hour is plenty.",
          "The smell of roasted cumin and chilli peppers fill the streets along with a thousand people lining up in front of small eateries on the street. It is an experience never to be missed. You can try Shaanxi's famed noodles all of which are utterly delicious. It is a carnivore's",
          "Visited here late morning / lunchtime on a Saturday, even though it was raining, there were many people around. Bought some small gifts, and some really good overshoes, as there was Minch water on the ground. Also had some lunch. Really good experience. Would definitely visit",
          "I must say it was the only thing I enjoyed in Xian since there was a sea of people because of the 70 years of celebrations. The Muslim Quarter is picturesque, full of vitality and life and shows the real China, not skyscrapers and shopping malls. It is worth wandering around its",
          "We visited at day time when shop owners were busy cleaning and getting ready for their late-evening customers. Few people were around and which in itself was worth the browsing around the market!",
          "One of the most interesting places we visited in China. Great place to do some shopping, taste some street food and visit the mosques. Food is great, different from Chinese food as there are so many dishes with spiced meat and seafood. The entire quarter turned into a large",
          "We went here to grab some street foo d for dinner. It's such a fun, bustling vibe here. None of the vendors are pushy and you can take your time choosing your food. I would recommend the tofu wrapped in seaweed and the fresh corn! Others in our group loved the pork on a stick",
          "Interesting but not overly impressive. Similar to many markets we have seen before. The Mosque is worth visiting, but the rest can be missed.",
          "I guess I understand the attraction but the crowds, pushing and general rude behavior was a real turn off for me. Food was mediocre and once you've done street food in Asia there isn't much more of an appeal.",
          "Lots of street food (not that great so be careful) it may look fresh, but may be from yesterday! It is a very colourful area and well worth a visit. Careful of falling into the tourist trap and paying way too much for those souviners!",
          "Many kinds of food. We would very much like to taste, but we had no time for that. We had to get back to the hotel to eat.",
          "Definitely a place for folks to find all types of things to buy and eat. There are many food places where you can get street food.",
          "I knew to look for mutton soup with crumbled bread -- a local delicacy. We loved that the menu called it \"Mutton Soup with Crud.\" It was really good -- you'll need both a spoon and chopsticks to get all the noodles and ...uh ... crud. The Xi'an sandwiches were also around -- no",
          "Good place to have different types of street Food and enjoy small Shops along the way. Of Course, everythin is for the tourists, but still enjoyable.",
          "All of Muslim food so very popular for Muslim friends. Full of snacks, noodles, dessert, bread, etc. Most shops served mainly mutton and beef. It gets very crowded at night. For souvenirs and clothing, there a inner street leading to the great mosque where you can find good",
          "Along main street,mainly food outlets of every kind,looking spotless,beware,as streetfood does not all treat western citizens kindly,stomach upsets are common,locals seem to enjoy. Brightly light shops,lureing you in,packed street ,so watch your pockets,we were warned here,to be",
          "Lots of interesting food here ranging from lamb trotter to gelato. Lots of beef, too. Street very busy and vibrant with the neon signs. Price of food is not cheap, though. A bowl of mutton noodles could easily coat RMB45.",
          "While it was fun to see and a nice diversion - don't plan on spending a lot of time there. We walked up and down the street - that was really enough",
          "Our tour guide arranged a Chinese muslim meal for us and it was the best food we had all trip! Wonderful.",
          "great place to do some shopping, taste some street food and visit the great mosque. If not into street food there is lots of restaurants also.",
          "Came here only for an hour as part of a tour. Great vibe & street food scene. Lots of colourful stores & stands selling food & shops. Worth a visit.",
          "Not sure what I was expecting but essentially its a street about 4-5 blocks long with food items. And the same food items repeating. So maybe like 20 unique things then 5 people selling each one of those. Its worth it to walk down, but you'll probably be disappointed like I",
          "A very colourful place to visit at night. Plenty of traders displaying their produces. Just stroll around and take in the atmosphere. Can be busy.",
          "Food not up to our taste so maybe my review is not really correct representation Its all kinds of meat (no pork) and shops selling packaged food and souvenirs",
          "this is very much a tale of 2 halves, as you enter the muslim quarter its as expected, street food ( try if you dare, happy face ) but further in its like a cheap market full of crap to be honest, don't buy there.",
          "We walked the tourist part during the day and the locals part of this area at night. We will never forget the smells of this place. It is busy whenever you go just take your time and watch your step.",

          "Weird food shops, crowded streets, shopping labyrinths, lights, and all kids of smells. Be careful in the shopping alleys of pick pockets disguised in a golden monkey suit. They want to take a pic with you but rob you silly. We saw it done. Great bargain shopping, very",
          "The place is extremely crowded at night, most of the shops offer pretty much similar foods, and it is over touristic.. nice to go there once yo mark it as \u201cdone\u201d but didn\u2019t find it too exciting",
          "A great way to spend an evening. The sights sounds and smells make it a must do in Xi'an. Opportunity to see the real China.",
          "It\u2019s a great place to wander- so many paths, noises, foods and things to see. It\u2019s also close to the drum and bell towers which is handy. A must see when in Xi\u2019an.",
          "Unbelievably good food in this quarter! Every corner you turn, there is good hot food to chase away the cold. The variety of food here is immense and entirely unique with flavours of cumin, fennel, herbs and chillies. Here, traditional food is sold alongside new trendy foods.",
          "Not far from the city center, on the west side of the inner city walls is the Muslim neighborhood. Many hawkers try to get you to try their foods and snacks. So many things to eat so see the food ranger reviews of Xian Muslim district. Most stalls are very cheap. Cheap",
          "we went to the muslim quarter while on a private tour with odynovo our guide fille was great. we were amazed at the different variety of food stalls. they cook in front of the stalls. we even saw a man skin, and debone a pig in front of the stall. it is a must see for food",
          "Full of local snacks, deserts, drinks. Other than a few stores in the area behind the drum tower (Jia San's soup buns, Lao Sun Jia's Pao Mo), try to go to the western end where the locals are. There you will find Lao Bai Jia's lamb/mutton soup noodles (shown on Taste of China",
          "I was here in early September and it was packed with locals and tourists in the early evening. It\u2019s worth a visit if you\u2019re in Xian. There is a fair amount of repetition in the types of foods but still enough variety to make it interesting. I tried a pomegranate juice drink made",
          "This is a nice place to walk around if you have some time free. There are lots of stools and places to buy street food and other such things.",
          "The Muslim Quarter was a lot of fun to walk through and lots of street food for lunch. We went with a foodie tour called \"the lost plate \" and they took us to 4 restaurants that you would never have found without them for some local specialties. As always the tour ended",
          "The muslim part of the display is not overpowering or eloquent and that makes it somewhat more tolerable than an in many other similar places.",
          "This is fairly common for the various street food markets we have seen around the world. In a microcosm they become within themselves somewhat repetitive - you want sheep trotters, well here are a dozen stalls selling them, a dozen more selling Xi'an burgers, so lots of stalls",
          "Last year I found that one night is not enough to sample and eat the variety of food offer at this place. So this year 2019 I am making a visit again, this time staying 5 nights in Xian. Its good to be here during the colder months as in cold weather makes me more hungry.",
          "It was such a treat just walking around this area, sampling the local delights and just taking in all the bustling activity.",
          "By all means do not miss the chance to walk the Muslim Quarter in the evening when it's alive with people and all the vendors are out serving up their exotic food. Like all of China, it is perfectly safe to do so after dark.",
          "We wandered around the muslim quarter, interesting to have a look at the markets and the side streets and the stalls sellers.",
          "We visited as part of a tour. Hard to keep the group together with the crowds and the narrow alleys but we didn't lose anyone. Very interesting food choices, lots of shopping. It's an experience we haven't had before.",
          "This area was a ton of fun just walking in around all the streets making up the quarter. It can be a bit touristy but the sights and sounds make up for the busyness. It would likely be a bit better in the morning with less people and when it was a bit cooler.",
          "I was here with local friends. Can try Mutton BBQ stick and Ice Mixed dessert. I tried also Mutton soup in the shop.",
          "Great place to wander through. Could spend lots of time. Interesting smells and food. Definately worth spending time here",

          "The Musim Quarter has to be seen to be believed, the variety of foods available is staggering but perhaps not to everyone's tastes. It gets very busy in the evenings but this is the best time to wander the streets.",
          "After living in Asia for 20 years, I've experiened a lot of food markets/markets...but none like this! It felt like a giant party all evening....so much fun. Much of the food was new to me, unlike any I've experience in Thailand, Indonesia or the rest of SE Asia. Go, have fun!",
          "This loud, colorful and busy street will amaze you with the strange and exciting street food, lanterns and local art.",
          "We stopped by the muslim mosque, which to be fair, could have been anyway, but with a chinese tinge to the design. The fun part was walking along the road to get to it, and experiencing all the locals on the sides cooking and selling their wares..",
          "Its a fairly big area made up of tons of small shops and restaurants with unique culture and feel. The food is differently spiced and halal, which means no pork or alcohol. Still its very good. Try the biang biang noodles and the barbecue.",
          "It was fairly crowded for a week day. It was a typical shopping street in a Chinese city. It right next to the drum tower, so it\u2019s convenient. But really nothing special.",
          "Late afternoon visit, plenty of food stalls and Colorful wares on display. Didn't actually taste snitching but there were many who were, both eat in or takeaway.",
          "My family visited there on June 23 evening. It\u2019s nice place to try many delicious street food. Most food were different varieties of halal food such as beef,mutton,fish,seafood,snacks and drinks. Available many souvenirs as well. It\u2019s nice and must visit place in Xi\u2019an as well.",
          "Crowded and full of life thera are a lot of food shops and a very small fake market but not very nice",
          "We had an amazing couple of days in the Muslim quarter (visited day/night) and were shocked by seeing a number of negative reviews! We absolutely loved the market area, it was very vibrant, lots of amazing street food to try and one of the only places we've visited in the",

          "I love going places where I can see local people enjoy themselves. We only were able to do the main street that leads to the Drum Tower due to lack of time but I thoroughly enjoyed seeing all the different foods offered. I would recommend doing this in the evening when all the",
          "The mosque in the Muslim quarter was a nice surprise. Unlike any other that we had seen. Had its own Chinese character. The street food stalls were also interesting.",
          "We visited the street after an average dumpling dinner at a local restaurant. We loved our visit to this street. We were overwhelmed by the smells, sounds and the huge number of people visiting. We could barely walk along the street for the crush of people visiting the street.",
          "Just a myriad of muslim streetfood vendors, nice and tasty, but nothing special. Cheap and good food.",
          "No words can describe Muslim Street The smells, the sights they have to be witnessed to be believed It is very busy but do not let put you off This is a real experience The foods on offer are different We visited the Muslim family restaurant and had a very enjoyable meal This",
          "This place is one of the highlights in Xian .It is interesting to know that there is a large Muslim community living here and to see their culture and to try their food is an experience. I remembered trying out the braised lamb feet and the meat filled bun.They also allowed you",
          "This street has a lot of options, maybe too many options. Additionally, there was a lot of the same stuff in most of the places. Like they can't have enough meat on a stick places or bread bakeries. Also, though it may have been nice, it was way too crowded to know. The",
          "I loved this area. A long Walkway of exquisite foods and culture. I wondered if I was really in Xian. People there have western looks so unlike the Han Chinese. The rich history reminds us of the Silk Road. This is the place where goods flow freely between East and West. This is",
          "As Muslim ourselves we found this area very fascinating as we did not speak Chinese but the Grand Mosque and the local stalls and food market were excellent.",
          "Great selection of food through here to dine in or take away. Muslim women in their lovely fancy head scarves. The atmosphere here is lively especially in the evening when it\u2019s packed. Stalls selling trinkets and souvenirs also",
          "the mosque is different from any i had seen, lots of shopping in area, and lots of different food choices.",
          "Definitely one of the best places I've visited in China! Whole quarter turned into a large bazaar, open market with plenty of shops and small restaurants. Food is great, different from Chinese food as there are so many dishes with spiced meat and seafood. The thing I like the",
          "This is the area of the night market. There are many replicates of the same shops and restaurants, but follow the longest lines or go to the busiest of cafes the locals frequent, and you'd found the best place to eat. It's tough for vegetarians here. There's a lot of barbecuing",
          "I went as a part of a group and what an experience! This is your typical, very crowded market/shopping area. There are all types of street foods (just be very careful of what you purchase to eat) and a long alley of stores. If you are looking to get gifts for folks from China,",
          "Hectic on a summers day. Waw. Constant battle for attention. Many sellers of food and all the stuff you expect in a street market place. Recommended!",
          "The food street is over run with tourists. There used to be some artisans when here 15 years ago in the shopping street but just depressing knickknacks now. The hidden gem is the mosque and side streets behind the food street.",
          "Visitors get to shuffle slowly along a street lined with street food vendors and restaurants targeting tourists. It's interesting to do a quick walkthrough, but I wouldn't stay longer than necessary.",
          "We took a tour in a TukTuk in the evening and saw the many shops and food stalls along the way. The streets are narrow and many are still cobblestone. The whole area had a very historic feel to it.",
          "Interesting and very lively area of Xi'an. Walking down the streets you see street food vendors, restaurants, and bright lights. Try a \"hamburger' which is actually pretty good...",
          "You walk along and see the market stalls selling all weird and wonderful stuff. The food stalls were most interesting.",
          "It\u2019s crowded and fun. Bring an appetite and absolutely don\u2019t forget to try the potatoes - they\u2019re UNBELIEVABLE!!!!",
          "After being molly\u2014coddled on our organised tour this was a breath of fresh air and loved the vibe. We had some street food and would have eaten here but our tour did not allow this. Food was safe \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Loved this area. Tons of delicious food. Walk and eat, walk and eat. It\u2019s pretty easy to navigate even with limited language skills, and certainly worth a visit.",
          "Food. Food. Food. There were just so many choices - 2 whole long streets & night time was packed with people. Must try whatever one can eat there. At one end, is the Drum Tower & at night with all the lights, it was beautiful. Must visit in day time together with the Great",
          "A night market over a long block in Muslim Quarter of Xi\u2019an (plus side streets and narrow alleyways). Recommend start from the north end of Xihuamen Street, proceed south along Beiyuanmen Street (take offshoots east/west to explore side streets), towards Drum Tower and go east",
          "Went there on a national holiday, and in the evening it was crazy - a few minutes was plenty to get a feeling of the place and we moved on!",
          "Wandering through the tight Muslim Quarter streets was amazing. Street vendors selling all sorts of goods from souvenirs, hand crafted products and local snacks (whole squid on a stick, lambs feet and pounded candy).",
          "Our guide in Xian took us to Muslim Street. We would not have known on our own to visit. Definitely worth it - a bustling street with interesting food and shopping. Nothing like it in the U.S. or other places in China we've been too. A multicultural melting pot of food and",
          "Very crowded with local tourists and lots of Muslim food choices. As Xian had been the start of the Silk Route, the locals have been influenced by the Muslim culture and religion, hence this is known as the Muslim quarters and it is also steps away from the Grand Mosque in Xi'an",
          "This was a very exciting place to visit within the Xi'an wall. There are tons of places to eat some known and/or interesting food and a great place to buy a thing or two. I would bring quite a bit of money if you are interested in buying a lot. Also, since there are a lot of",
          "This is the second time I\u2019ve visited the Muslim Quarter and it\u2019s really fun to see and try some of the street food. But at the end of the day it really gets annoying when the sellers run up to you and shove snacks in your face. I would recommend spending no more than an hour",
          "On the way to Xi'an Mosque, there is great Muslim street, and eateries on both side. Unique spicy food of this region primarily from the Muslim community. If you dont have any dietarry restrictions, please try as many things as you can.",
          "This place is buzzing The food is amazing I hd squid on a stick Very spicey and so good. People were friendly. Drinks ever where So easy to get around Streets were interesting. Never go hungry there.",
          "Loved going to this market to see the interesting food and goods they were selling. The market was fairly clean but it is on a street. You need to bargain with the vendors if you are buying goods.",
          "Lovely area but didn't eat. Don't believe everything you are told! My supposed silk scarf was certainly not 100% silk, if silk at all as can't read Chinese! The hard sell comes on but don't let them push you around and only pay what you want and about 1/4 to a 1/3 of the",
          "one of the interesting tourist attractions to do in Xian. muslim food and cheap shopping. a lot of street food to savour... try the meat buns.... (find the stall with the longest queue...)",
          "Well worth a visit to see the Mosque with its mix of Asian and Arabic styles. Avoid the bathroom there if possible! Great bargains to be had in the surrounding streets and alleys - very busy, very noisy but fun",
          "We had an hour or so to explore this market & noted a few differences from other markets we had seen. The main differences were found in the food available & the dress of those serving on the stalls. Worth a visit if in the area or if included in your tour.",
          "The vibrant street food stalls and shops make this a busy must see! But try to visit the tranquil sacred calm of mosque. We were lucky to witness a call to pray as we marvelled at the buildings/garden",
          "Great place to visit at night. Fun food! Easy to find from our hotel. We stayed a few blocks away. There is a variety of food and shops. Great place for some interesting pictures with all the lights at night.",
          "This is one place you must go if in Xian, especially if you are a moslem. I can say that most of the food are halal and tasty. The Great Mosque of Xian is also in this area.",
          "The market around that area is amazing. Very full of energy and interesting foods. We only tried a few things. Was a bit scared of the meats, but the fruits and teas were excellent.",
          "This is a compelling and authentic look at life for the Chinese Muslim population. Having read a good deal about the Chinese treatment of religious minorities, I wanted to go here and see for myself. One minute you\u2019re in very Chinese Xi\u2019an and then you plunge into this jumble",
          "We were so excited to go there for the shopping and street food but when we got there it was dirty, over crowded, and very overwhelming! It was even a little scary! Don't go alone! Our guide also told us NOT to eat the street food. After a little walking we found ourselves",
          "If there's one part of Xi'an that really captures the city's spirit, it's the wonderfully atmospheric Muslim quarter. At first glance, there's just a single long street filled with loads of stalls. However, especially if visiting during the day time, exploring some of the",
          "We went to the Muslim Quater as part of our tour, frankly it was the low point of the tour, looking at stalls selling the same tat, looking at meat hanging in the mid-day heat with the ever present threat of pick pockets doesnt do it for me. It didnt take long to walk from one",
          "Lots of food stalls and local delicacies. Also there were two shadow puppet theaters. We went to see one and saw one performance - lots of talking and shouting ...it was entertaining although we didn\u2019t understand. We took a bus (2RMB) from our hotel. Really easy to find. A",
          "Long street food with repetition. Snacking is ok. Chinese food in Xian is generally more delicious. Turn left at the entrance if you want to visit the muslim temple.",
          "This was defnitely worth a visit. We were led by a Tour Guide. Good Souvenirs and if your game to try street food go for it. Not for me.",
          "What a great experience! So colorful, so many people all having a wonderful time, sampling special treats from lollies to squid on a stick to rabbit's heads (roasted!!). This was our first experience in China with so many people around us. You really had to , almost, shuffle",
          "We loved the food at the Muslim quarter! So many things to choose! Try the dumplings with soup! They\u2019re amazing!!! Definitely a must go!",
          "In most books and reviews Muslim Street is described as an incredible place. I found it to be mostly restaurants where the food was kept outside and did not look very appealing. I did not eat on Muslim Street. There are some stores geared to tourists which I did not find so",
          "This area is full of tourists and locals with lots of street food stalls, smells and colour. The area is very geared towards visitors who slowly make their way past lots of food stalls, gift shops where you can barter. It was not what I expected but great fun to walk down and",
          "We experienced a riot of colour and sound as the many traders tout their goods which range from tourist souvenirs to tasty food and snacks. Surprisingly Muslim stall holders even offer cooked pig\u2019s trotters!! Halal food is not necessarily the order of the day in this eye opening",
          "Fantastic to walk through and see the vendors cooking different dishes and selling spices, food, etc.",
          "This place is just insane! There was thousands of people filling the streets, each street food stalls selling all types from goats feet, insects on sticks and sweets. Off from the mean street id the shopping area. You can barter on everything but don\u2019t be fooled as you can get",
          "Overwhelming at first, but then you notice proper food, fruit, veggies, etc. that's been sold out of the same outlet for who knows how many years (centuries?) - wonderful experience with smells, tastes and sounds you don't experience when walking down the main strip in Beijing!",
          "The Muslim Quarter is one of the most interesting places to visit in Xi\u2019an because it is very near the Great Mosque, the largest of its kind in China. The Muslim Quarter is teeming with so much vibe and activity, and this is where tourists can get a taste of the local street",
          "We went here by ourselves after an organised tour of the terracotta warriors. Taxi\u2019s are very cheap and the 40 min taxi ride from our outer hotel to the Muslim quarter cost only 20 yuan. There were some good little souvenir shops, but like the rest of markets in China you need",
          "The Outer Gate is being re done. The inner Gate is a Pay to view site.The alley way's getting here are narrow and full of vendors all to eager to remove you of some cash. Nice silk prints here.I had to lie down to frame my shots of the outer gate.",
          "Well to be fair the locals are very brave eating the exotic food items we saw on sale. Insects with their legs still kicking wasn't for us.However it was an enjoyable walk and good to see.",
          "A great place to visit to try lots of different food dishes cooked fresh to order. Shops selling souvenirs and trinkets.",
          "We had an afternoon stroll through the busy Muslim Quarter and could of spent all afternoon, watching and trying the local foods on offer.",
          "It is a very crowded one way street with same kind of food offerings and not friendly sellers. The only worthed venue is the Gao family mansion. Will not return.",
          "Must see in the evening. Very crowded but safe and interesting place with lots of the foods you always wanted to try. A must see in Xi' an",
          "The Muslim Quarter is an experience not to be missed when in Xi'an! We were on a guided tour of China and I do mean guided. We were taken to shop where the tour or might I say government wanted us to part with our money. My husband and I as well as a bunch of our new friends",
          "Lots of fun to wander though and grab snacks along the way. Not what I would call a night market per say. Lots of stalls and store fronts offering the same goods. If it looks good now and you are not in the mood, don\u2019t worry, shortly you will se it again when you are in the",
          "A great way to spend an evening in central Xi'an. Lights, people, food, and fun. If it looks good, try it! So many delicious food items.",
          "We visted the very lively food street. On both sides all kind of shops and restaurants, with lots of different types of food to choose from.",
          "Well worth spending half a day wandering around the narrow streets & alleyways - just watch out for many silent electric scooters which whizz along them all, sometimes sounding horns, but not always. The sunshine helped make it an enjoyable experience as we watched people",
          "There is so much food to choose. We were able to sample many delicious dishes. Don't forget to try Biang Biang noodles.",
          "Fun to walk through. Most of our souvenoir shopping was done here. Here was a chance to do some bargaining.",
          "all the food is nice! durian pancakes, lamb satay, the biq squid, all the fruits very fresh one and ruby juice..",
          "Extremely atmospheric part of the city and jam packed with all kinds of stalls and shops selling every kind of edible delicacies. Just enjoy walking around here. There are jewellery shops with crafts people hammering metal outside their establishments. Others making ice cream",
          "An interesting place within the city of Xian. Crowded and dirty with poor maintenance. But be there to see the life inside with lot of variant food stalls with different tastes. Careful with your pockets warned by the guide because there is pick pocketing.",
          "Over commercialised. The food is repetitive and not to tasty. The only attraction is the mansion of an individual who has served the Emperor for 7 generations. Even that has fallen into disrepair.",
          "Keep your hand on your purse (lol we were warned there where lots of 'foreigners' in this area - Chinese code for pickpockets). That said our group had no problems. Haggle hard but with good humor, wander through the bazaars off the main street, this area is a lot of fun.",
          "I love visiting markets so this market provided some interesting shops and food stalls. It was quite crowded when we were there, and we were warned about pick-pockets. Be prepared to spend at least an hour if not longer to see every thing.",
          "I should have bought my souvenirs here, so much competition. I got ripped off in Luoyang for my purchases. There\u2019s so many types of foods and drinks to try. The restaurant prices are also reasonable as well. The smelly toufu here ain\u2019t smelly, unlike other places in Xian or",
          "Bustling, colourful and full of amazing sights, sounds and tastes! This is one of the must-go-to place in Xi'an. Be prepared to eat alot!",
          "The Muslim Quarter is a unique section of the City of Xi'an. Our Odynovo guide, Ms Ann, guided us on a brief walking tour of this area. She explained to us the significance of the Muslim people and their role in Chinese history. It was very interesting and Ann was a superb",
          "A wonderful bonus to being in this fantastic City. Could have spent hours there. Full of life, and so many intriguing shops and food stalls. Want to go again",
          "The Muslim Quarter is full of life - the idea is to bring ancient Xi'an into the modern era and show it off to visitors. It is really fun exploring the crowded (like VERY crowded) streets and experiencing the sights, sounds and smells of traditional China. There are handicraft",
          "I didn\u2019t enjoy our visit here. I found it intimidating and was pleased to get out! Sorry it\u2019s not the place a foreigner like me felt comfortable. The shop keepers did not hound us at all which is why I gave it 2 stars",
          "It was so crowded it was hard to tell - but there certainly looked as though there was a good selection of food places - if you could only get to them!. Try to find out when the best time is to go - ie, after 8pm maybe and miss the local after-work rush for a quick bite.",
          "I mean it's basically a street with some side streets to walk. They all sell the same items and the same food. The mixture of smells from all the food were great though. But we're still in China, so eventually you're bound to smell the sewer systems too. It's a cool place to",
          "This area buzzes. It is full of people and stalls selling food and drinks as well as many crafts/tourist items. Bargaining is a must. It is close to the mosque which is also worth seeing. The sights, smells, sounds and volume of people is amazing.",
          "Really interesting to stroll at night with all the street signs and fascinating, unusual snacks on display. Very impressed with how hard the street cleaners worked to keep everything tidy.",
          "Fun area to walk around. Great sights and smells. Many food vendors. Not at all pushy or aggressive. Interesting cultural experience. Very near the drum tower.",
          "Went via a Lost Plate tour and worth every penny! Try the biang biang noodles and the mutton stew. It's delicious!",
          "We were on an organised tour and were taken to the Muslim quarter. It\u2019s full of markets and food stalls. The first thing I noticed was how clean the streets were and how there was a variety of food. The food stalls appeared to be fixed prices where as the clothes/Bric a brac you",
          "Great things to see and also the small shops with low price items to buy. Nice art work and you can take lots of photos.",
          "I think this was the highlight of my day. We got to see a lot of really cool things (Terracottas, City Wall, Wild Goose Pagoda) but shopping here (although the bargaining gets exhausting) and walking around, seeing the sights, smelling the food, getting caught in a rain",
          "Muslim quarter is fascinating. Lots of prepared food and shops to enjoy. Very busy area and lots of interesting sights to see and things to buy.",
          "What an amazing food experience, I recommend in particular the lamb skewers, the beef pita sandwiches and the grilled calamari.",
          "Muslim Quarter is definitely one of the first places one should visit when they arrive in Xian. For foodies, this is the place to be with different types of foods to try catered to the local dishes of Xian/Shaanxi Province. This is also a good place to buy souvenirs as some",
          "Vibrant street with lots of food vendors and restaurants, and well as shops. Everyone very friendly. Brightly lit safe walking street",
          "This is a buzzing \u201cmust do\u201d area offering all sorts of weird & wonderful foods. Even if you don\u2019t partake, watching the preparation is a tourist treat.",
          "Our day tour of Xi'an took us here after visitng the warriors and city wall. Very busy and lively location with a lot of street vendors selling all sorts of Chinese and middle eastern type food items including Turkish ice cream. While we didn't try much of the food due to",
          "We went there in the afternoon and maybe because it was also a national holiday but it was impossible to walk there. So many people on the street that it took for ages to get something to eat. The place is well known for the towers but the food is excellent. When you want to eat",
          "We've been to the Muslim Quarter many times (most recently in April 2019), and it never fails to dazzle our clients. It's a vibrant and hectic place, filled with exciting sights, sounds, and smells. The food stalls offer an authentic taste of traditional Hui-style cuisine, as",
          "Only went to the Muslim Quarter as a last minute decision. The most amazing food street ever. Colourful and vibrant, with so many delicious choices at very reasonable prices.,",
          "Went to the Muslim Quater in Xi'an, in March this year (19) was not sure i would enjoy it as its street food... the smells are different, as all the stalls are competing against each other..... the food is different, But that's all it is... the market at the end of the street",
          "A very lively experience in the Muslim quarter - mostly to taste local food specialties and purchase souvenirs.",
          "It's chaotic and feels authentic. The food is great. Every shop sells something different and fun to eat.",
          "Muslim Quarter which lies inside the city wall of Xi'an is a must see when coming to Xi'an China. Shopping, people watching, and a genuine taste of Chinese culture is rich within this Quarter. Hostels here as I spent 2 nights at Alley youth hostel and it was a fantastic hostel",
          "Food here excellent, like nowhere else on earth. Had dinner at Family Muslim restaurant. Fabulous food, excellent prices.",
          "We visited one afternoon and the busy street was jam packed with people and traders. Lots of stuff for sale but the prices were not good. So bargain hard or you will be ripped off.",
          "This area is well worth walking around - it is quite busy with lots of little streets, food stalls and shops selling souvenirs.It is a real contrast to the newly developed modern city areas.",
          "Busy street; lots of food; carry your own tissue paper and water; generally, food is very cheap around here; lot of bargaining in case you are going to buy some stuff(anything for that matter)",
          "I contacted a local tour company to arrange a group tour to see Terracotta warriors, pagodas, city wall & food street. The company did an amazing job and was very well priced! Our group of 13, 8 adults & 5 11 yr old girls loved the food street! We tried lots of local delights",
          "The Muslim Quarter and Bazaar were quite interesting to visit. The food looked so inviting however we had been warned not to take chances. There were also many stalls with the rich spices.",
          "What a beautiful place right in the heart of all the hustle and bustle. We arrived early and there was hardly anyone around. You pass through the busy market and there it is. A beautiful oasis of peace and birdsong,i could have spent much longer here with our guide filling us in",
          "A great experience walking through the narrow streets with various stores on each side. Food, souvenirs, restaurants. Bikes and tut-tuts can go through the streets too, beeping their horns as warning which just adds to the atmosphere. Great fun",
          "In the Muslim area can experience seeing, tasting and touching. A street with lots of stores of all kind of food, candies, cookies, icecream...., many goods to buy as a souvenir, handcrafts, silk and much more. In this area is the Mosque. Very beautiful garden and peaceful. Must",
          "Lots to see if you are adventurous for food. Lots of options. Nice atmosphere and friendly people. Great photos opportunities",
          "A short street filled with food sellers on both sides of the road; great local choices of food. We tried the fried chilly potatoes; the yogurt ice cream and a couple of other snacks",
          "We only made a quick run through this area. The street vendors were just amazing. So many offerings of unusual foods and even souvenirs. I loved the Dragon's Breath Smoking balls and the Mai Jong cookies. Every where I looked something was going on. It was so much fun just",
          "We walked through the Muslim Quarter. Lots of food stalls, the mosque and some markets at the back of the main thoroughfare. The mosque ispretty average and not really worth seeing if you have done other mosque elsewhere so give this a miss. It isa hectic place to walk through",
          "What a great experience to see this area during the day and definitely at night. There are food vendors, produce stalls, restaurants, and other interesting sites in the area, Also tasting the street food is something you do not want to miss. If you have a chance, mingle and",
          "Fantastic area Night market and food area bustling and lively Great culture try all the local cuisine",
          "We walked from one end to the other, the many food stalls, but the presentation was there to attract customers. From squid to ice cream to kebabs and a number of others I am not sure of. Worth a stop, the thing I did notice was that it was very clean.",
          "This is basically a multi-block section of town with stand after stand and restaurant after restaurant. I would not say you are going to get a fantastic meal here (maybe you can its so huge there's no way you try 1/10th of them in a week), but you'll get good food.",
          "I had never seen most of the food offered in the Muslim Quarter of Xi'an. It made for great photographs. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "While a tourist area at heart, this place really does absolutely buzzes and the food vendors are amazing. Really just wander down the street and try all the goodies. The lamb kebabs on a stick are a must have in my view! Probably not the place locals go to eat but don't let",
          "If you have a chance to stroll through the laneways of the Muslim quarter, its markets and Mosque, it is really fascinating. The sights, sounds, colours, tastes and smells are inviting.",
          "Plenty of halal foods can be find here , all stalls are operated and cook by Muslim, food store are operating daily from morning till nightfall",
          "Go here for some great cheap(ish) snacks and a great insight into the Muslim community. We particularly enjoyed the boiled potatoes in some spices and pomegranate juice.",
          "Tons of restaurants serving a variety of interesting and tasty foods. Recommend taking a tuk tuk tour to taste foods.",
          "Walked the muslim quarters a couple of nights. Busy, crowded and a lot happening. A ot of the same though. But definitely worth a visit and experience. Food for everyone.",
          "Cool street, a lot of outdoor food.. people are not very friendly and it\u2019s sort of dirty. Weird food and very crouded.",
          "One of the items on our checklist was visiting the Muslim quarter as their food street was quite popular. A word of advice...avoid evenings on weekends. We could barely walk with the building crowd. There is a variety of delicious fare to try and it is not priced too high.",
          "At the back alley leading to Xi an mosque, traders sell cheap souvenir, cheapest I found in the city by far. But make sure to bargain. Lots of local delicacy sold in the main street, both traditional food or hipster food can be found here.",
          "Walking along the Muslim quarters and streets were such a wonderful experience. The food is excellent and delicious. Amazing souvenirs, but you have to bargain for a better price. At the time of my visit, there were thousands of people because it was during the Tomb sweeping",
          "I have never seen so many types of food in one place in my life. The area is clean and safe. This would be a \"must see\" place in Xi'an.",
          "Its got to be seen to be believed. Teeming crowds and variety of food stalls that you may never see elsewhere. Be adventurous and try things you haven't before- remember only Chinese spoken so your charades skills need to be on point! Carry wet wipes to clean up after tastings!",
          "I would highly recommend planning to see the Muslim Quarter while in Xi'an! The area is a buzz with various street food stalls cooking up many delights, stalls selling fresh herbs and spices and much more! I would recommend the ice cream rolls! Delicious and fun to watch them",
          "Still worth a walk around, but be prepared for some hard sell. The food options are great and the location is very central, just near the towers.",
          "This is like a trip going back in time. You have to visit the quater by day, then by night so as to witness two contrasting atmospheres. Lots of food, lots of smells, one can easily swap bikes and cars for hoses or carts of many centuries ago.",
          "We went around 5pm which was early and sampled the food from many different vendors...rather than going to one place. The food was ok...but remember this is a tourist swamp. We found that near our hotel were Muslim restaurants with better food and a lot cleaner.",
          "We went there on our own and even tasted some local snacks. It's a fun place to explore on your own.",
          "Visiting this quarter during the day was relaxing and possible to leisurely walk down the streets. During the night, the whole area was packed with a definite \"night life vibe\". The food possibilities were vast. There were sweets and meats and fruit and vegetables. A variety",
          "Fascinating place to wander through. Viewing the food for sale is worth the walk. Plenty of souvenirs to buy but you need to haggle hard",
          "Along with the mosque there are plenty of shops and street food to get some decent souvenirs and a nice lunch. Be prepared to haggle of course.",
          "Lots and lots of local halal food to chose from and to try. Food in Xian is basically spicy (hot), salty and slight sourish so might not be the best experience for a lot of people. Generally prices were on the high side for street food and would recommend that for travellers",
          "A vibrant, colourful street filled with exotic foods, like sheep's feet and rabbit heads, decorative loaves of bread, piles of fruit and nuts, mountains of noodles. The pretty Chinese Muslim girls in patterned head scarves added to the flamboyant atmosphere. Not to be",

          "It was pouring with rain for our visit, but getting the history of the mosque itself and the muslim community was extremely interesting. The community dates back to centuries and still is very self-sufficient with its own school and other teaching facilities to enable the Koran"

        "wiki": "The Eight Immortals (Chinese: \u516b\u4ed9; pinyin: B\u0101xi\u0101n; Wade\u2013Giles: Pa\u00b9-hsien\u00b9) are a group of legendary xian (\"immortals\") in Chinese mythology. Each immortal's power can be transferred to a vessel (\u6cd5\u5668) that can bestow life or destroy evil. Together, these eight vessels are called the \"Covert Eight Immortals\" (\u6697\u516b\u4ed9). Most of them are said to have been born in the Tang or Song Dynasty. They are revered by the Taoists and are also a popular element in secular Chinese culture. They are said to live on a group of five islands in the Bohai Sea, which includes Mount Penglai.\nThe Immortals are:\n\nHe Xiangu (\u4f55\u4ed9\u59d1), this particular immortal is considered female.\nCao Guojiu (\u66f9\u570b\u8205), a princely actor among the eight.\nLi Tieguai (\u674e\u9435\u62d0), he is considered to be a male immortal who is also mentally disturbed.\nLan Caihe (\u85cd\u91c7\u548c), this particular immortal and their gender is considered to be ambiguous.\nL\u00fc Dongbin (\u5442\u6d1e\u8cd3), he is considered to be their leader.\nHan Xiangzi (\u97d3\u6e58\u5b50), he is a flute artist among the eight.\nZhang Guolao (\u5f35\u679c\u8001), he is associated with old age.\nZhongli Quan (\u937e\u96e2\u6b0a), he is associated with death.In literature before the 1970s, they were sometimes translated as the Eight Genies. First described in the Yuan Dynasty, they were probably named after the Eight Immortal Scholars of the Han.\n\n\n== In art ==\nThe tradition of depicting humans who have become immortals is an ancient practice in Chinese art, and when religious Taoism gained popularity, it quickly picked up this tradition with its own immortals. While cults dedicated to various Taoist immortals date back to the Han dynasty, the popular and well-known Eight Immortals first appeared in the Jin dynasty. The art of the Jin tombs of the 12th and 13th centuries depicts a group of eight Taoist immortals in wall murals and sculptures. They officially became known as the Eight Immortals in the writings and works of art of the Taoist group known as the Complete Realization (Quanshen). The most famous art depiction of the Eight Immortals from this period is a mural of them in the Eternal Joy Temple (Yongle Gong) at Ruicheng.\nThe Eight Immortals are considered to be signs of prosperity and longevity, so they are popular themes in ancient and medieval art. They were frequent adornments on celadon vases. They were also common in sculptures owned by the nobility. Their most common appearance, however, was in paintings. Many silk paintings, wall murals, and wood block prints remain of the Eight Immortals. They were often depicted either together in one group, or alone to give more homage to that specific immortal.\nAn interesting feature of early Eight Immortal artwork is that they are often accompanied by jade hand maidens, commonly depicted servants of the higher ranked deities, or other images showing great spiritual power. This shows that early on, the Eight Immortals quickly became eminent figures of the Taoist religion and had great importance. We can see this importance is only heightened in the Ming and Qing dynasties. During these dynasties, the Eight Immortals were very frequently associated with other prominent spiritual deities in artwork. There are numerous paintings with them and the Three Stars (the gods of longevity, prosperity, and good fortune) together. Also, other deities of importance, such as the Queen Mother of the West, are commonly seen in the company of the Eight Immortals.\nThe artwork of the Eight Immortals is not limited to paintings or other visual arts. They are quite prominent in written works too. Authors and playwrights wrote numerous stories and plays on the Eight Immortals. One famous story that has been rewritten many times and turned into several plays (the most famous written by Mu Zhiyuan in the Yuan Dynasty) is The Yellow-Millet Dream, which is the story of how L\u01da D\u00f2ngb\u012bn met Zhongli Quan and began his path to immortality.\n\n\n== In literature ==\n\nThe Immortals are the subject of many artistic creations, such as paintings and sculptures. Examples of writings about them include:\n\nThe Yueyang Tower by Ma Zhiyuan\nThe Bamboo-leaved Boat (\u7af9\u8449\u8239; zh\u00fa y\u00e8 chu\u00e1n) by Fan Zi'an (\u8303\u5b50\u5b89; f\u00e0n z\u01d0 \u0101n)\nThe Willow in the South of the City (\u57ce\u5357\u67f3; ch\u00e9ng n\u00e1n li\u01d4) by Gu Zijing (\u8c37\u5b50\u656c; g\u01d4 z\u01d0 j\u00ecng)\nThe most significant is The Eight Immortals Depart and Travel to the East (\u516b\u4ed9\u51fa\u8655\u6771\u904a\u8a18; b\u0101 xi\u0101n ch\u016b ch\u00f9 d\u014dng yo\u00fa j\u00ec) by Wu Yuantai (\u5433\u5143\u6cf0; w\u00fa yu\u00e1n ta\u00ec) in the Ming Dynasty.\nThere is another work, also made during the Ming (c. 14th-15th centuries), by an anonymous writer, called The Eight Immortals Cross the Sea (\u516b\u4ed9\u904e\u6d77; b\u0101 xi\u0101n gu\u00f2 h\u01cei). It is about the Immortals on their way to attend the Conference of the Magical Peach (\u87e0\u6843\u6703; p\u00e1n ta\u00f3 hu\u00ec) when they encounter an ocean. Instead of relying on their clouds to get them across, L\u00fc Dongbin suggested that they each should exercise their unique powers to get across. Derived from this, the Chinese proverb \"The Eight Immortals cross the sea, each reveals its divine powers\" (\u516b\u4ed9\u904e\u6d77\uff0c\u5404\u986f\u795e\u901a; b\u0101 xi\u0101n gu\u00f2 h\u01cei, g\u00e8 xi\u01cen sh\u00e9n t\u014dng) indicates the situation that everybody shows off their skills and expertise to achieve a common goal.\n\n\n== In qigong and martial art ==\nFurthermore, they have been linked to the initial development of qigong exercises such as the Eight Piece Brocade. There are some Chinese martial arts styles named after them, which use fighting techniques that are attributed to the characteristics of each immortal. Some drunken boxing styles make extensive use of the Eight Immortals archetypes for conditioning, qigong/meditation and combat training.  One subsection of BaYingQuan drunken fist training includes methodologies for each of the eight immortals.\n\n\n== Reverence ==\nEstablished in the Song Dynasty, the Xi'an temple Eight Immortals Palace (\u516b\u4ed9\u5bae), formerly Eight Immortals Nunnery (\u516b\u4ed9\u5eb5), is where statues of the Immortals can be found in the Hall of Eight Immortals (\u516b\u4ed9\u6bbf). There are many other shrines dedicated to them throughout China and Taiwan. In Singapore, the Xian'gu Temple (\u4ed9\u59d1\u6bbf) has the Immortal Woman He from the group as its focus of devotion.\n\n\n== Depictions in popular culture ==\n\nIn modern China, the Eight Immortals are still a popular theme in artwork. Paintings, pottery, and statues are still common in households across China and are even gaining some popularity worldwide.\nSeveral movies about the Eight Immortals have been produced in China in recent years.\nIn Jackie Chan's film Drunken Master, there are eight \"drunken\" Chinese martial arts forms that are said to be originated from the Eight Immortals. At first, the protagonist did not want to learn the Immortal Woman He form because he saw it as a feminine form, but he eventually created his own version of that form.\nThe 1998\u201399 Singaporean television series Legend of the Eight Immortals was based on stories of the Eight Immortals and adapted from the novel Dong You Ji.\nThe Eight Immortals play an important part in the plot of the video game Fear Effect 2.\nIn the Andy Seto graphic novel series Saint Legend, the Eight Immortals reappear to protect the Buddhist faith from evil spirits set on destroying it.\nIn the X-Men comic book, the Eight Immortals appear to protect China along with the Collective Man when the mutant Xorn caused a massacre in one small village.\nIn the Immortal Iron Fist comic book, there are seven supreme kung fu practitioners, called the Seven Immortal Weapons. They each hail from other-dimensional cities and must fight for their city's chance to appear on Earth. Aside from being named the \"Immortal\" Weapons, the most overt reference to the Eight Immortals is that one Immortal Weapon, Fat Cobra, hails from and represents a city called \"Peng Lai Island\".\nIn the roleplaying game Feng Shui, the Eight Immortals appear in the sourcebook Thorns of the Lotus.\nThe Eight Immortals played a role in the animated show Jackie Chan Adventures. In the show, the Immortals were said to be the ones who defeated the Eight Demon Sorcerers and sealed them away in the netherworld using items that symbolized their powers. They then crafted the Pan'ku box as a key to opening the portals that lead into the demons' prison. Later on in the series, the items the Immortals used to seal away the demons the first time are revealed to have absorbed some of the demons' chi and become the targets of Drago, the son of Shendu (one of the Demon Sorcerers), to enhance his own powers.\nIn The Forbidden Kingdom, Jackie Chan plays the character Lu Yan, who is supposed to be one of the Eight Immortals, as revealed by the director in the movie's special feature, The Monkey King and The Eight Immortals.\nIn the Tales of the Dragon expansion for Age of Mythology, the Eight Immortals are hero units for the Chinese.\nIn The Iron Druid Chronicles, Zhang Guolao joins the party journeying to Asgard to slay Thor in vengeance for the Norse gods crimes.  Zhang Guolao\u2019s grudge stems from Thor killing his donkey in a trick.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLai, T.

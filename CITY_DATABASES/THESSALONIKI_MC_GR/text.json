        "wiki": "Aristotelous Square (Greek: \u03a0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, IPA: [pla\u02c8tia aristo\u02c8telus], Aristotle Square) is the main city square of Thessaloniki, Greece and is located on Nikis avenue (on the city's waterfront), in the city center. It was designed by French architect Ernest H\u00e9brard in 1918, but most of the square was built in the 1950s. Many buildings surrounding the central square have since been renovated and its northern parts were largely restored in the 2000s.The twelve buildings that make up Aristotelous Square have been listed buildings of the Hellenic Republic since 1950.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of Aristotelous Square begins with the Great Fire of 1917 that destroyed two thirds of the city of Thessaloniki.\n\n\n=== Before the fire ===\n\nBefore the Great Fire of 1917, the city lacked much of what was considered to be 'essential' in European architecture. Until 1912, Thessaloniki had been part of Ottoman Turkey for almost 500 years. Under Ottoman rule, the city grew without the guidance of a general plan for expansion and had narrow streets. The absence of squares in pre-1917 Thessaloniki was addressed by Ernest H\u00e9brard, who proposed a number of large squares in the city, including Megalou Alexandrou Square (\"Alexander the Great Square\"), now Aristotelous Square.\n\n\n=== Designs by Ernest H\u00e9brard ===\n\nErnest H\u00e9brard envisioned a monumental axis for Thessaloniki that stretched from what is now Aristotelous Square on the seafront to Dikastirion Square and the Roman Forum. The axis began at Aristotelous Square, which was intended to be named after Alexander the Great. Throughout his plan for Thessaloniki, H\u00e9brard implemented an element that was missing from the pre-1917 architecture of the city: imposing fa\u00e7ades. For the monumental axis, the architect used elements from Byzantine and Western architecture rather than Ottoman architecture, to stress the city's connection with the Byzantine Empire. This style is most evident at Aristotelous Square, with a few building facades implementing some of H\u00e9brard's original ideas. Additionally, a statue of Alexander the Great was to be placed in the middle of the square.\n\nH\u00e9brard designed the monumental axis so that looking uphill from the square one could see the city's Byzantine walls and the Upper Town. Also visible from the square would be what H\u00e9brard called the Place Civique or  Civic Square, which would be the city's administrative heart along European lines: it would feature the City Hall on the left, the court houses on the right and a grand triumphant arch leading uphill from the Civic Square. This part of the design was never realized due to a lack of funds, although following archeological excavations unearthed the ancient Roman agora at the same spot were the Civic Square was planned.\nSince the first concept designs by H\u00e9brard in 1918, his designs for Aristotelous Square were simplified considerably. Instead of the original elaborate designs, the fa\u00e7ades that were built in the 1950s were much more modest, due to the financial situation of the country at the time and the decision of the Venizelos government in 1918 to fund the project from private sources and not the government.\n\n\n=== Present day ===\nToday, Aristotelous Square is one of the most famous places in all of Greece and almost synonymous with the city of Thessaloniki itself. The square plays an important role in the sociopolitical life not only of the city, but of the wider country as well. Numerous large rallies and political speeches have been organized in Aristotelous Square, such as the rally for Macedonia in 1992 (see further below). Additionally the square is used for many cultural events, such as festivals and the annual Christmas and carnival celebrations. It is an important tourist attraction for the city, and the numerous cafes and bars that line up the square make it popular with the younger generations.\nThe two quarter-circle sides of the square are occupied by important buildings. On the left is Electra Palace Hotel, which is one of the best five-star hotels in Thessaloniki and on the right is one of the city's most famous movie theaters, the Olympion Theatre cinema, site of the annual Thessaloniki International Film Festival. It also houses a very popular bar of the same name.\n\n\n=== Future redevelopment ===\nThere is no redevelopment currently under consideration, but numerous proposals have been submitted over the past twenty years. When Thessaloniki became the European capital of culture during 1997, the city council put together an organizing committee for the redevelopment of the waterfront of the city, including the redevelopment of Aristotelous Square. Of the many designs that were presented to the committee, some of them were very radical and others less so. In almost all proposals, there were provisions for a marina or a similar extension of the square onto waterfront, as well as a wheel similar to the London Eye in London. Up to date, no official redevelopment scheme has been made official. The current mayor of Thessaloniki, Yannis Boutaris, mentioned in his electoral campaign that Thessaloniki would undergo a major redevelopment to bring it into the 21st century, but so far no designs or any new announcements have been made public.\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\n\n=== Christmas and New Year ===\nDue to its location in the heart of the city, the square is used for almost all major celebrations, including that of the lighting of the official Christmas tree of Thessaloniki and the New Year countdown. Every year the municipality organizes the Celebration of the Angels (Greek: \u0393\u03b9\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03ae \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd), which is the official lighting ceremony for the Christmas tree and is accompanied by other festive activities, including bands, choirs, popular Greek singers and fireworks displays. Similar celebrations are organized annually on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.Following Greek traditions, apart from a Christmas tree, the municipality of Thessaloniki also decorates a giant Christmas ship, which is a Greek variant of the custom of decorating a Christmas tree. Both the Christmas tree and the Christmas boat are over 20 meters tall and are considered a tourist attraction for visitors to the city at the time they are up.\n\n\n=== Political activity ===\n\nSince its creation, the square has been used for a number of important party rallies. Many former Prime Ministers of Greece have given their main address from Aristotelous Square, including Andreas Papandreou, Costas Karamanlis and George Papandreou.\nApart from partisan action, there have also been numerous demonstrations in the square that were not backed by any particular party. Under the nationalist rush against the Republic of Macedonia in the early 1990s over the Macedonia naming dispute, a huge demonstration was organized in the square in February 1992 \"to show support for the Greekness of Macedonia\". During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, a large demonstration also took place in the square that reaffirmed the Greek people's disapproval of the NATO bombing and to show their support for the Serbian people. Many other demonstrations have been held in the square in recent years on a variety of subjects ranging from religious affairs, education reforms and the economic crisis.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nWhen the first buildings in the square were constructed in the late 1950s, the square was served by Thessaloniki's extensive tram network but the service was discontinued in 1957. Since then, the only means of public transportation to and from Aristotle Square is by the buses of the Thessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (OASTH). The city's horse shoe shape and the square's location within the city center make it easily reachable by OASTH, with many lines passing either through Aristotelous or by Venizelou Square. Additionally, there are taxi stands on Mitropoleos Street (a street which \"cuts\" the square in half), in front of the Olympion Theatre.The under-construction Thessaloniki Metro will have one station near Aristotelous Square, at Venizelou Street, a short walk away from Aristotelous on Egnatia Avenue. Other means of transportation that have been proposed are ferry services to the other pivotal points of coastal Thessaloniki.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nBecause of its resemblance to a bottle when viewed from above, an aerial photograph of the square was recently used in an advertisement for Absolut Vodka .\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Aristotelous square at Wikimedia Commons\nWebcam",

        "wiki": "The White Tower of Thessaloniki (Greek: \u039b\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 Lefk\u00f3s P\u00fdrgos; Turkish: Beyaz Kule; Ladino: Kuli Blanka) is a monument and museum on the waterfront of the city of Thessaloniki, capital of the region of Macedonia in northern Greece. The present tower replaced an old Byzantine fortification, known to have been mentioned around the 12th century, that the Ottoman Empire reconstructed to fortify the city's harbour sometime after Sultan Murad II captured Thessaloniki in 1430. The tower became a notorious prison and scene of mass executions during the period of Ottoman rule.\nThe White Tower was substantially remodeled and its exterior was whitewashed after Greece gained control of the city in 1912. It has been adopted as the symbol of the city.\n\n\n== Physical attributes ==\n\nThe White Tower takes the form of a cylindrical drum 23 m (75 ft) in diameter with a height of 34 m (112 ft) above ground level, on top of which is a turret 12 m (39 ft) in diameter and 6 m (20 ft) high. Some of the embrasures in the outer wall of the tower are reached by a spiral ramp; others are accessed from a central room on each of the six floors.\nThe turret houses a platform with a diameter of 10 m (33 ft), and the platform at the top of the main tower in front of the turret is about 5 m (16 ft) wide.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe tower, which once guarded the eastern end of the city's sea walls, was for many years attributed to Venice, to which the Byzantines ceded Thessaloniki in 1423. It is now known that the tower was constructed by the Ottomans sometime after the army of Sultan Murad II captured Thessaloniki in 1430. Until 1912, an inscription in Ottoman Turkish verse above the door dated the structure to AH 942 (1535\u20131536).\nThe historian Franz Babinger speculated that the work was designed by the great Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, who is known to have built fortifications, including a similar tower at the Albanian port Valona in 1537.\n\n\n=== Modifications ===\nThe present tower likely replaced an older Byzantine tower mentioned by the 12th-century archbishop Eustathius of Thessalonica during the sack of the city in 1185.The Ottoman-built structure itself has been altered substantially over the years. Early illustrations  show that it was originally covered by a conical roof, like similar towers in the Yedikule Fortress and Rumelihisar\u0131 fortress in Istanbul.\n\nUntil its demolition in 1917, a chemise stood at the foot of the tower, supporting the heavy guns and enclosing an area at least three times the diameter of the main tower. Octagonal turrets on the chemise and caponiers at ground level provided flanking fire around the tower. It is unclear whether the chemise was part of the original scheme for the tower or was a later addition.The tower was for centuries part of the walls of the old city of Thessaloniki, separating the Jewish quarter of the city from the cemeteries of the Muslims and Jews.  The city walls were demolished in 1866.\n\n\n=== From the Red Tower to the White Tower ===\n\nThe Tower was used by the Ottomans successively as a fortress, garrison and a prison. In 1826, at the order of the Sultan Mahmud II, there was a massacre of the rebellious Janissaries imprisoned there. Owing to the \"countless victims of Ottoman torturers and executioners\", the tower acquired the name \"Tower of Blood\" or \"Red Tower\" (Turkish: Kanli Kule), a name which it kept until the end of the 19th century.When Thessaloniki was taken from the Ottoman Empire by the Hellenic State in 1912 during the First Balkan War, the tower was whitewashed as a symbolic gesture of cleansing, and acquired its present name (there are numerous photographs from 1880s-90s showing the tower already white). King George I of Greece was assassinated not far from the White Tower in March 1913.\nThe Tower is now a buff colour but has retained the name White Tower. It now stands on Thessaloniki's waterfront boulevard, Nikis (Victory) Street. It houses a museum dedicated to the history of Thessaloniki and is one of the city's leading tourist attractions.\n\n\n== White Tower Museum ==\n\nThe White Tower houses an exhibition dedicated to the city of Thessaloniki and its history throughout various periods, organized by the city's Museum of Byzantine Culture. It is under the administration of the Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities of the Greek Ministry of Culture.\nThe Tower is open to the public, and visitors have the opportunity to view a map of the city with monuments and museums, a timeline with events relevant to Thessaloniki, scientific articles of distinguished historians and archaeologists, bibliography etc. School excursions may be arranged by contacting the Byzantine Museum.\n\n\n=== 2002 exhibit ===\nFor the first few months of 2002 the White Tower housed 'Byzantine Hours', an exhibition devoted to ordinary life in Byzantine times.\nExhibits on the first floor were part of the thematic unit entitled 'Professionals in the market place'. To be more precise, there were tools and other objects belonging to goldsmiths, blade-smiths, cobblers, glass-makers and tilers, coins and a model of the city of Thessaloniki market place. The second floor was devoted to journeys and trade. So exhibits included objects and texts related to journeys by sea and overland, fairs, spectacles and pilgrimages.\nThe third floor was focused mainly on the presentation of the Byzantine home and what the inside, the decoration, suppers and the neighbourhood were like. One floor above this there was an exhibition of life at home with garments and footwear, cosmetics, perfume and jewellery, personal grooming, and even superstitions. The theme of the top floor was death, covering burial and graves, funerary customs, finds from graves, gravestone inscriptions from cemeteries, even objects and specimens of magic were on display in the show cases on the top floor of the Tower.\nThe tower is now used as a museum.\n\n\n== White Tower banknotes controversy ==\n\nIn the early 1990s, the White Tower, located in the capital city of the Greek region of Macedonia, became the focus of a major controversy between Greece and the newly independent Republic of Macedonia, previously part of the former Yugoslavia. The controversy was part of a larger dispute over the historically important name of Macedonia.\n\nUnofficial \"Makedonka\" souvenir banknotes, created by nationalist organizations in the Republic of Macedonia, depicted the White Tower of Thessaloniki, in spite of the tower being located in the Greek region of Macedonia and not in the Republic of Macedonia. VMRO-DPMNE went so far as to propose the White Tower-depicting banknote's official adoption. However, the government in Skopje rejected its official use and adopted a different design for the new Macedonian denar, which was issued in 1992.IMPRES, nonetheless, printed unofficial banknotes depicting the White Tower, which were sold as souvenirs on the streets of Skopje, bearing the disclaimer, \"This is a souvenir banknote and not for official use.\"The printing of the notes became the subject of a rumor in Greece that the currency of the new neighbouring state did in fact depict Greek symbols \u2014a highly controversial point, given the dispute with the Republic of Macedonia over its name and flag. The notes were never placed in circulation, as they were not legal tender, but the episode nonetheless exacerbated the ill will felt between the two countries and helped to aggravate tensions.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nGlenny, Misha (2001). \"A maze of conspiracy\".

          "This tower is steeped in history and should be one of your stops when visiting Thessaloniki. Built in the late 15th century and has served as a fortification, a prison and now a museum. The name White Tower came about after a convict whitewashed it in 1890 in order to be freed",
          "It was wonderful to tour the White Tower, such a landmark on the Thessalonian waterfront. I found the displays confusing because they were not chronological and there could be several centuries between exhibits near each other. The history of the city is so extensive and so",
          "You can chill relaxed around the tower. You can go to the top of the tower for a complete overview of the bay. There you can also some boat trips along the coast. Cool place to go.",
          "The audio tour here provides an amazing history lesson of the importance of Thessaloniki in Greece and the region But make sure you get the audio as all signs are in Greek!",
          "I visited the tower cause is one of the town symbols. Unfortunatelly is was totally reconstructed and lost its charm. One of the best attractions from this town.",
          "a must visit when you are in thessaloniki. in a walking distance from aristotelous square and very close to alexander the great statue",
          "The most popular symbol of Thessaloniki. You could learn all about city history in modern and interesting multimedial presentations. At the top you are rewarded with breathtaking view of port and city. One have to pay entrance at affordable price.",
          "A beautiful view of the White tower, and the board walk in Thessaloniki! A must see when you visit Greece!",
          "we went in to the white tower the view is amazing from top the is a lot of stairs\ud83d\ude05 outside the white tower people seat around chilling relaxing u can walk or cycle also go by boat around . there also cafes and restaurands around",
          "Outside is better than inside. We did not get a headset & were not offered one. Even a leaflet would be helpful.There is no information in English and I appreciate we were in Greece. Not worth the climb. It was closed for a few days while we were there and we were looking",
          "I was disappointed in the exhibit. I would have thought the tour would be about the White Tower, it is not. It is the history of the city. Thankfully we got a headset since all the written information is only in Greek.",
          "The history of Thessaloniki was fascinating. You can take in the three levels of information at your leisure as they provide hand held radio sets in the language of your choice.",
          "Love looking at the white tower just sitting in one of the cafes or bars near the seafront of Thessaloniki- not only the emblem of a romantic city but also a gem in ottoman architecture: compact and elegant, it houses the city's history museum and offers a lovley view on the top",
          "Better from outside like from inside. All exhibition inside is only in greek language, but you can rent a audio guide. But my opinion that you don't need. Read about this place something in guide book before visit.",
          "There are 6 floors where they are telling the story of thessaloniki. 2nd floor was closed. Last floor had a souvenir shop but very poor suplied. At every floor there were woman guards which kept folowing us, not pleasant. Not worth the 4 euro per person. Better save tbe money",
          "Worth the walk from the town. Interesting facts about the whole area and lovely outside to sit and watch everything going on",
          "Small entrance fee of \u20ac4. Learn more about the history of the area and climb the staircase for beautiful views of the city and harbour.",
          "There was very nice view, but we were missing the texts on exhibition in English. The entry cost 4 euros for adult.",
          "we have been accompanied by a local tour guide and heard the history/ The buildingis not so impressive without understanding the history and about his nick name \"the red tower\"",
          "Exhibition is about history of the city and from the top view is beautiful. You get audio guide which is included in price, but could be done a bit better. Definitely a land mark of Thessaloniki that should be visited, we needed about hour and a half.",
          "We had a great view over the whole city of Thessaloniki from the top of the tower on one side and on the other side there is an overview over the sea till the port.",
          "Have just returned from a fabulous visit to this great city. The White Tower was very much on our to do list. When we arrived, we were given the price at the door for 'over 65's'. Upon entry the reception girl took exception that I asked for the discount, saying we weren't from",
          "To go inside the cost is almost nothing it\u2019s beautiful to see the history of that white towel The view it\u2019s beautiful and you can take pictures",
          "The white tower has a story . Visiting hours are posted at the door. Downtown Thessaloniki. Great views. Take a boat ride especially at night . They run all the way to 2am. We had fun. Some girls were hopping from boat to boat. Great restaurants around .",
          "It a nice walk at the beach site. A part a history also near the tower their is Great Alexander sculpture and the Beautiful umbrellas art.",
          "The white tower is a nice landmark on the sea front with an endless promenade. Entrance fee is very reasonable at only \u20ac4 with option to have audio commentary in various languages. The exhibition is set over various levels, accessed by steps. A really interesting insight into",
          "Not much to write on this historic site. It was real hot inside and did not enjoy. I recommend getting the audio guide because most of the information is written in Greek.",
          "The White Tower is a symbol of Thessaloniki and rightly so. Having changed hands, with the city, so many times in the last 500 years, makes it interesting. The view from the top terrace towards the city and the harbour is great, but what makes it worth a visit is the museum",
          "the monument is interesting from distance but was closed due to security issues as written in a paper in the front door. When I learned that the Ottoman Turkish concurred the place and used it as a dungeon and tortured people there i lost my appetite to go inside. So in",
          "It is the most famous monumental in Thessaloniki. On the coast, near the port. With a beautiful view from the top. In this area are some good restourants. Pretty walk in the area.",
          "It was a great walk on the seaside, lovely history and great restoration. Wasn\u2019t over crowded, and was conveniently situated in the tourist district which we were able to walk to from our hotel.",
          "Went there with friends and their children (7yrs). The museum is very modern and not terribly large. It deals with the history of the city, mostly through videos and text. Text is Greek only, so Audioguides (included in the 4\u20ac entry fee) are a must. Be aware that you usually",
          "We didnt have time for audio guide but also hadnt realised all the interpretation boards are in Greek only.",
          "Take the (free) audio guide, give yourself one hour and patience to explore all 6 levels, and you'll be able to learn tons about the local history, culture and civilization. Amazing views from the top of the tower. You surely need to visit this place!",
          "The symbol of Thessaloniki.. Is an amazing historical tower always open for the peaple to get in to enjoy and learn about thehistory of the town.. Just amazing",
          "Thessaloniki is a very filthy full of uneducated people and lacking parking spots! This tower can be seen from your car as you go through this city and leave it behind as soon as possible! To be avoided!",
          "We are on the sea, there is no beache in this said of the city, bjt u have this beautiful tower. if u like, you should take taxi bout for a few min and u get to the other saide of the beache.",
          "A must see for visitors. A great location to just hang out too or catch a cheesy, touristy, pirate/bar boat ride!",
          "The tower looks great. Worth going inside and learning some Greek culture. This is good anytime you are in Thessaloniki and want to go for a walk or hangout by the tower.",
          "Worth a visit to understand the massacre that civilisation has brought to this one magic town filled with romance garden and clean air ! Now a filthy mess something Greece should humiliate themselves for.",
          "If you find yourself in Thessaloniki the White Tower is a must on your list. Historical value aside sweeping views of the harbor and the city. Take in the Venetian architecture and enjoy a historical tour. Not handicap friendly and many steps to the top. Be aware it\u2019s hot in",
          "Staff working at tower were horrendous to english speaking tourists. View was good but not worth the entrance fee.",
          "The tower is nice, but crikey is the a lot of trading inside. The audio guide takes forever and send you to sleep. It's with a visit but be detective on what parts of the guide you listen to",
          "The White Tower is a nice photo spot espacially in the hours of sunset. It is reachable in foot walk distance from the City centre.",
          "Clearly, this museum wants to attract foreign visitors. It offers audio tours in English and combination tickets with some of the other major museums in the city. But they make the exhibit entirely inaccessible to anyone who cannot read Greek. The museum has almost no actual",
          "It was quite alright. A lot of tourists were here, and some pirate boats around it. Its worth a look.",
          "Situated at the opposite end of the ports at Thessaloniki waterfront the white tower is very interesting. It is a reasonably hard climb from bottom to top via the winding internal steps so try and avoid it if you have health issues. As you wind your way up the stairs there is a",
          "Interesting historical site. The White Tower in Thessaloniki (in addition to another 6 towers for peripheral protection of the city, in addition the wall) was established in Salonika by the Ottomans as a fortress to protect the maritime front of the region. In time, it became a",
          "It is always there either you see it from the port or walking to reach him on niki's promenand it is always there as the old sign of the city The sightseeing bus starts from here",
          "Well worth the visit...expect the long climb up though but the view is worth it. Listening to the stories as you ascend each level opens your eyes to the history of Thessaloniki and Greece.",
          "A very good preserved building with a lot of exchibition inside, about the life of Salonic. If you are there, it is a must to visit this location.",
          "I had a look online and the closing time for the White Tower is 8pm, I wanted to have a quick look inside so I went to visit one evening at 7.50pm and was refused entry by a very cold lady. I think if a place is going to refuse entry before closing time they should at least note",
          "I was on a work trip so didn\u2019t go inside the tower or find out about it\u2019s history. But compared to other cities this tower is nothing special and a bit touristy",
          "It has been a while since I read the reviews of the White Tower, and they may have changed, but last spring, reviewers compained that all the commentary was in Greek. This is true, but all you need to do is ask for a free audio guide in English, and click on the same numbers",
          "The tower itself is very nice and comfortable to climb with each floor (total of 6 floors) representing a different aspect of Thessaloniki. Worth mentioning that the explanations in the tower are written in Greek only but you can get a speaker guide which has an English option.",
          "If one has the time should \"climb\" through the stairs.. It has some interesting info. Only with athletic shoes",
          "It was disappointing because all the information under the displays were in Greek. The history was not in any chonological order. There was no history or evidence of how the tower had actually been used. It is a wonderful structure; just feel it could be exploited better.",
          "The white tower is one of the towers part of the city wall that remained. It's beautiful and going inside is totally worth it. In the tower there is a museum about Thessaloniki and each floor (there are 6) is about a theme. You can get an audio guise for free, which makes the",
          "The main city monument served as a prison and execution site during ottoman years. Now it has been transported into city museum. Don't forget to have a cup of coffee at the cafeteria at the top of the tower. The view from up there is spectacular.",
          "If you are interested in the social history of Thessaloniki don't miss this museum. Allow at least one hour and take one of the audio phones on offer.",
          "Worth paying 4euro per adult enabling you to see city, sea and hill view all together. Of course also can feel the age of the ruin and the history.",
          "The White Tower offers an amazing view of the city and the sea. It is definitely worth a visit if you ever go to Thessaloniki.",
          "Wow it\u2019s all lit up and night and stands out. It\u2019s just beautiful! We walked around it and then around the perimeter just lovely. The boats next to and the sea and the surroundings are beautiful. A lovely place to visit during the day or night x",
          "This is something I have seen in all the pictures that I encountered about Thessaloniki. so it was great to finally be next to it",
          "If you're visiting Thessaloniki you have to pay the 4 euros (so cheap) to climb White Tower and get a 360 view of the city and Thermaikos Gulf. It's a great spot to snap some pictures and enjoy the summer breeze on top.",
          "An impressive tower at looks out across the City and the sea. 4 euro to climb to the top and the great views.",
          "It\u2019s nice to be on the top of White Tower,great view.Inside was nice too,but not a lot of information about history and everything was written in Greek,so we didn\u2019t understand.",
          "We needed to get away from the hot sun and we came to Thessaloniki with the rain:)) Wonderful shoreline to the sea, great views, great people. Mandatory to visit when in Greece.",
          "Visit the once dreadful prison, then called Blood Tower and catch a nice overview of the city above its coastline. Access is rather easy, following the inclined internal spiral roundwalk with a few steps every now and then and interesting exhibitions on some of the tower levels.",
          "The view from the top of the White Tower in Thessaloniki is spectacular - highly recommended if you are in the central part of the city.",
          "Thessaloniki, Greece is a beautiful city with a relaxed and vibrant atmosphere. It is a MUST TO SEE. It gave a full historical detail about the tower and its history as well as the history of Thessaloniki and its surrounding areas. The only bad thing about the Tower tour is",
          "Lovely 6 flights of history and information about Thessaloniki. Quite enjoyed the afternoon and the audio guide. Make sure to get to the top for a 360 view of the city!",
          "Its a small but lovely tower with amazin views of the bay, you can learn about the city history while you go up",
          "The Tower is located on the sea front and a view from the top is really nice. Inside the building is some kind of exhibition, but in Greek exclusively. If you are lucky and the lady selling tickets likes you,you will get an audio guide, however my husband looks Arab or Asian so",
          "I had high expectations but found the English language audio tour to be poorly related to the actual exhibits. The tower itself is interesting.",
          "While they tried to offer some assistance with a mobile audio guide in many languages, the exhibits were very lightweight. It would have been easier to sit for a short film than to persevere through the numbered exhibits. The view at the top of the tower is very nice but among",
          "Even though it was raining we had to walk to the tower. No other tourists were out and about. Nice sovenier shop near by. Good coffee along the way too.",
          "Climb to the top through the narrow stair cases and you'll have an amazing panoramic view over the city and sea! Not too expensive neither so highly recommended.",
          "For an opportunity to find out more about Thessaloniki, and see across the city, make sure you go up the White Tower. The steps are gentle, and there are exhibits on each floor to take a breather - some of them weren't complete, or working, which was disappointing, but the view",
          "There is not much interesting about it to be honest but it has been preserved quite well and it really offers a nice view of the city and neighborhood.",
          "Special, worth visiting, no more than 15 minutes including knowing the history of the tower.The surroundings promenade, very nice tour and I recommend the afternoon and not in the middle of the day very hot !!!",
          "Check with anyone about the most famous spot in the city and they would guide you here. The tower I surrounded by cafes and people all the time. You can listen to street performers, catch ferry boats and grab some roasted corn. It makes for a nice stroll in the evening. The view",
          "Beautiful place, but we found the recorded tour way to long, it was all about the story of Thessaloniki, we wanted to know more on the how and why of the white tower!",
          "Probably Thessaloniki's most famous landmark and you can not mis it when walking on the foreshore. It seems to be the centre of activities on the foreshore.",
          "Nice complement to the waterfront promenade, the white tower is interesting to be visited, hosting a maritime exposition.",
          "Thessaloniki's landmark, the White Tower is the best place to take photos (both with it and on it). Enjoyed going up the tower, but the free audio guide is totally usless, it has no info whatsoever. Don't waste time taking it. Nice views from the tower. It's quite small and gets",
          "My advice would be skip the exhibitions on the various floors and head straight for the roof to get some great views over the city and the bay. The exhibitions were rather uninteresting and dull, especially if you have already been to the utterly amazing Byzantine museum",
          "The main attraction in the city of Thessaloniki right next to the sea (where the boats leave every hour for a 30 minutes trip). In the evening people chill next to it and there is also some dancing organised in open air. It\u2019s close to the (cheaper) student area. We didn\u2019t enter",
          "You must see chevk this one while in Thessaloniki. Even if you don't enter the tower, you can walk around it. The sea is near it and you have a nice view from there: at the tower or at the sea.",
          "The symbol of Thessaloniki, must visit place. The entrance is 4 euro per person, you can take audio guide in english, german, russian. There are five exibitions on your way to the top of the tower, each of these presenting various aspects of city history, culture and people.",
          "At each floor of the tower you can find a different exhibition that helps you discover parts of the greek history. And from the top you get a pretty nice cityscape and waterscape. Used to be a prison while ottoman domination, and it was remodeled to what we see today after",
          "Great starting point for city tour, gives you a good overview of the history and background. Very nice setting and photo shot right near the water. Experience the White Tower before getting on one of the city bus tours.",

          "A small exhibition place with pictures and information about the history of the city, nothing special, but the view from the top is worth a visit.",

          "The White Tower is one of Thessaloniki's most famous landmarks. It is worth climbing up to the top and enjoying the views of the waterfront area of the city. If you plan on visiting one of the museums in Thessaloniki it will be worth getting a ticket which includes the museums (",
          "The White Tower is the attraction which on the one side helps you to get around in the city (orientation) and on the other side, it is another astonishing landmark from ancient history. It seems a bit expensive to go up, but the view from outside is pleasant as well. This",
          "Simple ... it more interesting from outside than inside. You go up to see the town for higher level but the view is not exceptional ... ordinary ...",

          "worth while visiting, the presented history about the town and the way it is presented (incl. free audioguide) is excellent. One can learn quite alot about the past of the town and the curse overtime. the view from the top is good, however there is no fascinating skyline to be",
          "The tower is part of the museum of Byzantine art which is further down the boulevard. Sadly there is no English information so you have to guess and just look the pictures. The view from the top of the tower is beautiful.",

          "Boring exhibitions in Greek only. Likewise, at the top, some old photos again with Greek text only indicates some parts of the town you see. Nothing (I think) about the rest of the area. Where is Mt Olympos, for example? Save your 8 euros and skip this boring \"attraction\".",

It is also known in Greek as \u03b7 \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 (i Simprot\u00e9vousa), literally \"the co-capital\", a reference to its historical status as the \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 (Simvasil\u00e9vousa) or \"co-reigning\" city of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, alongside Constantinople.Thessaloniki is located on the Thermaic Gulf, at the northwest corner of the Aegean Sea. It is bounded on the west by the delta of the Axios. The municipality of Thessaloniki, the historical center, had a population of 325,182 in 2011, while the Thessaloniki Urban Area had a population of 824,676 and the Thessaloniki metropolitan area had 1,030,338 inhabitants in 2011. It is Greece's second major economic, industrial, commercial and political centre; it is a major transportation hub for Greece and southeastern Europe, notably through the Port of Thessaloniki. The city is renowned for its festivals, events and vibrant cultural life in general, and is considered to be Greece's cultural capital. Events such as the Thessaloniki International Fair and the Thessaloniki International Film Festival are held annually, while the city also hosts the largest bi-annual meeting of the Greek diaspora. Thessaloniki was the 2014 European Youth Capital.The city of Thessaloniki was founded in 315 BC by Cassander of Macedon. An important metropolis by the Roman period, Thessaloniki was the second largest and wealthiest city of the Byzantine Empire. It was conquered by the Ottomans in 1430, and remained an important seaport and multi-ethnic metropolis during the nearly five centuries of Turkish rule. It passed from the Ottoman Empire to Greece on 8 November 1912. It is home to numerous notable Byzantine monuments, including the Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as several Roman, Ottoman and Sephardic Jewish structures. The city's main university, Aristotle University, is the largest in Greece and the Balkans.Thessaloniki is a popular tourist destination in Greece. In 2013, National Geographic Magazine included Thessaloniki in its top tourist destinations worldwide, while in 2014 Financial Times FDI magazine (Foreign Direct Investments) declared Thessaloniki as the best mid-sized European city of the future for human capital and lifestyle. Among street photographers, the center of Thessaloniki is also considered the most popular destination for street photography in Greece.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe original name of the city was \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thessalon\u00edk\u0113. It was named after princess Thessalonike of Macedon, the half sister of Alexander the Great, whose name means \"Thessalian victory\", from \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 Thessalos, and \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 'victory' (Nike), honoring the Macedonian victory at the Battle of Crocus Field (353/352 BC).\nMinor variants are also found, including \u0398\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thettalon\u00edki, \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 Thessalon\u00edkia, \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thessalon\u00edki, and \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd Thessalonik\u00e9on.The name \u03a3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Salon\u00edki is first attested in Greek in the Chronicle of the Morea (14th century), and is common in folk songs, but it must have originated earlier, as al-Idrisi called it Salunik already in the 12th century. It is the basis for the city's name in other languages: \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0479\u043d\u044a (Solun) in Old Church Slavonic, \u05e1\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05d4 (Salonika) in Ladino, \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0643 (Sel\u00e2nik) in Ottoman Turkish and Selanik in modern Turkish, Salonicco in Italian, Solun or \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d in the local and neighboring South Slavic languages, \u0421\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 (Salon\u00edki) in Russian, and S\u00e3run\u00e3 in Aromanian, and Salonica or Salonika in English.Thessaloniki was revived as the city's official name in 1912, when it joined the Kingdom of Greece during the Balkan Wars. In local speech, the city's name is typically pronounced with a dark and deep L characteristic of Modern Macedonian accent. The name is often abbreviated as \u0398\u03b5\u03c3/\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== From classical antiquity to the Roman Empire ===\n\nThe city was founded around 315 BC by the King Cassander of Macedon, on or near the site of the ancient town of Therma and 26 other local villages. He named it after his wife Thessalonike, a half-sister of Alexander the Great and princess of Macedonia as daughter of Philip II. Under the kingdom of Macedonia the city retained its own autonomy and parliament and evolved to become the most important city in Macedonia.After the fall of the Kingdom of Macedonia in 168 BC, in 148 BC Thessalonica was made the capital of the Roman province of Macedonia.  Thessalonica became a free city of the Roman Republic under Mark Antony in 41 BC. It grew to be an important trade hub located on the Via Egnatia, the road connecting Dyrrhachium with Byzantium, which facilitated trade between Thessaloniki and great centers of commerce such as Rome and Byzantium.  Thessaloniki also lay at the southern end of the main north\u2013south route through the Balkans along the valleys of the Morava and Axios river valleys, thereby linking the Balkans with the rest of Greece. The city became the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia; later it became the capital of all the Greek provinces of the Roman Empire because of its importance in the Balkan peninsula.\nAt the time of the Roman Empire, about 50 A.D., Thessaloniki was also one of the early centers of Christianity; while on his second missionary journey, Paul the Apostle visited this city's chief synagogue on three Sabbaths and sowed the seeds for Thessaloniki's first Christian church.  Later, Paul wrote two letters to the new church at Thessaloniki, preserved in the Biblical canon as First and Second Thessalonians.  Some scholars hold that the First Epistle to the Thessalonians is the first written book of the New Testament.\n\nIn 306 AD, Thessaloniki acquired a patron saint, St. Demetrius, a Christian whom Galerius is said to have put to death. Most scholars agree with Hippolyte Delehaye's theory that Demetrius was not a Thessaloniki native, but his veneration was transferred to Thessaloniki when it replaced Sirmium as the main military base in the Balkans. A basilical church dedicated to St. Demetrius, Hagios Demetrios, was first built in the 5th century AD and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided into the tetrarchy, Thessaloniki became the administrative capital of one of the four portions of the Empire under Galerius Maximianus Caesar, where Galerius commissioned an imperial palace, a new hippodrome, a triumphal arch and a mausoleum among others.In 379, when the Roman Prefecture of Illyricum was divided between the East and West Roman Empires, Thessaloniki became the capital of the new Prefecture of Illyricum. The following year, the Edict of Thessalonica made Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire. In 390, Gothic troops under the Roman Emperor Theodosius I, led a massacre against the inhabitants of Thessalonica, who had risen in revolt against the Gothic soldiers.  By the time of the Fall of Rome in 476, Thessaloniki was the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era and Middle Ages ===\n\nFrom the first years of the Byzantine Empire, Thessaloniki was considered the second city in the Empire after Constantinople, both in terms of wealth and size. with a population of 150,000 in the mid-12th century. The city held this status until its transfer to Venetian control in 1423. In the 14th century, the city's population exceeded 100,000 to 150,000, making it larger than London at the time.During the 6th and 7th centuries, the area around Thessaloniki was invaded by Avars and Slavs, who unsuccessfully laid siege to the city several times, as narrated in the Miracles of Saint Demetrius. Traditional historiography stipulates that many Slavs settled in the hinterland of Thessaloniki; however, modern scholars consider this migration to have been on a much smaller scale than previously thought. In the 9th century, the Byzantine Greek missionaries Cyril and Methodius, both natives of the city, created the first literary language of the Slavs, the Old Church Slavonic, most likely based on the Slavic dialect used in the hinterland of their hometown.An Arab naval attack in 904 resulted in the sack of the city.\nThe economic expansion of the city continued through the 12th century as the rule of the Komnenoi emperors expanded Byzantine control to the north. Thessaloniki passed out of Byzantine hands in 1204, when Constantinople was captured by the forces of the Fourth Crusade and incorporated the city and its surrounding territories in the Kingdom of Thessalonica \u2014 which then became the largest vassal of the Latin Empire. In 1224, the Kingdom of Thessalonica was overrun by the Despotate of Epirus, a remnant of the former Byzantine Empire, under Theodore Komnenos Doukas who crowned himself Emperor, and the city became the capital of the short-lived Empire of Thessalonica. Following his defeat at Klokotnitsa however in 1230, the Empire of Thessalonica became a vassal state of the Second Bulgarian Empire until it was recovered again in 1246, this time by the Nicaean Empire.In 1342, the city saw the rise of the Commune of the Zealots, an anti-aristocratic party formed of sailors and the poor, which is nowadays described as social-revolutionary. The city was practically independent of the rest of the Empire, as it had its own government, a form of republic. The zealot movement was overthrown in 1350 and the city was reunited with the rest of the Empire.The capture of Gallipoli by the Ottomans in 1354 kicked off a rapid Turkish expansion in the southern Balkans, conducted both by the Ottomans themselves and by semi-independent Turkish ghazi warrior-bands. By 1369, the Ottomans were able to conquer Adrianople (modern Edirne), which became their new capital until 1453. Thessalonica, ruled by Manuel II Palaiologos (r. 1391\u20131425) itself surrendered after a lengthy siege in 1383\u20131387, along with most of eastern and central Macedonia, to the forces of Sultan Murad I. Initially, the surrendered cities were allowed complete autonomy in exchange for payment of the kharaj poll-tax. Following the death of Emperor John V Palaiologos in 1391, however, Manuel II escaped Ottoman custody and went to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor, succeeding his father. This angered Sultan Bayezid I, who laid waste to the remaining Byzantine territories, and then turned on Chrysopolis, which was captured by storm and largely destroyed. Thessalonica too submitted again to Ottoman rule at this time, possibly after brief resistance, but was treated more leniently: although the city was brought under full Ottoman control, the Christian population and the Church retained most of their possessions, and the city retained its institutions.\n\nThessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until 1403, when Emperor Manuel II sided with Bayezid's eldest son S\u00fcleyman in the Ottoman succession struggle that broke out following the crushing defeat and capture of Bayezid at the Battle of Ankara against Tamerlane in 1402. In exchange for his support, in the Treaty of Gallipoli the Byzantine emperor secured the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the Chalcidice peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers Strymon and Pineios. Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous appanage to John VII Palaiologos. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the Despot Andronikos Palaiologos, who was supervised by Demetrios Leontares until 1415. Thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity after 1403, as the Turks were preoccupied with their own civil war, but was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by Musa \u00c7elebi) and 1416 (during the uprising of Mustafa \u00c7elebi against Mehmed I). Once the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city began to increase again. Just as during the 1383\u20131387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western help, or submission to the Ottomans.In 1423, Despot Andronikos Palaiologos ceded it to the Republic of Venice with the hope that it could be protected from the Ottomans who were besieging the city. The Venetians held Thessaloniki until it was captured by the Ottoman Sultan Murad II on 29 March 1430.\n\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n\nWhen Sultan Murad II captured Thessaloniki and sacked it in 1430, contemporary reports estimated that about one-fifth of the city's population was enslaved. Ottoman artillery was used to secure the city's capture and bypass its double walls. Upon the conquest of Thessaloniki, some of its inhabitants escaped, including intellectuals such as Theodorus Gaza \"Thessalonicensis\" and Andronicus Callistus. However, the change of sovereignty from the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman one did not affect the city's prestige as a major imperial city and trading hub. Thessaloniki and Smyrna, although smaller in size than Constantinople, were the Ottoman Empire's most important trading hubs. Thessaloniki's importance was mostly in the field of shipping, but also in manufacturing, while most of the city's trade was controlled by ethnic Greeks.\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, the city's population of Ottoman Muslims (including those of Turkish origin, as well as Albanian Muslim, Bulgarian Muslim and Greek Muslim of convert origin) grew substantially. According to the 1478 census Sel\u00e2nik (Ottoman Turkish: \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0643\u200e), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniots community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the city's population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regime's invitation to Jewish settlement was a strategy to prevent the ethnic Greek population from dominating the city.Thessaloniki was the capital of the Sanjak of Selanik within the wider Rumeli Eyalet (Balkans) until 1826, and subsequently the capital of Selanik Eyalet (after 1867, the Selanik Vilayet). This consisted of the sanjaks of Selanik, Serres and Drama between 1826 and 1912.\n\nWith the break out of the Greek War of Independence in the spring of 1821, the governor Yusuf Bey imprisoned in his headquarters more than 400 hostages. On 18 May, when Yusuf learned of the insurrection to the villages of Chalkidiki, he ordered half of his hostages to be slaughtered before his eyes. The mulla of Thessaloniki, Hayr\u0131\u00fclah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations: \"Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning. It seems that Yusuf Bey, the Yeniceri Agasi, the Suba\u015f\u0131, the hocas and the ulemas have all gone raving mad.\" It would take until the end of the century for the city's Greek community to recover.Thessaloniki was also a Janissary stronghold where novice Janissaries were trained. In June 1826, regular Ottoman soldiers attacked and destroyed the Janissary base in Thessaloniki while also killing over 10,000 Janissaries, an event known as The Auspicious Incident in Ottoman history. In 1870\u20131917, driven by economic growth, the city's population expanded by 70%, reaching 135,000 in 1917.The last few decades of Ottoman control over the city were an era of revival, particularly in terms of the city's infrastructure. It was at that time that the Ottoman administration of the city acquired an \"official\" face with the creation of the Government House while a number of new public buildings were built in the eclectic style in order to project the European face both of Thessaloniki and the Ottoman Empire. The city walls were torn down between 1869 and 1889, efforts for a planned expansion of the city are evident as early as 1879, the first tram service started in 1888 and the city streets were illuminated with electric lamp posts in 1908. In 1888 the Oriental Railway connected Thessaloniki to Central Europe via rail through Belgrade and to Monastir in 1893, while the Thessaloniki-Istanbul Junction Railway connected it to Constantinople in 1896.\n\n\n=== 20th century and since ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, Thessaloniki was in the center of radical activities by various groups; the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, founded in 1897, and the Greek Macedonian Committee, founded in 1903. In 1903 an anarchist group known as the Boatmen of Thessaloniki planted bombs in several buildings in Thessaloniki, including the Ottoman Bank, with some assistance from the IMRO. The Greek consulate in Ottoman Thessaloniki (now the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle) served as the center of operations for the Greek guerillas.\nDuring this period, and since the 14th century, Thessaloniki's Jewish element was the most dominant; it was the only city in Europe where the Jews were a majority of the total population. The city was ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan. In 1890 its population had risen to 118,000, 47% of which were Jews, followed by Turks (22%), Greeks (14%), Bulgars (8%), Roma (2%), and others (7%). By 1913, the ethnic composition of the city had changed so that the population stood at 157,889, with Jews at 39%, followed again by Turks (29%), Greeks (25%), Bulgars (4%), Roma (2%), and others at 1%. Many varied religions were practiced and many languages spoken, including Ladino, a dialect of Spanish spoken by the city's Jews.\nThessaloniki was also the center of activities of the Young Turks, a political reform movement, which goal was to replace the Ottoman Empire's absolute monarchy with a constitutional government. The Young Turks started out as an underground movement, until finally in 1908, they started the Young Turk Revolution from the city of Thessaloniki, by which their revolutionaries gained control over the Ottoman Empire. Eleftherias (Liberty) Square, where the Young Turks gathered at the outbreak of the revolution, is named after the event.\n\nAs the First Balkan War broke out, Greece declared war on the Ottoman Empire and expanded its borders. When Eleftherios Venizelos, Prime Minister at the time, was asked if the Greek army should move towards Thessaloniki or Monastir (now Bitola, Republic of North Macedonia), Venizelos replied \"\u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2!\" (Thessaloniki, at all costs!). As both Greece and Bulgaria wanted Thessaloniki, the Ottoman garrison of the city entered negotiations with both armies. On 8 November 1912 (26 October Old Style), the feast day of the city's patron saint, Saint Demetrius, the Greek Army accepted the surrender of the Ottoman garrison at Thessaloniki. The Bulgarian army arrived one day after the surrender of the city to Greece and Tahsin Pasha, ruler of the city, told the Bulgarian officials that \"I have only one Thessaloniki, which I have surrendered\". After the Second Balkan War, Thessaloniki and the rest of the Greek portion of Macedonia were officially annexed to Greece by the Treaty of Bucharest in 1913. On 18 March 1913 George I of Greece was assassinated in the city by Alexandros Schinas.In 1915, during World War I, a large Allied expeditionary force established a base at Thessaloniki for operations against pro-German Bulgaria. This culminated in the establishment of the Macedonian Front, also known as the Salonika Front. In 1916, pro-Venizelist Greek army officers and civilians, with the support of the Allies, launched an uprising, creating a pro-Allied temporary government by the name of the \"Provisional Government of National Defence\" that controlled the \"New Lands\" (lands that were gained by Greece in the Balkan Wars, most of Northern Greece including Greek Macedonia, the North Aegean as well as the island of Crete); the official government of the King in Athens, the \"State of Athens\", controlled \"Old Greece\" which were traditionally monarchist. The State of Thessaloniki was disestablished with the unification of the two opposing Greek governments under Venizelos, following the abdication of King Constantine in 1917.On 30 December 1915 an Austrian air raid on Thessaloniki alarmed many town civilians and killed at least one person, and in response the Allied troops based there arrested the German and Austrian and Bulgarian and Turkish vice-consuls and their families and dependents and put them on a battleship, and billeted troops in their consulate buildings in Thessaloniki.\n\nMost of the old center of the city was destroyed by the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, which was started accidentally by an unattended kitchen fire on 18 August 1917. The fire swept through the centre of the city, leaving 72,000 people homeless; according to the Pallis Report, most of them were Jewish (50,000). Many businesses were destroyed, as a result, 70% of the population were unemployed. Two churches and many synagogues and mosques were lost. Nearly one-quarter of the total population of approximately 271,157 became homeless. Following the fire the government prohibited quick rebuilding, so it could implement the new redesign of the city according to the European-style urban plan prepared by a group of architects, including the Briton Thomas Mawson, and headed by French architect Ernest H\u00e9brard. Property values fell from 6.5 million Greek drachmas to 750,000.After the defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War and during the break-up of the Ottoman Empire, a population exchange took place between Greece and Turkey. Over 160,000 ethnic Greeks deported from the former Ottoman Empire \u2013 particularly Greeks from Asia Minor  and East Thrace were resettled in the city, changing its demographics. Additionally many of the city's Muslims, including Ottoman Greek Muslims, were deported to Turkey, ranging at about 20,000 people. This made the Greek element dominant, while the Jewish population was reduced to a minority for the first time since the 14th century.\n\nDuring World War II Thessaloniki was heavily bombarded by Fascist Italy (with 232 people dead, 871 wounded and over 800 buildings damaged or destroyed in November 1940 alone), and, the Italians having failed in their invasion of Greece, it fell to the forces of Nazi Germany on 8 April 1941 and went under German occupation. The Nazis soon forced the Jewish residents into a ghetto near the railroads and on 15 March 1943 began the deportation of the city's Jews to Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. Most were immediately sent to the gas chambers. Of the 45,000 Jews deported to Auschwitz, only 4% survived.\n\nDuring a speech in Reichstag, Hitler claimed that the intention of his Balkan campaign, was to prevent the Allies from establishing \"a new Macedonian front\", like they did during WWI. The importance of Thessaloniki to Nazi Germany can be demonstrated by the fact that, initially, Hitler had planned to incorporate it directly in the Third Reich (that is, make it part of Germany) and not have it controlled by a puppet state such as the Hellenic State or an ally of Germany (Thessaloniki had been promised to Yugoslavia as a reward for joining the Axis on 25 March 1941). As it was the first major city in Greece to fall to the occupying forces, the first Greek resistance group formed in Thessaloniki (under the name \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, Elefther\u00eda, \"Freedom\") as well as the first anti-Nazi newspaper in an occupied territory anywhere in Europe, also by the name Eleftheria. Thessaloniki was also home to a military camp-converted-concentration camp, known in German as \"Konzentrationslager Pavlo Mela\" (Pavlos Melas Concentration Camp), where members of the resistance and other anti-fascists were held either to be killed or sent to other concentration camps. On 30 October 1944, after battles with the retreating German army and the Security Battalions of Poulos, forces of ELAS entered Thessaloniki as liberators headed by Markos Vafiadis (who didn't obey to orders from ELAS leadership in Athens to not enter the city). Pro-EAM celebrations and demonstrations followed in the city. In the 1946 monarchy referendum, the majority of the locals voted in favor of a republic, contrary to the rest of Greece.After the war, Thessaloniki was rebuilt with large-scale development of new infrastructure and industry throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Many of its architectural treasures still remain, adding value to the city as a tourist destination, while several early Christian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1988. In 1997, Thessaloniki was celebrated as the European Capital of Culture, sponsoring events across the city and the region. Agency established to oversee the cultural activities of that year 1997 was still in existence by 2010. In 2004 the city hosted a number of the football events as part of the 2004 Summer Olympics.Today, Thessaloniki has become one of the most important trade and business hubs in Southeastern Europe, with its port, the Port of Thessaloniki being one of the largest in the Aegean and facilitating trade throughout the Balkan hinterland. On 26 October 2012 the city celebrated its centennial since its incorporation into Greece. The city also forms one of the largest student centers in Southeastern Europe, is host to the largest student population in Greece and was the European Youth Capital in 2014.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nThessaloniki lies on the northern fringe of the Thermaic Gulf on its eastern coast and is bound by Mount Chortiatis on its southeast. Its proximity to imposing mountain ranges, hills and fault lines, especially towards its southeast have historically made the city prone to geological changes.\nSince medieval times, Thessaloniki was hit by strong earthquakes, notably in 1759, 1902, 1978 and 1995. On 19\u201320 June 1978, the city suffered a series of powerful earthquakes, registering 5.5 and 6.5 on the Richter scale. The tremors caused considerable damage to a number of buildings and ancient monuments, but the city withstood the catastrophe without any major problems. One apartment building in central Thessaloniki collapsed during the second earthquake, killing many, raising the final death toll to 51.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThessaloniki's climate is directly affected by the sea it is situated on. The city lies in a transitional climatic zone, so its climate displays characteristics of several climates. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, it has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) that borders on a Mediterranean climate (Csa), as well as a semi-arid climate (BSk), observed on the periphery of the region. Its average annual precipitation of 450 mm (17.7 inches) is due to the Pindus rain shadow drying the westerly winds. However, the city has a summer precipitation between 20 to 30 mm (0.79 to 1.18 inches), which prevents it from qualifying as a Mediterranean climate (Csa), and increases gradually towards the north and west, turning humid subtropical.Winters are relatively dry, with common morning frost. Snowfalls occur sporadically more or less every winter, but the snow cover does not last for more than a few days. Fog is common, with an average of 193 foggy days in a year. During the coldest winters, temperatures can drop to \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F). The record minimum temperature in Thessaloniki was \u221214 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F). On average, Thessaloniki experiences frost (sub-zero temperature) 32 days a year. The coldest month of the year in the city is January, with an average 24-hour temperature of 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F). Wind is also usual in the winter months, with December and January having an average wind speed of 26 km/h (16 mph).Thessaloniki's summers are hot and quite dry. Maximum temperatures usually rise above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), but they rarely approach or go over 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F); the average number of days the temperature is above 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) is 32. The maximum recorded temperature in the city was 44 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F). Rain seldom falls in summer, mainly during thunderstorms. In the summer months Thessaloniki also experiences strong heat waves. The hottest month of the year in the city is July, with an average 24-hour temperature of 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F). The average wind speed for June and July in Thessaloniki is 20 kilometres per hour (12 mph).\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAccording to the Kallikratis reform, as of 1 January 2011 the Thessaloniki Urban Area (Greek: \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2) which makes up the \"City of Thessaloniki\", is made up of six self-governing municipalities (Greek: \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9) and one municipal unit (Greek: \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1). The municipalities that are included in the Thessaloniki Urban Area are those of Thessaloniki (the city center and largest in population size), Kalamaria, Neapoli-Sykies, Pavlos Melas, Kordelio-Evosmos, Ampelokipoi-Menemeni, and the municipal units of Pylaia and Panorama, part of the municipality of Pylaia-Chortiatis. Prior to the Kallikratis reform, the Thessaloniki Urban Area was made up of twice as many municipalities, considerably smaller in size, which created bureaucratic problems.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki Municipality ===\n\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki (Greek: \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2) is the second most populous in Greece, after Athens, with a resident population of 325,182 (in 2011) and an area of 19.307 square kilometres (7.454 square miles). The municipality forms the core of the Thessaloniki Urban Area, with its central district (the city center), referred to as the Kentro, meaning 'center' or 'downtown'.The city's first mayor, Osman Sait Bey, was appointed when the institution of mayor was inaugurated under the Ottoman Empire in 1912. The incumbent mayor is Konstantinos Zervas. In 2011, the municipality of Thessaloniki had a budget of \u20ac464.33 million while the budget of 2012 stands at \u20ac409.00 million.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nThessaloniki is the second largest city in Greece. It is an influential city for the northern parts of the country and is the capital of the region of Central Macedonia and the Thessaloniki regional unit. The Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace is also based in Thessaloniki, being that the city is the de facto capital of the Greek region of Macedonia.It is customary every year for the Prime Minister of Greece to announce his administration's policies on a number of issues, such as the economy, at the opening night of the Thessaloniki International Fair. In 2010, during the first months of the 2010 Greek debt crisis, the entire cabinet of Greece met in Thessaloniki to discuss the country's future.In the Hellenic Parliament, the Thessaloniki urban area constitutes a 16-seat constituency. As of the 2019 Greek legislative election the largest party in Thessaloniki is the New Democracy with 35.55% of the vote, followed by the Coalition of the Radical Left (31.29%) and the Movement for Change (6.05%). The table below summarizes the results of the latest elections.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nArchitecture in Thessaloniki is the direct result of the city's position at the centre of all historical developments in the Balkans. Aside from its commercial importance, Thessaloniki was also for many centuries the military and administrative hub of the region, and beyond this the transportation link between Europe and the Levant.\nMerchants, traders and refugees from all over Europe settled in the city. The need for commercial and public buildings in this new era of prosperity led to the construction of large edifices in the city center. During this time, the city saw the building of banks, large hotels, theatres, warehouses, and factories. Architects who designed some of the most notable buildings of the city, in the late 19th and early 20th century, include Vitaliano Poselli, Pietro Arrigoni, Xenophon Paionidis, Salvatore Poselli, Leonardo Gennari, Eli Modiano, Mosh\u00e9 Jacques, Joseph Pleyber, Frederic Charnot, Ernst Ziller, Roubens Max, Levi Ernst, Angelos Siagas, Alexandros Tzonis using mainly the styles of Eclecticism, Art Nouveau and Neobaroque.\n\nThe city layout changed after 1870, when the seaside fortifications gave way to extensive piers, and many of the oldest walls of the city were demolished, including those surrounding the White Tower, which today stands as the main landmark of the city. As parts of the early Byzantine walls were demolished, this allowed the city to expand east and west along the coast.The expansion of Eleftherias Square towards the sea completed the new commercial hub of the city and at the time was considered one of the most vibrant squares of the city. As the city grew, workers moved to the western districts, because of their proximity to factories and industrial activities; while the middle and upper classes gradually moved from the city-center to the eastern suburbs, leaving mainly businesses. In 1917, a devastating fire swept through the city and burned uncontrollably for 32 hours. It destroyed the city's historic center and a large part of its architectural heritage, but paved the way for modern development featuring wider diagonal avenues and monumental squares.\n\n\n=== City centre ===\n\nAfter the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, a team of architects and urban planners including Thomas Mawson and Ernest Hebrard, a French architect, chose the Byzantine era as the basis of their (re)building designs for Thessaloniki's city centre. The new city plan included axes, diagonal streets and monumental squares, with a street grid that would channel traffic smoothly. The plan of 1917 included provisions for future population expansions and a street and road network that would be, and still is sufficient today. It contained sites for public buildings and provided for the restoration of Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques.\n\nAlso called the historic centre, it is divided into several districts, including Dimokratias Square (Democracy Sq. known also as Vardaris) Ladadika (where many entertainment venues and tavernas are located), Kapani (were the city's central Modiano market is located), Diagonios, Navarinou, Rotonda, Agia Sofia and Hippodromio, which are all located around Thessaloniki's most central point, Aristotelous Square.\nVarious commercial stoas around Aristotelous are named from the city's past and historic personalities of the city, like stoa Hirsch, stoa Carasso/Ermou, Pelosov, Colombou, Modiano, Morpurgo, Mordoch, Simcha, Malakopi, Olympios, Emboron, Rogoti, Vyzantio, Tatti, Agiou Mina, Karipi etc.The western portion of the city centre is home to Thessaloniki's law courts, its central international railway station and the port, while its eastern side hosts the city's two universities, the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Centre, the city's main stadium, its archaeological and Byzantine museums, the new city hall and its central parks and gardens, namely those of the \u03a7\u0391\u039d\u0398 and Pedion tou Areos.\n\n\n=== Ano Poli ===\n\nAno Poli (also called Old Town and literally the Upper Town) is the heritage listed district north of Thessaloniki's city center that was not engulfed by the great fire of 1917 and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site by ministerial actions of Melina Merkouri, during the 1980s. It consists of Thessaloniki's most traditional part of the city, still featuring small stone paved streets, old squares and homes featuring old Greek and Ottoman architecture. It is the favorite area of Thessaloniki's poets, intellectuals and bohemians.\n\nAno Poli also, is the highest point in Thessaloniki and as such, is the location of the city's acropolis, its Byzantine fort, the Heptapyrgion, a large portion of the city's remaining walls, and with many of its additional Ottoman and Byzantine structures still standing. The area provides access to the Seich Sou Forest National Park and features panoramic views of the whole city and the Thermaic Gulf. On clear days Mount Olympus, at about 100 km (62 mi) away across the gulf, can also be seen towering the horizon.\n\n\n=== Northwestern Thessaloniki ===\nNorthwestern Thessaloniki had always been associated with industry and the working class because as the city grew during the 1920s, many workers had moved there, because of its proximity near factories and industrial activities.\nToday many factories and industries have been moved further out west and the area is experiencing rapid growth as does the southeast. Many factories in this area have been converted to cultural centers, while past military grounds that are being surrounded by densely built neighborhoods are awaiting transformation into parklands.\nNorthwest Thessaloniki forms the main entry point into the city of Thessaloniki with the avenues of Monastiriou, Lagkada and 26is Octovriou passing through it, as well as the extension of the A1 motorway, feeding into Thessaloniki's city center. The area is home to the Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal (KTEL), the Zeitenlik Allied memorial military cemetery and to large entertainment venues of the city, such as Milos, Fix, Vilka (which are housed in converted old factories). Northwestern Thessaloniki is also home to Moni Lazariston, located in Stavroupoli, which today forms one of the most important cultural centers for the city, including MOMus\u2013Museum of Modern Art\u2013Costakis Collection and two theatres of the National Theatre of Northern Greece. Construction on the Holocaust Museum of Greece began in the city in 2018 in the area of the Old Railway Station.\nIn this area are located the Railway Museum of Thessaloniki and the Water Supply Museum.\n\n\n=== Southeastern Thessaloniki ===\n\nThe area along the today Vasileos Georgiou and Vasilissis Olgas avenues, was up until the 1920s home to the city's most affluent residents and formed the outermost suburbs of the city at the time, with the area close to the Thermaic Gulf coast called Exoch\u00e8s (des Campagnes), from the 19th century holiday villas which defined the area. Some of them include Villa Allatini, Villa Bianca, Villa Mehmet Kapanci, Villa Modiano, Villa Mordoch and others.Today southeastern Thessaloniki has in some way become a natural extension of the city center, with the avenues of Megalou Alexandrou, Georgiou Papandreou (Antheon), Vasileos Georgiou, Vasilissis Olgas, Delfon, Konstantinou Karamanli (Nea Egnatia) and Papanastasiou passing through it, enclosing an area traditionally called \u039d\u03c4\u03b5\u03c0\u03ce (Dep\u00f3, lit. D\u00e9p\u00f4t), from the name of the old tram station, owned by a French company.\nThe municipality of Kalamaria is also located in southeastern Thessaloniki and was firstly inhabited mainly by Greek refugees from Asia Minor and East Thrace after 1922.Southeastern Thessaloniki is also home to three of the city's football stadiums, the Thessaloniki Concert Hall, the Poseidonio aquatic and athletic complex, the Northern Greece Naval Command and the old royal palace (called Palataki), located on the most westerly point of Karabournaki cape.\nOther extended residential areas that belong to southeastern Thessaloniki are Charilaou and Toumba, which is divided in \"Ano Toumpa\" and \"Kato Toumpa\". Toumba was named after the homonymous hill of Toumba, situated in the northwest of the area. It was created by refugees after the 1922 Asia Minor disaster and the population exchange (1923\u201324). Toumba is one of the most famous areas of Thessaloniki, mainly due to the football stadium of the local team PAOK FC and its important archaeological site on the hill of Toumba, where extensive archaeological research takes place.\n\n\n=== Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments (UNESCO) ===\n\nBecause of Thessaloniki's importance during the early Christian and Byzantine periods, the city is host to several paleochristian monuments that have significantly contributed to the development of Byzantine art and architecture throughout the Byzantine Empire as well as Serbia. The evolution of Imperial Byzantine architecture and the prosperity of Thessaloniki go hand in hand, especially during the first years of the Empire, when the city continued to flourish. It was at that time that the Complex of Roman emperor Galerius was built, as well as the first church of Hagios Demetrios.By the 8th century, the city had become an important administrative center of the Byzantine Empire, and handled much of the Empire's Balkan affairs. During that time, the city saw the creation of more notable Christian churches that are now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as Hagia Sophia of Thessaloniki, the Church of the Acheiropoietos, the Church of Panagia Chalkeon. When the Ottoman Empire took control of Thessaloniki in 1430, most of the city's churches were converted into mosques, but have survived to this day. Travelers such as Paul Lucas and Abdulmejid I document the city's wealth in Christian monuments during the years of the Ottoman control of the city.\nThe church of Hagios Demetrios was burnt down during the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, as did many other of the city's monuments, but it was rebuilt. During World War II, the city was extensively bombed and as such many of Thessaloniki's paleochristian and Byzantine monuments were heavily damaged. Some of the sites were not restored until the 1980s. Thessaloniki has more UNESCO World Heritage Sites listed than any other city in Greece, a total of 15 monuments. They have been listed since 1988.\n\n\n=== Urban sculpture ===\n\nThere are around 150 statues or busts in the city. Probably the most famous one is the equestrian statue of Alexander the Great on the promenade, placed in 1973 and created by sculptor Evangelos Moustakas. An equestrian statue of Constantine I, by sculptor Georgios Dimitriades, is located in Demokratias Square. Other notable statues include that of Eleftherios Venizelos by sculptor Giannis Pappas, Pavlos Melas by Natalia Mela, the statue of Emmanouel Pappas by Memos Makris, Chrysostomos of Smyrna by Athanasios Apartis, such as various creations by George Zongolopoulos.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki 2012 Program ===\n\nWith the 100th anniversary of the 1912 incorporation of Thessaloniki into Greece, the government announced a large-scale redevelopment program for the city of Thessaloniki, which aims in addressing the current environmental and spatial problems that the city faces. More specifically, the program will drastically change the physiognomy of the city by relocating the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center and grounds of the Thessaloniki International Fair outside the city centre and turning the current location into a large metropolitan park, redeveloping the coastal front of the city, relocating the city's numerous military camps and using the grounds and facilities to create large parklands and cultural centers; and the complete redevelopment of the harbor and the Lachanokipoi and Dendropotamos districts (behind and near the Port of Thessaloniki) into a commercial business district, with possible highrise developments.The plan also envisions the creation of new wide avenues in the outskirts of the city and the creation of pedestrian-only zones in the city centre. Furthermore, the program includes plans to expand the jurisdiction of Seich Sou Forest National Park and the improvement of accessibility to and from the Old Town. The ministry has said that the project will take an estimated 15 years to be completed, in 2025.Part of the plan has been implemented with extensive pedestrianization's within the city center by the municipality of Thessaloniki and the revitalization the eastern urban waterfront/promenade, \u039d\u03ad\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 (N\u00e9a Paral\u00eda, lit. new promenade), with a modern and vibrant design. Its first section opened in 2008, having been awarded as the best public project in Greece of the last five years by the Hellenic Institute of Architecture.The municipality of Thessaloniki's budget for the reconstruction of important areas of the city and the completion of the waterfront, opened in January 2014, was estimated at around \u20ac28.2 million (US$39.9 million) for the year 2011 alone.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThessaloniki rose to economic prominence as a major economic hub in the Balkans during the years of the Roman Empire. The Pax Romana and the city's strategic position allowed for the facilitation of trade between Rome and Byzantium (later Constantinople and now Istanbul) through Thessaloniki by means of the Via Egnatia. The Via Egnatia also functioned as an important line of communication between the Roman Empire and the nations of Asia, particularly in relation to the Silk Road. With the partition of the Roman Emp. into East (Byzantine) and West, Thessaloniki became the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire after New Rome (Constantinople) in terms of economic might. Under the Empire, Thessaloniki was the largest port in the Balkans. As the city passed from Byzantium to the Republic of Venice in 1423, it was subsequently conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Under Ottoman rule the city retained its position as the most important trading hub in the Balkans. Manufacturing, shipping and trade were the most important components of the city's economy during the Ottoman period, and the majority of the city's trade at the time was controlled by ethnic Greeks. Plus, the Jewish community was also an important factor in the trade sector.Historically important industries for the economy of Thessaloniki included tobacco (in 1946 35% of all tobacco companies in Greece were headquartered in the city, and 44% in 1979) and banking (in Ottoman years Thessaloniki was a major center for investment from western Europe, with the Bank of Thessaloniki (French: Banque de Salonique) having a capital of 20 million French francs in 1909).\n\n\n=== Services ===\n\nThe service sector accounts for nearly two thirds of the total labour force of Thessaloniki. Of those working in services, 20% were employed in trade, 13% in education and healthcare, 7.1% in real estate, 6.3% in transport, communications & storing, 6.1% in the finance industry & service-providing organizations, 5.7% in public administration & insurance services and 5.4% in hotels & restaurants.The city's port, the Port of Thessaloniki, is one of the largest ports in the Aegean and as a free port, it functions as a major gateway to the Balkan hinterland. In 2010, more than 15.8 million tons of products went through the city's port, making it the second-largest port in Greece after Aghioi Theodoroi, surpassing Piraeus. At 273,282 TEUs, it is also Greece's second-largest container port after Piraeus. As a result, the city is a major transportation hub for the whole of south-eastern Europe, carrying, among other things, trade to and from the neighbouring countries.In recent years Thessaloniki has begun to turn into a major port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean. The Greek ministry of tourism considers Thessaloniki to be Greece's second most important commercial port, and companies such as Royal Caribbean International have expressed interest in adding the Port of Thessaloniki to their destinations. A total of 30 cruise ships are expected to arrive at Thessaloniki in 2011.\n\n\n=== Companies ===\nRecent historyAfter WWII and the Greek civil war, heavy industrialization of the city's suburbs began in the middle 1950s.During the 1980s a spate of factory shut downs occurred, mostly of automobile manufacters, such as Agricola (vehicles), AutoDiana, EBIAM, Motoemil, Pantelemidis-TITAN and C.AR (automobiles). Since the 1990s, companies took advantage of cheaper labour markets and more lax regulations in other countries, and among the largest companies to shut down factories were Goodyear, AVEZ pasta industry (one of the first industrial factories in northern Greece, built in 1926),  Philkeram Johnson, AGNO dairy and VIAMIL.\nHowever, Thessaloniki still remains a major business hub in the Balkans and Greece, with a number of important Greek companies headquartered in the city, such as the Hellenic Vehicle Industry (ELVO), Namco (automobiles), Astra Airlines, Ellinair, Pyramis and MLS Multimedia, which introduced the first Greek-built smartphone in 2012.\nIndustryIn early 1960s, with the collaboration of Standard Oil and ESSO-Pappas, a large industrial zone was created, containing refineries, oil refinery and steel production (owned by Hellenic Steel Co.). The zone attracted also a series of different factories during the next decades.\nTitan Cement has also facilities outside the city, on the road to Serres, such as the AGET Heracles, a member of the Lafarge group, and Alumil SA.\nMultinational companies such as Air Liquide, Cyanamid, Nestl\u00e9, Pfizer, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company and Vivartia have also industrial facilities in the suburbs of the city.\nFoodstuffFoodstuff or drink companies headquartered in the city include the Macedonian Milk Industry (Mevgal), Allatini, Barbastathis, Hellenic Sugar Industry, Haitoglou Bros, Mythos Brewery, Malamatina, while the Goody's chain started from the city.The American Farm School also has important contribution in food production.\n\n\n=== Macroeconomic indicators ===\nIn 2011, the regional unit of Thessaloniki had a Gross Domestic Product of \u20ac18.293 billion (ranked 2nd amongst the country's regional units), comparable to Bahrain or Cyprus, and a per capita of \u20ac15,900 (ranked 16th). In Purchasing Power Parity, the same indicators are \u20ac19,851 billion (2nd) and \u20ac17,200 (15th) respectively. In terms of comparison with the European Union average, Thessaloniki's GDP per capita indicator stands at 63% the EU average and 69% in PPP \u2013 this is comparable to the German state of Brandenburg. Overall, Thessaloniki accounts for 8.9% of the total economy of Greece. Between 1995 and 2008 Thessaloniki's GDP saw an average growth rate of 4.1% per annum (ranging from +14.5% in 1996 to \u221211.1% in 2005) while in 2011 the economy contracted by \u22127.8%.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical ethnic statistics ===\nThe tables below show the ethnic statistics of Thessaloniki during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki is the most populous in the Thessaloniki Urban Area. Its population has increased in the latest census and the metropolitan area's population rose to over one million. The city forms the base of the Thessaloniki metropolitan area, with latest census in 2011 giving it a population of 1,030,338.\n\n\n=== Jews of Thessaloniki ===\n\nThe Jewish population in Greece is the oldest in mainland Europe (see Romaniotes). When Paul the Apostle came in Thessaloniki he taught in the area of what today is called Upper City. Later, during the Ottoman period, with the coming of Sephardic Jews from Spain, the community of Thessaloniki became mostly Sephardic. Thessaloniki became the largest center in Europe of the Sephardic Jews, who nicknamed the city la madre de Israel (Israel's mother) and \"Jerusalem of the Balkans\". It also included the historically significant and ancient Greek-speaking Romaniote community. During the Ottoman era, Thessaloniki's Sephardic community of was half the population according to the Ottoman Census of 1902 and almost 40% the city's population of 157,000 about 1913; Jewish merchants were prominent in commerce until the ethnic Greek population increased after independence in 1912. By the 1680s, about 300 families of Sephardic Jews, followers of Sabbatai Zevi, had converted to Islam, becoming a sect known as the D\u00f6nmeh (convert), and migrated to Salonika, whose population was majority Jewish. They established an active community that thrived for about 250 years. Many of their descendants later became prominent in trade. Many Jewish inhabitants of Thessaloniki spoke Ladino, the Romance language of the Sephardic Jews.\n\nFrom the second half of the 19th century with the Ottoman reforms, the Jewish community had a new revival. Many French and especially Italian Jews (from Livorno and other cities), influential in introducing new methods of education and developing new schools and intellectual environment for the Jewish population, were established in Thessaloniki. Such modernists introduced also new techniques and ideas from the industrialized Western Europe and from the 1880s the city began to industrialize. The Italian Jews Allatini brothers led Jewish entrepreneurship, establishing milling and other food industries, brickmaking and processing plants for tobacco. Several traders supported the introduction of a large textile-production industry, superseding the weaving of cloth in a system of artisanal production. Notable names of the era include among others the Italo-Jewish Modiano family and the Allatini. Benrubis founded also in 1880 one of the first retail companies in the Balkans.\nAfter the Balkan Wars, Thessaloniki was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece in 1913. At first the community feared that the annexation would lead to difficulties and during the first years its political stance was, in general, anti-Venizelist and pro-royalist/conservative. The Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 during World War I burned much of the center of the city and left 50,000 Jews homeless of the total of 72,000 residents who were burned out. Having lost homes and their businesses, many Jews emigrated: to the United States, Palestine, and Paris. They could not wait for the government to create a new urban plan for rebuilding, which was eventually done.After the Greco-Turkish War in 1922 and the bilateral population exchange between Greece and Turkey, many refugees came to Greece. Nearly 100,000 ethnic Greeks resettled in Thessaloniki, reducing the proportion of Jews in the total community. After this, Jews made up about 20% of the city's population. During the interwar period, Greece granted Jewish citizens the same civil rights as other Greek citizens. In March 1926, Greece re-emphasized that all citizens of Greece enjoyed equal rights, and a considerable proportion of the city's Jews decided to stay. During the Metaxas regime the stance towards Jews became even better.\n\nWorld War II brought a disaster for the Jewish Greeks, since in 1941 the Germans occupied Greece and began actions against the Jewish population. Greeks of the Resistance helped save some of the Jewish residents. By the 1940s, the great majority of the Jewish Greek community firmly identified as both Greek and Jewish. According to Misha Glenny, such Greek Jews had largely not encountered \"anti-Semitism as in its North European form.\"In 1943 the Nazis began brutal actions against the historic Jewish population in Thessaloniki, forcing them into a ghetto near the railroad lines and beginning deportation to concentration and labor camps. They deported and exterminated approximately 96% of Thessaloniki's Jews of all ages during the Holocaust. The Thessaloniki Holocaust memorial in Eleftherias (\"Freedom\") Square was built in 1997 in memory of all the Jewish people from Thessaloniki, who died in the Holocaust. The site was chosen because it was the place where Jewish residents were rounded up before embarking to trains for concentration camps. Today, a community of around 1200 remains in the city. Communities of descendants of Thessaloniki Jews \u2013 both Sephardic and Romaniote \u2013 live in other areas, mainly the United States and Israel. Israeli singer Yehuda Poliker recorded a song about the Jewish people of Thessaloniki, called \"Wait for me, Thessaloniki\".\n\n\n=== Others ===\nSince the late 19th century, many merchants from Western Europe (mainly from France and Italy) were established in the city. They had an important role in the social and economic life of the city and introduced new industrial techniques. Their main district was what is known today as the \"Frankish district\" (near Ladadika), where the Catholic church designed by Vitaliano Poselli is also situated. Many of them left after the incorporation of the city into the Greek kingdom, others, who were of Jewish faith, were exterminated by the Nazis.\nThe Bulgarian community of the city increased during the late 19th century. The community had a Men's High School, a Girl's High School, a trade union and a gymnastics society. A large part of them were Catholics, as a result of actions by the Lazarists society, which had its base in the city.\nAnother group is the Armenian community which dates back to the Byzantine and Ottoman periods. During the 20th century, after the Armenian Genocide and the defeat of the Greek army in the Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322), many fled to Greece including Thessaloniki. There is also an Armenian cemetery and an Armenian church at the center of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Leisure and entertainment ===\n\nThessaloniki is not only regarded as the cultural and entertainment capital of northern Greece but also the cultural capital of the country. The city's main theaters, run by the National Theatre of Northern Greece (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0398\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf \u0392\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2) which was established in 1961, include the Theater of the Society of Macedonian Studies, where the National Theater is based, the Royal Theater (\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0398\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf)-the first base of the National Theater-, Moni Lazariston, and the Earth Theater and Forest Theater, both amphitheatrical open-air theatres overlooking the city.\n\nThe title of the European Capital of Culture in 1997 saw the birth of the city's first opera and today forms an independent section of the National Theatre of Northern Greece. The opera is based at the Thessaloniki Concert Hall, one of the largest concert halls in Greece. Recently a second building was also constructed and designed by Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. Thessaloniki is also the seat of two symphony orchestras, the Thessaloniki State Symphony Orchestra and the Symphony Orchestra of the Municipality of Thessaloniki.\nOlympion Theater, the site of the Thessaloniki International Film Festival and the Plateia Assos Odeon multiplex are the two major cinemas in downtown Thessaloniki. The city also has a number of multiplex cinemas in major shopping malls in the suburbs, most notably in Mediterranean Cosmos, the largest retail and entertainment development in the Balkans.\nThessaloniki is renowned for its major shopping streets and lively laneways. Tsimiski Street and Proxenou Koromila avenue are the city's most famous shopping streets and are among Greece's most expensive and exclusive high streets. The city is also home to one of Greece's most famous and prestigious hotels, Makedonia Palace hotel, the Hyatt Regency Casino and hotel (the biggest casino in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe) and Waterland, the largest water park in southeastern Europe.\nThe city has long been known in Greece for its vibrant city culture, including having the most cafes and bars per capita of any city in Europe; and as having some of the best nightlife and entertainment in the country, thanks to its large young population and multicultural feel. Lonely Planet listed Thessaloniki among the world's \"ultimate party cities\".\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\n\nAlthough Thessaloniki is not renowned for its parks and greenery throughout its urban area, where green spaces are few, it has several large open spaces around its waterfront, namely the central city gardens of Palios Zoologikos Kipos (which is recently being redeveloped to also include rock climbing facilities, a new skatepark and paintball range), the park of Pedion tou Areos, which also holds the city's annual floral expo; and the parks of the Nea Paralia (waterfront) that span for 3 km (2 mi) along the coast, from the White Tower to the concert hall.\nThe Nea Paralia parks are used throughout the year for a variety of events, while they open up to the Thessaloniki waterfront, which is lined up with several caf\u00e9s and bars; and during summer is full of Thessalonians enjoying their long evening walks (referred to as \"the volta\" and is embedded into the culture of the city). Having undergone an extensive revitalization, the city's waterfront today features a total of 12 thematic gardens/parks.Thessaloniki's proximity to places such as the national parks of Pieria and beaches of Chalkidiki often allow its residents to easily have access to some of the best outdoor recreation in Europe; however, the city is also right next to the Seich Sou forest national park, just 3.5 km (2 mi) away from Thessaloniki's city center; and offers residents and visitors alike, quiet viewpoints towards the city, mountain bike trails and landscaped hiking paths. The city's zoo, which is operated by the municipality of Thessaloniki, is also located nearby the national park.Other recreation spaces throughout the Thessaloniki metropolitan area include the Fragma Thermis, a landscaped parkland near Thermi and the Delta wetlands west of the city center; while urban beaches that have continuously been awarded the blue flags, are located along the 10 km (6 mi) coastline of Thessaloniki's southeastern suburbs of Thermaikos, about 20 km (12 mi) away from the city center.\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nBecause of the city's rich and diverse history, Thessaloniki houses many museums dealing with many different eras in history. Two of the city's most famous museums include the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki and the Museum of Byzantine Culture.\nThe Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki was established in 1962 and houses some of the most important ancient Macedonian artifacts, including an extensive collection of golden artwork from the royal palaces of Aigai and Pella. It also houses exhibits from Macedon's prehistoric past, dating from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. The Prehistoric Antiquities Museum of Thessaloniki has exhibits from those periods as well.\n\nThe Museum of Byzantine Culture is one of the city's most famous museums, showcasing the city's glorious Byzantine past. The museum was also awarded Council of Europe's museum prize in 2005. The museum of the White Tower of Thessaloniki houses a series of galleries relating to the city's past, from the creation of the White Tower until recent years.One of the most modern museums in the city is the Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum and is one of the most high-tech museums in Greece and southeastern Europe. It features the largest planetarium in Greece, a cosmotheater with the country's largest flat screen, an amphitheater, a motion simulator with 3D projection and 6-axis movement and exhibition spaces. Other industrial and technological museums in the city include the Railway Museum of Thessaloniki, which houses an original Orient Express train, the War Museum of Thessaloniki and others. The city also has a number of educational and sports museums, including the Thessaloniki Olympic Museum.\nThe Atat\u00fcrk Museum in Thessaloniki is the historic house where Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, founder of modern-day Turkey, was born. The house is now part of the Turkish consulate complex, but admission to the museum is free. The museum contains historic information about Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk and his life, especially while he was in Thessaloniki.\nOther ethnological museums of the sort include the Historical Museum of the Balkan Wars, the Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki and the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle, containing information about the freedom fighters in Macedonia and their struggle to liberate the region from the Ottoman yoke. Construction on the Holocaust Museum of Greece began in the city in 2018.The city also has a number of important art galleries. Such include the Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art, housing exhibitions from a number of well-known Greek and foreign artists. The Teloglion Foundation of Art is part of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and includes an extensive collection of works by important artists of the 19th and 20th centuries, including works by prominent Greeks and native Thessalonians. The Thessaloniki Museum of Photography also houses a number of important exhibitions, and is located within the old port of Thessaloniki.\n\n\n=== Archaeological sites ===\n\nThessaloniki is home to a number of prominent archaeological sites. Apart from its recognized UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Thessaloniki features a large two-terraced Roman forum featuring two-storey stoas, dug up by accident in the 1960s. The forum complex also boasts two Roman baths, one of which has been excavated while the other is buried underneath the city. The forum also features a small theater, which was also used for gladiatorial games. Although the initial complex was not built in Roman times, it was largely refurbished in the 2nd century. It is believed that the forum and the theater continued to be used until at least the 6th century.Another important archaeological site is the imperial palace complex which Roman emperor Galerius, located at Navarinou Square, commissioned when he made Thessaloniki the capital of his portion of the Roman Empire. The large octagonal portion of the complex, most of which survives to this day, is believed to have been an imperial throne room. Various mosaics from the palatial complex have also survived. Some historians believe that the complex must have been in use as an imperial residence until the 11th century.Not far from the palace itself is the Arch of Galerius, known colloquially as the Kamara. The arch was built to commemorate the emperor's campaigns against the Persians. The original structure featured three arches; however, only two full arches and part of the third survive to this day. Many of the arches' marble parts survive as well, although it is mostly the brick interior that can be seen today.\nOther monuments of the city's past, such as the Incantadas, a Caryatid portico from the ancient forum, have been removed or destroyed over the years. The Incantadas in particular are on display at the Louvre. Thanks to a private donation of \u20ac180,000, it was announced on 6 December 2011 that a replica of the Incantadas would be commissioned and later put on display in Thessaloniki.The construction of the Thessaloniki Metro inadvertently started the largest archaeological dig not only of the city, but of Northern Greece; the dig spans 20 km2 (7.7 sq mi) and has unearthed 300,000 individual artefacts from as early as the Roman Empire and as late as the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917. Ancient Thessaloniki's Decumanus Maximus was also found and 75 metres (246 ft) of the marble-paved and column-lined road were unearthed along with shops, other buildings, and plumbing, prompting one scholar to describe the discovery as \"the Byzantine Pompeii\". Some of the artefacts will be put on display inside the metro stations, while Venizelou will feature the world's first open archaeological site located within a metro station.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThessaloniki is home of a number of festivals and events. The Thessaloniki International Fair is the most important event to be hosted in the city annually, by means of economic development. It was first established in 1926 and takes place every year at the 180,000 m2 (1,937,503.88 sq ft) Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center. The event attracts major political attention and it is customary for the Prime Minister of Greece to outline his administration's policies for the next year, during event. Over 250,000 visitors attended the exposition in 2010.  The new Art Thessaloniki,  is starting first time 29.10. \u2013 1 November 2015 as an international contemporary art fair. \nThe Thessaloniki International Film Festival is established as one of the most important film festivals in Southern Europe, with a number of notable film makers such as Francis Ford Coppola, Faye Dunaway, Catherine Deneuve, Irene Papas and Fatih Ak\u0131n taking part, and was established in 1960. The Documentary Festival, founded in 1999, has focused on documentaries that explore global social and cultural developments, with many of the films presented being candidates for FIPRESCI and Audience Awards.The Dimitria festival, founded in 1966 and named after the city's patron saint of St. Demetrius, has focused on a wide range of events including music, theatre, dance, local happenings, and exhibitions. The \"DMC DJ Championship\" has been hosted at the International Trade Fair of Thessaloniki, has become a worldwide event for aspiring DJs and turntablists. The \"International Festival of Photography\" has taken place every February to mid-April. Exhibitions for the event are sited in museums, heritage landmarks, galleries, bookshops and caf\u00e9s. Thessaloniki also holds an annual International Book Fair.Between 1962\u20131997 and 2005\u20132008 the city also hosted the Thessaloniki Song Festival, Greece's most important music festival, at Alexandreio Melathron.In 2012 the city hosted its first pride parade, Thessaloniki Pride, which took place between 22 and 23 June. It has been held every year ever since, however in 2013 transgender people participating in the parade became victims of police brutality. The issue was soon settled by the government. The city's Greek Orthodox Church leadership has consistently rallied against the event, but mayor Boutaris sided with Thessaloniki Pride, saying also that Thessaloniki would seek to host EuroPride 2020. The event was given to Thessaloniki in September 2017, beating Bergen, Brussels, and Hamburg.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe main stadium of the city is the Kaftanzoglio Stadium (also home ground of Iraklis F.C.), while other main stadiums of the city include the football Kleanthis Vikelidis Stadium and Toumba Stadium home grounds of Aris F.C. and PAOK FC, respectively, all of whom are founding members of the Greek league.\nBeing the largest \"multi-sport\" stadium in the city, Kaftanzoglio Stadium regularly plays host to athletics events; such as the European Athletics Association event \"Olympic Meeting Thessaloniki\" every year; it has hosted the Greek national championships in 2009 and has been used for athletics at the Mediterranean Games and for the European Cup in athletics. In 2004 the stadium served as an official Athens 2004 venue, while in 2009 the city and the stadium hosted the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final.\nThessaloniki's major indoor arenas include the state-owned Alexandreio Melathron, P.A.O.K. Sports Arena and the YMCA indoor hall. Other sporting clubs in the city include Apollon FC based in Kalamaria, Agrotikos Asteras F.C. based in Evosmos and YMCA. Thessaloniki has a rich sporting history with its teams winning the first ever panhellenic football (Aris FC), basketball (Iraklis BC), and water polo (AC Aris) tournaments.\nDuring recent years, PAOK FC has emerged as the strongest football club of the city, winning also the Greek championship without a defeat (2018\u201319 season).\nThe city played a major role in the development of basketball in Greece. The local YMCA was the first to introduce the sport to the country, while Iraklis B.C. won the first ever Greek championship. From 1982 to 1993 Aris B.C. dominated the league, regularly finishing in first place. In that period Aris won a total of 9 championships, 7 cups and one European Cup Winners' Cup. The city also hosted the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in which Greece came third. In volleyball, Iraklis has emerged since 2000 as one of the most successful teams in Greece and Europe \u2013 see 2005\u201306 CEV Champions League. In October 2007, Thessaloniki also played host to the first Southeastern European Games.The city is also the finish point of the annual Alexander The Great Marathon, which starts at Pella, in recognition of its Ancient Macedonian heritage.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nThessaloniki is home to the ERT3 TV-channel and Radio Macedonia, both services of Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) operating in the city and are broadcast all over Greece.\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki also operates three radio stations, namely FM100, FM101 and FM100.6; and TV100, a television network which was also the first non-state-owned TV station in Greece and opened in 1988. Several private TV-networks also broadcast out from Thessaloniki, with Makedonia TV being the most popular.\nThe city's main newspapers and some of the most circulated in Greece, include Makedonia, which was also the first newspaper published in Thessaloniki in 1911 and Aggelioforos. A large number of radio stations also broadcast from Thessaloniki as the city is known for its music contributions.\n\n\n==== TV broadcasting ====\nERT3 (Panhellenic broadcasting)\nMakedonia TV (Panhellenic)\n4E TV (Panhellenic)\nTV 100 (Regional)\nVergina TV (Regional)\nAtlas TV (Regional)\n\n\n==== Press ====\nMakedonia (national publication)\nAggelioforos (national)\nMetrosport (sports, national)\nFair Play (sports, national)\nAris Ise (sports, weekly, national )\nForza (sports, weekly, national)\nThessaloniki (weekly, national)\nKarfitsa (weekly)\nIkonomiki (financial)\n\n\n=== Notable Thessalonians ===\n\nThroughout its history, Thessaloniki has been home to a number of well-known figures. It was also the birthplace or base of various Saints and other religious figures, such as Demetrius of Thessaloniki, Cyril and Methodius (creators of the first Slavic alphabet), Saint Mitre (Saint Demetrius, not to be confused with the previous), Gregorios Palamas, Eustathius of Thessalonica and Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople. Other Byzantine-era notables included jurist Constantine Armenopoulos, the anti-Palamian theologians Prochoros and Demetrios Kydones, such as scholars Theodorus Gaza (Thessalonicensis) and Matthaios Kamariotis.\nMany of the country's best-known musicians and movie personalities are from Thessaloniki, such as Zoe Laskari, Costas Hajihristos, Stella Haskil, Giannis Dalianidis, Maria Plyta, Harry Klynn, Antonis Remos, Paschalis Terzis, Nikos Papazoglou, Nikolas Asimos, Giorgos Hatzinasios, Alberto Eskenazi, Stavros Kouyioumtzis, Giannis Kalatzis, Natassa Theodoridou, Katia Zygouli, Kostas Voutsas, Takis Kanellopoulos, Titos Vandis, Manolis Chiotis, Dionysis Savvopoulos, Marinella, Yvonne Sanson and the classical composer Emilios Riadis. Additionally, there have been a number of politicians born in the city: Ioannis Skandalidis, Alexandros Zannas, Evangelos Venizelos, Christos Sartzetakis, fourth President of Greece, Niki Kerameus and Yiannis Boutaris. Sports personalities from the city include Georgios Roubanis, Giannis Ioannidis, Faidon Matthaiou, Alketas Panagoulias, Panagiotis Fasoulas, Eleni Daniilidou, Traianos Dellas, Giorgos Koudas, Kleanthis Vikelidis, Christos Kostis, Dimitris Salpingidis and Nikos Zisis. Benefactor Ioannis Papafis, architect Lysandros Kaftanzoglou and writers, such as Grigorios Zalykis, Manolis Anagnostakis, Kleitos Kyrou, Albertos Nar, Giorgos Ioannou, Elias Petropoulos, Kostis Moskof, Rena Molho and Dinos Christianopoulos are also from Thessaloniki.\nThe city is also the birthplace or base of a number of international personalities, which include Bulgarians (Atanas Dalchev), Jews (Moshe Levy, Maurice Abravanel, Isaak Benrubi, Isaac and Daniel Carasso, Rapha\u00ebl Salem, Baruch Uziel, Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz, Salamo Arouch), Slav Macedonians (Dimo Todorovski), Italians (Luisa Poselli, Giacomo Poselli, Vittorio Citterich), French (Louis Dumont), Spanish (Juana Mord\u00f3), Turks (Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet, Afet \u0130nan, Cahit Arf, Mehmet Cavit Bey, Sabiha Sertel, Abdul Kerim Pasha, Hasan Tahsin Uzer, Hasan Tahsin) and Armenians (Jean Tatlian).\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nBecause Thessaloniki remained under Ottoman rule for about 100 years more than southern Greece, it has retained a lot of its Eastern character, including its culinary tastes. Spices in particular play an important role in the cuisine of Thessaloniki, something which is not true to the same degree about Greece's southern regions. Thessaloniki's Ladadika borough is a particularly busy area in regards to Thessalonian cuisine, with most tavernas serving traditional meze and other such culinary delights.Bougatsa, a breakfast pastry, which can be either sweet or savory, is very popular throughout the city and has spread around other parts of Greece and the Balkans as well. Another popular snack is koulouri.\nNotable sweets of the city are Trigona, Rox\u00e1kia and Armenov\u00edl. A stereotypical Thessalonian coffee drink is Frapp\u00e9 coffee. Frapp\u00e9 was invented in the Thessaloniki International Fair in 1957 and has since spread throughout Greece and Cyprus to become a hallmark of the Greek coffee culture.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nA touristic boom took place in the 2010s, during the years of mayor Boutaris, especially from the neighboring countries, Austria, Israel and Turkey. In 2010 the sleepovers of foreign tourists in the city were around 250,000. In 2018 the sleepovers of foreign tourists was estimated to reach 3,000,000 people.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe city is viewed as a romantic one in Greece, and as such Thessaloniki is commonly featured in Greek songs. There are a number of famous songs that go by the name 'Thessaloniki' (rebetiko, la\u00efko etc.) or include the name in their title.During the 1930s and 40s the city became a center of the Rebetiko music, partly because of the Metaxas censorship, which was stricter in Athens. Vassilis Tsitsanis wrote some of his best songs in Thessaloniki.\nThe city is the birthplace of significant composers in the Greek music scene, such as Manolis Chiotis, Stavros Kouyioumtzis and Dionysis Savvopoulos. It is also notable for its rock music scene and its many rock groups; some became famous such as Xylina Spathia, Trypes or the pop rock Onirama.\nBetween 1962\u20131997 and 2005\u20132008 the city also hosted the Thessaloniki Song Festival. In the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 Greece was represented by Koza Mostra and Agathonas Iakovidis, both from Thessaloniki.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nOn May 1936, a massive strike by tobacco workers led to general anarchy in the city and Ioannis Metaxas (future dictator, then PM) ordered its repression. The events and the deaths of the protesters inspired Yiannis Ritsos to write the Epitafios.\nOn 22 May 1963, Grigoris Lambrakis, pacifist and MP, was assassinated by two far-right extremists driving a three-wheeled vehicle. The event led to political crisis. Costa Gavras directed Z (1969 film) based on it, two years after the military junta had seized power in Greece.\nNotable films set or shot in Thessaloniki among others include Mademoiselle Docteur/Salonique, nid d'espions (1937) by Georg Wilhelm Pabst, The Barefooted Battalion (1954) by Greg Tallas (Gregory Thalassinos), O Ats\u00eddas (1961) by Giannis Dalianidis,  Parenthesis (1968) by Takis Kanellopoulos,  Triumph of the Spirit (1989) by Robert M. Young, Eternity and a Day by Theo Angelopoulos (1998) and Ouzeri Tsitsanis (2015) by Manousos Manousakis.\nThe 1963 book I am David, written by Anne Holm, makes mention of the main character David making his way there after escaping from the Eastern Bloc, before continuing his ultimate journey to Denmark.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThessaloniki is a major center of education for Greece. Three of the country's largest universities are located in central Thessaloniki: Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the University of Macedonia and the International Hellenic University. Aristotle University was founded in 1926 and is currently the largest university in Greece by number of students, which number at more than 80,000 in 2010, and is a member of the Utrecht Network. For the academic year 2009\u20132010, Aristotle University was ranked as one of the 150 best universities in the world for arts and humanities and among the 250 best universities in the world overall by the Times QS World University Rankings, making it one of the top 2% of best universities worldwide. Leiden ranks Aristotle University as one of the top 100 European universities and the best university in Greece, at number 97. Since 2010, Thessaloniki is also home to the Open University of Thessaloniki, which is funded by Aristotle University, the University of Macedonia and the municipality of Thessaloniki.\nAdditionally, a TEI (Technological Educational Institute), namely the Alexander Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki, is located in the western suburb of Sindos; home also to the industrial zone of the city. Numerous public and private vocational institutes (Greek: IEK) provide professional training to young students, while a large number of private colleges offer American and UK academic curriculum, via cooperation with foreign universities. In addition to Greek students, the city hence attracts many foreign students either via the Erasmus programme for public universities, or for a complete degree in public universities or in the city's private colleges. As of 2006 the city's total student population was estimated around 200,000.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nTram was the main, oldest and most popular public urban mean of Thessalonians in the past. It functioned from 1893 to 1957, when it was disestablished by the government of Konstantinos Karamanlis. The French Compagnie de Tramways et d' \u00c9clairage \u00c9lectrique de Salonique operated it from 1912 until 1940, when the company was purchased by the Hellenic State. The operating base and tram station was in the district of D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nBefore the economic crisis of 2009, there were various proposals for new tram lines.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nThessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (OASTH) operates buses as the only form of public transport in Thessaloniki. It was founded in 1957 and operates a fleet of 604 vehicles on 75 routes throughout the Thessaloniki metropolitan area. International and regional bus links are provided by KTEL at its Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal, located to the west of the city centre.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe creation of a metro system for Thessaloniki goes back as far as 1918, when Thomas Hayton Mawson and Ernest H\u00e9brard proposed the creation of a Thessaloniki Metropolitan Railway. In 1968 a circular metro line was proposed, and in 1987 the first serious proposal was presented and construction briefly started in 1988, before stalling and finally being abandoned due to lack of funding. Both the 1918 and 1988 proposals ran almost the identical route to the current Line 1.\nConstruction on Thessaloniki's current metro began in 2006 and is classified as a megaproject: it has a budget of \u20ac1.57 billion ($1.77 billion). Line 1 and Line 2 are currently under construction and will enter service, in phases, between 2020 and 2021. Line 1 is 9.5 kilometres (5.9 mi) long and stops at 13 stations, while Line 2 is 4.8 kilometres (3.0 mi) long and stops at a further 5 stations, while also calling at 11 of the Line 1 stations. Important archaeological discoveries have been made during construction, and some of the system's stations will house archaeological exhibitions. One stop, Venizelou, will house the only open archaeological site within a metro station anywhere in the world.Line 2 is to be expanded further, with a loop extension to the western suburbs of the city, towards Evosmos and Stavroupoli, and one overground extension towards the Airport. The western extension is more high-priority than the airport one, as the airport will be served by a 10-minute shuttle bus to the terminus of Line 2, Mikra.Once opened in 2020, it is expected that 320,000 people will use the metro every day, or 116 million people every year.\n\n\n=== Commuter/suburban rail (Proastiakos) ===\n\nCommuter rail services have recently been established between Thessaloniki and the city of Larissa (the service is known in Greek as the \"Proastiakos\", meaning \"Suburban Railway\"). The service is operated using Siemens Desiro EMU trains on a modernised electrified double track and stops at 11 refurbished stations, covering the journey in 1 hour and 33 minutes. Furthermore, an additional line has also been established, although with the use of regional trains, between Thessaloniki and the city of Edessa.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki Airport \"Makedonia\" ===\n\nInternational and domestic air traffic to and from the city is served by Thessaloniki Airport \"Makedonia\". The short length of the airport's two runways means that it does not currently support intercontinental flights, although a major extension \u2013 lengthening one of its runways into the Thermaic Gulf \u2013 is under construction, despite considerable opposition from local environmental groups. Following the completion of the runway works, the airport will be able to serve intercontinental flights and cater for larger aircraft in the future. Construction of a second terminal began in September 2018, due to be completed in 2021.\n\n\n=== Railways and ferry connections ===\n\nBecause of the Greek economic crisis, all international train links from the city were suspended in February 2011. Until then, the city was a major railway hub for the Balkans, with direct connections to Sofia, Skopje, Belgrade, Moscow, Vienna, Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul, alongside Athens and other destinations in Greece. Daily through trains to Sofia and Belgrade were restarted in May 2014. Thessaloniki remains one of Greece's most important railway hubs and has the biggest marshalling yard in the country.\nRegional train services within Greece (operated by TrainOSE, the Hellenic Railways Organization's train operating company), link the city with other parts of the country, from its central railway passenger station, called the \"New railway station\" located at the western end of Thessaloniki's city center.\nThe Port of Thessaloniki connects the city with seasonal ferries to the Sporades and other north Aegean islands, with its passenger terminal, being one of the largest in the Aegean Sea basin; having handled around 162,731 passengers in 2007. Meanwhile, ongoing actions have been going on for more connections and the port is recently being upgraded, as Thessaloniki is also slowly turning into a major tourist port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Motorways ===\n\nThessaloniki lies on the crossroads of the A1/E75, A2/E90 and A25 motorways; which connect the city with other parts of the country, as well as the Republic of North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey.\nThe city itself is bypassed by the C-shaped Thessaloniki Inner Ring Road (Esoteriki Peripheriaki Odos,  Greek: \u0395\u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2), which all of the above motorways connect onto it. The western end of the route begins at the junction with the A1/A2 motorways in Lachanagora District. Clockwise it heads northeast around the city, passing through the northwestern suburbs, the forest of Seich Sou and through to the southeast suburb/borough of Kalamaria. The ring road ends at a large junction with the A25 motorway, which then continues south to Chalkidiki, passing through Thessaloniki's outer southeast suburbs.\nThe speed limit on this motorway is 90 kilometres per hour (56 mph), it currently has three traffic lanes for each direction and forms the city's most vital road link; handling more than 120,000 vehicles daily, instead of 30,000 as it was meant to handle when designed in 1975.\nAn outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (Greek: \u0395\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2, outer ring road) carries all traffic that completely bypasses the city. It is Part of Motorway 2.\n\n\n==== Future plans ====\nDespite the large effort that was made in 2004 to improve the motorway features of the Thessaloniki ring road, the motorway is still insufficient to tackle Thessaloniki's increasing traffic and metropolitan population. To tackle this problem, the government has introduced large scale redevelopment plans throughout 2011 with tenders expected to be announced within early 2012; that include the total restructuring of the A16 in the western side of the city, with new junctions and new emergency lanes throughout the whole length of the motorway. In the eastern side an even larger scale project has been announced, for the construction of a new elevated motorway section above the existing, which would allow faster travel for drivers heading through to the airport and Chalkidiki that do not wish to exit into the city, and will decongest the existing motorway for city commuters. The plans also include adding one more lane in each direction on the existing A16 ring road and on the A25 passing through Thessaloniki's southeast suburbs, from its junction with the A16 in Kalamaria, up to the airport exit (\u0395\u039f67); which will make it an 8 lane highway.Additional long term plans further include the extension of the planned outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (Greek: \u0395\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2, outer ring road) to circle around the entire Thessaloniki metropolitan area, crossing over the Thermaic Gulf from the east, to join with the A1/E75 motorway. Preliminary plans have been announced which include a 4.5 km (3 mi) bridge over the gulf, as part of the southern bypass of the city; to cater for the large number of travellers from Macedonia and the rest of Greece heading to the airport, and to the increasingly popular tourist region of Chalkidiki.\nMotorways:\nA1/E75 W (Republic of North Macedonia, Larissa, Athens)\nA2/E90 W (Kozani, Ioannina, Igoumenitsa) N (Kavala, Xanthi, Alexandroupolis, Turkey)\nA25 (\u0395\u039f12)/\u039579 \u039d (Serres, Bulgaria)\nA25 (\u0395\u039f67) S (Airport, Nea Moudania)\nNational Roads:\n\u0395\u039f2/\u039586 W (Edessa, Giannitsa)\n\u0395\u039f12/\u039579 \u039d (Serres, Drama)\n\u0395\u039f16, SW (Polygyros, Ouranopolis)\n\u0395\u039f65, \u039d (Kilkis, Doirani)\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nConsulates\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nThessaloniki is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nBattle of Thessalonica (fourteen events at various times)\nMacedonians (Greeks)\nMount Chortiatis, above the city\nLake Koroneia, 14 km from the city\nDelta of Axios National Park, west of the city\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\nMunicipality of Thessaloniki\nThessaloniki Port Authority\n\u039f\u0391\u03a3\u0398 \u2013 Organisation of Urban Transport of Thessaloniki (Greek & English)\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nYou in Thessaloniki on YouTube: Official promotional video for Thessaloniki by the Greek National Tourism Organization\nThessaloniki The Official website of the Greek National Tourism Organisation\n\n\n=== Cultural ===\nThessaloniki Concert Hall Organisation\nThessaloniki Film Festival\nThessaloniki Info & Links\nThessaloniki360 Virtual City Guide\nThessaloniki Tsimiski.gr street\n\n\n=== Events ===\nThessaloniki 2012 (celebrations for the 100 years of the incorporation of the city to Greece)\nThessaloniki 2014 (official website of Thessaloniki European Youth Capital 2014)\n\n\n=== Local guides ===\nGreek Local Yellow Pages of Thessaloniki",

          "Interesting archaeological history of Thessaloniki, covering who/what was there before and how the city came about, following through from the Macedonian kings to the Roman era and then the Byzantine era onto the Ottoman period",
          "I think that this is a museum worth visiting. The sections in the museum are tastefully separated, allowing the visitors to understand fully how life was back then. I didn't find it boring (I'm not a museum freak) and I took around 2.5 hours to look at all sections. Worth a",
          "Very beautifully designed museum housing prehistoric artifacts from Macedonia. Beautiful statues, funeral stones and a great deal of gold jewelry as well as mosaics, pottery and bronze works. The museum is so well laid out that you never feel crammed or overwhelmed .",

          "We spent 2 hours, wandering from room to room, marvelling at the abundance of beautiful artefacts, some very mundane and others fit for kings. The museum gives a good overview of the history of Makedonia and Thessaloniki. The items are very well displayed, with good information",
          "We visit every archeological museum we can find and this one is one of the highest category. So beautiful in art which is on display and so well documented, greatly done. There are lockers to store your coat and bag. A combination ticket for 5 museums is for sale for 15 euro",
          "This is well worth the trip, there is a small entry fee but the way the museum is kept and the staff on hand it is well worth it. The staff are very knowledgeable and able to answer most questions. The museum and all exhibits are presented very well both in Greek and English",
          "A nice museum that offers basic information about history of the Macedonian region with detailed English explanations. Apart from the main halls, do not miss the exhibition of how they used gold in those times, they have some precious pieces there.",

          "This is a can\u2019t-miss destination for anyone spending more than a few hours in Thessaloniki. This place opens a whole new world for anyone who has spent time at the National Archeological Museum in Athens. Greek history is not limited just to Attica and the Cyclades, and this",

          "Great museum focusing on the history of the region. It helped me put the modern-day animosity about Macedonia into perspective. I don't have kids, so perhaps take this with a grain of salt, but I imagine that this is the kind of museum that would play well with (curious,",

          "Myself and three friends, all 18+ visited the museum as we have been all across Europe this summer. One of our party is of Sri Lanka'n decent and due to this, he was harassed and watched for our entire visit. Extremely disrespectful and assumptuous behaviour from all members of",
          "Not as exciting as expected from what it tells to be. Apart from a couple of well preserved objects it\u2019s just not an interesting place. The building that houses the museum itself, says it all ! Rather uninteresting, and you can see far better collections in Athens, The Getty",
          "This museum seemed to me to be a combination of the museums of Vergina, Pella and Dion minus the archaeological sites. There was so much to see we spent 3hrs here and it still did not seem to be enough time. Highlights of my visit - the amazingly well preserved mosaics, the",
          "In not historically famed Thessaloniki, it's a surprise to visit the archaeological museum. It's divided in two parts: the fist is the \"normal\" museum, which depict in a clear and interesting way the millennia-long history of Greece, with details of the economical realities and",

          "Overall, I have to say that it was an average museum with a few interesting ideas. For example, they have a room in which you take a cardboard \"tablet\", place it over a map, and it pulls up some interesting historical facts about the city. I also enjoyed looking at the Roman era",

          "In fact it is a nice museum including a short movie about Macedonian History..You enchance your knowledge about the antique Macedonia and the layout is good. Unfortunatelly, it is disappointing seeing very few about Alexander the Great, in this respect, do not expect much.",

It is also known in Greek as \u03b7 \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 (i Simprot\u00e9vousa), literally \"the co-capital\", a reference to its historical status as the \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 (Simvasil\u00e9vousa) or \"co-reigning\" city of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, alongside Constantinople.Thessaloniki is located on the Thermaic Gulf, at the northwest corner of the Aegean Sea. It is bounded on the west by the delta of the Axios. The municipality of Thessaloniki, the historical center, had a population of 325,182 in 2011, while the Thessaloniki Urban Area had a population of 824,676 and the Thessaloniki metropolitan area had 1,030,338 inhabitants in 2011. It is Greece's second major economic, industrial, commercial and political centre; it is a major transportation hub for Greece and southeastern Europe, notably through the Port of Thessaloniki. The city is renowned for its festivals, events and vibrant cultural life in general, and is considered to be Greece's cultural capital. Events such as the Thessaloniki International Fair and the Thessaloniki International Film Festival are held annually, while the city also hosts the largest bi-annual meeting of the Greek diaspora. Thessaloniki was the 2014 European Youth Capital.The city of Thessaloniki was founded in 315 BC by Cassander of Macedon. An important metropolis by the Roman period, Thessaloniki was the second largest and wealthiest city of the Byzantine Empire. It was conquered by the Ottomans in 1430, and remained an important seaport and multi-ethnic metropolis during the nearly five centuries of Turkish rule. It passed from the Ottoman Empire to Greece on 8 November 1912. It is home to numerous notable Byzantine monuments, including the Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as several Roman, Ottoman and Sephardic Jewish structures. The city's main university, Aristotle University, is the largest in Greece and the Balkans.Thessaloniki is a popular tourist destination in Greece. In 2013, National Geographic Magazine included Thessaloniki in its top tourist destinations worldwide, while in 2014 Financial Times FDI magazine (Foreign Direct Investments) declared Thessaloniki as the best mid-sized European city of the future for human capital and lifestyle. Among street photographers, the center of Thessaloniki is also considered the most popular destination for street photography in Greece.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe original name of the city was \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thessalon\u00edk\u0113. It was named after princess Thessalonike of Macedon, the half sister of Alexander the Great, whose name means \"Thessalian victory\", from \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 Thessalos, and \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 'victory' (Nike), honoring the Macedonian victory at the Battle of Crocus Field (353/352 BC).\nMinor variants are also found, including \u0398\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thettalon\u00edki, \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 Thessalon\u00edkia, \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thessalon\u00edki, and \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd Thessalonik\u00e9on.The name \u03a3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Salon\u00edki is first attested in Greek in the Chronicle of the Morea (14th century), and is common in folk songs, but it must have originated earlier, as al-Idrisi called it Salunik already in the 12th century. It is the basis for the city's name in other languages: \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0479\u043d\u044a (Solun) in Old Church Slavonic, \u05e1\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05d4 (Salonika) in Ladino, \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0643 (Sel\u00e2nik) in Ottoman Turkish and Selanik in modern Turkish, Salonicco in Italian, Solun or \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d in the local and neighboring South Slavic languages, \u0421\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 (Salon\u00edki) in Russian, and S\u00e3run\u00e3 in Aromanian, and Salonica or Salonika in English.Thessaloniki was revived as the city's official name in 1912, when it joined the Kingdom of Greece during the Balkan Wars. In local speech, the city's name is typically pronounced with a dark and deep L characteristic of Modern Macedonian accent. The name is often abbreviated as \u0398\u03b5\u03c3/\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== From classical antiquity to the Roman Empire ===\n\nThe city was founded around 315 BC by the King Cassander of Macedon, on or near the site of the ancient town of Therma and 26 other local villages. He named it after his wife Thessalonike, a half-sister of Alexander the Great and princess of Macedonia as daughter of Philip II. Under the kingdom of Macedonia the city retained its own autonomy and parliament and evolved to become the most important city in Macedonia.After the fall of the Kingdom of Macedonia in 168 BC, in 148 BC Thessalonica was made the capital of the Roman province of Macedonia.  Thessalonica became a free city of the Roman Republic under Mark Antony in 41 BC. It grew to be an important trade hub located on the Via Egnatia, the road connecting Dyrrhachium with Byzantium, which facilitated trade between Thessaloniki and great centers of commerce such as Rome and Byzantium.  Thessaloniki also lay at the southern end of the main north\u2013south route through the Balkans along the valleys of the Morava and Axios river valleys, thereby linking the Balkans with the rest of Greece. The city became the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia; later it became the capital of all the Greek provinces of the Roman Empire because of its importance in the Balkan peninsula.\nAt the time of the Roman Empire, about 50 A.D., Thessaloniki was also one of the early centers of Christianity; while on his second missionary journey, Paul the Apostle visited this city's chief synagogue on three Sabbaths and sowed the seeds for Thessaloniki's first Christian church.  Later, Paul wrote two letters to the new church at Thessaloniki, preserved in the Biblical canon as First and Second Thessalonians.  Some scholars hold that the First Epistle to the Thessalonians is the first written book of the New Testament.\n\nIn 306 AD, Thessaloniki acquired a patron saint, St. Demetrius, a Christian whom Galerius is said to have put to death. Most scholars agree with Hippolyte Delehaye's theory that Demetrius was not a Thessaloniki native, but his veneration was transferred to Thessaloniki when it replaced Sirmium as the main military base in the Balkans. A basilical church dedicated to St. Demetrius, Hagios Demetrios, was first built in the 5th century AD and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided into the tetrarchy, Thessaloniki became the administrative capital of one of the four portions of the Empire under Galerius Maximianus Caesar, where Galerius commissioned an imperial palace, a new hippodrome, a triumphal arch and a mausoleum among others.In 379, when the Roman Prefecture of Illyricum was divided between the East and West Roman Empires, Thessaloniki became the capital of the new Prefecture of Illyricum. The following year, the Edict of Thessalonica made Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire. In 390, Gothic troops under the Roman Emperor Theodosius I, led a massacre against the inhabitants of Thessalonica, who had risen in revolt against the Gothic soldiers.  By the time of the Fall of Rome in 476, Thessaloniki was the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era and Middle Ages ===\n\nFrom the first years of the Byzantine Empire, Thessaloniki was considered the second city in the Empire after Constantinople, both in terms of wealth and size. with a population of 150,000 in the mid-12th century. The city held this status until its transfer to Venetian control in 1423. In the 14th century, the city's population exceeded 100,000 to 150,000, making it larger than London at the time.During the 6th and 7th centuries, the area around Thessaloniki was invaded by Avars and Slavs, who unsuccessfully laid siege to the city several times, as narrated in the Miracles of Saint Demetrius. Traditional historiography stipulates that many Slavs settled in the hinterland of Thessaloniki; however, modern scholars consider this migration to have been on a much smaller scale than previously thought. In the 9th century, the Byzantine Greek missionaries Cyril and Methodius, both natives of the city, created the first literary language of the Slavs, the Old Church Slavonic, most likely based on the Slavic dialect used in the hinterland of their hometown.An Arab naval attack in 904 resulted in the sack of the city.\nThe economic expansion of the city continued through the 12th century as the rule of the Komnenoi emperors expanded Byzantine control to the north. Thessaloniki passed out of Byzantine hands in 1204, when Constantinople was captured by the forces of the Fourth Crusade and incorporated the city and its surrounding territories in the Kingdom of Thessalonica \u2014 which then became the largest vassal of the Latin Empire. In 1224, the Kingdom of Thessalonica was overrun by the Despotate of Epirus, a remnant of the former Byzantine Empire, under Theodore Komnenos Doukas who crowned himself Emperor, and the city became the capital of the short-lived Empire of Thessalonica. Following his defeat at Klokotnitsa however in 1230, the Empire of Thessalonica became a vassal state of the Second Bulgarian Empire until it was recovered again in 1246, this time by the Nicaean Empire.In 1342, the city saw the rise of the Commune of the Zealots, an anti-aristocratic party formed of sailors and the poor, which is nowadays described as social-revolutionary. The city was practically independent of the rest of the Empire, as it had its own government, a form of republic. The zealot movement was overthrown in 1350 and the city was reunited with the rest of the Empire.The capture of Gallipoli by the Ottomans in 1354 kicked off a rapid Turkish expansion in the southern Balkans, conducted both by the Ottomans themselves and by semi-independent Turkish ghazi warrior-bands. By 1369, the Ottomans were able to conquer Adrianople (modern Edirne), which became their new capital until 1453. Thessalonica, ruled by Manuel II Palaiologos (r. 1391\u20131425) itself surrendered after a lengthy siege in 1383\u20131387, along with most of eastern and central Macedonia, to the forces of Sultan Murad I. Initially, the surrendered cities were allowed complete autonomy in exchange for payment of the kharaj poll-tax. Following the death of Emperor John V Palaiologos in 1391, however, Manuel II escaped Ottoman custody and went to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor, succeeding his father. This angered Sultan Bayezid I, who laid waste to the remaining Byzantine territories, and then turned on Chrysopolis, which was captured by storm and largely destroyed. Thessalonica too submitted again to Ottoman rule at this time, possibly after brief resistance, but was treated more leniently: although the city was brought under full Ottoman control, the Christian population and the Church retained most of their possessions, and the city retained its institutions.\n\nThessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until 1403, when Emperor Manuel II sided with Bayezid's eldest son S\u00fcleyman in the Ottoman succession struggle that broke out following the crushing defeat and capture of Bayezid at the Battle of Ankara against Tamerlane in 1402. In exchange for his support, in the Treaty of Gallipoli the Byzantine emperor secured the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the Chalcidice peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers Strymon and Pineios. Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous appanage to John VII Palaiologos. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the Despot Andronikos Palaiologos, who was supervised by Demetrios Leontares until 1415. Thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity after 1403, as the Turks were preoccupied with their own civil war, but was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by Musa \u00c7elebi) and 1416 (during the uprising of Mustafa \u00c7elebi against Mehmed I). Once the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city began to increase again. Just as during the 1383\u20131387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western help, or submission to the Ottomans.In 1423, Despot Andronikos Palaiologos ceded it to the Republic of Venice with the hope that it could be protected from the Ottomans who were besieging the city. The Venetians held Thessaloniki until it was captured by the Ottoman Sultan Murad II on 29 March 1430.\n\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n\nWhen Sultan Murad II captured Thessaloniki and sacked it in 1430, contemporary reports estimated that about one-fifth of the city's population was enslaved. Ottoman artillery was used to secure the city's capture and bypass its double walls. Upon the conquest of Thessaloniki, some of its inhabitants escaped, including intellectuals such as Theodorus Gaza \"Thessalonicensis\" and Andronicus Callistus. However, the change of sovereignty from the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman one did not affect the city's prestige as a major imperial city and trading hub. Thessaloniki and Smyrna, although smaller in size than Constantinople, were the Ottoman Empire's most important trading hubs. Thessaloniki's importance was mostly in the field of shipping, but also in manufacturing, while most of the city's trade was controlled by ethnic Greeks.\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, the city's population of Ottoman Muslims (including those of Turkish origin, as well as Albanian Muslim, Bulgarian Muslim and Greek Muslim of convert origin) grew substantially. According to the 1478 census Sel\u00e2nik (Ottoman Turkish: \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0643\u200e), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniots community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the city's population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regime's invitation to Jewish settlement was a strategy to prevent the ethnic Greek population from dominating the city.Thessaloniki was the capital of the Sanjak of Selanik within the wider Rumeli Eyalet (Balkans) until 1826, and subsequently the capital of Selanik Eyalet (after 1867, the Selanik Vilayet). This consisted of the sanjaks of Selanik, Serres and Drama between 1826 and 1912.\n\nWith the break out of the Greek War of Independence in the spring of 1821, the governor Yusuf Bey imprisoned in his headquarters more than 400 hostages. On 18 May, when Yusuf learned of the insurrection to the villages of Chalkidiki, he ordered half of his hostages to be slaughtered before his eyes. The mulla of Thessaloniki, Hayr\u0131\u00fclah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations: \"Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning. It seems that Yusuf Bey, the Yeniceri Agasi, the Suba\u015f\u0131, the hocas and the ulemas have all gone raving mad.\" It would take until the end of the century for the city's Greek community to recover.Thessaloniki was also a Janissary stronghold where novice Janissaries were trained. In June 1826, regular Ottoman soldiers attacked and destroyed the Janissary base in Thessaloniki while also killing over 10,000 Janissaries, an event known as The Auspicious Incident in Ottoman history. In 1870\u20131917, driven by economic growth, the city's population expanded by 70%, reaching 135,000 in 1917.The last few decades of Ottoman control over the city were an era of revival, particularly in terms of the city's infrastructure. It was at that time that the Ottoman administration of the city acquired an \"official\" face with the creation of the Government House while a number of new public buildings were built in the eclectic style in order to project the European face both of Thessaloniki and the Ottoman Empire. The city walls were torn down between 1869 and 1889, efforts for a planned expansion of the city are evident as early as 1879, the first tram service started in 1888 and the city streets were illuminated with electric lamp posts in 1908. In 1888 the Oriental Railway connected Thessaloniki to Central Europe via rail through Belgrade and to Monastir in 1893, while the Thessaloniki-Istanbul Junction Railway connected it to Constantinople in 1896.\n\n\n=== 20th century and since ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, Thessaloniki was in the center of radical activities by various groups; the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, founded in 1897, and the Greek Macedonian Committee, founded in 1903. In 1903 an anarchist group known as the Boatmen of Thessaloniki planted bombs in several buildings in Thessaloniki, including the Ottoman Bank, with some assistance from the IMRO. The Greek consulate in Ottoman Thessaloniki (now the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle) served as the center of operations for the Greek guerillas.\nDuring this period, and since the 14th century, Thessaloniki's Jewish element was the most dominant; it was the only city in Europe where the Jews were a majority of the total population. The city was ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan. In 1890 its population had risen to 118,000, 47% of which were Jews, followed by Turks (22%), Greeks (14%), Bulgars (8%), Roma (2%), and others (7%). By 1913, the ethnic composition of the city had changed so that the population stood at 157,889, with Jews at 39%, followed again by Turks (29%), Greeks (25%), Bulgars (4%), Roma (2%), and others at 1%. Many varied religions were practiced and many languages spoken, including Ladino, a dialect of Spanish spoken by the city's Jews.\nThessaloniki was also the center of activities of the Young Turks, a political reform movement, which goal was to replace the Ottoman Empire's absolute monarchy with a constitutional government. The Young Turks started out as an underground movement, until finally in 1908, they started the Young Turk Revolution from the city of Thessaloniki, by which their revolutionaries gained control over the Ottoman Empire. Eleftherias (Liberty) Square, where the Young Turks gathered at the outbreak of the revolution, is named after the event.\n\nAs the First Balkan War broke out, Greece declared war on the Ottoman Empire and expanded its borders. When Eleftherios Venizelos, Prime Minister at the time, was asked if the Greek army should move towards Thessaloniki or Monastir (now Bitola, Republic of North Macedonia), Venizelos replied \"\u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2!\" (Thessaloniki, at all costs!). As both Greece and Bulgaria wanted Thessaloniki, the Ottoman garrison of the city entered negotiations with both armies. On 8 November 1912 (26 October Old Style), the feast day of the city's patron saint, Saint Demetrius, the Greek Army accepted the surrender of the Ottoman garrison at Thessaloniki. The Bulgarian army arrived one day after the surrender of the city to Greece and Tahsin Pasha, ruler of the city, told the Bulgarian officials that \"I have only one Thessaloniki, which I have surrendered\". After the Second Balkan War, Thessaloniki and the rest of the Greek portion of Macedonia were officially annexed to Greece by the Treaty of Bucharest in 1913. On 18 March 1913 George I of Greece was assassinated in the city by Alexandros Schinas.In 1915, during World War I, a large Allied expeditionary force established a base at Thessaloniki for operations against pro-German Bulgaria. This culminated in the establishment of the Macedonian Front, also known as the Salonika Front. In 1916, pro-Venizelist Greek army officers and civilians, with the support of the Allies, launched an uprising, creating a pro-Allied temporary government by the name of the \"Provisional Government of National Defence\" that controlled the \"New Lands\" (lands that were gained by Greece in the Balkan Wars, most of Northern Greece including Greek Macedonia, the North Aegean as well as the island of Crete); the official government of the King in Athens, the \"State of Athens\", controlled \"Old Greece\" which were traditionally monarchist. The State of Thessaloniki was disestablished with the unification of the two opposing Greek governments under Venizelos, following the abdication of King Constantine in 1917.On 30 December 1915 an Austrian air raid on Thessaloniki alarmed many town civilians and killed at least one person, and in response the Allied troops based there arrested the German and Austrian and Bulgarian and Turkish vice-consuls and their families and dependents and put them on a battleship, and billeted troops in their consulate buildings in Thessaloniki.\n\nMost of the old center of the city was destroyed by the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, which was started accidentally by an unattended kitchen fire on 18 August 1917. The fire swept through the centre of the city, leaving 72,000 people homeless; according to the Pallis Report, most of them were Jewish (50,000). Many businesses were destroyed, as a result, 70% of the population were unemployed. Two churches and many synagogues and mosques were lost. Nearly one-quarter of the total population of approximately 271,157 became homeless. Following the fire the government prohibited quick rebuilding, so it could implement the new redesign of the city according to the European-style urban plan prepared by a group of architects, including the Briton Thomas Mawson, and headed by French architect Ernest H\u00e9brard. Property values fell from 6.5 million Greek drachmas to 750,000.After the defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War and during the break-up of the Ottoman Empire, a population exchange took place between Greece and Turkey. Over 160,000 ethnic Greeks deported from the former Ottoman Empire \u2013 particularly Greeks from Asia Minor  and East Thrace were resettled in the city, changing its demographics. Additionally many of the city's Muslims, including Ottoman Greek Muslims, were deported to Turkey, ranging at about 20,000 people. This made the Greek element dominant, while the Jewish population was reduced to a minority for the first time since the 14th century.\n\nDuring World War II Thessaloniki was heavily bombarded by Fascist Italy (with 232 people dead, 871 wounded and over 800 buildings damaged or destroyed in November 1940 alone), and, the Italians having failed in their invasion of Greece, it fell to the forces of Nazi Germany on 8 April 1941 and went under German occupation. The Nazis soon forced the Jewish residents into a ghetto near the railroads and on 15 March 1943 began the deportation of the city's Jews to Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. Most were immediately sent to the gas chambers. Of the 45,000 Jews deported to Auschwitz, only 4% survived.\n\nDuring a speech in Reichstag, Hitler claimed that the intention of his Balkan campaign, was to prevent the Allies from establishing \"a new Macedonian front\", like they did during WWI. The importance of Thessaloniki to Nazi Germany can be demonstrated by the fact that, initially, Hitler had planned to incorporate it directly in the Third Reich (that is, make it part of Germany) and not have it controlled by a puppet state such as the Hellenic State or an ally of Germany (Thessaloniki had been promised to Yugoslavia as a reward for joining the Axis on 25 March 1941). As it was the first major city in Greece to fall to the occupying forces, the first Greek resistance group formed in Thessaloniki (under the name \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, Elefther\u00eda, \"Freedom\") as well as the first anti-Nazi newspaper in an occupied territory anywhere in Europe, also by the name Eleftheria. Thessaloniki was also home to a military camp-converted-concentration camp, known in German as \"Konzentrationslager Pavlo Mela\" (Pavlos Melas Concentration Camp), where members of the resistance and other anti-fascists were held either to be killed or sent to other concentration camps. On 30 October 1944, after battles with the retreating German army and the Security Battalions of Poulos, forces of ELAS entered Thessaloniki as liberators headed by Markos Vafiadis (who didn't obey to orders from ELAS leadership in Athens to not enter the city). Pro-EAM celebrations and demonstrations followed in the city. In the 1946 monarchy referendum, the majority of the locals voted in favor of a republic, contrary to the rest of Greece.After the war, Thessaloniki was rebuilt with large-scale development of new infrastructure and industry throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Many of its architectural treasures still remain, adding value to the city as a tourist destination, while several early Christian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1988. In 1997, Thessaloniki was celebrated as the European Capital of Culture, sponsoring events across the city and the region. Agency established to oversee the cultural activities of that year 1997 was still in existence by 2010. In 2004 the city hosted a number of the football events as part of the 2004 Summer Olympics.Today, Thessaloniki has become one of the most important trade and business hubs in Southeastern Europe, with its port, the Port of Thessaloniki being one of the largest in the Aegean and facilitating trade throughout the Balkan hinterland. On 26 October 2012 the city celebrated its centennial since its incorporation into Greece. The city also forms one of the largest student centers in Southeastern Europe, is host to the largest student population in Greece and was the European Youth Capital in 2014.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nThessaloniki lies on the northern fringe of the Thermaic Gulf on its eastern coast and is bound by Mount Chortiatis on its southeast. Its proximity to imposing mountain ranges, hills and fault lines, especially towards its southeast have historically made the city prone to geological changes.\nSince medieval times, Thessaloniki was hit by strong earthquakes, notably in 1759, 1902, 1978 and 1995. On 19\u201320 June 1978, the city suffered a series of powerful earthquakes, registering 5.5 and 6.5 on the Richter scale. The tremors caused considerable damage to a number of buildings and ancient monuments, but the city withstood the catastrophe without any major problems. One apartment building in central Thessaloniki collapsed during the second earthquake, killing many, raising the final death toll to 51.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThessaloniki's climate is directly affected by the sea it is situated on. The city lies in a transitional climatic zone, so its climate displays characteristics of several climates. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, it has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) that borders on a Mediterranean climate (Csa), as well as a semi-arid climate (BSk), observed on the periphery of the region. Its average annual precipitation of 450 mm (17.7 inches) is due to the Pindus rain shadow drying the westerly winds. However, the city has a summer precipitation between 20 to 30 mm (0.79 to 1.18 inches), which prevents it from qualifying as a Mediterranean climate (Csa), and increases gradually towards the north and west, turning humid subtropical.Winters are relatively dry, with common morning frost. Snowfalls occur sporadically more or less every winter, but the snow cover does not last for more than a few days. Fog is common, with an average of 193 foggy days in a year. During the coldest winters, temperatures can drop to \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F). The record minimum temperature in Thessaloniki was \u221214 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F). On average, Thessaloniki experiences frost (sub-zero temperature) 32 days a year. The coldest month of the year in the city is January, with an average 24-hour temperature of 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F). Wind is also usual in the winter months, with December and January having an average wind speed of 26 km/h (16 mph).Thessaloniki's summers are hot and quite dry. Maximum temperatures usually rise above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), but they rarely approach or go over 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F); the average number of days the temperature is above 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) is 32. The maximum recorded temperature in the city was 44 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F). Rain seldom falls in summer, mainly during thunderstorms. In the summer months Thessaloniki also experiences strong heat waves. The hottest month of the year in the city is July, with an average 24-hour temperature of 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F). The average wind speed for June and July in Thessaloniki is 20 kilometres per hour (12 mph).\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAccording to the Kallikratis reform, as of 1 January 2011 the Thessaloniki Urban Area (Greek: \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2) which makes up the \"City of Thessaloniki\", is made up of six self-governing municipalities (Greek: \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9) and one municipal unit (Greek: \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1). The municipalities that are included in the Thessaloniki Urban Area are those of Thessaloniki (the city center and largest in population size), Kalamaria, Neapoli-Sykies, Pavlos Melas, Kordelio-Evosmos, Ampelokipoi-Menemeni, and the municipal units of Pylaia and Panorama, part of the municipality of Pylaia-Chortiatis. Prior to the Kallikratis reform, the Thessaloniki Urban Area was made up of twice as many municipalities, considerably smaller in size, which created bureaucratic problems.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki Municipality ===\n\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki (Greek: \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2) is the second most populous in Greece, after Athens, with a resident population of 325,182 (in 2011) and an area of 19.307 square kilometres (7.454 square miles). The municipality forms the core of the Thessaloniki Urban Area, with its central district (the city center), referred to as the Kentro, meaning 'center' or 'downtown'.The city's first mayor, Osman Sait Bey, was appointed when the institution of mayor was inaugurated under the Ottoman Empire in 1912. The incumbent mayor is Konstantinos Zervas. In 2011, the municipality of Thessaloniki had a budget of \u20ac464.33 million while the budget of 2012 stands at \u20ac409.00 million.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nThessaloniki is the second largest city in Greece. It is an influential city for the northern parts of the country and is the capital of the region of Central Macedonia and the Thessaloniki regional unit. The Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace is also based in Thessaloniki, being that the city is the de facto capital of the Greek region of Macedonia.It is customary every year for the Prime Minister of Greece to announce his administration's policies on a number of issues, such as the economy, at the opening night of the Thessaloniki International Fair. In 2010, during the first months of the 2010 Greek debt crisis, the entire cabinet of Greece met in Thessaloniki to discuss the country's future.In the Hellenic Parliament, the Thessaloniki urban area constitutes a 16-seat constituency. As of the 2019 Greek legislative election the largest party in Thessaloniki is the New Democracy with 35.55% of the vote, followed by the Coalition of the Radical Left (31.29%) and the Movement for Change (6.05%). The table below summarizes the results of the latest elections.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nArchitecture in Thessaloniki is the direct result of the city's position at the centre of all historical developments in the Balkans. Aside from its commercial importance, Thessaloniki was also for many centuries the military and administrative hub of the region, and beyond this the transportation link between Europe and the Levant.\nMerchants, traders and refugees from all over Europe settled in the city. The need for commercial and public buildings in this new era of prosperity led to the construction of large edifices in the city center. During this time, the city saw the building of banks, large hotels, theatres, warehouses, and factories. Architects who designed some of the most notable buildings of the city, in the late 19th and early 20th century, include Vitaliano Poselli, Pietro Arrigoni, Xenophon Paionidis, Salvatore Poselli, Leonardo Gennari, Eli Modiano, Mosh\u00e9 Jacques, Joseph Pleyber, Frederic Charnot, Ernst Ziller, Roubens Max, Levi Ernst, Angelos Siagas, Alexandros Tzonis using mainly the styles of Eclecticism, Art Nouveau and Neobaroque.\n\nThe city layout changed after 1870, when the seaside fortifications gave way to extensive piers, and many of the oldest walls of the city were demolished, including those surrounding the White Tower, which today stands as the main landmark of the city. As parts of the early Byzantine walls were demolished, this allowed the city to expand east and west along the coast.The expansion of Eleftherias Square towards the sea completed the new commercial hub of the city and at the time was considered one of the most vibrant squares of the city. As the city grew, workers moved to the western districts, because of their proximity to factories and industrial activities; while the middle and upper classes gradually moved from the city-center to the eastern suburbs, leaving mainly businesses. In 1917, a devastating fire swept through the city and burned uncontrollably for 32 hours. It destroyed the city's historic center and a large part of its architectural heritage, but paved the way for modern development featuring wider diagonal avenues and monumental squares.\n\n\n=== City centre ===\n\nAfter the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, a team of architects and urban planners including Thomas Mawson and Ernest Hebrard, a French architect, chose the Byzantine era as the basis of their (re)building designs for Thessaloniki's city centre. The new city plan included axes, diagonal streets and monumental squares, with a street grid that would channel traffic smoothly. The plan of 1917 included provisions for future population expansions and a street and road network that would be, and still is sufficient today. It contained sites for public buildings and provided for the restoration of Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques.\n\nAlso called the historic centre, it is divided into several districts, including Dimokratias Square (Democracy Sq. known also as Vardaris) Ladadika (where many entertainment venues and tavernas are located), Kapani (were the city's central Modiano market is located), Diagonios, Navarinou, Rotonda, Agia Sofia and Hippodromio, which are all located around Thessaloniki's most central point, Aristotelous Square.\nVarious commercial stoas around Aristotelous are named from the city's past and historic personalities of the city, like stoa Hirsch, stoa Carasso/Ermou, Pelosov, Colombou, Modiano, Morpurgo, Mordoch, Simcha, Malakopi, Olympios, Emboron, Rogoti, Vyzantio, Tatti, Agiou Mina, Karipi etc.The western portion of the city centre is home to Thessaloniki's law courts, its central international railway station and the port, while its eastern side hosts the city's two universities, the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Centre, the city's main stadium, its archaeological and Byzantine museums, the new city hall and its central parks and gardens, namely those of the \u03a7\u0391\u039d\u0398 and Pedion tou Areos.\n\n\n=== Ano Poli ===\n\nAno Poli (also called Old Town and literally the Upper Town) is the heritage listed district north of Thessaloniki's city center that was not engulfed by the great fire of 1917 and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site by ministerial actions of Melina Merkouri, during the 1980s. It consists of Thessaloniki's most traditional part of the city, still featuring small stone paved streets, old squares and homes featuring old Greek and Ottoman architecture. It is the favorite area of Thessaloniki's poets, intellectuals and bohemians.\n\nAno Poli also, is the highest point in Thessaloniki and as such, is the location of the city's acropolis, its Byzantine fort, the Heptapyrgion, a large portion of the city's remaining walls, and with many of its additional Ottoman and Byzantine structures still standing. The area provides access to the Seich Sou Forest National Park and features panoramic views of the whole city and the Thermaic Gulf. On clear days Mount Olympus, at about 100 km (62 mi) away across the gulf, can also be seen towering the horizon.\n\n\n=== Northwestern Thessaloniki ===\nNorthwestern Thessaloniki had always been associated with industry and the working class because as the city grew during the 1920s, many workers had moved there, because of its proximity near factories and industrial activities.\nToday many factories and industries have been moved further out west and the area is experiencing rapid growth as does the southeast. Many factories in this area have been converted to cultural centers, while past military grounds that are being surrounded by densely built neighborhoods are awaiting transformation into parklands.\nNorthwest Thessaloniki forms the main entry point into the city of Thessaloniki with the avenues of Monastiriou, Lagkada and 26is Octovriou passing through it, as well as the extension of the A1 motorway, feeding into Thessaloniki's city center. The area is home to the Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal (KTEL), the Zeitenlik Allied memorial military cemetery and to large entertainment venues of the city, such as Milos, Fix, Vilka (which are housed in converted old factories). Northwestern Thessaloniki is also home to Moni Lazariston, located in Stavroupoli, which today forms one of the most important cultural centers for the city, including MOMus\u2013Museum of Modern Art\u2013Costakis Collection and two theatres of the National Theatre of Northern Greece. Construction on the Holocaust Museum of Greece began in the city in 2018 in the area of the Old Railway Station.\nIn this area are located the Railway Museum of Thessaloniki and the Water Supply Museum.\n\n\n=== Southeastern Thessaloniki ===\n\nThe area along the today Vasileos Georgiou and Vasilissis Olgas avenues, was up until the 1920s home to the city's most affluent residents and formed the outermost suburbs of the city at the time, with the area close to the Thermaic Gulf coast called Exoch\u00e8s (des Campagnes), from the 19th century holiday villas which defined the area. Some of them include Villa Allatini, Villa Bianca, Villa Mehmet Kapanci, Villa Modiano, Villa Mordoch and others.Today southeastern Thessaloniki has in some way become a natural extension of the city center, with the avenues of Megalou Alexandrou, Georgiou Papandreou (Antheon), Vasileos Georgiou, Vasilissis Olgas, Delfon, Konstantinou Karamanli (Nea Egnatia) and Papanastasiou passing through it, enclosing an area traditionally called \u039d\u03c4\u03b5\u03c0\u03ce (Dep\u00f3, lit. D\u00e9p\u00f4t), from the name of the old tram station, owned by a French company.\nThe municipality of Kalamaria is also located in southeastern Thessaloniki and was firstly inhabited mainly by Greek refugees from Asia Minor and East Thrace after 1922.Southeastern Thessaloniki is also home to three of the city's football stadiums, the Thessaloniki Concert Hall, the Poseidonio aquatic and athletic complex, the Northern Greece Naval Command and the old royal palace (called Palataki), located on the most westerly point of Karabournaki cape.\nOther extended residential areas that belong to southeastern Thessaloniki are Charilaou and Toumba, which is divided in \"Ano Toumpa\" and \"Kato Toumpa\". Toumba was named after the homonymous hill of Toumba, situated in the northwest of the area. It was created by refugees after the 1922 Asia Minor disaster and the population exchange (1923\u201324). Toumba is one of the most famous areas of Thessaloniki, mainly due to the football stadium of the local team PAOK FC and its important archaeological site on the hill of Toumba, where extensive archaeological research takes place.\n\n\n=== Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments (UNESCO) ===\n\nBecause of Thessaloniki's importance during the early Christian and Byzantine periods, the city is host to several paleochristian monuments that have significantly contributed to the development of Byzantine art and architecture throughout the Byzantine Empire as well as Serbia. The evolution of Imperial Byzantine architecture and the prosperity of Thessaloniki go hand in hand, especially during the first years of the Empire, when the city continued to flourish. It was at that time that the Complex of Roman emperor Galerius was built, as well as the first church of Hagios Demetrios.By the 8th century, the city had become an important administrative center of the Byzantine Empire, and handled much of the Empire's Balkan affairs. During that time, the city saw the creation of more notable Christian churches that are now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as Hagia Sophia of Thessaloniki, the Church of the Acheiropoietos, the Church of Panagia Chalkeon. When the Ottoman Empire took control of Thessaloniki in 1430, most of the city's churches were converted into mosques, but have survived to this day. Travelers such as Paul Lucas and Abdulmejid I document the city's wealth in Christian monuments during the years of the Ottoman control of the city.\nThe church of Hagios Demetrios was burnt down during the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, as did many other of the city's monuments, but it was rebuilt. During World War II, the city was extensively bombed and as such many of Thessaloniki's paleochristian and Byzantine monuments were heavily damaged. Some of the sites were not restored until the 1980s. Thessaloniki has more UNESCO World Heritage Sites listed than any other city in Greece, a total of 15 monuments. They have been listed since 1988.\n\n\n=== Urban sculpture ===\n\nThere are around 150 statues or busts in the city. Probably the most famous one is the equestrian statue of Alexander the Great on the promenade, placed in 1973 and created by sculptor Evangelos Moustakas. An equestrian statue of Constantine I, by sculptor Georgios Dimitriades, is located in Demokratias Square. Other notable statues include that of Eleftherios Venizelos by sculptor Giannis Pappas, Pavlos Melas by Natalia Mela, the statue of Emmanouel Pappas by Memos Makris, Chrysostomos of Smyrna by Athanasios Apartis, such as various creations by George Zongolopoulos.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki 2012 Program ===\n\nWith the 100th anniversary of the 1912 incorporation of Thessaloniki into Greece, the government announced a large-scale redevelopment program for the city of Thessaloniki, which aims in addressing the current environmental and spatial problems that the city faces. More specifically, the program will drastically change the physiognomy of the city by relocating the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center and grounds of the Thessaloniki International Fair outside the city centre and turning the current location into a large metropolitan park, redeveloping the coastal front of the city, relocating the city's numerous military camps and using the grounds and facilities to create large parklands and cultural centers; and the complete redevelopment of the harbor and the Lachanokipoi and Dendropotamos districts (behind and near the Port of Thessaloniki) into a commercial business district, with possible highrise developments.The plan also envisions the creation of new wide avenues in the outskirts of the city and the creation of pedestrian-only zones in the city centre. Furthermore, the program includes plans to expand the jurisdiction of Seich Sou Forest National Park and the improvement of accessibility to and from the Old Town. The ministry has said that the project will take an estimated 15 years to be completed, in 2025.Part of the plan has been implemented with extensive pedestrianization's within the city center by the municipality of Thessaloniki and the revitalization the eastern urban waterfront/promenade, \u039d\u03ad\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 (N\u00e9a Paral\u00eda, lit. new promenade), with a modern and vibrant design. Its first section opened in 2008, having been awarded as the best public project in Greece of the last five years by the Hellenic Institute of Architecture.The municipality of Thessaloniki's budget for the reconstruction of important areas of the city and the completion of the waterfront, opened in January 2014, was estimated at around \u20ac28.2 million (US$39.9 million) for the year 2011 alone.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThessaloniki rose to economic prominence as a major economic hub in the Balkans during the years of the Roman Empire. The Pax Romana and the city's strategic position allowed for the facilitation of trade between Rome and Byzantium (later Constantinople and now Istanbul) through Thessaloniki by means of the Via Egnatia. The Via Egnatia also functioned as an important line of communication between the Roman Empire and the nations of Asia, particularly in relation to the Silk Road. With the partition of the Roman Emp. into East (Byzantine) and West, Thessaloniki became the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire after New Rome (Constantinople) in terms of economic might. Under the Empire, Thessaloniki was the largest port in the Balkans. As the city passed from Byzantium to the Republic of Venice in 1423, it was subsequently conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Under Ottoman rule the city retained its position as the most important trading hub in the Balkans. Manufacturing, shipping and trade were the most important components of the city's economy during the Ottoman period, and the majority of the city's trade at the time was controlled by ethnic Greeks. Plus, the Jewish community was also an important factor in the trade sector.Historically important industries for the economy of Thessaloniki included tobacco (in 1946 35% of all tobacco companies in Greece were headquartered in the city, and 44% in 1979) and banking (in Ottoman years Thessaloniki was a major center for investment from western Europe, with the Bank of Thessaloniki (French: Banque de Salonique) having a capital of 20 million French francs in 1909).\n\n\n=== Services ===\n\nThe service sector accounts for nearly two thirds of the total labour force of Thessaloniki. Of those working in services, 20% were employed in trade, 13% in education and healthcare, 7.1% in real estate, 6.3% in transport, communications & storing, 6.1% in the finance industry & service-providing organizations, 5.7% in public administration & insurance services and 5.4% in hotels & restaurants.The city's port, the Port of Thessaloniki, is one of the largest ports in the Aegean and as a free port, it functions as a major gateway to the Balkan hinterland. In 2010, more than 15.8 million tons of products went through the city's port, making it the second-largest port in Greece after Aghioi Theodoroi, surpassing Piraeus. At 273,282 TEUs, it is also Greece's second-largest container port after Piraeus. As a result, the city is a major transportation hub for the whole of south-eastern Europe, carrying, among other things, trade to and from the neighbouring countries.In recent years Thessaloniki has begun to turn into a major port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean. The Greek ministry of tourism considers Thessaloniki to be Greece's second most important commercial port, and companies such as Royal Caribbean International have expressed interest in adding the Port of Thessaloniki to their destinations. A total of 30 cruise ships are expected to arrive at Thessaloniki in 2011.\n\n\n=== Companies ===\nRecent historyAfter WWII and the Greek civil war, heavy industrialization of the city's suburbs began in the middle 1950s.During the 1980s a spate of factory shut downs occurred, mostly of automobile manufacters, such as Agricola (vehicles), AutoDiana, EBIAM, Motoemil, Pantelemidis-TITAN and C.AR (automobiles). Since the 1990s, companies took advantage of cheaper labour markets and more lax regulations in other countries, and among the largest companies to shut down factories were Goodyear, AVEZ pasta industry (one of the first industrial factories in northern Greece, built in 1926),  Philkeram Johnson, AGNO dairy and VIAMIL.\nHowever, Thessaloniki still remains a major business hub in the Balkans and Greece, with a number of important Greek companies headquartered in the city, such as the Hellenic Vehicle Industry (ELVO), Namco (automobiles), Astra Airlines, Ellinair, Pyramis and MLS Multimedia, which introduced the first Greek-built smartphone in 2012.\nIndustryIn early 1960s, with the collaboration of Standard Oil and ESSO-Pappas, a large industrial zone was created, containing refineries, oil refinery and steel production (owned by Hellenic Steel Co.). The zone attracted also a series of different factories during the next decades.\nTitan Cement has also facilities outside the city, on the road to Serres, such as the AGET Heracles, a member of the Lafarge group, and Alumil SA.\nMultinational companies such as Air Liquide, Cyanamid, Nestl\u00e9, Pfizer, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company and Vivartia have also industrial facilities in the suburbs of the city.\nFoodstuffFoodstuff or drink companies headquartered in the city include the Macedonian Milk Industry (Mevgal), Allatini, Barbastathis, Hellenic Sugar Industry, Haitoglou Bros, Mythos Brewery, Malamatina, while the Goody's chain started from the city.The American Farm School also has important contribution in food production.\n\n\n=== Macroeconomic indicators ===\nIn 2011, the regional unit of Thessaloniki had a Gross Domestic Product of \u20ac18.293 billion (ranked 2nd amongst the country's regional units), comparable to Bahrain or Cyprus, and a per capita of \u20ac15,900 (ranked 16th). In Purchasing Power Parity, the same indicators are \u20ac19,851 billion (2nd) and \u20ac17,200 (15th) respectively. In terms of comparison with the European Union average, Thessaloniki's GDP per capita indicator stands at 63% the EU average and 69% in PPP \u2013 this is comparable to the German state of Brandenburg. Overall, Thessaloniki accounts for 8.9% of the total economy of Greece. Between 1995 and 2008 Thessaloniki's GDP saw an average growth rate of 4.1% per annum (ranging from +14.5% in 1996 to \u221211.1% in 2005) while in 2011 the economy contracted by \u22127.8%.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical ethnic statistics ===\nThe tables below show the ethnic statistics of Thessaloniki during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki is the most populous in the Thessaloniki Urban Area. Its population has increased in the latest census and the metropolitan area's population rose to over one million. The city forms the base of the Thessaloniki metropolitan area, with latest census in 2011 giving it a population of 1,030,338.\n\n\n=== Jews of Thessaloniki ===\n\nThe Jewish population in Greece is the oldest in mainland Europe (see Romaniotes). When Paul the Apostle came in Thessaloniki he taught in the area of what today is called Upper City. Later, during the Ottoman period, with the coming of Sephardic Jews from Spain, the community of Thessaloniki became mostly Sephardic. Thessaloniki became the largest center in Europe of the Sephardic Jews, who nicknamed the city la madre de Israel (Israel's mother) and \"Jerusalem of the Balkans\". It also included the historically significant and ancient Greek-speaking Romaniote community. During the Ottoman era, Thessaloniki's Sephardic community of was half the population according to the Ottoman Census of 1902 and almost 40% the city's population of 157,000 about 1913; Jewish merchants were prominent in commerce until the ethnic Greek population increased after independence in 1912. By the 1680s, about 300 families of Sephardic Jews, followers of Sabbatai Zevi, had converted to Islam, becoming a sect known as the D\u00f6nmeh (convert), and migrated to Salonika, whose population was majority Jewish. They established an active community that thrived for about 250 years. Many of their descendants later became prominent in trade. Many Jewish inhabitants of Thessaloniki spoke Ladino, the Romance language of the Sephardic Jews.\n\nFrom the second half of the 19th century with the Ottoman reforms, the Jewish community had a new revival. Many French and especially Italian Jews (from Livorno and other cities), influential in introducing new methods of education and developing new schools and intellectual environment for the Jewish population, were established in Thessaloniki. Such modernists introduced also new techniques and ideas from the industrialized Western Europe and from the 1880s the city began to industrialize. The Italian Jews Allatini brothers led Jewish entrepreneurship, establishing milling and other food industries, brickmaking and processing plants for tobacco. Several traders supported the introduction of a large textile-production industry, superseding the weaving of cloth in a system of artisanal production. Notable names of the era include among others the Italo-Jewish Modiano family and the Allatini. Benrubis founded also in 1880 one of the first retail companies in the Balkans.\nAfter the Balkan Wars, Thessaloniki was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece in 1913. At first the community feared that the annexation would lead to difficulties and during the first years its political stance was, in general, anti-Venizelist and pro-royalist/conservative. The Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 during World War I burned much of the center of the city and left 50,000 Jews homeless of the total of 72,000 residents who were burned out. Having lost homes and their businesses, many Jews emigrated: to the United States, Palestine, and Paris. They could not wait for the government to create a new urban plan for rebuilding, which was eventually done.After the Greco-Turkish War in 1922 and the bilateral population exchange between Greece and Turkey, many refugees came to Greece. Nearly 100,000 ethnic Greeks resettled in Thessaloniki, reducing the proportion of Jews in the total community. After this, Jews made up about 20% of the city's population. During the interwar period, Greece granted Jewish citizens the same civil rights as other Greek citizens. In March 1926, Greece re-emphasized that all citizens of Greece enjoyed equal rights, and a considerable proportion of the city's Jews decided to stay. During the Metaxas regime the stance towards Jews became even better.\n\nWorld War II brought a disaster for the Jewish Greeks, since in 1941 the Germans occupied Greece and began actions against the Jewish population. Greeks of the Resistance helped save some of the Jewish residents. By the 1940s, the great majority of the Jewish Greek community firmly identified as both Greek and Jewish. According to Misha Glenny, such Greek Jews had largely not encountered \"anti-Semitism as in its North European form.\"In 1943 the Nazis began brutal actions against the historic Jewish population in Thessaloniki, forcing them into a ghetto near the railroad lines and beginning deportation to concentration and labor camps. They deported and exterminated approximately 96% of Thessaloniki's Jews of all ages during the Holocaust. The Thessaloniki Holocaust memorial in Eleftherias (\"Freedom\") Square was built in 1997 in memory of all the Jewish people from Thessaloniki, who died in the Holocaust. The site was chosen because it was the place where Jewish residents were rounded up before embarking to trains for concentration camps. Today, a community of around 1200 remains in the city. Communities of descendants of Thessaloniki Jews \u2013 both Sephardic and Romaniote \u2013 live in other areas, mainly the United States and Israel. Israeli singer Yehuda Poliker recorded a song about the Jewish people of Thessaloniki, called \"Wait for me, Thessaloniki\".\n\n\n=== Others ===\nSince the late 19th century, many merchants from Western Europe (mainly from France and Italy) were established in the city. They had an important role in the social and economic life of the city and introduced new industrial techniques. Their main district was what is known today as the \"Frankish district\" (near Ladadika), where the Catholic church designed by Vitaliano Poselli is also situated. Many of them left after the incorporation of the city into the Greek kingdom, others, who were of Jewish faith, were exterminated by the Nazis.\nThe Bulgarian community of the city increased during the late 19th century. The community had a Men's High School, a Girl's High School, a trade union and a gymnastics society. A large part of them were Catholics, as a result of actions by the Lazarists society, which had its base in the city.\nAnother group is the Armenian community which dates back to the Byzantine and Ottoman periods. During the 20th century, after the Armenian Genocide and the defeat of the Greek army in the Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322), many fled to Greece including Thessaloniki. There is also an Armenian cemetery and an Armenian church at the center of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Leisure and entertainment ===\n\nThessaloniki is not only regarded as the cultural and entertainment capital of northern Greece but also the cultural capital of the country. The city's main theaters, run by the National Theatre of Northern Greece (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0398\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf \u0392\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2) which was established in 1961, include the Theater of the Society of Macedonian Studies, where the National Theater is based, the Royal Theater (\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0398\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf)-the first base of the National Theater-, Moni Lazariston, and the Earth Theater and Forest Theater, both amphitheatrical open-air theatres overlooking the city.\n\nThe title of the European Capital of Culture in 1997 saw the birth of the city's first opera and today forms an independent section of the National Theatre of Northern Greece. The opera is based at the Thessaloniki Concert Hall, one of the largest concert halls in Greece. Recently a second building was also constructed and designed by Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. Thessaloniki is also the seat of two symphony orchestras, the Thessaloniki State Symphony Orchestra and the Symphony Orchestra of the Municipality of Thessaloniki.\nOlympion Theater, the site of the Thessaloniki International Film Festival and the Plateia Assos Odeon multiplex are the two major cinemas in downtown Thessaloniki. The city also has a number of multiplex cinemas in major shopping malls in the suburbs, most notably in Mediterranean Cosmos, the largest retail and entertainment development in the Balkans.\nThessaloniki is renowned for its major shopping streets and lively laneways. Tsimiski Street and Proxenou Koromila avenue are the city's most famous shopping streets and are among Greece's most expensive and exclusive high streets. The city is also home to one of Greece's most famous and prestigious hotels, Makedonia Palace hotel, the Hyatt Regency Casino and hotel (the biggest casino in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe) and Waterland, the largest water park in southeastern Europe.\nThe city has long been known in Greece for its vibrant city culture, including having the most cafes and bars per capita of any city in Europe; and as having some of the best nightlife and entertainment in the country, thanks to its large young population and multicultural feel. Lonely Planet listed Thessaloniki among the world's \"ultimate party cities\".\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\n\nAlthough Thessaloniki is not renowned for its parks and greenery throughout its urban area, where green spaces are few, it has several large open spaces around its waterfront, namely the central city gardens of Palios Zoologikos Kipos (which is recently being redeveloped to also include rock climbing facilities, a new skatepark and paintball range), the park of Pedion tou Areos, which also holds the city's annual floral expo; and the parks of the Nea Paralia (waterfront) that span for 3 km (2 mi) along the coast, from the White Tower to the concert hall.\nThe Nea Paralia parks are used throughout the year for a variety of events, while they open up to the Thessaloniki waterfront, which is lined up with several caf\u00e9s and bars; and during summer is full of Thessalonians enjoying their long evening walks (referred to as \"the volta\" and is embedded into the culture of the city). Having undergone an extensive revitalization, the city's waterfront today features a total of 12 thematic gardens/parks.Thessaloniki's proximity to places such as the national parks of Pieria and beaches of Chalkidiki often allow its residents to easily have access to some of the best outdoor recreation in Europe; however, the city is also right next to the Seich Sou forest national park, just 3.5 km (2 mi) away from Thessaloniki's city center; and offers residents and visitors alike, quiet viewpoints towards the city, mountain bike trails and landscaped hiking paths. The city's zoo, which is operated by the municipality of Thessaloniki, is also located nearby the national park.Other recreation spaces throughout the Thessaloniki metropolitan area include the Fragma Thermis, a landscaped parkland near Thermi and the Delta wetlands west of the city center; while urban beaches that have continuously been awarded the blue flags, are located along the 10 km (6 mi) coastline of Thessaloniki's southeastern suburbs of Thermaikos, about 20 km (12 mi) away from the city center.\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nBecause of the city's rich and diverse history, Thessaloniki houses many museums dealing with many different eras in history. Two of the city's most famous museums include the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki and the Museum of Byzantine Culture.\nThe Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki was established in 1962 and houses some of the most important ancient Macedonian artifacts, including an extensive collection of golden artwork from the royal palaces of Aigai and Pella. It also houses exhibits from Macedon's prehistoric past, dating from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. The Prehistoric Antiquities Museum of Thessaloniki has exhibits from those periods as well.\n\nThe Museum of Byzantine Culture is one of the city's most famous museums, showcasing the city's glorious Byzantine past. The museum was also awarded Council of Europe's museum prize in 2005. The museum of the White Tower of Thessaloniki houses a series of galleries relating to the city's past, from the creation of the White Tower until recent years.One of the most modern museums in the city is the Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum and is one of the most high-tech museums in Greece and southeastern Europe. It features the largest planetarium in Greece, a cosmotheater with the country's largest flat screen, an amphitheater, a motion simulator with 3D projection and 6-axis movement and exhibition spaces. Other industrial and technological museums in the city include the Railway Museum of Thessaloniki, which houses an original Orient Express train, the War Museum of Thessaloniki and others. The city also has a number of educational and sports museums, including the Thessaloniki Olympic Museum.\nThe Atat\u00fcrk Museum in Thessaloniki is the historic house where Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, founder of modern-day Turkey, was born. The house is now part of the Turkish consulate complex, but admission to the museum is free. The museum contains historic information about Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk and his life, especially while he was in Thessaloniki.\nOther ethnological museums of the sort include the Historical Museum of the Balkan Wars, the Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki and the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle, containing information about the freedom fighters in Macedonia and their struggle to liberate the region from the Ottoman yoke. Construction on the Holocaust Museum of Greece began in the city in 2018.The city also has a number of important art galleries. Such include the Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art, housing exhibitions from a number of well-known Greek and foreign artists. The Teloglion Foundation of Art is part of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and includes an extensive collection of works by important artists of the 19th and 20th centuries, including works by prominent Greeks and native Thessalonians. The Thessaloniki Museum of Photography also houses a number of important exhibitions, and is located within the old port of Thessaloniki.\n\n\n=== Archaeological sites ===\n\nThessaloniki is home to a number of prominent archaeological sites. Apart from its recognized UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Thessaloniki features a large two-terraced Roman forum featuring two-storey stoas, dug up by accident in the 1960s. The forum complex also boasts two Roman baths, one of which has been excavated while the other is buried underneath the city. The forum also features a small theater, which was also used for gladiatorial games. Although the initial complex was not built in Roman times, it was largely refurbished in the 2nd century. It is believed that the forum and the theater continued to be used until at least the 6th century.Another important archaeological site is the imperial palace complex which Roman emperor Galerius, located at Navarinou Square, commissioned when he made Thessaloniki the capital of his portion of the Roman Empire. The large octagonal portion of the complex, most of which survives to this day, is believed to have been an imperial throne room. Various mosaics from the palatial complex have also survived. Some historians believe that the complex must have been in use as an imperial residence until the 11th century.Not far from the palace itself is the Arch of Galerius, known colloquially as the Kamara. The arch was built to commemorate the emperor's campaigns against the Persians. The original structure featured three arches; however, only two full arches and part of the third survive to this day. Many of the arches' marble parts survive as well, although it is mostly the brick interior that can be seen today.\nOther monuments of the city's past, such as the Incantadas, a Caryatid portico from the ancient forum, have been removed or destroyed over the years. The Incantadas in particular are on display at the Louvre. Thanks to a private donation of \u20ac180,000, it was announced on 6 December 2011 that a replica of the Incantadas would be commissioned and later put on display in Thessaloniki.The construction of the Thessaloniki Metro inadvertently started the largest archaeological dig not only of the city, but of Northern Greece; the dig spans 20 km2 (7.7 sq mi) and has unearthed 300,000 individual artefacts from as early as the Roman Empire and as late as the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917. Ancient Thessaloniki's Decumanus Maximus was also found and 75 metres (246 ft) of the marble-paved and column-lined road were unearthed along with shops, other buildings, and plumbing, prompting one scholar to describe the discovery as \"the Byzantine Pompeii\". Some of the artefacts will be put on display inside the metro stations, while Venizelou will feature the world's first open archaeological site located within a metro station.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThessaloniki is home of a number of festivals and events. The Thessaloniki International Fair is the most important event to be hosted in the city annually, by means of economic development. It was first established in 1926 and takes place every year at the 180,000 m2 (1,937,503.88 sq ft) Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center.

It has been held every year ever since, however in 2013 transgender people participating in the parade became victims of police brutality. The issue was soon settled by the government. The city's Greek Orthodox Church leadership has consistently rallied against the event, but mayor Boutaris sided with Thessaloniki Pride, saying also that Thessaloniki would seek to host EuroPride 2020. The event was given to Thessaloniki in September 2017, beating Bergen, Brussels, and Hamburg.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe main stadium of the city is the Kaftanzoglio Stadium (also home ground of Iraklis F.C.), while other main stadiums of the city include the football Kleanthis Vikelidis Stadium and Toumba Stadium home grounds of Aris F.C. and PAOK FC, respectively, all of whom are founding members of the Greek league.\nBeing the largest \"multi-sport\" stadium in the city, Kaftanzoglio Stadium regularly plays host to athletics events; such as the European Athletics Association event \"Olympic Meeting Thessaloniki\" every year; it has hosted the Greek national championships in 2009 and has been used for athletics at the Mediterranean Games and for the European Cup in athletics.

In October 2007, Thessaloniki also played host to the first Southeastern European Games.The city is also the finish point of the annual Alexander The Great Marathon, which starts at Pella, in recognition of its Ancient Macedonian heritage.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nThessaloniki is home to the ERT3 TV-channel and Radio Macedonia, both services of Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) operating in the city and are broadcast all over Greece.\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki also operates three radio stations, namely FM100, FM101 and FM100.6; and TV100, a television network which was also the first non-state-owned TV station in Greece and opened in 1988. Several private TV-networks also broadcast out from Thessaloniki, with Makedonia TV being the most popular.\nThe city's main newspapers and some of the most circulated in Greece, include Makedonia, which was also the first newspaper published in Thessaloniki in 1911 and Aggelioforos. A large number of radio stations also broadcast from Thessaloniki as the city is known for its music contributions.\n\n\n==== TV broadcasting ====\nERT3 (Panhellenic broadcasting)\nMakedonia TV (Panhellenic)\n4E TV (Panhellenic)\nTV 100 (Regional)\nVergina TV (Regional)\nAtlas TV (Regional)\n\n\n==== Press ====\nMakedonia (national publication)\nAggelioforos (national)\nMetrosport (sports, national)\nFair Play (sports, national)\nAris Ise (sports, weekly, national )\nForza (sports, weekly, national)\nThessaloniki (weekly, national)\nKarfitsa (weekly)\nIkonomiki (financial)\n\n\n=== Notable Thessalonians ===\n\nThroughout its history, Thessaloniki has been home to a number of well-known figures. It was also the birthplace or base of various Saints and other religious figures, such as Demetrius of Thessaloniki, Cyril and Methodius (creators of the first Slavic alphabet), Saint Mitre (Saint Demetrius, not to be confused with the previous), Gregorios Palamas, Eustathius of Thessalonica and Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople. Other Byzantine-era notables included jurist Constantine Armenopoulos, the anti-Palamian theologians Prochoros and Demetrios Kydones, such as scholars Theodorus Gaza (Thessalonicensis) and Matthaios Kamariotis.\nMany of the country's best-known musicians and movie personalities are from Thessaloniki, such as Zoe Laskari, Costas Hajihristos, Stella Haskil, Giannis Dalianidis, Maria Plyta, Harry Klynn, Antonis Remos, Paschalis Terzis, Nikos Papazoglou, Nikolas Asimos, Giorgos Hatzinasios, Alberto Eskenazi, Stavros Kouyioumtzis, Giannis Kalatzis, Natassa Theodoridou, Katia Zygouli, Kostas Voutsas, Takis Kanellopoulos, Titos Vandis, Manolis Chiotis, Dionysis Savvopoulos, Marinella, Yvonne Sanson and the classical composer Emilios Riadis. Additionally, there have been a number of politicians born in the city: Ioannis Skandalidis, Alexandros Zannas, Evangelos Venizelos, Christos Sartzetakis, fourth President of Greece, Niki Kerameus and Yiannis Boutaris. Sports personalities from the city include Georgios Roubanis, Giannis Ioannidis, Faidon Matthaiou, Alketas Panagoulias, Panagiotis Fasoulas, Eleni Daniilidou, Traianos Dellas, Giorgos Koudas, Kleanthis Vikelidis, Christos Kostis, Dimitris Salpingidis and Nikos Zisis. Benefactor Ioannis Papafis, architect Lysandros Kaftanzoglou and writers, such as Grigorios Zalykis, Manolis Anagnostakis, Kleitos Kyrou, Albertos Nar, Giorgos Ioannou, Elias Petropoulos, Kostis Moskof, Rena Molho and Dinos Christianopoulos are also from Thessaloniki.\nThe city is also the birthplace or base of a number of international personalities, which include Bulgarians (Atanas Dalchev), Jews (Moshe Levy, Maurice Abravanel, Isaak Benrubi, Isaac and Daniel Carasso, Rapha\u00ebl Salem, Baruch Uziel, Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz, Salamo Arouch), Slav Macedonians (Dimo Todorovski), Italians (Luisa Poselli, Giacomo Poselli, Vittorio Citterich), French (Louis Dumont), Spanish (Juana Mord\u00f3), Turks (Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet, Afet \u0130nan, Cahit Arf, Mehmet Cavit Bey, Sabiha Sertel, Abdul Kerim Pasha, Hasan Tahsin Uzer, Hasan Tahsin) and Armenians (Jean Tatlian).\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nBecause Thessaloniki remained under Ottoman rule for about 100 years more than southern Greece, it has retained a lot of its Eastern character, including its culinary tastes. Spices in particular play an important role in the cuisine of Thessaloniki, something which is not true to the same degree about Greece's southern regions. Thessaloniki's Ladadika borough is a particularly busy area in regards to Thessalonian cuisine, with most tavernas serving traditional meze and other such culinary delights.Bougatsa, a breakfast pastry, which can be either sweet or savory, is very popular throughout the city and has spread around other parts of Greece and the Balkans as well. Another popular snack is koulouri.\nNotable sweets of the city are Trigona, Rox\u00e1kia and Armenov\u00edl. A stereotypical Thessalonian coffee drink is Frapp\u00e9 coffee. Frapp\u00e9 was invented in the Thessaloniki International Fair in 1957 and has since spread throughout Greece and Cyprus to become a hallmark of the Greek coffee culture.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nA touristic boom took place in the 2010s, during the years of mayor Boutaris, especially from the neighboring countries, Austria, Israel and Turkey. In 2010 the sleepovers of foreign tourists in the city were around 250,000. In 2018 the sleepovers of foreign tourists was estimated to reach 3,000,000 people.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe city is viewed as a romantic one in Greece, and as such Thessaloniki is commonly featured in Greek songs. There are a number of famous songs that go by the name 'Thessaloniki' (rebetiko, la\u00efko etc.) or include the name in their title.During the 1930s and 40s the city became a center of the Rebetiko music, partly because of the Metaxas censorship, which was stricter in Athens. Vassilis Tsitsanis wrote some of his best songs in Thessaloniki.\nThe city is the birthplace of significant composers in the Greek music scene, such as Manolis Chiotis, Stavros Kouyioumtzis and Dionysis Savvopoulos. It is also notable for its rock music scene and its many rock groups; some became famous such as Xylina Spathia, Trypes or the pop rock Onirama.\nBetween 1962\u20131997 and 2005\u20132008 the city also hosted the Thessaloniki Song Festival. In the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 Greece was represented by Koza Mostra and Agathonas Iakovidis, both from Thessaloniki.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nOn May 1936, a massive strike by tobacco workers led to general anarchy in the city and Ioannis Metaxas (future dictator, then PM) ordered its repression. The events and the deaths of the protesters inspired Yiannis Ritsos to write the Epitafios.\nOn 22 May 1963, Grigoris Lambrakis, pacifist and MP, was assassinated by two far-right extremists driving a three-wheeled vehicle. The event led to political crisis. Costa Gavras directed Z (1969 film) based on it, two years after the military junta had seized power in Greece.\nNotable films set or shot in Thessaloniki among others include Mademoiselle Docteur/Salonique, nid d'espions (1937) by Georg Wilhelm Pabst, The Barefooted Battalion (1954) by Greg Tallas (Gregory Thalassinos), O Ats\u00eddas (1961) by Giannis Dalianidis,  Parenthesis (1968) by Takis Kanellopoulos,  Triumph of the Spirit (1989) by Robert M. Young, Eternity and a Day by Theo Angelopoulos (1998) and Ouzeri Tsitsanis (2015) by Manousos Manousakis.\nThe 1963 book I am David, written by Anne Holm, makes mention of the main character David making his way there after escaping from the Eastern Bloc, before continuing his ultimate journey to Denmark.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThessaloniki is a major center of education for Greece. Three of the country's largest universities are located in central Thessaloniki: Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the University of Macedonia and the International Hellenic University. Aristotle University was founded in 1926 and is currently the largest university in Greece by number of students, which number at more than 80,000 in 2010, and is a member of the Utrecht Network. For the academic year 2009\u20132010, Aristotle University was ranked as one of the 150 best universities in the world for arts and humanities and among the 250 best universities in the world overall by the Times QS World University Rankings, making it one of the top 2% of best universities worldwide. Leiden ranks Aristotle University as one of the top 100 European universities and the best university in Greece, at number 97. Since 2010, Thessaloniki is also home to the Open University of Thessaloniki, which is funded by Aristotle University, the University of Macedonia and the municipality of Thessaloniki.\nAdditionally, a TEI (Technological Educational Institute), namely the Alexander Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki, is located in the western suburb of Sindos; home also to the industrial zone of the city. Numerous public and private vocational institutes (Greek: IEK) provide professional training to young students, while a large number of private colleges offer American and UK academic curriculum, via cooperation with foreign universities. In addition to Greek students, the city hence attracts many foreign students either via the Erasmus programme for public universities, or for a complete degree in public universities or in the city's private colleges. As of 2006 the city's total student population was estimated around 200,000.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nTram was the main, oldest and most popular public urban mean of Thessalonians in the past. It functioned from 1893 to 1957, when it was disestablished by the government of Konstantinos Karamanlis. The French Compagnie de Tramways et d' \u00c9clairage \u00c9lectrique de Salonique operated it from 1912 until 1940, when the company was purchased by the Hellenic State. The operating base and tram station was in the district of D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nBefore the economic crisis of 2009, there were various proposals for new tram lines.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nThessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (OASTH) operates buses as the only form of public transport in Thessaloniki. It was founded in 1957 and operates a fleet of 604 vehicles on 75 routes throughout the Thessaloniki metropolitan area. International and regional bus links are provided by KTEL at its Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal, located to the west of the city centre.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe creation of a metro system for Thessaloniki goes back as far as 1918, when Thomas Hayton Mawson and Ernest H\u00e9brard proposed the creation of a Thessaloniki Metropolitan Railway. In 1968 a circular metro line was proposed, and in 1987 the first serious proposal was presented and construction briefly started in 1988, before stalling and finally being abandoned due to lack of funding. Both the 1918 and 1988 proposals ran almost the identical route to the current Line 1.\nConstruction on Thessaloniki's current metro began in 2006 and is classified as a megaproject: it has a budget of \u20ac1.57 billion ($1.77 billion). Line 1 and Line 2 are currently under construction and will enter service, in phases, between 2020 and 2021. Line 1 is 9.5 kilometres (5.9 mi) long and stops at 13 stations, while Line 2 is 4.8 kilometres (3.0 mi) long and stops at a further 5 stations, while also calling at 11 of the Line 1 stations. Important archaeological discoveries have been made during construction, and some of the system's stations will house archaeological exhibitions. One stop, Venizelou, will house the only open archaeological site within a metro station anywhere in the world.Line 2 is to be expanded further, with a loop extension to the western suburbs of the city, towards Evosmos and Stavroupoli, and one overground extension towards the Airport. The western extension is more high-priority than the airport one, as the airport will be served by a 10-minute shuttle bus to the terminus of Line 2, Mikra.Once opened in 2020, it is expected that 320,000 people will use the metro every day, or 116 million people every year.\n\n\n=== Commuter/suburban rail (Proastiakos) ===\n\nCommuter rail services have recently been established between Thessaloniki and the city of Larissa (the service is known in Greek as the \"Proastiakos\", meaning \"Suburban Railway\"). The service is operated using Siemens Desiro EMU trains on a modernised electrified double track and stops at 11 refurbished stations, covering the journey in 1 hour and 33 minutes. Furthermore, an additional line has also been established, although with the use of regional trains, between Thessaloniki and the city of Edessa.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki Airport \"Makedonia\" ===\n\nInternational and domestic air traffic to and from the city is served by Thessaloniki Airport \"Makedonia\". The short length of the airport's two runways means that it does not currently support intercontinental flights, although a major extension \u2013 lengthening one of its runways into the Thermaic Gulf \u2013 is under construction, despite considerable opposition from local environmental groups. Following the completion of the runway works, the airport will be able to serve intercontinental flights and cater for larger aircraft in the future. Construction of a second terminal began in September 2018, due to be completed in 2021.\n\n\n=== Railways and ferry connections ===\n\nBecause of the Greek economic crisis, all international train links from the city were suspended in February 2011. Until then, the city was a major railway hub for the Balkans, with direct connections to Sofia, Skopje, Belgrade, Moscow, Vienna, Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul, alongside Athens and other destinations in Greece. Daily through trains to Sofia and Belgrade were restarted in May 2014. Thessaloniki remains one of Greece's most important railway hubs and has the biggest marshalling yard in the country.\nRegional train services within Greece (operated by TrainOSE, the Hellenic Railways Organization's train operating company), link the city with other parts of the country, from its central railway passenger station, called the \"New railway station\" located at the western end of Thessaloniki's city center.\nThe Port of Thessaloniki connects the city with seasonal ferries to the Sporades and other north Aegean islands, with its passenger terminal, being one of the largest in the Aegean Sea basin; having handled around 162,731 passengers in 2007. Meanwhile, ongoing actions have been going on for more connections and the port is recently being upgraded, as Thessaloniki is also slowly turning into a major tourist port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Motorways ===\n\nThessaloniki lies on the crossroads of the A1/E75, A2/E90 and A25 motorways; which connect the city with other parts of the country, as well as the Republic of North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey.\nThe city itself is bypassed by the C-shaped Thessaloniki Inner Ring Road (Esoteriki Peripheriaki Odos,  Greek: \u0395\u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2), which all of the above motorways connect onto it. The western end of the route begins at the junction with the A1/A2 motorways in Lachanagora District. Clockwise it heads northeast around the city, passing through the northwestern suburbs, the forest of Seich Sou and through to the southeast suburb/borough of Kalamaria. The ring road ends at a large junction with the A25 motorway, which then continues south to Chalkidiki, passing through Thessaloniki's outer southeast suburbs.\nThe speed limit on this motorway is 90 kilometres per hour (56 mph), it currently has three traffic lanes for each direction and forms the city's most vital road link; handling more than 120,000 vehicles daily, instead of 30,000 as it was meant to handle when designed in 1975.\nAn outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (Greek: \u0395\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2, outer ring road) carries all traffic that completely bypasses the city. It is Part of Motorway 2.\n\n\n==== Future plans ====\nDespite the large effort that was made in 2004 to improve the motorway features of the Thessaloniki ring road, the motorway is still insufficient to tackle Thessaloniki's increasing traffic and metropolitan population. To tackle this problem, the government has introduced large scale redevelopment plans throughout 2011 with tenders expected to be announced within early 2012; that include the total restructuring of the A16 in the western side of the city, with new junctions and new emergency lanes throughout the whole length of the motorway. In the eastern side an even larger scale project has been announced, for the construction of a new elevated motorway section above the existing, which would allow faster travel for drivers heading through to the airport and Chalkidiki that do not wish to exit into the city, and will decongest the existing motorway for city commuters. The plans also include adding one more lane in each direction on the existing A16 ring road and on the A25 passing through Thessaloniki's southeast suburbs, from its junction with the A16 in Kalamaria, up to the airport exit (\u0395\u039f67); which will make it an 8 lane highway.Additional long term plans further include the extension of the planned outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (Greek: \u0395\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2, outer ring road) to circle around the entire Thessaloniki metropolitan area, crossing over the Thermaic Gulf from the east, to join with the A1/E75 motorway. Preliminary plans have been announced which include a 4.5 km (3 mi) bridge over the gulf, as part of the southern bypass of the city; to cater for the large number of travellers from Macedonia and the rest of Greece heading to the airport, and to the increasingly popular tourist region of Chalkidiki.\nMotorways:\nA1/E75 W (Republic of North Macedonia, Larissa, Athens)\nA2/E90 W (Kozani, Ioannina, Igoumenitsa) N (Kavala, Xanthi, Alexandroupolis, Turkey)\nA25 (\u0395\u039f12)/\u039579 \u039d (Serres, Bulgaria)\nA25 (\u0395\u039f67) S (Airport, Nea Moudania)\nNational Roads:\n\u0395\u039f2/\u039586 W (Edessa, Giannitsa)\n\u0395\u039f12/\u039579 \u039d (Serres, Drama)\n\u0395\u039f16, SW (Polygyros, Ouranopolis)\n\u0395\u039f65, \u039d (Kilkis, Doirani)\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nConsulates\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nThessaloniki is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nBattle of Thessalonica (fourteen events at various times)\nMacedonians (Greeks)\nMount Chortiatis, above the city\nLake Koroneia, 14 km from the city\nDelta of Axios National Park, west of the city\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\nMunicipality of Thessaloniki\nThessaloniki Port Authority\n\u039f\u0391\u03a3\u0398 \u2013 Organisation of Urban Transport of Thessaloniki (Greek & English)\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nYou in Thessaloniki on YouTube: Official promotional video for Thessaloniki by the Greek National Tourism Organization\nThessaloniki The Official website of the Greek National Tourism Organisation\n\n\n=== Cultural ===\nThessaloniki Concert Hall Organisation\nThessaloniki Film Festival\nThessaloniki Info & Links\nThessaloniki360 Virtual City Guide\nThessaloniki Tsimiski.gr street\n\n\n=== Events ===\nThessaloniki 2012 (celebrations for the 100 years of the incorporation of the city to Greece)\nThessaloniki 2014 (official website of Thessaloniki European Youth Capital 2014)\n\n\n=== Local guides ===\nGreek Local Yellow Pages of Thessaloniki",

        "wiki": "The Roman Forum of Thessaloniki is the ancient Roman-era forum (or Agora) of the city, located at the upper side of Aristotelous Square.\nIt is a large two-terraced forum featuring two-storey stoas, dug up by accident in the 1960s. The forum complex also boasts two Roman baths, one of which has been excavated while the other is buried underneath the city, and a small theater which was also used for gladiatorial games. Although the initial complex was not built in Roman times, it was largely refurbished in the 2nd century. It is believed that the forum and the theater continued to be used until at least the 6th century.The area of the forum was planned to be the site of the Thessaloniki Municipal Courthouse (in Greek: \u0394\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf), but after the ruins were discovered during the excavation, the project was scrapped. While the courthouse building was relocated, the intended name of the square (\"Courthouse/Dikastirion Square\") still survives in popular use. The official name of the square however is \"of Ancient Agora (Archaias Agoras)\".\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==",

          "This is a giant archeological dig right in the middle of Thessaloniki. It\u2019s quite incredible and it\u2019s quite clear the outline and main features of the Roman town that existed 2000 years ago. This is a must see in Thessaloniki.",
          "Only \u20ac2 with my passport for Senior Citizens Well worth it for the sights and museum . Well preserved place",
          "There is so much history in this city, that the Forum doesn't get much attention, but it is worth walking to (nothing is very far). You can view it from the sidewalk--you do not have to enter into it.",
          "It is amazing the amount of well preserved buildings that were left in this city. This site closes quite early (3 pm), though you can see most of it from the outside.",
          "A much more preserved site than I was expecting, plus yet another excellent museum with really interesting artifacts.",
          "Very special place. Nice to see. It is situated at the top of the Aristotelous square. Huge archeological site.",
          "Situated at the top of the square this place is well worth a visit. Only downside was that during our visit you could only look at it from the outside. Even then you can only be impressed by the look and size of the place. Hopefully it might open a bit more so you can wander",
          "This is a very special place, soaked in ancient history. It was the Roman market place of Thessaloniki and it is thought to be sited where an ancient Greek version had previously stood. The Roman forum dates from the 2nd century AD and is thought to have operated for about 400",
          "The place is above the aristetolous square. It is a huge archeological site but lacks markings or information landmarks to give it\u2019s importance. The city should give more emphasis to tourists. A good place to relax and take a walk with the locals.",
          "In the centre of the city this little square of history speaks of times past. Below the site visible from the street is a museum containing impressive relics from the excavations and telling the story of the city from before its metropolis status in 315BC., when it was formed by",
          "Definitely a must-visit. Students in the EU can get in free. Guess incentivise youngsters to learn more about history",
          "This is well worth visiting. It's a huge site with a really interesting museum. A huge amount of excavation has been carried out so there's lots to see",
          "Walking through the Roman Forum, one realizes how convoluted history is. Though Rome conquored Greece militarily, Greece conquored Rome culturally. Latin may have been useful in Italia, but Greek was the commercial language of the empire. It comes together in Thessaloniki's",
          "Above ground, the site can largely be seen from the street, though the best bit, the theatre, is best seen from inside the site. The underground museum is the best bit, with nicely presented storyboards in English and not too many exhibits. As usual in Greece great value.",
          "Here was the agora and then the Roman forum. There is not much left on the surface, but there is a very interesting not very large museum with exhibits. The surface is a reconstruction part of the ancient Greek theater for 200 people. It is worth seeing.",
          "Top tip: get the 15euro multiple museums ticket and you\u2019ll get access in here. Great place to visit to see the old agora, well worth a visit",
          "This stadium was home to many plays and music performances. It seems that throughout history these things have always been an important part of the culture.",
          "You can wander round this site and visit the excellent museum which is below ground and gives a facinating insight into this period in the cities history",
          "You can see how things were in the past. Understand that it 's a city under the city. But it's a shame that they aren't protected by the rain, snow, sun and weather. Although they are still standing!",

          "Who thought that the beautiful restored building looked great, should take a look in the museum underneath the excavation! Huge, beautiful displayed and greatly documented. A typical example of a modern museum. If you\u2019re interested in the classical history of the Roman Agora, go",

          "The Agora and Roman Forum are quite accessible being located in the city center. The place was the main important part of the city during the ancient times. If you want to feel the history under your foot, you have to pay a small fee and visit the place and the small museum as",
          "It is not overcrowded. It is centrally located and easy to find, and there are residential blocks around. It is easy to walk around the Eternal Residues and look up to see some people stretching their laundry.I was not very impressed, there was no guide, no placards, you could",
          "There's not too much left of the ancient Greek Agora and slightly less ancient Roman Forum, but it might still be worth a quick look as you head upwards to see Thessaloniki from the hills above. There were very few visitors when I was there in early Feb.",
          "It was laid out during the 3rd century AD, and it remained the main social center of the city until the 7th century AD.You have to visit it for 30 minutes",

          "Similar to the Agora in Athens, but on a much smaller scale and virtually no tourists. I spent almost two hours exploring the outdoors forum/agora as well as the fascinating museum located underneath the ruins. I had the whole place to myself. The well preserved theatre is quite",

          "I like the fact that in Greece you can find so many layers - modern buildings mixed with the remains of ancient times in vicinity. It gives a special charm to Thessaloniki as well as to the whole Greece.",

          "Much has been destroyed over the centuries but grab a brochure and you will quickly be able to visualize the structures that once sat at this cradle of civilization. The rebuilt Stoa of Attalos has a nice few exhibits. The Temple of Hephaistos is in the far corner up a slight",

          "You can find a lot of stuff to buy in Thessaloniki and you can stub on ancient Roman agora and forum. It is in center of the city! But, you should pay entrance fee for small and not too interesting museum (taking photos is prohibited). Actually you can't walk around freely which",
          "Its has an amazing and well preserved view but its bad that they charge you for something that is wide open at plane sight",
          "Much better than many larger museums, well organized so you walk by the exhibits along the timeline of the historic site accompanied by very clear and interesting descriptions and explanations",
          "A great chance to step back in time by visiting the Agora and Forum - make sure you wear sensible footwear as some of the floors are a trifle uneven. Take the opportunity to buy a \"multi-ticket\" for all the Thessaloniki attractions from the ticket office - if you visit three",
          "It looks interesting just from the road, don\u2019t need to go in, in my opinion. By visiting you are not seeing much and the museum was not so interesting. I was disappointed. Very small and not too much to see and mainly they were group of children very noisy and I could not enjoy",
          "You can't miss the forum if you are going down from Saint Dimitrios church. Even if you don't enter the Agora you won't be disappointed. The place is well preserved and will give you an idea of the Roman period in the city. As all things in the centre you can just pass them by",
          "The Greek Agora and Roman Forum give a very interesting peak into Thessalon\u00edki\u2019s history. The site is centrally located in what used to be the center of the city. Definitely worth checking out.",
          "Very nice museum beneath the ancient agora and Roman forum. Walk through the remainings of the Roman forum and learn about ancient history in the underground museum. Entrance fee is 2\u20ac per person only!",

          "Well conserved and peaceful area. It\u2019s evocative of the ancient period. Built 2nd Century on top of previous agora there are ruins which look like part of an amphitheatre around an open area with columns and underground areas.wide expanse in the middle of a bustling city .",
          "Strangely enough the street signs indicate it as the \"Roman Agora\". In Latin it is called a forum, in ancient Greek an Agora - but the concept is the same. Here is where everything public (elections, electoral speeches, public addresses, trials, ...) took place. Of course, in",
          "This site made my entire trip. Coming from a country where archeological findings/sites aren't much more that a few plates, cups or cutlery this place fulfilled all my desires and really let me envision the 2000+ years of history! The site is easily accessible and the staff is",
          "A trip to remember if you visit Tessaloniki- situated in the heart of the city close to important landmarks of the city such as the church of Agios Dimitrios and the central Aristotelous Square-you definitely need a guide to explain the history of the place or do your homework",
          "Thessaloniki is full of archaeological sites, aside from Rome I've never seen so many ancient ruins and buildings melded seamlessly into a modern city. My hotel overlooked the agora so it was great to have a view of this fantastic site.",
          "It all depends on your interests and past. If you love Agoras and Forums from ancient times -- you will love this one... If you have seen one too many of them -- e.g. during visits to (ancient ;-) Italy... this is just one more Agora and Forum, but a nice one -- nevertheless....",
          "The roman forum (or agora in Greek) was the center of the life of the ancient thessaloniki, it was almost lost in the last years and only in the last 50th years (thanks also to the EU contribution) the archeologists were able to give this site back to the population. The museum",
          "although in an excellent state of preservation, it seems curiously dull. The presentation, below street level at top of Aristotle Sq means that it seems rather unimportant and not much is done really to make it seem more significant",

          "Plenty to see and read. Worth buying a discount ticket to visit here - the white tower, and two museums. Amazing how much is still preserved. The air con wasn't working in the underground museum when we visited (we were advised of this prior to entering) but it wasn't too hot,",
          "In the middle of this historic city is a large Roman forum, surrounded by apartment blocks. A strange and fascinating site especially for those of us from the new world, unaccustomed to living with historic sites thousands of years old. This site is relatively well preserved and",
          "This is a really significant site as it is part of the city's long history. It is an open space and you can just view the whole thing from the street, you don't have to actually enter the site. The archaeological site was discovered accidentally in the 1960's, during",
          "Easy to see from the street, quite unexpected as it is surrounded by modern buildings. A real step back in time.",

          "This amphitheater (Roman Forum) is certainly worth a visit. It's a shame that the modern buildings are so close, however when inside you feel the history. You can see all the structures from the outside without paying the entrance fee. Still, I advice you to go inside (2 Euros)",
          "Unfortunately not open to tourists right now, but you can have a good look of this site just by walking around it , easy to find it, in the center and on the weay to Agios Dimitrios church...It is definately worth more attention from the state...",
          "This attraction has the disadvantage (for it anyway) of being very viewable from the streets that surround it on all four sides. I'm quite sure that there are some aspects you can't see unless you're up close but unless this is really your sort of thing I'd stick to the street",
          "there is a brochure in english, but just walking through with the imagination in tact is perhaps almost as valuable",
          "This site was closed on the Monday I visited but you are able to walk around the circuit and view it from street level. Sadly I couldn't get close ups of the mosaics or read the information boards but it looked an interesting excavation.",
          "Spoilt by the 3 columns built to represent the original columns. Fascinating to hear that there is a hidden city beneath Thessaloniki. Worth a look if you can hear the commentary of your tour guide",
          "Although there are bigger forums elsewhere in Greece and Italy, this Greek Agora and Roman Forum is still an interesting visit. I stumbled across these ruins when leaving the Church of Agios Dimitrios. They are worth a stop over when walking around Thessaloniki.",
          "The Greek Agora and Roman Forum is situate close to Church Agia Sofia. It is a nice place loaded with history. Nothing spectacular but worth to see it.",
          "On the way up to the Church of Agios Dimitrios one passes by the Agora, it's a nice site to see but not worth much time especially if you've been to Rome.",

          "In the middle of St. Demetrius and Egnatia Road a great monument of Greek and Roman history, even if only looked at from the fence surrounding it. A lot of caf\u00e9s and shops around it to make it easily accessible and easily visitable even for the bored from old stones and",
          "It is located between church of st. Dimitrios and Aristoteles square, so you cannot miss it. It is not a spectacular site, but you should at least take a look. It has some interesing pieces, especially the amphitheatre.",
          "It almost feels as if it is to be repopulated after construction is finished. Is unlike any other ruin you will visit in Greece.",
          "walking the city, you will sooner or later also pass by here. have a look from walking around, but there is little that will attract you. no neede to enter therefore.",
          "Perhaps I am getting jaded, but I've now been to a number of very nice ruin sites in Greece. If you are in Thessolaniki anyway, it's worth at least walking by even if you don't have time to go in, you can see much of it from the outside. It's not that big, about a large city",
          "We mostly viewed the area from the outside but it was worth to walk around and see the various ruins.",
          "It is amazing how this area has withstood the test of time, in consideration of the development around it. The suburb itself is a little dingy, quite a number of drunks walking around during the day, be mindful of your possessions.",
          "This was our first stop of the morning. My friend and I were literally the only people here aside from a few stray cats. You could sense that this marketplace was once full of life, but it actually felt like something was lacking here. Overall, I enjoyed the visit, and access to",
          "This is a large space located near the center of the modern city. There is not much left of the columns or walls.....other than a small stone theater at east end of the site. The subterranean vendor spaces are interesting.....as are the remains of the roman road. The subway",
          "Not the best the city has to offer. It makes for a nice stroll to go around it but no need to do a detour for it. If you come from the Aristotle plaza, it will be on the way to the St Dimitrius church.",
          "We had read that you can see better from outside the Agora so we did not go in. You can definitely see the entire place from the fence surrounding it. Interesting spot - can see many structures and part of structures that have been there for centuries. Very interesting!",
          "Another of the archeological places of Thessaloniki. When I was here, the place was closed, but the view from outside is very cool. And it's on walking distance from the waterfront",
          "It is a large forum, dug up by accident in the 1960s. The forum complex also boasts two Roman baths, one of which has been excavated while the other is buried underneath the city, and a small theater which was also used for gladiatorial games.",

          "We had just arrived from Athens and so many of the ruins there are under restoration and extremely crowded (at least when several cruise s hips are in town). These ruins stood out because they were not under restoration and hardly any people were there. The restoration is well",
          "Located rigth in the center of the city the forum is essy to find and visit. The sidewalks that surround it are the best place to view the whole site. There is also a cafe that has tables overlooking it.",
          "this is my most favorite attraction of Thessaloniki because you can really really imagnine how it must have been 2 thousand years ago. It has also an underground museum which is my favorite museum in the city. In the summer it also offers movie and classic movie events.",
          "It's a pity: it's closed to the tourists! You can look at it just from top to bottom.To understand it better, go to the Archeological museum.",
          "What to say when such things belong to the history of the city! Well preserved and shown! It worths to sit in the small ancient theatre!",
          "You cannot go wrong viewing around Thessaloniki or Greece for that matter!! The market in Thessaloniki is something I will never forget. The statues of naked men are even memorable. The stadium, the Acropolis, the food, the people! If you can afford it GO HERE!! Greece is",
          "The site is interesting from a historical and Biblical standpoint and knowing that possibly the apostle Paul might have been in the agora. The site is nice and well cared for. Staff is helpful but don't speak much English",
          "We are in Thessaloniki for the 2nd time and again this locality is closed! Unfortunatelly, all we could see is from the street, take the picsand that is all. At tleast this time locality is marked and has info signs so you know where you are.",
          "This is one of the best preserved ruins we've seen in Thessaloniki. It's in a big area where you can go down and walk around the ruins. You can then go to the museum where they have a lot of artifacts as well as chronological write-up on the sequence of events. I found this",
          "My kids loved being able to explore. The museum was fascinating and worth the trip. One of the museum workers engaged my kids in conversation and was explaining things to them. We felt very welcomed.",
          "Hours for this sight are limited, as it closes at 3 pm. The ruins and museum are interesting . It is definitely worth a visit. In the museum. Thessaloniki' s history is highlighted and the importance of the sight.",
          "This was less than a minute from my hotel ( the Olympia), so, naturally, it was the first place I visited. Unfortunately, as many others have said, it was closed off, but walking around gave me a good idea of how impressive this agora and forum must have been in its heyday.",
          "For those interested in Roman heritage, this is a must-see stop. It is a well presevred fine example of what an administrative square in an Eastern Roman province looked like. Do not miss the museum underground, it is very informative. The agora is within a walking distance from",
          "Huge and old ruins in middle of city, surrounding by buildings and hotels, but so beautiful place! The museum under the ground was full of information and interesting. Do not miss this place for sure, it was great experience in Thessaloniki.",
          "It was just next to our hotel (Orestias Kastorias) so we wanted to visit these ruins. However we could not enter the site as it was closed - I think we saw some kind of information plate next to the entrance booth but ridiculously access to this plate was also closed so how on",
          "We are staying at a hotel straight across the road from these ruins and from the top floor the view of the agora and theatre are amazing. I'm sure for all those locals that live in the surrounding apartments that this is not much to look at but for my eyes that just can't",
          "Overall impression of the sites in Thessaloniki is that they are not well cared for. There is such a wealth of remains here but they are marred by graffiti and rubbish. The Greeks are missing a trick here by failing to exploit their wonderful archaeology in a tourist friendly",
          "Gorgeous and huge site that is clearly visible as you move downwards from the Kastro (city fortifications). It is nicely lit at night. Many places to walk around and you can see most of the site from outside. Which was what I did, as I found it, unfortunately, closed off in",
          "Just as interesting as all the ruins in Thessaloniki! Definetely advise to go downstairs and visit all the area. Only sad thing is the huge amount of modern buildings all around.",
          "With the exception of the Theater; that is very well preserved; the rest of the ruins are incomplete and scattered in a vast area. This does not lower in any way the value and richness of this great representation of the Greek Civilization. The forum is surrounded by modern",
          "Greek and Roman agora. Really worths a visit... the underground museum is also worth visiting. Too bad its only 1/3 of the ancient agora as the rest is bellow modern apartment blocks. Let's hope one day we will be able to fully excavate the city...",

          "Pretty well preserved site in the middle of modern big city. Looks good by day, fabulous by night. I don't know if you can enter, it was all closed by the time we get there, but I understood that there are shows there from time to time. Nice idea from the Greek authorities. It",
          "Very nice preserved considering the fact that is surrounded by apartment blocks all around. We couln't get in when we got there (I don't know if it's closed for public visits all the time). I would recomend this to everyone considering that Paul might have preached in here...",
          "An ancient site surrounded by modern buildings and people going about their everyday business. It is great that the city that decided to preserve this site. Inspiring.",
          "It's funny/odd to see these remnants of ancient civilization surrounded by the ugly high-rise apartment buildings that cover much of the center of Thessaloniki. This is certainly not the place to gain much appreciation of the achievements of the ancient Greeks and Romans, but",
          "Nothing special. Just old ruins visible from the street. We didn't even buy a ticket to go inside. There are more interesting places to see in Thessaloniki.",
          "I was suprised that it was uncovered and you could see really everything. Made a lot of great pictures and got a lot of infos from the guide. Worths visit.",
          "There's a full city block that Thessaloniki decided to preserve when they rediscovered these remains--well done. Unfortunately, the remains aren't the best example and it requires a lot of imagination. Only one column remained intact. At the time that I visited, there was a nice",
          "Nice to see the perimeter and JUST IMAGINE what could it be at the time of Romans. It is a sort of football field with just a two or three columns near a corner of the peristyle. Also for the rest of the theater there is nothing special to say. We should be happy that such ruins",
          "This is an amazing place and the museum under the market square is well set out with so much information. They also have exhibitions in the area and were setting up photographs when we visited in early May.",
          "Enjoy your walk at Agora, it's just on the north of Aristotelous Square, you will like the view and there are also quite a few hip bars and taverns you will enjoy (and quite cheap too!). A really good alternative walk away from the bustling crowds of the sea front.",

          "The best thing about the Agora, is that you can go around all four sides, if you don't want to go inside. The size of the Agora itself and the surrounding buildings is quite illustrative of Roman opulence.",
          "You can understand the spirit of evolution by going to this place. It is located in the city center, in a city of 2013. However, you can undersstand th way that ancient people used to live. Houses, archtitecture and roads designed for their needs... a trip to ancient history.",
          "This museum is not only about the history of the Agora and the Roman period of time but it refers to all the history of Thessaloniki during the Roman Period, such as the Arch of Galerius and many others monuments of Thessaloniki! The only diasadvantage of this museum is that the",

          "The remains above the ground are not really impressive and can as well be viewed from the street, but the underground museum is definitely worth a visit.",

          "Wonderful to see so much work going on to try and restore what was here all those centuries ago.Easy to see and easy to get to by foot. .therenis no hype around it, just a simple excavation but you can see how it is foing to look.",
          "The agora does not have any buildings above ground that are preserved. However, they do have some baths at one corner that are very interesting and you can get an idea of the complexity of the architecture while walking around the sidewalks that border the agora. Worth a visit.",
          "It's an archeologic place like others. I like to visit ancient caves and streets, but pay 3 Euro for visit inside is to much because there are very poor explation, and you can walk arround to see almost every place.",

        "wiki": "The Museum of Byzantine Culture (Greek: \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd) is a museum in Thessaloniki, Central Macedonia, Greece, which opened in 1994.\n\n\n== History ==\nTo design the museum, a nationwide architectural competition was announced in 1977. The competition was ultimately won by the entry of Kyriakos Krokos. Construction of the building began in March 1989, and was completed in October 1993. Antiquities from the Byzantine & Christian Museum in Athens were transferred in June 1994, some of them being displayed in the museum's inaugural exhibition, \"Byzantine Treasures of Thessaloniki: The Return Journey\". The museum finally opened on 11 September 1994.\n\n\n== Purpose of the museum ==\n\nArticle 4, Goals:\n\nThe museum is a scientific institution, open to the public, of a broader cultural and educational nature, aims to collect, preserve, protect, conserve, exhibit and study the works and objects of the early Christian, Byzantine, medieval in general and post-Byzantine periods, mainly from the geographical area of Macedonia and the excavation material of the territorial scope of the 9th Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities, with which it is in close collaboration. The Museum of Byzantine Culture also works as appropriate with the other Ephorates, when this is necessary for the enrichment and fuller, better and more scientifically informed presentation of its reports. in the framework of the realization of its aims, the Museum of Byzantine Culture is addressed to the general public, encourages through appropriate activities the increase of the number of visitors, favors the entertaining and educational contact of the public with its collections and asserts a scientifically proven and internationally scholarly way of their museum presentation.\nLater, its structure and responsibilities are modified after the publication of the Decree 191 (Organization of the Ministry of Culture, Government Gazette 146 / A / 13.6.2003), according to the Article 56. The responsibilities are described in detail as follows: \"...issues of acquisition, acceptance, storage, maintenance, recording, documentation, research, study, publication and display and promotion to the public of objects of the early Christian, Byzantine, medieval in general and post-Byzantine periods in northern Greece and of the modern era with subjects related to the Byzantine and Christian art\".\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nOpening in 1994, the museum currently has 11 (as of 2017) permanent exhibitions. The first, \"Early Christian Churches\", focuses on the design and decoration of churches in early centuries of Christianity. \"Early Christian Cities and Dwellings\", presents aspects of economic life, domestic handicrafts, houses, and food and clothing of early Christians, and finally, \"From the Elysian Fields to the Christian Paradise\" focuses on cemeteries of early Christians, jewellery, sepulchral architecture and painting, cult customs, and clay and glass objects recovered from excavated graves. Beginning in 1998, the museum has run educational programmes for schoolchildren.The exhibition in detail:\n\n\n=== Room 1: The Early Christian Church ===\nHere, finds from the Protobyzantin period (4th to 7th century) are exhibited. After the founding of the Byzantine Empire by Constantine the Great (330 AD) Christianity soon became a state religion. Since 1997 artifacts of the early Christian Church and architectural finds have been shown in connection with the church buildings of the time, while wealthy churches were endowed with marble or mosaic floors and marble wall claddings, poorer churches were laid out with mosaic floors and frescoed walls.\n\n\n=== Room 2: Early Christian City and Dwelling ===\nSince 1998, objects of everyday life such as pottery, glass vessels, looms etc. have been shown here. The reception hall of a rich household in Thessaloniki was imitated; the role of the city in private and public life is to be emphasized.\n\n\n=== Room 3: From the Elysian Fields to the Christian Paradise ===\nThe exhibition refers to the European Union-sponsored program \"The Transformation of the Roman World in the Period from 400 to 900 AD\". The exhibits mainly consist of graves, gravestone inscriptions, and tomb paintings. Thus, the transformation of burial rites and burial decorations since late antiquity is displayed. The exhibition was opened in 1997.\n\n\n=== Room 4: From Iconoclasm to the Splendor of the Macedonian and Komnenian Dynasties ===\nSince 2000, the period from the 8th to the 12th century has been dealt with in Room 4. This so-called middle Byzantine period was regarded as a period of Byzantine humanism and Greek education. Shown are items of everyday life such as coins, pottery, lead seals and clothing.\n\n\n=== Room 5: The Dynasties of Byzyntine Emporers ===\nHere the epoch of the Byzantine rulers from the time of Heraclius (610-641) to the fall of Constantinople in 1453 is considered. Since the year 2000, coins and seals from this time have been seen here.\n\n\n=== Room 6: The Byzantine Castle ===\nThe Byzantine castles were built in strategically important locations. In order to protect their inhabitants and people from the surrounding area, even during a long period of a siege in war time, they had all the necessary facilities of a city. The archaeological finds displayed are from different castles of Macedonia. A video informs the visitor about the castles of Macedonia and Thrace. The exhibition in room 6 was opened in 2000.\n\n\n=== Room 7: The Twilight of Byzantium (1204-1453) ===\nThe late Byzantine period is noticed by his artists and their works of art. Especially the Slavic neighbors of Greece and the monastic republic of Athos are treated. Since 2002 the works of art have been exhibited.\n\n\n=== Room 8: Dori Papastratos Collection ===\nThe collection was donated to the museum in 1994. In addition to wooden and copper printing plates, more than 200 prints from the 18th to the 19th century can be seen. Some prints were taken from the permanent exhibition of the museum and are exhibited in other museums, abroad and within Greece.\n\n\n=== Room 9: The Demetrios Economopoulos Collection ===\nSince 2001, some of the 1460 artefacts that Mr. Oikonopoulos has left to the museum are exhibited. The collection contains pieces from prehistoric times up to the 19th century, with Byzantine and post-Byzantine art predominant. Mainly, icons from the 14th century to the 19th century are shown.\n\n\n=== Room 10: \"Byzantium after Byzantium\": The Byzantine Legacy in the Years after the Fall ===\nIt was only in 2004 that Room 10 was opened to the public in its present form. Here the Byzantine legacy after the conquest of the Ottoman empire is illuminated. The works depicted illustrate various styles that were cultivated under the rule of the Venetians and the Ottomans. Exhibited are icons, prints, embroidery, books, silver and gold forging.\n\n\n=== Room 11: Discovering the Past ===\nThe last room of the permanent exhibition opened in 2004. He documents the stations from the excavation of an object to its exhibition in the museum. The excavation, documentation, study and conservation phases are brought to the visitor by means of archaeological material and digital representation.\n\n\n=== Temporary exhibition ===\nSince the opening of the museum, temporary exhibitions have been held, most of which touch on the subject of \"Byzantium\". Among other things, there were presentations of religious themes, daily life and Byzantine treasures in the monastic republic of Athos..In addition, the exhibits of other museums are presented and thematic related hiking exhibitions are housed.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe collection of the museum contains works from the 2nd to the 20th century. They originate mainly from collections, legacies, seizures, donations or were procured with private or state aid. Most of the collection consists of coins, seals and smaller artifacts, followed by sculptures and icons. They come from Thessaloniki and Macedonia, from churches, private houses and cemeteries.\nThe works of iconic paintings from the 16th and 17th centuries are of high artistic value. But also the rare textiles of the early Byzantine period (loans from the Benaki Museum), or tomb-works and mosaics are of particular importance. Selected artifacts are temporarily handed over to other museums at home and abroad as hiking exhibitions.\nThe collection includes:\n\n\n=== Books and manuscripts ===\nThe collection includes 27 Greek books and manuscripts. The oldest are from the early Christian period; most were written on parchment. Of particular interest are some pages of the Qur\u2018an and an Ottoman manuscript.\n\n\n=== Wooden icons ===\nMore than 1,000 individual works comprise the storage space of the museum; including the 442 icons that were sent to Athens during the First World War. In 1987, the number of icons was considerably increased by accessing 400 icons from the estate of Mr. Oikonopuolos. The collection is constantly being extended, not least by private donations and legacies. The museum houses icons from the 12th century to the 20th century and comes from the areas where Greeks lived under Venetian or Ottoman rule. The works are of different origin, they come from islands, from Northern Greece or Constantinople.\n\n\n=== Miniature ===\nOver 7,000 objects of this group were found in Thessaloniki and further Macedonia. Almost all were discovered in organized excavations; only a few come from donations or were confiscated. They date from the late Roman period, from the Byzantine period to the time of Ottoman rule. Jewelry from gold, silver, glass and bone are represented as well as ecclesiastical objects. Furthermore, tools made of different materials are kept.\n\n\n=== Fabrics ===\nThe existing textiles are from the 4th century to the 19th century and thus represent the entire Byzantine and post-Byzantine era. The woolen and linen tunics from Egypt are permanent loans of the Benaki Museum from Athens.\n\n\n=== Coins ===\nThe approximately 30,000 coins of the museum were discovered in Thessaloniki and further Macedonia. They date from the late Roman period to modern times. The predominant part are bronze coins. Few are made of silver, some more are of gold. In addition to individual finds, the coins mainly come from larger hoards, which were probably created by their owners for emergency periods.\n\n\n=== Seals ===\n100 seals are in the possession of the Museum of Byzantine Culture. They were once used to verify documents. They are considered important historical sources to understand the administrative Byzantine system and the church hierarchy. The most important seals are of Tiberius II (698-705), Constantine VII (913-959), the patriarchs Photios (858-886) and Michael Keroularios (1043-1059).\n\n\n=== Mosaics ===\nThe collection includes 70 mosaics that adorn the walls and floors of churches, private houses and public buildings. Most of them are from the excavation of Thessaloniki from the 4th to the 7th century. During this period, Thessaloniki was the center of mosaic art in the region. The mosaics are made of different materials. In addition to stones, marble and glass, leaf gold was also used. They depicted saints, animals, plants and geometrical shapes.\n\n\n=== Wall paintings ===\nAbout 200 wall paintings from the 3rd to the 20th century are owned by the museum. Among them are the most beautiful tomb paintings of Greece. The most popular motifs from the Greek and Roman epoch are garlands, wreaths and ribbons. Wall paintings can be found in almost all rooms of the permanent exhibition.\n\n\n=== Sculptures ===\nThe approx. 2,000 sculptures are from the period from the 2nd / 3rd century to the 17th century. 120 sculptures are permanently exhibited in the museum. Almost all were found in Thessaloniki and the surrounding area; most of them are architectural in nature, such as capitals in the Ionic and Corinthian style. Few sculptures are preserved from the period from the 7th to the 9th century, the so-called \"dark times\". From the 9th to the 12th century, the artists' activities increased significantly. From this time came marble images with ecclesiastical motifs. The few, discovered sculptures from the late Byzantine period point to the decline of the empire, which fell to the Franks in 1204 and to the Ottomans in 1453.\n\n\n=== Latest projects ===\nThey are predominantly modern paintings by Greek artists, inspired by the early Christian, Byzantine spirit. In addition to oil paintings are prints and abstract paintings. About 50 works are copies of ancient tomb paintings, mosaics and sculptures.\n\n\n=== Early printed books ===\nThe collection of the museum consists of 22 books, mostly from the 19th and 20th century. The works are written in different languages and deal with Christian themes. The bindings of some books are valuable and elaborate. In addition to velvety envelopes one finds silver-framed covers, which depict Christian scenes or the crucifix.\n\n\n== Laboratories and workshops ==\n\nThe museum has seven different laboratories and workshops. They are housed on 2750 m\u00b2 of space, each department has a fireproof storage room and a suction system for the indoor air. Like the entire museum, the workshops are air-conditioned; Temperature and humidity are kept constant, the fresh air (supplied from outside the museum) is filtered.\nThey workshops are well equipped; modern and scientifically internationally recognized methods of diagnosis and preservation are applied. Within the framework of European programs they cooperate with national and international research centers. Students from Greece and abroad can complete their internships in the workshops.\nThe Workshops in detail:\n\n\n=== Conservation Workshop of Icons ===\nThe oldest workshop of the museum started work in 1993. It consists of an X-ray room, diagnostics, a room for preservation and a carpentry. The X-ray machine is also used by other departments, the radiation exposure of employees is recorded for health reasons. The conventional radiographs are digitized and stored on DVD's. Details of the surface of an object are examined with the electron microscope and displayed on a screen. Depending on requirements, the findings will continue to be examined under ultraviolet light or by infrared light. Occasionally, an underlying painting is discovered beneath the visible surface of an icon. In some cases, the older painting is brought to light again. Two conditions have to be fulfilled: the underlying painting must be in good condition and it should be much older than the picture above it. With the utmost care, the visible image is conserved, so after completion of the restoration both paintings are preserved, the one visible first and the one below. Due to the immense effort, it takes months until an experienced restorer completes the work, these works are performed quite rarely.\nIn addition to these non-destructive methods, destructive investigations are also used; In the process, tiny samples are taken and examined. Since the laboratory is not equipped for these examinations, they are carried out in the departments of the Universities of Thessaloniki or Athens. This lab, like some of the other laboratories, has chemicals to remove unwanted layers. The chemicals are stored in special cabinets, which may suck escaped gases before opening the cabinets.\nIn the workshop icons, woodcuts, painted textiles, leather and wood are processed. All work steps are documented. The first work of the conservators in 1994 was the project \"Byzantine treasures of Thessaloniki, the return\". There are cooperations with many national and international institutions. In addition to Greek monasteries and other institutions, these include the National Museum of Medieval Art of Korytsa (Albania) and the National Gallery of Arts of Sofia (Bulgaria).\n\n\n=== Conservation Workshop of Paper ===\n\nOriginally preserved in this workshop documents for the exhibition \"Treasures of Mount Athos\", which took place in 1997 in the rooms of the museum. Since then, the equipment has been adapted to the increased demands on the processing and preservation of the exhibits. Since the year 2000, the specialized conservators have been working in a separate room, taking care of the diagnosis, documentation and preservation of fonts made of paper or parchment. While parchment and hand-made papers age quite slowly, the preservation of books printed on industrially produced paper is more laborious. The proportion of acids makes them easier to decompose.\nParts of the staff are trained in paleography and can thus decipher the ancient scriptures.\nThe workshop does not just take care of the museum's collections. She is an advisor and works for the Institute of Byzantine and Post-Byzantine Studies in Venice, the city of Kozani and the monasteries of Athos. During 2007 and 2008, the lab collaborated with the Camberwell College of Arts of the University of the Arts London.\nGuided tours are available in conjunction with the museum's educational program. There will also be workshops on bookbinding, papermaking and engraving.\n\n\n=== Conservation Workshop of Ceramic, Glass and Small Finds ===\nSince 1994 the workshop works. Next to the work area there is a storage room and an area used for cleaning the excavated material. After the cleaning process, the finds are sorted. All color matched parts, as well as all related forms (handles, floors, etc.) are grouped together. Then they are examined for their composition and condition. As an orientation for the composition of the items serve drawings of all known forms of clay and glass vessels. The individual parts are glued together and dried in a special oven.\nBoth old and modern methods are used for repair and conservation.\nIn addition to guided tours, there are also workshops dedicated to the production of pottery.\n\n\n=== Conservation Workshop of Metals ===\nCoins and other metal finds are mechanically and chemically cleaned here. If necessary, heavy soiling is removed with a sandblaster, for finer work dental tools are used. As in some other workshops too, a special cabinet is for storing acids and other chemicals. available. Before opening these cabinets any escaped gases are sucked off. In addition to coins, smaller finds made of other materials, such as glass or bone, are processed.\n\n\n=== Conservation Workshop of Mosaics ===\nSince 1995 about 600 mosaics have been conserved. Most of them are in the museum's exhibition, and the curators are responsible for their inspection and repair. Guided tours for students of archeology and students who are especially interested in conservation are offered in conjunction with the museum's educational program.\n\n\n=== Conservation Workshop of Stone ===\n\nBesides the sculptures and other stone finds of the museum, the staff also deal with the ancient finds of other regions of Greece. Since 1994, mostly marble artefacts have been worked up and preserved in a professional manner. As in the other workshops, all work steps are recorded, photographed and documented.\n\n\n=== Conservation Workshop of Mural Paintings ===\nThe murals of the museum come from churches and other buildings from Thessaloniki and the surrounding area. The museum's collection consists of around 200 pieces, dating from the early Christian period (4th to 7th centuries), through the post-Byzantine period to the modern era (19th and 20th centuries). Most of the paintings were executed as Frescoes, from the post-Byzantine period also as Secco.\nThe detached murals are applied to transportable media so that they can be displayed in museums. Before they are examined microscopically and technically. This analyzes the composition of the material on which the painting was applied. Fractions of a painting are put together by the restorer in the best possible way and stuck with the painted side on a fabric, which in turn lies on a flat surface. A frame of appropriate size is made and placed around the fragments, then the frame is filled with fiberglass. The fragments are enclosed from the fiberglass. After drying, the fabric is peeled off and the adhesive removed from the resulting work.\n\n\n== Storerooms ==\nApproximately 1200 m\u00b2 of the building is used as storage space. Industrial warehouses served as a model. Sculptures are stored on pallets, which can be moved by machines. Icons and mosaics in horizontal, sliding frames. An unconventional method is used for storing amphorae. After finding a Byzantine ship, it was found that amphorae could be stacked in a space-saving manner without damaging the clay vessels.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2005, the museum was awarded the Council of Europe's Museum Prize\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the Museum in English\nOfficial website of the Museum\nHellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism\nMuseums of Macedonia\nwww.hri.org",

          "As a New Yorker, I have access to world class museums. I was blown away by the Byzantine Museum. There are about eleven rooms painstakingly laid out with info in Greek and English. The rooms are filled with archeological finds and art work. We saw some lovely mosaics as well.",
          "This is a wonderfully laid out museum containing a large variety of Byzantine artefacts. Its permanent exhibition is presented over about 11 rooms in this specifically designed, easy to navigate, atmospheric yet modern building. There are some truly beautiful icons and mosaics",

          "Well presented museum with audio shows and many displays of the history of the area. Very interesting.",
          "I'm sure it's not easy to condense over 1,000 years of glorious history into 11 rooms of display. Yet, this museum does a wonderful job and it is a pleasure to spend some hours in it. Our city guide highly recommended a visit and we were not disappointed.",
          "Quite a few stuff to look at but fell below our expectations. Maybe it was just too hyped up. If you got the time after visiting the other places, can consider this.",
          "I was underwhelmed by the Museum of Byzantine Culture. It felt sparse and repetitive. Too bad, as I was looking forward to seeing more Byzantine art and history in Thessaloniki.",
          "We really enjoyed spending 2 hours in this museum. Great set up and easy guidance. Well functioning air conditioning ( which did not work in the museum of contemporary art)",
          "The museum is very well organised, the collection has a lot of great pieces and I have to say it has impressed me. If you are a history fan, must see.",
          "Very well laid out modern museum. There are very clear explanations of the history of Byzantium, which covers a period from about 330AD to about 1450. Lots of information is provided in English. The exhibits are very interesting and you never feel overwhelmed.",
          "A beautifully presented museum with brief and interesting boards in English. It is even worth going to appreciate the building. A model museum for others to follow. The contents range over the architectural, social and religious. If you are not into icons, there is a vast amount",
          "Mega interesting museum. It tells the story of Byzantium. There are 11 halls with exhibits. The museum is quite rich and you have to spend at least an hour in it.",
          "A \u20ac15 pass will give you access to this great museum, together with the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki and the White Tower.",
          "It is THE must visit place in the Thessaloniki....all Byzantine history within a museum, do not skip it.",
          "Another weill laid out museum with information in English and seats to rest while you walk round. There is also and excellent moderately priced restaurant to each and drink after your tour",

          "I loved this museum. The imagery is beautiful and an incredible depiction of early Christian life and worship. The attention to detail was great. I especially loved that even the box with the fire extinguisher in it had a little mosaic extinguisher on it. I mean adorable. We",
          "Takes you through the ages of Byzantine art - from mosaics glitering with gold and stylised figures, through the no-human-image years, back to the Icon paintings. Multiple St Stephens, or St Georges or St Johns abound, along with endless Madonna and child - though at least one",
          "Considered one of the best museums in Greece, it's easy to spend a couple of hours here. There are murals, mosaics, icons, whole early Christian tombs as well as objects of everyday use throughout the whole Byzantine period. It's beautifully displayed in a very modern setting",
          "Beautiful museum with Byzantine artefacts in an interesting building that creates a unique atmosphere.",
          "I visited this attraction on a cold, rainy day. Entrance fee is 8 Euros per person.Credit cards are accepted as mode of payments. There are 11 rooms full of beautiful exhibits, showcasing the rise and fall of the Byzantine Kingdoms and Culture. Explanations regarding the",
          "The museum gives a good overview of Byzantine history. The museum opened in 1994 but still has a modern and up to date feel. The items are exhibited with great care and the lighting is very good. We spent 2 hours wandering through the 11 rooms.",
          "Situated next to the archeological museum. A great overview regarding the Byzantine history en finally the decline and submission by the Ottoman empire. Greatly displayed and for us tourists also in English.",
          "Very well organised and the exhibits well lit with explanations in English too. What they get top marks for are the explanations for the blind and many items are laid out for them to touch.",
          "The collection is rather sparse. On the good side we were the only patrons there. Call in advance to ensure it\u2019s open.",
          "This is one of the better museums in Greece, very informative for those that know about Byzantium, and quite accessible and inviting for those that know nothing about it. On top of the exhibits, the museum\u2019s architecture is fascinating and makes a very nice subject for",

          "Love museums that invest in the everyday life of the era they represent and this one does it perfectly. Also the building itself is amazing. Strongly suggest it, plus you can combine it with the archeological museum that's right next to it",
          "Fantastic museum, but I wish I had known that the closing time during winter is 4pm. The exhibitions are elaborate and the explanations in English abundant. A reason to return!",
          "I have longed to see a Byzantine Museum and this was a great chance to see things that cannot be found anywhere\u2019s else. There is also a section on post-Byzantine art that shows how the Orthodox Church was influenced.",
          "A few days ago I visited the Museum of Byzantine Culture of Thessaloniki, which is a museum of a special character. The museum exhibits objects from the Early Byzantine to the Post Byzantine period. It is a well-organized museum that exhibits were organized according to modern",
          "I want to make a critique of the Museum of Byzantine culture in Thessaloniki. I visited the museum in October. The museum of Byzantine civilization exhibits in chronological periods the Byzantine culture of Greece in an extraordinary way. Initially, the museum has eleven halls",
          "We visited the museum for a second time and we found it very well organised and very analytical to those who want to study this reriod of the greek history.",
          "It is a very small museum with very few interesting pieces unless you are interested in orthodox religious paintings. There are many much more interesting Byzantine museums in northern Greece.",
          "This is the crown jewel of Thessaloniki museums, even if only by a few notches over the city's Archaeological Museum. In its long history, Thessaloniki has been a Byzantine city more than anything else (over 1,000 years). In conjunction with visits to the city's many Byzantine",
          "The museum if very good with a nice atmosphere and good exhibits a bit small compared to other European museums but it's pretty interesting without being boring or tiring you. You need about one and half to two hours to see it and then you can go for a walk in the center which",
          "Great museum, good infrastructure, interesting exhibits which add to the interesting history of the city of Thessaloniki",
          "Such a marvellous museum - spacious and not crowded with extremely helpful staff. One of the best museums I have visited. Loved it.",
          "Our tour group visited in the evening and it was very quiet. This very modern museum has excellent English labeling. It is well-organized and explains the history, art work, and artifacts very well to the traveler unfamiliar with this epoch.",
          "Wonderful early Christian & Byzantine relics well displayed. Helped provide a context for the remainder of our trip through northern Greece, Albania, & Macedonia. Well worth the time.",
          "One of the most important museums in the city. You will find there great treasures. Also a beautiful place in the center of the city.",
          "Excellent exhibits show cultural and artistic changes in the region as a function of time period. Not too many people. Great building layout. Beautifully done.",
          "for those who love byzantine culture and icons this is a must to visit place . it is full with ancient items eg icons and mosaic a three floor building it take 1 hour maximum to see everything. vey nice",
          "This museum is an absolute must see if visiting Thessaloniki. It\u2019s design, both internally and externally, are just wonderful. The content is so comprehensive that a visit of less than two hours is impossible.",
          "Byzantine art/culture isn't my cup of tea, so I won't say anything about the actual exhibit, except that a typical visit will take around 2-3 hours. Friends of mine have claimed that the museum is nice ;-) The building itself is very nice in terms of architecture and the",
          "It's by far the best museum in Thessaloniki. If you have very little time then only go here and take a nice break in the very good museum cafe!",

          "this museum is definitely a must see when visiting thessaloniki. it is wonderfully organized, curated, the building itself reminiscent of byzantine architecture with red bricks...however, i have to strongly point out that the focus is only on byzantine period in greece, while",
          "One of the most interesting museums in Thesaloniki. It is very well organised museums which provide both historic view Greek history during Byzantine Empire as well as large number of archaeological and art exhibits form this period. It is organised with well described",
          "There are some excellent exhibitions and pieces on display here, it's definitely a must-see for anyone visiting Thessaloniki, particularly if you have the combined museum ticket. The only downside is the attendants on guard in the exhibition rooms who clearly have no idea of",
          "The displays were very interesting and diverse. We spent over an hour there, just absorbing everything. It definitely should be on your must see list.",
          "There is a lot to see here in this large multilevel museum. A discount is only given to holders of EU passports so I had to pay full price. Each room had 1-2 security staff watching us. After a while this becomes uncomfortable and I had to consciously try to shut them out to be",
          "The new and modern museum is absolutely packed with incredible artefacts, icons and relics. It\u2019s brilliantly laid out, really great explanatory notes everywhere and cleverly designed to lead you through the different ages of the Byzantine period. My son and I loved this museum",
          "Well organized and presented, a journey through history illuminated with objects from the obscure to the magnificent. The restaurant is also lovely.",
          "This is definitely the most interesting museum in town. All the history of christianity in one building.If you are interested in this and the byzantine era this museum with answer all your expectations",
          "Air Conditioned! So felt great! Very clean. Very well done. Amazing artifacts arranged in a way that gave you a good feel of this era in a good chronological layout. Teenagers who like history loved it and got good pictures because everything wasn't behind glass.",
          "The Museum was one of our \"must stop\" places on our recent visit and we weren't disappointed - there were lots of well constructed exhibits with easy to understand explanations (without too much explanation, which can often be the case!) and we felt we were really able to get",
          "Identical as any other Byzantine museum; icons status etc but if you like those kind of religious history you will enjoy it. For me it was ok. Sometimes interesting.",
          "I spent a couple hours here. The greatest disappointment was that the bookstore was closed due to staffing issues. Really interesting exhibits as you wind your way up the building. They tell the history of Byzantium and the area. Final exhibits on religious icons were",
          "Really enjoyed our visit here, one of the best museums i have visited. Well presented exhibits and tells a story throughout. If you visit one museum in Thessaloniki make it this one. The staff were friendly and the man in the ticket office was very helpful. At the end the cafe",
          "Visited on a week day afternoon and the museum was virtually empty. The layout follows the Byzantine era in chronological order with interesting and informative displays. Frustratingly the shop was not open so we were unable to buy a book on the period.",
          "Very good thoughful design of museum building, and moreover of the expositions. It is not overcrowded with exhibits, the have proper lighting, and good amount of explanations. Some are very impressive, more so in total. The dates of icon paintings seem questionable, though",
          "The layout and curation of the museum lend a hand in helping the visitor to understand Byzantium and its place in history, artistically, religiously and socially as well as geographically. Give yourself a good hour at least to stroll through.",
          "I was fortunate to visit this museum with a very professional guide. I don't know if the museum offers guided tours, but if it does it may be helpful in order to pick the cherries from this rich collection. It spans the period from the 4th to the 15th century. Signage is very",
          "This is a must in Thessaloniki visit.Not only is a great designed group of building that has a general architectural history with the city, but is also an experience for the Byzantine history ! All of our family was enthusiastic after this visit.Small garden cafe and restaurant",
          "Visited this beautiful museum on a trip to Thessaloniki, it is really fascinating. In the winter months it closes at 16.00 so an early start is advised but well worth the effort. We didn\u2019t bring the teenagers as they have limited museum capacity.",
          "Thessaloniki was the 2nd in rank city of the byzantine empire and this is Thessaloniki's most important museum!",
          "I enjoy visiting museums. This one has an angle which revealed some previously misunderstood aspects of Greek-Roman interactions from the perspective of Eastern Christianity. The importance of Macedonian region to the history of Europe does not often feature in",
          "This the most impressive museum of Thessaloniki with an anormous collection of very valuable pieces of art. We loved this place most of all the historic sites in the city.",
          "Great place to visit. We went on a weekday (Wednesday) and it was virtually empty. The history of Thessaloniki laid out in chronological order. My only complaint was that the museum shop didn't have any guides in English.",
          "One realizes the centrality of Thessaloniki to the history of today's Greece and beyond. It makes the city one of Europe's best kept tourism secrets.",
          "This place is a must visit.It contains all the history of Thessaloniki since before christ till the Otoman era.I love it",
          "This is one of the most sorted and comprehensive museums I have ever been to ! Loved the peaceful and clean artefacts\u2019 display. Thank You !!",
          "Thessaloniki was the second most important city of the byzantine empire. Despite the catastrophe of the 20th century the feeling of the significance of the city is seen everywhere in the city center. The museum provides a trip back in time to visitor.",
          "I visited this museum as part of a group tour in September. We spent 2 hours there and you need at least that much time to see everything properly. The museum boasts a wonderful collection and it's easily laid out. There aren't really any stairs to worry about. It's all ramps",
          "We were excited about this museum but it was the one place in Greece where we were confronted with rude staff. Reception staff spoke no English and when we lined up at the bag check ignored us for ages. When we finally managed to get somebody's attention they told us to just",
          "Beautiful building with outstanding collection. It brings to life what it was like during this period and how similar people are even now. It showed make up and hair braided styles similar to now ! It uses grave archeology to show artefacts that people had . There were",
          "Beautiful building with a diverse collection of Byzantine art. The place was spacious. You need at least a couple of hours to see everything. You may buy a 15 Euro ticket that lasts for three days and gives you entry into the Archeological museum and The White tower.",
          "A not so hidden jewl of the town, the museum consist of exhibits from the byzantine era to modern times. Weather you are religious or not, it's worth visiting. It may not be as popular as other points of interest, but there was no queue that you can enjoy your visit. It's",
          "Another must see museum in Thessaloniki. Great space, impressive rooms and lots of information about the times between 300 and 1400 ac Recommend the visit, first go to the archeological museum then come here. There is a continuity. There is also a combined ticket offered for",
          "The museum has been relatively recently opened and has a small but excellent collection of Byzantine artifacts. The later icons (post-15th century), while good, are perhaps less interesting than the tombs from the 5th and 6th centuries, and the salvaged architectural materials,",
          "Very interesting artefacts, excellent architecture, and a very nice restaurant with a patio. Very recommended.",
          "A magnificent museum building housing a wonderful collection. As far as possible collection items are displayed in the open, notably the ceramics. It must have wonderful air conditioning plant. Periodic views to the outside provide relief so that one does not get exhausted. The",
          "In my opinion this visit must require a guide. The explanations about the Thessaloniki and icons in the museum are like in any other museums short and not sufficient.",
          "The museum has an amazing collection of Byzantine art and archaelogical finds. I was particularly interested in the old manuscripts. I was very lucky I had the chance to visit it though on a very tight schedule.",
          "This is so worth the effort of visiting. Allow yourself plenty of time with a coffee break between exhibits. There are a lot of museums in Greece that don't have (a) seats or (b) places to take a break and have a coffee or lunch. The exhibits are all well marked in both Greek",
          "While I did not visit the museum for time reasons, my mistake was to visit Byzantino Cafe which serves low quality, high priced snacks relative to all other city centre cafes with sincere indifference. The approach of staff is a relic from the past where jobs - however badly",
          "Thoughtful, spacious and informative, all in English. Fascinating tour of a hugely interesting period and its later consequences.",
          "This collection spans essentially the entire period after Christ, from the very first emergence of Christianity in Greece up to the 19th century. As a bibliophile I loved the books and manuscripts, there's also an amazing collection of Byzantine art and archaeological finds. I",
          "I have to say this museum owns some interesting piece of art, but most of the items displayed doesn't have any interest. In addition to that, the museum has been organized without any logical sense, and most of the times the spotlights are not well placed. In some room you can",
          "I am a huge fan of everything Byzantium, and the museum takes care to present many interesting historical elements. The amount of items displayed is less than you would expect for the size of the building. I also wish that they would make the lights just a bit brighter to see",
          "Beautiful. Our guide was great. You will find very interesting. Worth going to. Fascinating and interesting.",
          "A place that you should visit in order to discover the real soul of the city's past.Apart from the artifacts, you should stay for lunch in B restaurant of the museum..",
          "Every visitor of Thessaloniki should visit this place to complete the story of glorious past of Thessaloniki during Byzantine Empire, after visiting Byzantine churches like Agia Sophia and Agios Dimitrios. You can see jewlery, icons, frescos, tombs, things used in everyday life.",
          "This is perhaps the finest museum that I have visited. It is laid out in a series of rooms depicting mosaics, frescoes, coins, glasswork, sculptures, a vast number of architectural pieces. All exhibits are described in English. The building has been built purposely to hold all",
          "Mostly: religious art, clay skulptures, tombs. Good location, close to many other museums and landmarks. Needs maybe something extra to really explain the meaning of the icons to the people who don't know much of the pictured saints or stories they represent.",
          "Probably the best Museum in the city. Modern and well organised, guided tour recommended unless you know the subject. Gives you the feeling of the past Glory of the Empire. Many precious objects on display, including home ware, jeweller, many icons of great value.",
          "To tell the truth, I loved this museum firstly from the outside, and loved it even more from its inside! The exhibits are nice, but the way they are displayed and the structure of the building itself both contribute to a very atmospheric and almost spiritual experience. Not to",
          "the museum was interesting for me. there was a lot of pictures and draws and object with their own story.",
          "Great building which showcases the different eras of the Byzantines. Beautifully laid out, very well explained - one of the best small museums I have seen.",
          "A beautiful buiding with many selections, many econs, photographs, easily read explanation for the excibition items, nice cafe in the garden.",
          "Many smaller or bigger treasures hidden inside. Very very nice lighting and atmosphere complementing the Greek/Byzantine history. One of the city's cultural highlights.",
          "I have seldom been in a museum with such a natural flow and structure. It was enjoyable to take a stroll around all the exhibits and understand the history of the byzantine culture. Make sure you come here with the combined 15\u20ac ticket which also includes the white tower,",
          "I and my family had a very great time in the museum by saw an ancient drawing for holy family and the saints and old coins i feel very happy at the atmosphere",

          "This museum is extremely nice and well done. Everything is labeled in English and Greek so easy to know what each item is. Many fine examples of icons, mosaics, tombs, etc. Loved that even the fire extinguishers were labeled in mosaic signage.",

          "The art, architectural, religious and historical background comes alive in this beautifully designed museum. The interior space is impressive, and further enhanced with its dramatic lighting . It's been divided up into galleries chronologically, which include extensive",
          "I knew nothing about this museum - was just filling in a rainy afternoon but it was outstanding. It's not particularly big but so much history and the exhibits are amazing. There are English descriptions to pretty much every exhibit which I found very helpful. And the cafe",
          "We were with a group touring this fabulous museum and so were on a schedule. So plan on going on your own if you can and take the time to really explore all the wonderful artifacts. We really loved it.",
          "I saw aspects of the history of Greece and Byzantium that I had never heard of before the visit and was very glad to have been there. In fact, I would have liked to stay longer and to just browse through the exhibits at a slower pace. We were there on a Sunday and I was very",
          "Maybe it is because we went when it was before the tourist season, I don't know. I did not like the lay out, and the \"babysitters\" of each section made me feel uncomfortable and followed me everywhere I went.",

          "Beautiful, spiritual, peaceful. Multiple galleries of Byzantine icons and religious pieces from the Greek Orthodox faith.",
          "This is a must see museum to understand the history of Byzantium in all its plenitude. The architecture makes for a good reading of the pieces exhibited. Only sorry that the bookshop was closed for lacking personnel although I saw plenty of people as vigilants in the rooms.",
          "It goes without saying that there is a rich history that this museum has collected and curated but the main disappointment I had with this museum was the cursory handling of the change from early paganism to Christianity. There was a small mention of 'witchcraft' and the exhibit",
          "Thessaloniki use to be the second city in the Byzantine empire so it is No surprise to find a museum with a rich collection. Nor Just icons But lots of objects From daalt life. The building of the museum is an attraction in itself. Very well designed and laid out.",
          "Greece has a tremendous history - starting with that in mind you will not be ready for what lies ahead in this museum. It's Big enough and you will need some time to visit it all so maybe pay visit in the morning. You'll see big history made by the Greeks and those who visited",

          "Paid a visit recently...excellent museum...a lot to learn and admire about byzantine culture...congratulations",
          "An intriguing gallery of rectangular spaces that spiral inwards with a few quite powerful pieces. But the economy is hurting and the place is dim and they cannot even staff the shop.",
          "I enjoyed the exhibits as much as the building itself. Unique in terms of Byzantine treasures, quite self-explanatory signage (although no museum map was available) I was impressed by the paintings of Mary and the Child and the family maps of Byzantine emperors. The building",
          "As a Canadian of Greek herotage, these was a few gaps on Greek history. The visit to the Byzantine and Macedonian museums helped fill in a few of those gaps. Worth the visit!",

          "If you are interested to Byzantine culture, this is excellent! You will get a lot of the byzantine history of town which will then give you a different perspective of the ruins you see walking around in town (walls etc). Furthermore, there is a section representing how houses",
          "Have been several times. For visitors to the city it is easy to get to and can be combined with a visit to the Archaeological museum next door. The exhibits are well displayed. There is a lovely coffee shop with a choice of snacks. I would advise looking at the exhibits, having",

          "Very interesting exhibits which outline the byzintine history of the town, how people used to live then and some beautiful icons",
          "The museum is worth a visit. I bought a combination ticket with the Archeological Museum. I visited the Archeolgical Museum first, which has a very interesting collection. I found the Byzantine Culture Museum good, but the focus was too narrow.",
          "Spectacular things inside the museum history in every corner nice located in the center (middle of the city ) near White tower.I would like to have more choices for tourist guiding and a greater range of time to visit",
          "Pleasantly surprised. No glossing over any part of the city's history. Fantastic facility, great artificates accompanied by well presented notes. All conquerors, periods and incidents are touched on with equal attention. Worth visiting.",
          "Enjoyed visiting this museum . Good easy layout and interesting displays. Only complaint was the infomation was badly lit and small making it hard to read. But worth visiting. First Sunday of the month entry is free",
          "Magnificent exhibits, very well displayed. Information provided on the displays and the era of each, also very helpful. I was slightly disappointed by the museum shop. It sold mementos that were from every other Greek museum and very little relating to the specific one.",

          "Right next to the Archaeological museum, it is easy to reach and well worth a visit. Exhibits the riches of the region from Late antiquity to the fall of Byzantine empire. It's spacious, renovated and well-designed. It contains several halls, dedicated to different periods and",
          "The museum is very informative, you'll learn definitely a lot about Byzantine Empire. However, probably because the empire and the things that remained from the empire is spread in different cities, I can't say that everything displayed is that interesting. Worth a fast visit",
          "Well worth a visit. Full of the most amazing things. Beautifully displayed and well documented exhibits. Lots of staff around if you need to ask questions. Very nice cafe in the grounds as well.",

          "It was a great museum to help understand some of what we saw when we visited other Greek sites. We very much appreciated the museum. A little surprised how much of the original pieces were so available to see with out glass cases and more protection. They have security, but",
          "This museum is great and greatly accessible for wheel chairs as well. It presents archeological findings, artefacts, church treasures, and a lot of other elements of Byzantine life. What maybe impresses most are the decorated tombs. The sophisticated architecture allows for a",
          "The building is very nice, to see as Architecture But for this kind of Museum as I visited it I was disapointed beause all what you see has to do with big posters , graves, big Christian Croses and Icons of the Holy Family. Only the first hall a interesting theme of how it was",

          "the two museum are very close to each other and you can even buy a combined ticket for them. We have started with the archeological one and then continued with the Byzantine one and a little disappointed with it. The number of artefacts was not a many as the other one and",
          "Thessaloniki was the second city of the Byzantine Empire and was the Symvasil\u00e9vousa (co-reigning) city of the Empire. This museum does justice to the Byzantine past of the city!",

          "It's right next to the Archaeological museum of Thessaloniki and after you visit that one, this one is a definite must. It furthers the exhibition in its cultural and anthropological aspects with different exhibitions. There are huge main halls with parts of temples and tombs",
          "The museam is great, you start your journy into the byzantium while being utsiide, even the design of the building is mixed between the modern and the byzantium!!!",
          "This is one of the museums that doesn't really do anything but display artefacts. What's wrong with that? A good historic and especially cultural museum makes its visitors re-imagine and re-experience the period or nation it covers. This museum doesn't even try to do that. And",
          "This is one of those museums that the building and presentation compete with the actual exhibits in excellence. The museum building is justly considered to be the most important work of modern architecture work in Greece. The exhibits are amply contextualized and explained but",

          "A beautiful museum with some rare exhibits from Byzantine period which was a great period for Thessaloniki. The exhibits are from the religious and everyday life of the people of Byzantium. Most exciting exhibits are byzantine orthodox icons painted by artists of this era.",
          "I liked the fact that it is not overcrowded and has visitors that are really interested to know more about the Byzantine History and culture, it is not just religion but part of the city's history and culture",
          "I admit that I am passionate about Byzantine culture. This museum is not vast, but it is a very modern concept, walking you through Byzantine culture. For instance, some of the best icons i have ever seen. Only pity was that a number of top pieces were on loan to other musea.",
          "I admired the exhibitions but \u0131 saw some politics against the Ottoman Turks. Some evaluations are not objective and scientific. Cultures are belong to human beings, not to the nations.",
          "I have been to many museums but this is one to fall in love with. Small, manageable, even with young kids, well organized, carefully curated, hospitable, accessible. Our young kids really learned a lot during our visit and so did we. Even if you visit just to see the utensils",
          "The museum is centrally located; there are sufficient parking spaces within a diameter of 500 metres. The collections are displayed in a very well organised building. Work are not displayed all together in adjoining rooms;they ar rather separated by long hallways, so you can",
          "As well as being the best museum in Thessaloniki, with every period in byzantine history covered from palaeochristian until eighteenth century and beyond, the architecture of the museum and the cool interiors is superb. After a tour of the museum, there is a very pleasant cafe",
          "The museum is beautifully arranged and designed. The collection of Late Antique and Byzantine mosaics and frescoes is amazing. The icon collection is extensive and includes numerous examples from the pre-iconoclast period through the 19th century.",
          "I'm not an expert on museum layouts/ curators, but the layout, flow and atmosphere of this museum seemed exceptional to me. It's laid out in 13-stages and each tells a clear and compelling visual story. The quality of the exhibits is first class. Suggest to make the visit",
          "Housed in a very nice purpose build building it offers the history of Byzantine in separate rooms with full explanations. The selection of artefact is large and very interesting. Great educational visit.",
          "Nice walk around this museum quite a lot of interesting items the museum is nice and cool with the air conditioning also it has a little coffee shop and cafe so if you are paying a visit to thesoloniki take a walk around this museum",
          "Beautiful, very well organized, informative for a very small entry fee. (Even cheaper if you buy a combined ticket to the Archaeological Museum that's also not to be missed.) I learned a lot about Byzantine Culture. It's a remarkable experience to see how people lived thousands",
          "Nice museum with a few lovely icons and other exhibits. Perhaps a little specialised but definately worth an hour of your time and it is next door to thhe larger archaeological museum so a joint ticket is available.",
          "I love a well-designed and well-presented museum, and this is one of them. The lighting and layout is good, and it really makes it a treat to see the exhibits. It's not the largest of museums, and I don't think that there are many pieces in the collection that are particularly",
          "Displays were well set out in a very \"visitor friendly\" building. The explanatory notes as one passed through the rooms were concise and informative. We particularly enjoyed the displays of capitals and vaulted tombs.",
          "A great deal to look at and some of the exhibits are seriously valuable. If you appreciate Greek /Persian art this is the place for you.",
          "This museum will overwhelm you with the fantastic history and a marvelous display of precious findings from the Thessaloniki. One of the places you have to visit at least once in your lifetime. It stands record of the magnificence of ancient Greece.",
          "This museum is really nice! In my holidays in greece i've been in many archaeological museums, and i wanted to see something different... and i think this museum is exactly what i needed! The ilumination is very (very!) poor in some parts of the museum, even that much that i",
          "A marvelous display of precious findings from the Thessaloniki and Macedonian area. Very well organized, o lot of extra information on display, and the building itself impressive and in absolute accordance to its subject. In addition, an interesting short-film about the history",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect from this museum, but in the end I was quite impressed by the quality of its exhibits, particularly in the Late Antique/Early Christian section. Don't expect a lot of epic history here -- the collections focus on Byzantine daily life and religion,",
          "Unfortunately this was the only museum we managed to visit at our stay in Thessaloniki, but it was well worth the visit. If you aren't going to read every label (but still most of it), then you can easily finish it under an hour.",
          "The Museum of Byzantine Culture is definitely worth the visit if you want to learn more about the history of Thessaloniki. You can buy a dual ticket for this museum and the Archaeological Museum, you should see both and visit Archaeological first (to stay in chronological order).",
          "This is a great museum. Around Greece we saw a lot of museums mostly about ancient Greece. This is the only museum that covers Byzantine period in such a depth. Combination ticket for 8 euro gives you the entrance to this museum and to Archeological museum which is right around",
          "A series of 11 rooms taking you through the life, death, art and religion of the Byzantine period, this modern museum lets you walk through ancient objects relying on you not to damage them. The day to day objects \u2013 fish hooks, building and agricultural tools, storage jars,",
          "thessaloniki had many interesting museums!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..one of them is the byzantine museum..Near to archaeological museum and a must visit ...you can see the history of the second biggest town of byzantine empire after Constantinople.!!!!!!!!!!!",

          "I live in Thessaloniki and I am not a museum expert. These two points said, I cosider this musem one of the best in Thessaloniki and a very good museum generally speaking. Interesting collection and exibitions, nice atmosphere and I love the building itself. The city has",
          "Very educational and visually impressive, must be one of the most comprehensive exhibits of the byzantine period in the world.",

          "Most of all I like the atmosphere, especially outdoors in the protected atrium with its flowers and lovely decoration. The food is also very good, salads, main courses and desserts, but also for a coffee break. Special price menus are usually offered to match the pocket and the",
          "The first galleries contain brilliant displays of Early Christian churches, houses and tombs. The Museum loses steam thereafter. The 14th and 15th centuries galleries are called The Twilight of Byzantium and are dark and depressing even though these centuries witnessed a",
          "The museum is a great history lesson of Byzantine Culture supported by beautiful displays and exhibits.",

          "Good museum to pass a couple of hours. The narrative could be better. It would reference events or years with no explanation and I had to do a lot of research after to understand the history that was overviewed in the museum. The cafe is great.",
          "This is a really nice museum in downtown Thessaloniki that traces a historical path though all of Byzantium. It is really laid out quite well with many exhibits. You can buy a dual ticket that will admit you to both this museum and the Archaeological Museum.",
          "Finally got a better idea what Byzantine era was all about in Art and Culture. Sections on cemetary and funerary archeological aspects most fascinating.",
          "It's all in there! The magic of the true Byzantine history of the city, as it comes to life through the ingeniously designed exhibitions! The building itself is an important piece of inspired modern architecture in Greece. Highly recommended!",
          "Excellent artifacts and displays, nice lighting, spacious. Good video, but some descriptions not lit enough. Nice cafe on ground floor.",
          "Liked the exhibitions. Byzantine time and theme are not everyone's cup of tea. Anyone who was likes variety, may not find it as interesting.",
          "Many interesting and some very beautiful exhibits. On our visit it felt very empty which is obviously a pity for the museum but makes for a peaceful time Good little cafe attached!",
          "Certainly the best museum in Saloniki. Lots to see from very important era of the city. We recommend it to everyone",
          "Worth visiting but not especially large -- I was able to see everything in an hour. Plenty of descriptions in English and you can see nearly everything very close up -- things are not hidden behind glass. Overall, I found the The Archaeological Museum next door more",
          "For anyone interested in the developments in Christian & Byzantine Culture, this is a museum not to be missed. Exhibits are nicely presented and organized. A lot to see.",
          "The collection is fine and the way it is displayed shows new museum technologies. With one ticket you can visit this museum and the archaeological museum.",
          "Venice has been built with much Byzantine taste... It's interesting to see where all those influences are coming from, and what it has been developed from it.",
          "There are many museums to choose from in Thessaloniki. We went to this one and it is very interesting, going through the history of Byzantine. The icons alone are worth a visit.",
          "Anyone interested in cultural travel must learn something about the places they visit and its history. This museum can help you do that as far as Greece and Thessaloniki are concerned.",
          "The museum contains a lot of stuff from the byzantine Culture - pieces of churches, jewellery, ancient stones etc. But unfortunately it's arranged rather boring. Which means you see a stone and have an explanation where it was found. It might be just me but I was missing the",
          "The museum layout is engaging and the exhibits are first class. Nice presentations throughout, with just the right balance of detail to be informative without overwhelming. Really worth a visit.",
          "Great Museum. Thessaloniki is one of the few cities with such many Byzantine monuments, so this museum could be the highlight of your Byzantine tour.",

          "interesting well-labeled collection in a very interesting building too. If you are familiar with the Byzantine period, it is well worth a visit. If you are not, it is an outstanding introduction to this important period in Greece that has long been neglected.",

          "This is IMHO the most interesting museum in Thesalloniki. They sell a combined ticket for this museum and the archaeological museum next door. But even if you don't do both, this one is definitely a must-see while in the city.",
          "everything i love archeology the museum is interesting and so very informative. all artifacts are well displayed",
          "A really fascinating museum and very wisely guide you through the long period, this culture was in Greece. You enter the earliest remains and slowly move from one hall to the next, also move forward in time but also move up in the building. In this way you never loose the time",
          "The Byzantine museum in Thessaloniki is indisputably one of the best in Greece, due to to both its amazing architectuer and concept of museum space and its permanenent collection and temporary exhibitions. It is a must for any visitor to Thessaloniki!",
          "This excellent building, designed by architect Crocos houses a great exhibition of byzantine and post-byzantine finds has been awarded with the the prize of the Best Museum 2005 by the Council of Europe. It is an ideal museum for individuals and groups to visit on a guided tour,",
          "This Museum is a must! If you know very little about the Byzantine period you will be enlightened, if you do know about it then you will find your knowledge much enhanced. If you can go to no other museum in Thessaloniki - visit the Byzantine Museum",
          "this maybe the only museum we have visited in Greece, that does not show respect to the relevant period in the Greek history that it pretends to represent. it is far behind in claiming to represent the byzantine culture, and it could easily be included, as a corner in the",
          "Of course, this is a must-see museum in Thessaloniki. It contains many pieces, but the organization is weird. The museum contains 10 rooms, which appears to follow some kind of chronology. But nothing is really put into a historical perspective. There is no logic in the",
          "Buy the combined ticket which permits you to visit the nearby archeological museum and after visiting both, sit and relax in the caf\u00e9 at the archeological museum. This museum displays mosaics, costumes, icons, Inscriptions which are educational and explain the Byzantine period",

          "Museum is extremely well designed with large displays that follow chronologically to give you a great build up of the history and day to day life of people in the Byzantine Empire. The mix of artificats to history is around half to half and the focus is on the cutlure and daily",

          "Beutiful building, with lots of treasures of the Byzantine period. I visited twice and the first time took part to a very interesting role game, whereas the second I followed a very informative and interesting guided tour by a passionate archaologist. The best part was to find",
          "This is an excellent Museum and I recommend it highly. It has been very creatively staged and is well worth a visit.",
          "This museum didn't exist when I was last in Thessaloniki but it is now one of the things to definitely visit when you are there. You can buy a combined ticket with the Archaeological Museum which is much cheaper than two separate ones and spend a good few hours strolling through",
          "I found this to be the best museum of our trip as so much of the art & exhibits was intact and of exceptional quality. Very well set out and able to allow the visitor to step back in time",
          "My family was lucky to join in the May's clay workshop. We had the chance to make our own clay turtles and other ornaments. The instructors were very nice and informative. Next to this event there was a demonstration of master pottery. A big flagon and a pot were made by",
          "Absolutely stunning Byzantine art and early Christian religious iconography. Very interesting historical information available on all exhibits. This is a must visit attraction for anyone interested in the history of western civilization.",
          "If you are interested in Byzantine culture well this is your place to be (the oriental branch of the Roman empire). Well after your museum show around there is a \"secret\" garden that can host your after museum questionings",
          "It is a very interest museum with modren presentation of the exhibits/ It is very friendly and understandable to the visitor.",
          "This was a well laid out museum with interesting displays and a great deal of information. Most exhibit displays were in English as well as Greek. We only spent an hour and a half here and enjoyed it more than the Archaeological Museum. Pay attention to the combination tickets",

          "I don't know much about museums, but this one has won my heart. The museum architecture is amazing, the atmoshpere brings you to another world (would have liked just a bit more light, so we can read the signs accompanying some exhibits). The location of the museum is great,",
          "I did know very less about Byzantine culture, this museum is really interesting and enjoyable with a lot of every-day exhibitions and religious icons. Although being in a new structure it is well organized and offers a good tour in the Byzantine Culture.",

      "name": "Arch of Galerius",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Arch of Galerius (Greek: \u0391\u03c8\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5) or Kamara (\u039a\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1) and the Rotunda (\u03a1\u03bf\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1) are neighbouring early 4th-century AD monuments in the city of Thessaloniki, in the region of Central Macedonia in northern Greece.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe 4th-century Roman Emperor Galerius commissioned these two structures as elements of an imperial precinct linked to his Thessaloniki palace. Archeologists have found substantial remains of the palace to the southwest. These three monumental structures were connected by a road that ran through the arch, which rose above the major east-west road of the city.\n\nAt the crux of the major axes of the city, the Arch of Galerius emphasized the power of the emperor and linked the monumental structures with the fabric of 4th-century Thessaloniki. The arch was composed of a masonry core faced with marble sculptural panels celebrating a victory over Narses (Narseh), the seventh emperor in the Sassanid Persian Empire, in 299 AD. About two-third of the arch is preserved.\nThe Rotunda was a massive circular structure with a masonry core that had an oculus like the Pantheon in Rome. It has gone through multiple periods of use and modification as a polytheist temple, a Christian basilica, a Muslim mosque, and again a Christian church (and archaeological site). A minaret is preserved from its use as a mosque, and ancient remains are exposed on its southern side.\n\n\n== Location and description of the Arch ==\n\nThe Arch of Galerius stands on what is now the intersection of Egnatia & Dimitriou Gounari streets. The arch was built in 298 to 299 AD and dedicated in 303 AD to celebrate the victory of the tetrarch Galerius over the Sassanid Persians at the Battle of Satala and capture of their capital Ctesiphon in 298.\n\nThe structure was an octopylon (eight-pillared gateway) forming a triple arch that was built of a rubble masonry core faced first with brick and then with marble panels with sculptural relief. The central arched opening was 9.7 m wide and 12.5 m high, and the secondary openings on other side were 4.8 m wide and 6.5 m high. The central arch spanned the portion of the  Via Egnatia (primary Roman road from Dyrrhacium to Byzantium) that passed through the city as a Decumanus (east-west major street). A road connecting the Rotunda (125m northeast) with the Palace complex (235m southwest) passed through the arch along its long axis.\nOnly the northwestern three of the eight pillars and parts of the masonry cores of the arches above survive: i.e., the entire eastern side (4 pillars) and the southernmost one of the western pillars are lost. Extensive consolidation with modern brick has been performed on the exposed masonry cores to protect the monument. The two pillars flanking the central arched passageway retain their sculpted marble slabs, which depict the wars of Galerius against the Persians in broadly panegyric terms.\n\n\n=== Sculptural program of the Arch ===\n\nUnderstanding of the sculptural program of the arch is limited by the loss of the majority of the marble panels, but the remains give an impression of the whole. Four vertically stacked registers of sculpted decoration were carved on each pillar, each separated by elaborate moldings. A label for the Tigris River indicates that there were likely labels on other representations as the builders deemed necessary. Artistic license was taken in the representations, for instance, the Caesar Galerius is shown in personal combat with the Sassanid Shah Narses in one of the panels; although they never met in battle. On the arch a mounted Galerius attacks a similarly mounted Narses with a lance as an eagle bearing a victory wreath in its talons approaches Galerius. The Caesar sits securely on his rearing horse, while the Persian king appears nearly unhorsed. Terrified Persians cower under the hooves of the Caesar's horse in the chaos of battle. The panel expresses the power of the Caesar Galerius.\n\nThe relief of the imperial family conjoined in a sacrifice of thanksgiving owes its distant prototype to the Augustan reliefs on the Ara Pacis in Rome. Galerius' wife, Diocletian's daughter Valeria, is shown at his side, helping authenticate his connection to his predecessor. Here as elsewhere all the faces have been carefully chiselled off, whether as damnatio memoriae or in later cultural intolerance of images.\nIn another panel, the tetrarchs are all arrayed in the toga as a Victoria holds a victory wreath out to the heads of the two Augusti. A third panel celebrates the unity of the tetrarchy, with a depiction of the tetrarchs standing together; the depersonalized manner in which the tetrarchs are portrayed is reminiscent of the schematic statues of the tetrarchs in porphyry at St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. Only Galerius is dressed in armor, and he makes the offering upon the altar.\nWhat remains of the arch asserts the glory of the tetrarchy and the prominence of Galerius within that system. The arch celebrates the Roman Empire as part of Galerius\u2019 victory over the Sassanid king. Galerius is also pictured on his horse at the right, while attacking a Sassanid guard.\n\n\n== Rotunda of Galerius ==\n\n\n=== Location and description of the Rotunda ===\n\nThe Rotunda of Galerius is 125m northeast of the Arch of Galerius at 40\u00b037'59.77\"N, 22\u00b057'9.77\"E. It is also known (by its consecration and use) as the Greek Orthodox Church of Agios Georgios, and is informally called the Church of the Rotunda (or simply The Rotunda).\nThe cylindrical structure was built in 306 AD on the orders of the tetrarch Galerius, who was thought to have intended it to be his mausoleum.The Rotunda has a diameter of 24.5 m. Its walls are more than 6 m thick, which is why it has withstood Thessaloniki's earthquakes. The walls are interrupted by eight rectangular bays, with the west bay forming the entrance. A flat brick dome, 30 m high at the peak, crowns the cylindrical structure. In its original design, the dome of the Rotunda had an oculus, as does the Pantheon in Rome.\n\n\n=== Uses of the Rotunda ===\n\nAfter Galerius's death in 311, he was buried at Gamzigrad (Felix Romuliana) near Zajecar, Serbia. The Rotunda stood empty for several decades until the Emperor Theodosius I ordered its conversion into a Christian church in the late fourth century. The church was embellished with very high quality mosaics. Only fragments have survived of the original decoration, for example, a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer, in front of complex architectural fantasies.\nThe building was used as a church (Church of Asomaton or Archangelon) for over 1,200 years until the city fell to the Ottomans. In 1590 it was converted into a mosque, called the Mosque of Suleyman Hortaji Effendi, and a minaret was added to the structure. It was used as a mosque until 1912, when the Greeks captured the city during the Balkan War. Greek Orthodox officials reconsecrated the structure as a church, and they left the minaret. The structure was damaged during an earthquake in 1978 but was subsequently restored. As of 2004, the minaret was still being stabilized with scaffolding. The building is now a historical monument under the Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities of the Greek Ministry of Culture, although the Greek Orthodox Church has access to the monument for various festivities some days of the year (as Church of Saint George).\nThe Rotunda is the oldest of Thessaloniki's churches. Some Greek publications claim it is the oldest Christian church in the world, although there are competitors for that title. It is the most important surviving example of a church from the early Christian period of the Greek-speaking part of the Roman Empire.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Roman domes\nHistory of Roman and Byzantine domes\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== The arch ===\nDyggve, E.

It is a three-floor house with a courtyard on 24 Apostolou Pavlou Street, next to the Turkish Consulate. Before the capture of Thessaloniki by the Greek Army in 1912, it was known as \"Koca Kas\u0131m Pa\u015fa district, Islahhane street\". It was built before 1870 and in 1935 the Thessaloniki City Council gave it to the Turkish State, which decided to convert it into a museum dedicated to Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk. Until the Istanbul pogrom of 1955, the street in front of the house was named \"Kemal Ataturk\".\nThe building has three floors and a courtyard. It was repaired in 1981 and was repainted to its original pink. Most of the furniture is authentic. Any missing items were replaced with furniture from Kemal's mausoleum and from Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. There are photographs on all the walls of Kemal at various periods of his life.\nThere are four rooms on the ground floor. On the 1st floor is the reception room, with European sofas, a large console table, and a chased brazier; a large sitting-room, with low banquettes around the walls; Kemal's mother's room, with a bed, a banquette, and a trunk; and the kitchen, equipped with contemporary cooking utensils. The most impressive room on the 2nd floor is the one in which Kemal was born, a large room with a banquette, his desk, and a large brazier. It faces another room, in which some of Kemal's personal effects from Ankara are displayed. These include formal dress, smoking requisites, cutlery, cups, and other items. All the documents relating to Kemal's schooldays have been hung on the walls. A pomegranate tree planted by Kemal's father still grows in the courtyard.In September 1955 as the Cyprus EOKA crisis unleashed in the Mediterranean island, a bomb exploded close to the Turkish consulate damaging also the Atat\u00fcrk Museum. The damage was minimal with some broken windows. but it marked the beginning of anti-Greek pogrom in Istanbul. Six years later the Turkish Prime Minister Adnan Menderes was deposed and a Turkish court found that the bombing had been ordered by his government; Menderes apologized and offered compensation but was sentenced to death charged with promoting the Istanbul pogrom, among other charges.\nIn 1981 a replica of the house was built in Ankara.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nwww.museumsofmacedonia.gr\nwww.studylanguages.org",

It is bounded on the west by the delta of the Axios.

It is Greece's second major economic, industrial, commercial and political centre; it is a major transportation hub for Greece and southeastern Europe, notably through the Port of Thessaloniki. The city is renowned for its festivals, events and vibrant cultural life in general, and is considered to be Greece's cultural capital. Events such as the Thessaloniki International Fair and the Thessaloniki International Film Festival are held annually, while the city also hosts the largest bi-annual meeting of the Greek diaspora. Thessaloniki was the 2014 European Youth Capital.The city of Thessaloniki was founded in 315 BC by Cassander of Macedon. An important metropolis by the Roman period, Thessaloniki was the second largest and wealthiest city of the Byzantine Empire. It was conquered by the Ottomans in 1430, and remained an important seaport and multi-ethnic metropolis during the nearly five centuries of Turkish rule. It passed from the Ottoman Empire to Greece on 8 November 1912. It is home to numerous notable Byzantine monuments, including the Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as several Roman, Ottoman and Sephardic Jewish structures. The city's main university, Aristotle University, is the largest in Greece and the Balkans.Thessaloniki is a popular tourist destination in Greece. In 2013, National Geographic Magazine included Thessaloniki in its top tourist destinations worldwide, while in 2014 Financial Times FDI magazine (Foreign Direct Investments) declared Thessaloniki as the best mid-sized European city of the future for human capital and lifestyle. Among street photographers, the center of Thessaloniki is also considered the most popular destination for street photography in Greece.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe original name of the city was \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thessalon\u00edk\u0113. It was named after princess Thessalonike of Macedon, the half sister of Alexander the Great, whose name means \"Thessalian victory\", from \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 Thessalos, and \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 'victory' (Nike), honoring the Macedonian victory at the Battle of Crocus Field (353/352 BC).\nMinor variants are also found, including \u0398\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thettalon\u00edki, \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 Thessalon\u00edkia, \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thessalon\u00edki, and \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd Thessalonik\u00e9on.The name \u03a3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Salon\u00edki is first attested in Greek in the Chronicle of the Morea (14th century), and is common in folk songs, but it must have originated earlier, as al-Idrisi called it Salunik already in the 12th century. It is the basis for the city's name in other languages: \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0479\u043d\u044a (Solun) in Old Church Slavonic, \u05e1\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05d4 (Salonika) in Ladino, \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0643 (Sel\u00e2nik) in Ottoman Turkish and Selanik in modern Turkish, Salonicco in Italian, Solun or \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d in the local and neighboring South Slavic languages, \u0421\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 (Salon\u00edki) in Russian, and S\u00e3run\u00e3 in Aromanian, and Salonica or Salonika in English.Thessaloniki was revived as the city's official name in 1912, when it joined the Kingdom of Greece during the Balkan Wars. In local speech, the city's name is typically pronounced with a dark and deep L characteristic of Modern Macedonian accent. The name is often abbreviated as \u0398\u03b5\u03c3/\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== From classical antiquity to the Roman Empire ===\n\nThe city was founded around 315 BC by the King Cassander of Macedon, on or near the site of the ancient town of Therma and 26 other local villages. He named it after his wife Thessalonike, a half-sister of Alexander the Great and princess of Macedonia as daughter of Philip II. Under the kingdom of Macedonia the city retained its own autonomy and parliament and evolved to become the most important city in Macedonia.After the fall of the Kingdom of Macedonia in 168 BC, in 148 BC Thessalonica was made the capital of the Roman province of Macedonia.  Thessalonica became a free city of the Roman Republic under Mark Antony in 41 BC. It grew to be an important trade hub located on the Via Egnatia, the road connecting Dyrrhachium with Byzantium, which facilitated trade between Thessaloniki and great centers of commerce such as Rome and Byzantium.  Thessaloniki also lay at the southern end of the main north\u2013south route through the Balkans along the valleys of the Morava and Axios river valleys, thereby linking the Balkans with the rest of Greece. The city became the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia; later it became the capital of all the Greek provinces of the Roman Empire because of its importance in the Balkan peninsula.\nAt the time of the Roman Empire, about 50 A.D., Thessaloniki was also one of the early centers of Christianity; while on his second missionary journey, Paul the Apostle visited this city's chief synagogue on three Sabbaths and sowed the seeds for Thessaloniki's first Christian church.  Later, Paul wrote two letters to the new church at Thessaloniki, preserved in the Biblical canon as First and Second Thessalonians.  Some scholars hold that the First Epistle to the Thessalonians is the first written book of the New Testament.\n\nIn 306 AD, Thessaloniki acquired a patron saint, St. Demetrius, a Christian whom Galerius is said to have put to death. Most scholars agree with Hippolyte Delehaye's theory that Demetrius was not a Thessaloniki native, but his veneration was transferred to Thessaloniki when it replaced Sirmium as the main military base in the Balkans. A basilical church dedicated to St. Demetrius, Hagios Demetrios, was first built in the 5th century AD and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided into the tetrarchy, Thessaloniki became the administrative capital of one of the four portions of the Empire under Galerius Maximianus Caesar, where Galerius commissioned an imperial palace, a new hippodrome, a triumphal arch and a mausoleum among others.In 379, when the Roman Prefecture of Illyricum was divided between the East and West Roman Empires, Thessaloniki became the capital of the new Prefecture of Illyricum. The following year, the Edict of Thessalonica made Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire. In 390, Gothic troops under the Roman Emperor Theodosius I, led a massacre against the inhabitants of Thessalonica, who had risen in revolt against the Gothic soldiers.  By the time of the Fall of Rome in 476, Thessaloniki was the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era and Middle Ages ===\n\nFrom the first years of the Byzantine Empire, Thessaloniki was considered the second city in the Empire after Constantinople, both in terms of wealth and size. with a population of 150,000 in the mid-12th century. The city held this status until its transfer to Venetian control in 1423. In the 14th century, the city's population exceeded 100,000 to 150,000, making it larger than London at the time.During the 6th and 7th centuries, the area around Thessaloniki was invaded by Avars and Slavs, who unsuccessfully laid siege to the city several times, as narrated in the Miracles of Saint Demetrius. Traditional historiography stipulates that many Slavs settled in the hinterland of Thessaloniki; however, modern scholars consider this migration to have been on a much smaller scale than previously thought. In the 9th century, the Byzantine Greek missionaries Cyril and Methodius, both natives of the city, created the first literary language of the Slavs, the Old Church Slavonic, most likely based on the Slavic dialect used in the hinterland of their hometown.An Arab naval attack in 904 resulted in the sack of the city.\nThe economic expansion of the city continued through the 12th century as the rule of the Komnenoi emperors expanded Byzantine control to the north. Thessaloniki passed out of Byzantine hands in 1204, when Constantinople was captured by the forces of the Fourth Crusade and incorporated the city and its surrounding territories in the Kingdom of Thessalonica \u2014 which then became the largest vassal of the Latin Empire. In 1224, the Kingdom of Thessalonica was overrun by the Despotate of Epirus, a remnant of the former Byzantine Empire, under Theodore Komnenos Doukas who crowned himself Emperor, and the city became the capital of the short-lived Empire of Thessalonica. Following his defeat at Klokotnitsa however in 1230, the Empire of Thessalonica became a vassal state of the Second Bulgarian Empire until it was recovered again in 1246, this time by the Nicaean Empire.In 1342, the city saw the rise of the Commune of the Zealots, an anti-aristocratic party formed of sailors and the poor, which is nowadays described as social-revolutionary. The city was practically independent of the rest of the Empire, as it had its own government, a form of republic. The zealot movement was overthrown in 1350 and the city was reunited with the rest of the Empire.The capture of Gallipoli by the Ottomans in 1354 kicked off a rapid Turkish expansion in the southern Balkans, conducted both by the Ottomans themselves and by semi-independent Turkish ghazi warrior-bands. By 1369, the Ottomans were able to conquer Adrianople (modern Edirne), which became their new capital until 1453. Thessalonica, ruled by Manuel II Palaiologos (r. 1391\u20131425) itself surrendered after a lengthy siege in 1383\u20131387, along with most of eastern and central Macedonia, to the forces of Sultan Murad I. Initially, the surrendered cities were allowed complete autonomy in exchange for payment of the kharaj poll-tax. Following the death of Emperor John V Palaiologos in 1391, however, Manuel II escaped Ottoman custody and went to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor, succeeding his father. This angered Sultan Bayezid I, who laid waste to the remaining Byzantine territories, and then turned on Chrysopolis, which was captured by storm and largely destroyed. Thessalonica too submitted again to Ottoman rule at this time, possibly after brief resistance, but was treated more leniently: although the city was brought under full Ottoman control, the Christian population and the Church retained most of their possessions, and the city retained its institutions.\n\nThessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until 1403, when Emperor Manuel II sided with Bayezid's eldest son S\u00fcleyman in the Ottoman succession struggle that broke out following the crushing defeat and capture of Bayezid at the Battle of Ankara against Tamerlane in 1402. In exchange for his support, in the Treaty of Gallipoli the Byzantine emperor secured the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the Chalcidice peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers Strymon and Pineios. Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous appanage to John VII Palaiologos. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the Despot Andronikos Palaiologos, who was supervised by Demetrios Leontares until 1415. Thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity after 1403, as the Turks were preoccupied with their own civil war, but was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by Musa \u00c7elebi) and 1416 (during the uprising of Mustafa \u00c7elebi against Mehmed I). Once the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city began to increase again. Just as during the 1383\u20131387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western help, or submission to the Ottomans.In 1423, Despot Andronikos Palaiologos ceded it to the Republic of Venice with the hope that it could be protected from the Ottomans who were besieging the city. The Venetians held Thessaloniki until it was captured by the Ottoman Sultan Murad II on 29 March 1430.\n\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n\nWhen Sultan Murad II captured Thessaloniki and sacked it in 1430, contemporary reports estimated that about one-fifth of the city's population was enslaved. Ottoman artillery was used to secure the city's capture and bypass its double walls. Upon the conquest of Thessaloniki, some of its inhabitants escaped, including intellectuals such as Theodorus Gaza \"Thessalonicensis\" and Andronicus Callistus. However, the change of sovereignty from the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman one did not affect the city's prestige as a major imperial city and trading hub. Thessaloniki and Smyrna, although smaller in size than Constantinople, were the Ottoman Empire's most important trading hubs. Thessaloniki's importance was mostly in the field of shipping, but also in manufacturing, while most of the city's trade was controlled by ethnic Greeks.\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, the city's population of Ottoman Muslims (including those of Turkish origin, as well as Albanian Muslim, Bulgarian Muslim and Greek Muslim of convert origin) grew substantially. According to the 1478 census Sel\u00e2nik (Ottoman Turkish: \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0643\u200e), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniots community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the city's population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regime's invitation to Jewish settlement was a strategy to prevent the ethnic Greek population from dominating the city.Thessaloniki was the capital of the Sanjak of Selanik within the wider Rumeli Eyalet (Balkans) until 1826, and subsequently the capital of Selanik Eyalet (after 1867, the Selanik Vilayet). This consisted of the sanjaks of Selanik, Serres and Drama between 1826 and 1912.\n\nWith the break out of the Greek War of Independence in the spring of 1821, the governor Yusuf Bey imprisoned in his headquarters more than 400 hostages. On 18 May, when Yusuf learned of the insurrection to the villages of Chalkidiki, he ordered half of his hostages to be slaughtered before his eyes. The mulla of Thessaloniki, Hayr\u0131\u00fclah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations: \"Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning. It seems that Yusuf Bey, the Yeniceri Agasi, the Suba\u015f\u0131, the hocas and the ulemas have all gone raving mad.\" It would take until the end of the century for the city's Greek community to recover.Thessaloniki was also a Janissary stronghold where novice Janissaries were trained. In June 1826, regular Ottoman soldiers attacked and destroyed the Janissary base in Thessaloniki while also killing over 10,000 Janissaries, an event known as The Auspicious Incident in Ottoman history. In 1870\u20131917, driven by economic growth, the city's population expanded by 70%, reaching 135,000 in 1917.The last few decades of Ottoman control over the city were an era of revival, particularly in terms of the city's infrastructure. It was at that time that the Ottoman administration of the city acquired an \"official\" face with the creation of the Government House while a number of new public buildings were built in the eclectic style in order to project the European face both of Thessaloniki and the Ottoman Empire. The city walls were torn down between 1869 and 1889, efforts for a planned expansion of the city are evident as early as 1879, the first tram service started in 1888 and the city streets were illuminated with electric lamp posts in 1908. In 1888 the Oriental Railway connected Thessaloniki to Central Europe via rail through Belgrade and to Monastir in 1893, while the Thessaloniki-Istanbul Junction Railway connected it to Constantinople in 1896.\n\n\n=== 20th century and since ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, Thessaloniki was in the center of radical activities by various groups; the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, founded in 1897, and the Greek Macedonian Committee, founded in 1903. In 1903 an anarchist group known as the Boatmen of Thessaloniki planted bombs in several buildings in Thessaloniki, including the Ottoman Bank, with some assistance from the IMRO. The Greek consulate in Ottoman Thessaloniki (now the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle) served as the center of operations for the Greek guerillas.\nDuring this period, and since the 14th century, Thessaloniki's Jewish element was the most dominant; it was the only city in Europe where the Jews were a majority of the total population. The city was ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan. In 1890 its population had risen to 118,000, 47% of which were Jews, followed by Turks (22%), Greeks (14%), Bulgars (8%), Roma (2%), and others (7%). By 1913, the ethnic composition of the city had changed so that the population stood at 157,889, with Jews at 39%, followed again by Turks (29%), Greeks (25%), Bulgars (4%), Roma (2%), and others at 1%. Many varied religions were practiced and many languages spoken, including Ladino, a dialect of Spanish spoken by the city's Jews.\nThessaloniki was also the center of activities of the Young Turks, a political reform movement, which goal was to replace the Ottoman Empire's absolute monarchy with a constitutional government. The Young Turks started out as an underground movement, until finally in 1908, they started the Young Turk Revolution from the city of Thessaloniki, by which their revolutionaries gained control over the Ottoman Empire. Eleftherias (Liberty) Square, where the Young Turks gathered at the outbreak of the revolution, is named after the event.\n\nAs the First Balkan War broke out, Greece declared war on the Ottoman Empire and expanded its borders. When Eleftherios Venizelos, Prime Minister at the time, was asked if the Greek army should move towards Thessaloniki or Monastir (now Bitola, Republic of North Macedonia), Venizelos replied \"\u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2!\" (Thessaloniki, at all costs!). As both Greece and Bulgaria wanted Thessaloniki, the Ottoman garrison of the city entered negotiations with both armies. On 8 November 1912 (26 October Old Style), the feast day of the city's patron saint, Saint Demetrius, the Greek Army accepted the surrender of the Ottoman garrison at Thessaloniki. The Bulgarian army arrived one day after the surrender of the city to Greece and Tahsin Pasha, ruler of the city, told the Bulgarian officials that \"I have only one Thessaloniki, which I have surrendered\". After the Second Balkan War, Thessaloniki and the rest of the Greek portion of Macedonia were officially annexed to Greece by the Treaty of Bucharest in 1913. On 18 March 1913 George I of Greece was assassinated in the city by Alexandros Schinas.In 1915, during World War I, a large Allied expeditionary force established a base at Thessaloniki for operations against pro-German Bulgaria. This culminated in the establishment of the Macedonian Front, also known as the Salonika Front. In 1916, pro-Venizelist Greek army officers and civilians, with the support of the Allies, launched an uprising, creating a pro-Allied temporary government by the name of the \"Provisional Government of National Defence\" that controlled the \"New Lands\" (lands that were gained by Greece in the Balkan Wars, most of Northern Greece including Greek Macedonia, the North Aegean as well as the island of Crete); the official government of the King in Athens, the \"State of Athens\", controlled \"Old Greece\" which were traditionally monarchist. The State of Thessaloniki was disestablished with the unification of the two opposing Greek governments under Venizelos, following the abdication of King Constantine in 1917.On 30 December 1915 an Austrian air raid on Thessaloniki alarmed many town civilians and killed at least one person, and in response the Allied troops based there arrested the German and Austrian and Bulgarian and Turkish vice-consuls and their families and dependents and put them on a battleship, and billeted troops in their consulate buildings in Thessaloniki.\n\nMost of the old center of the city was destroyed by the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, which was started accidentally by an unattended kitchen fire on 18 August 1917. The fire swept through the centre of the city, leaving 72,000 people homeless; according to the Pallis Report, most of them were Jewish (50,000). Many businesses were destroyed, as a result, 70% of the population were unemployed. Two churches and many synagogues and mosques were lost. Nearly one-quarter of the total population of approximately 271,157 became homeless. Following the fire the government prohibited quick rebuilding, so it could implement the new redesign of the city according to the European-style urban plan prepared by a group of architects, including the Briton Thomas Mawson, and headed by French architect Ernest H\u00e9brard. Property values fell from 6.5 million Greek drachmas to 750,000.After the defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War and during the break-up of the Ottoman Empire, a population exchange took place between Greece and Turkey. Over 160,000 ethnic Greeks deported from the former Ottoman Empire \u2013 particularly Greeks from Asia Minor  and East Thrace were resettled in the city, changing its demographics. Additionally many of the city's Muslims, including Ottoman Greek Muslims, were deported to Turkey, ranging at about 20,000 people. This made the Greek element dominant, while the Jewish population was reduced to a minority for the first time since the 14th century.\n\nDuring World War II Thessaloniki was heavily bombarded by Fascist Italy (with 232 people dead, 871 wounded and over 800 buildings damaged or destroyed in November 1940 alone), and, the Italians having failed in their invasion of Greece, it fell to the forces of Nazi Germany on 8 April 1941 and went under German occupation. The Nazis soon forced the Jewish residents into a ghetto near the railroads and on 15 March 1943 began the deportation of the city's Jews to Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. Most were immediately sent to the gas chambers. Of the 45,000 Jews deported to Auschwitz, only 4% survived.\n\nDuring a speech in Reichstag, Hitler claimed that the intention of his Balkan campaign, was to prevent the Allies from establishing \"a new Macedonian front\", like they did during WWI. The importance of Thessaloniki to Nazi Germany can be demonstrated by the fact that, initially, Hitler had planned to incorporate it directly in the Third Reich (that is, make it part of Germany) and not have it controlled by a puppet state such as the Hellenic State or an ally of Germany (Thessaloniki had been promised to Yugoslavia as a reward for joining the Axis on 25 March 1941). As it was the first major city in Greece to fall to the occupying forces, the first Greek resistance group formed in Thessaloniki (under the name \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, Elefther\u00eda, \"Freedom\") as well as the first anti-Nazi newspaper in an occupied territory anywhere in Europe, also by the name Eleftheria. Thessaloniki was also home to a military camp-converted-concentration camp, known in German as \"Konzentrationslager Pavlo Mela\" (Pavlos Melas Concentration Camp), where members of the resistance and other anti-fascists were held either to be killed or sent to other concentration camps. On 30 October 1944, after battles with the retreating German army and the Security Battalions of Poulos, forces of ELAS entered Thessaloniki as liberators headed by Markos Vafiadis (who didn't obey to orders from ELAS leadership in Athens to not enter the city). Pro-EAM celebrations and demonstrations followed in the city. In the 1946 monarchy referendum, the majority of the locals voted in favor of a republic, contrary to the rest of Greece.After the war, Thessaloniki was rebuilt with large-scale development of new infrastructure and industry throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Many of its architectural treasures still remain, adding value to the city as a tourist destination, while several early Christian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1988. In 1997, Thessaloniki was celebrated as the European Capital of Culture, sponsoring events across the city and the region. Agency established to oversee the cultural activities of that year 1997 was still in existence by 2010. In 2004 the city hosted a number of the football events as part of the 2004 Summer Olympics.Today, Thessaloniki has become one of the most important trade and business hubs in Southeastern Europe, with its port, the Port of Thessaloniki being one of the largest in the Aegean and facilitating trade throughout the Balkan hinterland. On 26 October 2012 the city celebrated its centennial since its incorporation into Greece. The city also forms one of the largest student centers in Southeastern Europe, is host to the largest student population in Greece and was the European Youth Capital in 2014.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nThessaloniki lies on the northern fringe of the Thermaic Gulf on its eastern coast and is bound by Mount Chortiatis on its southeast. Its proximity to imposing mountain ranges, hills and fault lines, especially towards its southeast have historically made the city prone to geological changes.\nSince medieval times, Thessaloniki was hit by strong earthquakes, notably in 1759, 1902, 1978 and 1995. On 19\u201320 June 1978, the city suffered a series of powerful earthquakes, registering 5.5 and 6.5 on the Richter scale. The tremors caused considerable damage to a number of buildings and ancient monuments, but the city withstood the catastrophe without any major problems. One apartment building in central Thessaloniki collapsed during the second earthquake, killing many, raising the final death toll to 51.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThessaloniki's climate is directly affected by the sea it is situated on. The city lies in a transitional climatic zone, so its climate displays characteristics of several climates. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, it has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) that borders on a Mediterranean climate (Csa), as well as a semi-arid climate (BSk), observed on the periphery of the region. Its average annual precipitation of 450 mm (17.7 inches) is due to the Pindus rain shadow drying the westerly winds. However, the city has a summer precipitation between 20 to 30 mm (0.79 to 1.18 inches), which prevents it from qualifying as a Mediterranean climate (Csa), and increases gradually towards the north and west, turning humid subtropical.Winters are relatively dry, with common morning frost. Snowfalls occur sporadically more or less every winter, but the snow cover does not last for more than a few days. Fog is common, with an average of 193 foggy days in a year. During the coldest winters, temperatures can drop to \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F). The record minimum temperature in Thessaloniki was \u221214 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F). On average, Thessaloniki experiences frost (sub-zero temperature) 32 days a year. The coldest month of the year in the city is January, with an average 24-hour temperature of 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F). Wind is also usual in the winter months, with December and January having an average wind speed of 26 km/h (16 mph).Thessaloniki's summers are hot and quite dry. Maximum temperatures usually rise above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), but they rarely approach or go over 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F); the average number of days the temperature is above 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) is 32. The maximum recorded temperature in the city was 44 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F). Rain seldom falls in summer, mainly during thunderstorms. In the summer months Thessaloniki also experiences strong heat waves. The hottest month of the year in the city is July, with an average 24-hour temperature of 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F). The average wind speed for June and July in Thessaloniki is 20 kilometres per hour (12 mph).\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAccording to the Kallikratis reform, as of 1 January 2011 the Thessaloniki Urban Area (Greek: \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2) which makes up the \"City of Thessaloniki\", is made up of six self-governing municipalities (Greek: \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9) and one municipal unit (Greek: \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1). The municipalities that are included in the Thessaloniki Urban Area are those of Thessaloniki (the city center and largest in population size), Kalamaria, Neapoli-Sykies, Pavlos Melas, Kordelio-Evosmos, Ampelokipoi-Menemeni, and the municipal units of Pylaia and Panorama, part of the municipality of Pylaia-Chortiatis. Prior to the Kallikratis reform, the Thessaloniki Urban Area was made up of twice as many municipalities, considerably smaller in size, which created bureaucratic problems.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki Municipality ===\n\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki (Greek: \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2) is the second most populous in Greece, after Athens, with a resident population of 325,182 (in 2011) and an area of 19.307 square kilometres (7.454 square miles). The municipality forms the core of the Thessaloniki Urban Area, with its central district (the city center), referred to as the Kentro, meaning 'center' or 'downtown'.The city's first mayor, Osman Sait Bey, was appointed when the institution of mayor was inaugurated under the Ottoman Empire in 1912. The incumbent mayor is Konstantinos Zervas. In 2011, the municipality of Thessaloniki had a budget of \u20ac464.33 million while the budget of 2012 stands at \u20ac409.00 million.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nThessaloniki is the second largest city in Greece. It is an influential city for the northern parts of the country and is the capital of the region of Central Macedonia and the Thessaloniki regional unit. The Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace is also based in Thessaloniki, being that the city is the de facto capital of the Greek region of Macedonia.It is customary every year for the Prime Minister of Greece to announce his administration's policies on a number of issues, such as the economy, at the opening night of the Thessaloniki International Fair. In 2010, during the first months of the 2010 Greek debt crisis, the entire cabinet of Greece met in Thessaloniki to discuss the country's future.In the Hellenic Parliament, the Thessaloniki urban area constitutes a 16-seat constituency. As of the 2019 Greek legislative election the largest party in Thessaloniki is the New Democracy with 35.55% of the vote, followed by the Coalition of the Radical Left (31.29%) and the Movement for Change (6.05%). The table below summarizes the results of the latest elections.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nArchitecture in Thessaloniki is the direct result of the city's position at the centre of all historical developments in the Balkans. Aside from its commercial importance, Thessaloniki was also for many centuries the military and administrative hub of the region, and beyond this the transportation link between Europe and the Levant.\nMerchants, traders and refugees from all over Europe settled in the city. The need for commercial and public buildings in this new era of prosperity led to the construction of large edifices in the city center. During this time, the city saw the building of banks, large hotels, theatres, warehouses, and factories. Architects who designed some of the most notable buildings of the city, in the late 19th and early 20th century, include Vitaliano Poselli, Pietro Arrigoni, Xenophon Paionidis, Salvatore Poselli, Leonardo Gennari, Eli Modiano, Mosh\u00e9 Jacques, Joseph Pleyber, Frederic Charnot, Ernst Ziller, Roubens Max, Levi Ernst, Angelos Siagas, Alexandros Tzonis using mainly the styles of Eclecticism, Art Nouveau and Neobaroque.\n\nThe city layout changed after 1870, when the seaside fortifications gave way to extensive piers, and many of the oldest walls of the city were demolished, including those surrounding the White Tower, which today stands as the main landmark of the city. As parts of the early Byzantine walls were demolished, this allowed the city to expand east and west along the coast.The expansion of Eleftherias Square towards the sea completed the new commercial hub of the city and at the time was considered one of the most vibrant squares of the city. As the city grew, workers moved to the western districts, because of their proximity to factories and industrial activities; while the middle and upper classes gradually moved from the city-center to the eastern suburbs, leaving mainly businesses. In 1917, a devastating fire swept through the city and burned uncontrollably for 32 hours. It destroyed the city's historic center and a large part of its architectural heritage, but paved the way for modern development featuring wider diagonal avenues and monumental squares.\n\n\n=== City centre ===\n\nAfter the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, a team of architects and urban planners including Thomas Mawson and Ernest Hebrard, a French architect, chose the Byzantine era as the basis of their (re)building designs for Thessaloniki's city centre. The new city plan included axes, diagonal streets and monumental squares, with a street grid that would channel traffic smoothly. The plan of 1917 included provisions for future population expansions and a street and road network that would be, and still is sufficient today. It contained sites for public buildings and provided for the restoration of Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques.\n\nAlso called the historic centre, it is divided into several districts, including Dimokratias Square (Democracy Sq. known also as Vardaris) Ladadika (where many entertainment venues and tavernas are located), Kapani (were the city's central Modiano market is located), Diagonios, Navarinou, Rotonda, Agia Sofia and Hippodromio, which are all located around Thessaloniki's most central point, Aristotelous Square.\nVarious commercial stoas around Aristotelous are named from the city's past and historic personalities of the city, like stoa Hirsch, stoa Carasso/Ermou, Pelosov, Colombou, Modiano, Morpurgo, Mordoch, Simcha, Malakopi, Olympios, Emboron, Rogoti, Vyzantio, Tatti, Agiou Mina, Karipi etc.The western portion of the city centre is home to Thessaloniki's law courts, its central international railway station and the port, while its eastern side hosts the city's two universities, the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Centre, the city's main stadium, its archaeological and Byzantine museums, the new city hall and its central parks and gardens, namely those of the \u03a7\u0391\u039d\u0398 and Pedion tou Areos.\n\n\n=== Ano Poli ===\n\nAno Poli (also called Old Town and literally the Upper Town) is the heritage listed district north of Thessaloniki's city center that was not engulfed by the great fire of 1917 and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site by ministerial actions of Melina Merkouri, during the 1980s. It consists of Thessaloniki's most traditional part of the city, still featuring small stone paved streets, old squares and homes featuring old Greek and Ottoman architecture. It is the favorite area of Thessaloniki's poets, intellectuals and bohemians.\n\nAno Poli also, is the highest point in Thessaloniki and as such, is the location of the city's acropolis, its Byzantine fort, the Heptapyrgion, a large portion of the city's remaining walls, and with many of its additional Ottoman and Byzantine structures still standing. The area provides access to the Seich Sou Forest National Park and features panoramic views of the whole city and the Thermaic Gulf. On clear days Mount Olympus, at about 100 km (62 mi) away across the gulf, can also be seen towering the horizon.\n\n\n=== Northwestern Thessaloniki ===\nNorthwestern Thessaloniki had always been associated with industry and the working class because as the city grew during the 1920s, many workers had moved there, because of its proximity near factories and industrial activities.\nToday many factories and industries have been moved further out west and the area is experiencing rapid growth as does the southeast. Many factories in this area have been converted to cultural centers, while past military grounds that are being surrounded by densely built neighborhoods are awaiting transformation into parklands.\nNorthwest Thessaloniki forms the main entry point into the city of Thessaloniki with the avenues of Monastiriou, Lagkada and 26is Octovriou passing through it, as well as the extension of the A1 motorway, feeding into Thessaloniki's city center. The area is home to the Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal (KTEL), the Zeitenlik Allied memorial military cemetery and to large entertainment venues of the city, such as Milos, Fix, Vilka (which are housed in converted old factories). Northwestern Thessaloniki is also home to Moni Lazariston, located in Stavroupoli, which today forms one of the most important cultural centers for the city, including MOMus\u2013Museum of Modern Art\u2013Costakis Collection and two theatres of the National Theatre of Northern Greece. Construction on the Holocaust Museum of Greece began in the city in 2018 in the area of the Old Railway Station.\nIn this area are located the Railway Museum of Thessaloniki and the Water Supply Museum.\n\n\n=== Southeastern Thessaloniki ===\n\nThe area along the today Vasileos Georgiou and Vasilissis Olgas avenues, was up until the 1920s home to the city's most affluent residents and formed the outermost suburbs of the city at the time, with the area close to the Thermaic Gulf coast called Exoch\u00e8s (des Campagnes), from the 19th century holiday villas which defined the area. Some of them include Villa Allatini, Villa Bianca, Villa Mehmet Kapanci, Villa Modiano, Villa Mordoch and others.Today southeastern Thessaloniki has in some way become a natural extension of the city center, with the avenues of Megalou Alexandrou, Georgiou Papandreou (Antheon), Vasileos Georgiou, Vasilissis Olgas, Delfon, Konstantinou Karamanli (Nea Egnatia) and Papanastasiou passing through it, enclosing an area traditionally called \u039d\u03c4\u03b5\u03c0\u03ce (Dep\u00f3, lit. D\u00e9p\u00f4t), from the name of the old tram station, owned by a French company.\nThe municipality of Kalamaria is also located in southeastern Thessaloniki and was firstly inhabited mainly by Greek refugees from Asia Minor and East Thrace after 1922.Southeastern Thessaloniki is also home to three of the city's football stadiums, the Thessaloniki Concert Hall, the Poseidonio aquatic and athletic complex, the Northern Greece Naval Command and the old royal palace (called Palataki), located on the most westerly point of Karabournaki cape.\nOther extended residential areas that belong to southeastern Thessaloniki are Charilaou and Toumba, which is divided in \"Ano Toumpa\" and \"Kato Toumpa\". Toumba was named after the homonymous hill of Toumba, situated in the northwest of the area. It was created by refugees after the 1922 Asia Minor disaster and the population exchange (1923\u201324). Toumba is one of the most famous areas of Thessaloniki, mainly due to the football stadium of the local team PAOK FC and its important archaeological site on the hill of Toumba, where extensive archaeological research takes place.\n\n\n=== Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments (UNESCO) ===\n\nBecause of Thessaloniki's importance during the early Christian and Byzantine periods, the city is host to several paleochristian monuments that have significantly contributed to the development of Byzantine art and architecture throughout the Byzantine Empire as well as Serbia. The evolution of Imperial Byzantine architecture and the prosperity of Thessaloniki go hand in hand, especially during the first years of the Empire, when the city continued to flourish. It was at that time that the Complex of Roman emperor Galerius was built, as well as the first church of Hagios Demetrios.By the 8th century, the city had become an important administrative center of the Byzantine Empire, and handled much of the Empire's Balkan affairs. During that time, the city saw the creation of more notable Christian churches that are now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as Hagia Sophia of Thessaloniki, the Church of the Acheiropoietos, the Church of Panagia Chalkeon. When the Ottoman Empire took control of Thessaloniki in 1430, most of the city's churches were converted into mosques, but have survived to this day. Travelers such as Paul Lucas and Abdulmejid I document the city's wealth in Christian monuments during the years of the Ottoman control of the city.\nThe church of Hagios Demetrios was burnt down during the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, as did many other of the city's monuments, but it was rebuilt. During World War II, the city was extensively bombed and as such many of Thessaloniki's paleochristian and Byzantine monuments were heavily damaged. Some of the sites were not restored until the 1980s. Thessaloniki has more UNESCO World Heritage Sites listed than any other city in Greece, a total of 15 monuments. They have been listed since 1988.\n\n\n=== Urban sculpture ===\n\nThere are around 150 statues or busts in the city. Probably the most famous one is the equestrian statue of Alexander the Great on the promenade, placed in 1973 and created by sculptor Evangelos Moustakas. An equestrian statue of Constantine I, by sculptor Georgios Dimitriades, is located in Demokratias Square. Other notable statues include that of Eleftherios Venizelos by sculptor Giannis Pappas, Pavlos Melas by Natalia Mela, the statue of Emmanouel Pappas by Memos Makris, Chrysostomos of Smyrna by Athanasios Apartis, such as various creations by George Zongolopoulos.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki 2012 Program ===\n\nWith the 100th anniversary of the 1912 incorporation of Thessaloniki into Greece, the government announced a large-scale redevelopment program for the city of Thessaloniki, which aims in addressing the current environmental and spatial problems that the city faces. More specifically, the program will drastically change the physiognomy of the city by relocating the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center and grounds of the Thessaloniki International Fair outside the city centre and turning the current location into a large metropolitan park, redeveloping the coastal front of the city, relocating the city's numerous military camps and using the grounds and facilities to create large parklands and cultural centers; and the complete redevelopment of the harbor and the Lachanokipoi and Dendropotamos districts (behind and near the Port of Thessaloniki) into a commercial business district, with possible highrise developments.The plan also envisions the creation of new wide avenues in the outskirts of the city and the creation of pedestrian-only zones in the city centre. Furthermore, the program includes plans to expand the jurisdiction of Seich Sou Forest National Park and the improvement of accessibility to and from the Old Town. The ministry has said that the project will take an estimated 15 years to be completed, in 2025.Part of the plan has been implemented with extensive pedestrianization's within the city center by the municipality of Thessaloniki and the revitalization the eastern urban waterfront/promenade, \u039d\u03ad\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 (N\u00e9a Paral\u00eda, lit. new promenade), with a modern and vibrant design. Its first section opened in 2008, having been awarded as the best public project in Greece of the last five years by the Hellenic Institute of Architecture.The municipality of Thessaloniki's budget for the reconstruction of important areas of the city and the completion of the waterfront, opened in January 2014, was estimated at around \u20ac28.2 million (US$39.9 million) for the year 2011 alone.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThessaloniki rose to economic prominence as a major economic hub in the Balkans during the years of the Roman Empire. The Pax Romana and the city's strategic position allowed for the facilitation of trade between Rome and Byzantium (later Constantinople and now Istanbul) through Thessaloniki by means of the Via Egnatia. The Via Egnatia also functioned as an important line of communication between the Roman Empire and the nations of Asia, particularly in relation to the Silk Road. With the partition of the Roman Emp. into East (Byzantine) and West, Thessaloniki became the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire after New Rome (Constantinople) in terms of economic might. Under the Empire, Thessaloniki was the largest port in the Balkans. As the city passed from Byzantium to the Republic of Venice in 1423, it was subsequently conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Under Ottoman rule the city retained its position as the most important trading hub in the Balkans. Manufacturing, shipping and trade were the most important components of the city's economy during the Ottoman period, and the majority of the city's trade at the time was controlled by ethnic Greeks. Plus, the Jewish community was also an important factor in the trade sector.Historically important industries for the economy of Thessaloniki included tobacco (in 1946 35% of all tobacco companies in Greece were headquartered in the city, and 44% in 1979) and banking (in Ottoman years Thessaloniki was a major center for investment from western Europe, with the Bank of Thessaloniki (French: Banque de Salonique) having a capital of 20 million French francs in 1909).\n\n\n=== Services ===\n\nThe service sector accounts for nearly two thirds of the total labour force of Thessaloniki. Of those working in services, 20% were employed in trade, 13% in education and healthcare, 7.1% in real estate, 6.3% in transport, communications & storing, 6.1% in the finance industry & service-providing organizations, 5.7% in public administration & insurance services and 5.4% in hotels & restaurants.The city's port, the Port of Thessaloniki, is one of the largest ports in the Aegean and as a free port, it functions as a major gateway to the Balkan hinterland. In 2010, more than 15.8 million tons of products went through the city's port, making it the second-largest port in Greece after Aghioi Theodoroi, surpassing Piraeus. At 273,282 TEUs, it is also Greece's second-largest container port after Piraeus. As a result, the city is a major transportation hub for the whole of south-eastern Europe, carrying, among other things, trade to and from the neighbouring countries.In recent years Thessaloniki has begun to turn into a major port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean. The Greek ministry of tourism considers Thessaloniki to be Greece's second most important commercial port, and companies such as Royal Caribbean International have expressed interest in adding the Port of Thessaloniki to their destinations. A total of 30 cruise ships are expected to arrive at Thessaloniki in 2011.\n\n\n=== Companies ===\nRecent historyAfter WWII and the Greek civil war, heavy industrialization of the city's suburbs began in the middle 1950s.During the 1980s a spate of factory shut downs occurred, mostly of automobile manufacters, such as Agricola (vehicles), AutoDiana, EBIAM, Motoemil, Pantelemidis-TITAN and C.AR (automobiles). Since the 1990s, companies took advantage of cheaper labour markets and more lax regulations in other countries, and among the largest companies to shut down factories were Goodyear, AVEZ pasta industry (one of the first industrial factories in northern Greece, built in 1926),  Philkeram Johnson, AGNO dairy and VIAMIL.\nHowever, Thessaloniki still remains a major business hub in the Balkans and Greece, with a number of important Greek companies headquartered in the city, such as the Hellenic Vehicle Industry (ELVO), Namco (automobiles), Astra Airlines, Ellinair, Pyramis and MLS Multimedia, which introduced the first Greek-built smartphone in 2012.\nIndustryIn early 1960s, with the collaboration of Standard Oil and ESSO-Pappas, a large industrial zone was created, containing refineries, oil refinery and steel production (owned by Hellenic Steel Co.). The zone attracted also a series of different factories during the next decades.\nTitan Cement has also facilities outside the city, on the road to Serres, such as the AGET Heracles, a member of the Lafarge group, and Alumil SA.\nMultinational companies such as Air Liquide, Cyanamid, Nestl\u00e9, Pfizer, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company and Vivartia have also industrial facilities in the suburbs of the city.\nFoodstuffFoodstuff or drink companies headquartered in the city include the Macedonian Milk Industry (Mevgal), Allatini, Barbastathis, Hellenic Sugar Industry, Haitoglou Bros, Mythos Brewery, Malamatina, while the Goody's chain started from the city.The American Farm School also has important contribution in food production.\n\n\n=== Macroeconomic indicators ===\nIn 2011, the regional unit of Thessaloniki had a Gross Domestic Product of \u20ac18.293 billion (ranked 2nd amongst the country's regional units), comparable to Bahrain or Cyprus, and a per capita of \u20ac15,900 (ranked 16th). In Purchasing Power Parity, the same indicators are \u20ac19,851 billion (2nd) and \u20ac17,200 (15th) respectively. In terms of comparison with the European Union average, Thessaloniki's GDP per capita indicator stands at 63% the EU average and 69% in PPP \u2013 this is comparable to the German state of Brandenburg. Overall, Thessaloniki accounts for 8.9% of the total economy of Greece. Between 1995 and 2008 Thessaloniki's GDP saw an average growth rate of 4.1% per annum (ranging from +14.5% in 1996 to \u221211.1% in 2005) while in 2011 the economy contracted by \u22127.8%.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical ethnic statistics ===\nThe tables below show the ethnic statistics of Thessaloniki during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki is the most populous in the Thessaloniki Urban Area. Its population has increased in the latest census and the metropolitan area's population rose to over one million. The city forms the base of the Thessaloniki metropolitan area, with latest census in 2011 giving it a population of 1,030,338.\n\n\n=== Jews of Thessaloniki ===\n\nThe Jewish population in Greece is the oldest in mainland Europe (see Romaniotes). When Paul the Apostle came in Thessaloniki he taught in the area of what today is called Upper City. Later, during the Ottoman period, with the coming of Sephardic Jews from Spain, the community of Thessaloniki became mostly Sephardic. Thessaloniki became the largest center in Europe of the Sephardic Jews, who nicknamed the city la madre de Israel (Israel's mother) and \"Jerusalem of the Balkans\". It also included the historically significant and ancient Greek-speaking Romaniote community. During the Ottoman era, Thessaloniki's Sephardic community of was half the population according to the Ottoman Census of 1902 and almost 40% the city's population of 157,000 about 1913; Jewish merchants were prominent in commerce until the ethnic Greek population increased after independence in 1912. By the 1680s, about 300 families of Sephardic Jews, followers of Sabbatai Zevi, had converted to Islam, becoming a sect known as the D\u00f6nmeh (convert), and migrated to Salonika, whose population was majority Jewish. They established an active community that thrived for about 250 years. Many of their descendants later became prominent in trade. Many Jewish inhabitants of Thessaloniki spoke Ladino, the Romance language of the Sephardic Jews.\n\nFrom the second half of the 19th century with the Ottoman reforms, the Jewish community had a new revival. Many French and especially Italian Jews (from Livorno and other cities), influential in introducing new methods of education and developing new schools and intellectual environment for the Jewish population, were established in Thessaloniki. Such modernists introduced also new techniques and ideas from the industrialized Western Europe and from the 1880s the city began to industrialize. The Italian Jews Allatini brothers led Jewish entrepreneurship, establishing milling and other food industries, brickmaking and processing plants for tobacco. Several traders supported the introduction of a large textile-production industry, superseding the weaving of cloth in a system of artisanal production. Notable names of the era include among others the Italo-Jewish Modiano family and the Allatini. Benrubis founded also in 1880 one of the first retail companies in the Balkans.\nAfter the Balkan Wars, Thessaloniki was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece in 1913. At first the community feared that the annexation would lead to difficulties and during the first years its political stance was, in general, anti-Venizelist and pro-royalist/conservative. The Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 during World War I burned much of the center of the city and left 50,000 Jews homeless of the total of 72,000 residents who were burned out. Having lost homes and their businesses, many Jews emigrated: to the United States, Palestine, and Paris. They could not wait for the government to create a new urban plan for rebuilding, which was eventually done.After the Greco-Turkish War in 1922 and the bilateral population exchange between Greece and Turkey, many refugees came to Greece. Nearly 100,000 ethnic Greeks resettled in Thessaloniki, reducing the proportion of Jews in the total community. After this, Jews made up about 20% of the city's population. During the interwar period, Greece granted Jewish citizens the same civil rights as other Greek citizens. In March 1926, Greece re-emphasized that all citizens of Greece enjoyed equal rights, and a considerable proportion of the city's Jews decided to stay. During the Metaxas regime the stance towards Jews became even better.\n\nWorld War II brought a disaster for the Jewish Greeks, since in 1941 the Germans occupied Greece and began actions against the Jewish population. Greeks of the Resistance helped save some of the Jewish residents. By the 1940s, the great majority of the Jewish Greek community firmly identified as both Greek and Jewish. According to Misha Glenny, such Greek Jews had largely not encountered \"anti-Semitism as in its North European form.\"In 1943 the Nazis began brutal actions against the historic Jewish population in Thessaloniki, forcing them into a ghetto near the railroad lines and beginning deportation to concentration and labor camps. They deported and exterminated approximately 96% of Thessaloniki's Jews of all ages during the Holocaust. The Thessaloniki Holocaust memorial in Eleftherias (\"Freedom\") Square was built in 1997 in memory of all the Jewish people from Thessaloniki, who died in the Holocaust. The site was chosen because it was the place where Jewish residents were rounded up before embarking to trains for concentration camps. Today, a community of around 1200 remains in the city. Communities of descendants of Thessaloniki Jews \u2013 both Sephardic and Romaniote \u2013 live in other areas, mainly the United States and Israel. Israeli singer Yehuda Poliker recorded a song about the Jewish people of Thessaloniki, called \"Wait for me, Thessaloniki\".\n\n\n=== Others ===\nSince the late 19th century, many merchants from Western Europe (mainly from France and Italy) were established in the city. They had an important role in the social and economic life of the city and introduced new industrial techniques. Their main district was what is known today as the \"Frankish district\" (near Ladadika), where the Catholic church designed by Vitaliano Poselli is also situated. Many of them left after the incorporation of the city into the Greek kingdom, others, who were of Jewish faith, were exterminated by the Nazis.\nThe Bulgarian community of the city increased during the late 19th century. The community had a Men's High School, a Girl's High School, a trade union and a gymnastics society. A large part of them were Catholics, as a result of actions by the Lazarists society, which had its base in the city.\nAnother group is the Armenian community which dates back to the Byzantine and Ottoman periods. During the 20th century, after the Armenian Genocide and the defeat of the Greek army in the Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322), many fled to Greece including Thessaloniki. There is also an Armenian cemetery and an Armenian church at the center of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Leisure and entertainment ===\n\nThessaloniki is not only regarded as the cultural and entertainment capital of northern Greece but also the cultural capital of the country. The city's main theaters, run by the National Theatre of Northern Greece (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0398\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf \u0392\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2) which was established in 1961, include the Theater of the Society of Macedonian Studies, where the National Theater is based, the Royal Theater (\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0398\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf)-the first base of the National Theater-, Moni Lazariston, and the Earth Theater and Forest Theater, both amphitheatrical open-air theatres overlooking the city.\n\nThe title of the European Capital of Culture in 1997 saw the birth of the city's first opera and today forms an independent section of the National Theatre of Northern Greece. The opera is based at the Thessaloniki Concert Hall, one of the largest concert halls in Greece. Recently a second building was also constructed and designed by Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. Thessaloniki is also the seat of two symphony orchestras, the Thessaloniki State Symphony Orchestra and the Symphony Orchestra of the Municipality of Thessaloniki.\nOlympion Theater, the site of the Thessaloniki International Film Festival and the Plateia Assos Odeon multiplex are the two major cinemas in downtown Thessaloniki. The city also has a number of multiplex cinemas in major shopping malls in the suburbs, most notably in Mediterranean Cosmos, the largest retail and entertainment development in the Balkans.\nThessaloniki is renowned for its major shopping streets and lively laneways. Tsimiski Street and Proxenou Koromila avenue are the city's most famous shopping streets and are among Greece's most expensive and exclusive high streets. The city is also home to one of Greece's most famous and prestigious hotels, Makedonia Palace hotel, the Hyatt Regency Casino and hotel (the biggest casino in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe) and Waterland, the largest water park in southeastern Europe.\nThe city has long been known in Greece for its vibrant city culture, including having the most cafes and bars per capita of any city in Europe; and as having some of the best nightlife and entertainment in the country, thanks to its large young population and multicultural feel. Lonely Planet listed Thessaloniki among the world's \"ultimate party cities\".\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\n\nAlthough Thessaloniki is not renowned for its parks and greenery throughout its urban area, where green spaces are few, it has several large open spaces around its waterfront, namely the central city gardens of Palios Zoologikos Kipos (which is recently being redeveloped to also include rock climbing facilities, a new skatepark and paintball range), the park of Pedion tou Areos, which also holds the city's annual floral expo; and the parks of the Nea Paralia (waterfront) that span for 3 km (2 mi) along the coast, from the White Tower to the concert hall.\nThe Nea Paralia parks are used throughout the year for a variety of events, while they open up to the Thessaloniki waterfront, which is lined up with several caf\u00e9s and bars; and during summer is full of Thessalonians enjoying their long evening walks (referred to as \"the volta\" and is embedded into the culture of the city). Having undergone an extensive revitalization, the city's waterfront today features a total of 12 thematic gardens/parks.Thessaloniki's proximity to places such as the national parks of Pieria and beaches of Chalkidiki often allow its residents to easily have access to some of the best outdoor recreation in Europe; however, the city is also right next to the Seich Sou forest national park, just 3.5 km (2 mi) away from Thessaloniki's city center; and offers residents and visitors alike, quiet viewpoints towards the city, mountain bike trails and landscaped hiking paths. The city's zoo, which is operated by the municipality of Thessaloniki, is also located nearby the national park.Other recreation spaces throughout the Thessaloniki metropolitan area include the Fragma Thermis, a landscaped parkland near Thermi and the Delta wetlands west of the city center; while urban beaches that have continuously been awarded the blue flags, are located along the 10 km (6 mi) coastline of Thessaloniki's southeastern suburbs of Thermaikos, about 20 km (12 mi) away from the city center.\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nBecause of the city's rich and diverse history, Thessaloniki houses many museums dealing with many different eras in history. Two of the city's most famous museums include the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki and the Museum of Byzantine Culture.\nThe Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki was established in 1962 and houses some of the most important ancient Macedonian artifacts, including an extensive collection of golden artwork from the royal palaces of Aigai and Pella. It also houses exhibits from Macedon's prehistoric past, dating from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. The Prehistoric Antiquities Museum of Thessaloniki has exhibits from those periods as well.\n\nThe Museum of Byzantine Culture is one of the city's most famous museums, showcasing the city's glorious Byzantine past. The museum was also awarded Council of Europe's museum prize in 2005. The museum of the White Tower of Thessaloniki houses a series of galleries relating to the city's past, from the creation of the White Tower until recent years.One of the most modern museums in the city is the Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum and is one of the most high-tech museums in Greece and southeastern Europe. It features the largest planetarium in Greece, a cosmotheater with the country's largest flat screen, an amphitheater, a motion simulator with 3D projection and 6-axis movement and exhibition spaces. Other industrial and technological museums in the city include the Railway Museum of Thessaloniki, which houses an original Orient Express train, the War Museum of Thessaloniki and others. The city also has a number of educational and sports museums, including the Thessaloniki Olympic Museum.\nThe Atat\u00fcrk Museum in Thessaloniki is the historic house where Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, founder of modern-day Turkey, was born. The house is now part of the Turkish consulate complex, but admission to the museum is free. The museum contains historic information about Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk and his life, especially while he was in Thessaloniki.\nOther ethnological museums of the sort include the Historical Museum of the Balkan Wars, the Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki and the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle, containing information about the freedom fighters in Macedonia and their struggle to liberate the region from the Ottoman yoke. Construction on the Holocaust Museum of Greece began in the city in 2018.The city also has a number of important art galleries. Such include the Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art, housing exhibitions from a number of well-known Greek and foreign artists. The Teloglion Foundation of Art is part of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and includes an extensive collection of works by important artists of the 19th and 20th centuries, including works by prominent Greeks and native Thessalonians. The Thessaloniki Museum of Photography also houses a number of important exhibitions, and is located within the old port of Thessaloniki.\n\n\n=== Archaeological sites ===\n\nThessaloniki is home to a number of prominent archaeological sites. Apart from its recognized UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Thessaloniki features a large two-terraced Roman forum featuring two-storey stoas, dug up by accident in the 1960s. The forum complex also boasts two Roman baths, one of which has been excavated while the other is buried underneath the city. The forum also features a small theater, which was also used for gladiatorial games. Although the initial complex was not built in Roman times, it was largely refurbished in the 2nd century. It is believed that the forum and the theater continued to be used until at least the 6th century.Another important archaeological site is the imperial palace complex which Roman emperor Galerius, located at Navarinou Square, commissioned when he made Thessaloniki the capital of his portion of the Roman Empire. The large octagonal portion of the complex, most of which survives to this day, is believed to have been an imperial throne room. Various mosaics from the palatial complex have also survived. Some historians believe that the complex must have been in use as an imperial residence until the 11th century.Not far from the palace itself is the Arch of Galerius, known colloquially as the Kamara. The arch was built to commemorate the emperor's campaigns against the Persians. The original structure featured three arches; however, only two full arches and part of the third survive to this day. Many of the arches' marble parts survive as well, although it is mostly the brick interior that can be seen today.\nOther monuments of the city's past, such as the Incantadas, a Caryatid portico from the ancient forum, have been removed or destroyed over the years. The Incantadas in particular are on display at the Louvre. Thanks to a private donation of \u20ac180,000, it was announced on 6 December 2011 that a replica of the Incantadas would be commissioned and later put on display in Thessaloniki.The construction of the Thessaloniki Metro inadvertently started the largest archaeological dig not only of the city, but of Northern Greece; the dig spans 20 km2 (7.7 sq mi) and has unearthed 300,000 individual artefacts from as early as the Roman Empire and as late as the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917. Ancient Thessaloniki's Decumanus Maximus was also found and 75 metres (246 ft) of the marble-paved and column-lined road were unearthed along with shops, other buildings, and plumbing, prompting one scholar to describe the discovery as \"the Byzantine Pompeii\". Some of the artefacts will be put on display inside the metro stations, while Venizelou will feature the world's first open archaeological site located within a metro station.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThessaloniki is home of a number of festivals and events. The Thessaloniki International Fair is the most important event to be hosted in the city annually, by means of economic development. It was first established in 1926 and takes place every year at the 180,000 m2 (1,937,503.88 sq ft) Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center. The event attracts major political attention and it is customary for the Prime Minister of Greece to outline his administration's policies for the next year, during event. Over 250,000 visitors attended the exposition in 2010.  The new Art Thessaloniki,  is starting first time 29.10. \u2013 1 November 2015 as an international contemporary art fair. \nThe Thessaloniki International Film Festival is established as one of the most important film festivals in Southern Europe, with a number of notable film makers such as Francis Ford Coppola, Faye Dunaway, Catherine Deneuve, Irene Papas and Fatih Ak\u0131n taking part, and was established in 1960.

It has been held every year ever since, however in 2013 transgender people participating in the parade became victims of police brutality. The issue was soon settled by the government. The city's Greek Orthodox Church leadership has consistently rallied against the event, but mayor Boutaris sided with Thessaloniki Pride, saying also that Thessaloniki would seek to host EuroPride 2020. The event was given to Thessaloniki in September 2017, beating Bergen, Brussels, and Hamburg.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe main stadium of the city is the Kaftanzoglio Stadium (also home ground of Iraklis F.C.), while other main stadiums of the city include the football Kleanthis Vikelidis Stadium and Toumba Stadium home grounds of Aris F.C. and PAOK FC, respectively, all of whom are founding members of the Greek league.\nBeing the largest \"multi-sport\" stadium in the city, Kaftanzoglio Stadium regularly plays host to athletics events; such as the European Athletics Association event \"Olympic Meeting Thessaloniki\" every year; it has hosted the Greek national championships in 2009 and has been used for athletics at the Mediterranean Games and for the European Cup in athletics.

Thessaloniki has a rich sporting history with its teams winning the first ever panhellenic football (Aris FC), basketball (Iraklis BC), and water polo (AC Aris) tournaments.\nDuring recent years, PAOK FC has emerged as the strongest football club of the city, winning also the Greek championship without a defeat (2018\u201319 season).\nThe city played a major role in the development of basketball in Greece. The local YMCA was the first to introduce the sport to the country, while Iraklis B.C. won the first ever Greek championship. From 1982 to 1993 Aris B.C. dominated the league, regularly finishing in first place. In that period Aris won a total of 9 championships, 7 cups and one European Cup Winners' Cup. The city also hosted the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in which Greece came third. In volleyball, Iraklis has emerged since 2000 as one of the most successful teams in Greece and Europe \u2013 see 2005\u201306 CEV Champions League. In October 2007, Thessaloniki also played host to the first Southeastern European Games.The city is also the finish point of the annual Alexander The Great Marathon, which starts at Pella, in recognition of its Ancient Macedonian heritage.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nThessaloniki is home to the ERT3 TV-channel and Radio Macedonia, both services of Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) operating in the city and are broadcast all over Greece.\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki also operates three radio stations, namely FM100, FM101 and FM100.6; and TV100, a television network which was also the first non-state-owned TV station in Greece and opened in 1988. Several private TV-networks also broadcast out from Thessaloniki, with Makedonia TV being the most popular.\nThe city's main newspapers and some of the most circulated in Greece, include Makedonia, which was also the first newspaper published in Thessaloniki in 1911 and Aggelioforos. A large number of radio stations also broadcast from Thessaloniki as the city is known for its music contributions.\n\n\n==== TV broadcasting ====\nERT3 (Panhellenic broadcasting)\nMakedonia TV (Panhellenic)\n4E TV (Panhellenic)\nTV 100 (Regional)\nVergina TV (Regional)\nAtlas TV (Regional)\n\n\n==== Press ====\nMakedonia (national publication)\nAggelioforos (national)\nMetrosport (sports, national)\nFair Play (sports, national)\nAris Ise (sports, weekly, national )\nForza (sports, weekly, national)\nThessaloniki (weekly, national)\nKarfitsa (weekly)\nIkonomiki (financial)\n\n\n=== Notable Thessalonians ===\n\nThroughout its history, Thessaloniki has been home to a number of well-known figures. It was also the birthplace or base of various Saints and other religious figures, such as Demetrius of Thessaloniki, Cyril and Methodius (creators of the first Slavic alphabet), Saint Mitre (Saint Demetrius, not to be confused with the previous), Gregorios Palamas, Eustathius of Thessalonica and Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople. Other Byzantine-era notables included jurist Constantine Armenopoulos, the anti-Palamian theologians Prochoros and Demetrios Kydones, such as scholars Theodorus Gaza (Thessalonicensis) and Matthaios Kamariotis.\nMany of the country's best-known musicians and movie personalities are from Thessaloniki, such as Zoe Laskari, Costas Hajihristos, Stella Haskil, Giannis Dalianidis, Maria Plyta, Harry Klynn, Antonis Remos, Paschalis Terzis, Nikos Papazoglou, Nikolas Asimos, Giorgos Hatzinasios, Alberto Eskenazi, Stavros Kouyioumtzis, Giannis Kalatzis, Natassa Theodoridou, Katia Zygouli, Kostas Voutsas, Takis Kanellopoulos, Titos Vandis, Manolis Chiotis, Dionysis Savvopoulos, Marinella, Yvonne Sanson and the classical composer Emilios Riadis. Additionally, there have been a number of politicians born in the city: Ioannis Skandalidis, Alexandros Zannas, Evangelos Venizelos, Christos Sartzetakis, fourth President of Greece, Niki Kerameus and Yiannis Boutaris. Sports personalities from the city include Georgios Roubanis, Giannis Ioannidis, Faidon Matthaiou, Alketas Panagoulias, Panagiotis Fasoulas, Eleni Daniilidou, Traianos Dellas, Giorgos Koudas, Kleanthis Vikelidis, Christos Kostis, Dimitris Salpingidis and Nikos Zisis. Benefactor Ioannis Papafis, architect Lysandros Kaftanzoglou and writers, such as Grigorios Zalykis, Manolis Anagnostakis, Kleitos Kyrou, Albertos Nar, Giorgos Ioannou, Elias Petropoulos, Kostis Moskof, Rena Molho and Dinos Christianopoulos are also from Thessaloniki.\nThe city is also the birthplace or base of a number of international personalities, which include Bulgarians (Atanas Dalchev), Jews (Moshe Levy, Maurice Abravanel, Isaak Benrubi, Isaac and Daniel Carasso, Rapha\u00ebl Salem, Baruch Uziel, Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz, Salamo Arouch), Slav Macedonians (Dimo Todorovski), Italians (Luisa Poselli, Giacomo Poselli, Vittorio Citterich), French (Louis Dumont), Spanish (Juana Mord\u00f3), Turks (Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet, Afet \u0130nan, Cahit Arf, Mehmet Cavit Bey, Sabiha Sertel, Abdul Kerim Pasha, Hasan Tahsin Uzer, Hasan Tahsin) and Armenians (Jean Tatlian).\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nBecause Thessaloniki remained under Ottoman rule for about 100 years more than southern Greece, it has retained a lot of its Eastern character, including its culinary tastes. Spices in particular play an important role in the cuisine of Thessaloniki, something which is not true to the same degree about Greece's southern regions. Thessaloniki's Ladadika borough is a particularly busy area in regards to Thessalonian cuisine, with most tavernas serving traditional meze and other such culinary delights.Bougatsa, a breakfast pastry, which can be either sweet or savory, is very popular throughout the city and has spread around other parts of Greece and the Balkans as well. Another popular snack is koulouri.\nNotable sweets of the city are Trigona, Rox\u00e1kia and Armenov\u00edl. A stereotypical Thessalonian coffee drink is Frapp\u00e9 coffee. Frapp\u00e9 was invented in the Thessaloniki International Fair in 1957 and has since spread throughout Greece and Cyprus to become a hallmark of the Greek coffee culture.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nA touristic boom took place in the 2010s, during the years of mayor Boutaris, especially from the neighboring countries, Austria, Israel and Turkey. In 2010 the sleepovers of foreign tourists in the city were around 250,000. In 2018 the sleepovers of foreign tourists was estimated to reach 3,000,000 people.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe city is viewed as a romantic one in Greece, and as such Thessaloniki is commonly featured in Greek songs. There are a number of famous songs that go by the name 'Thessaloniki' (rebetiko, la\u00efko etc.) or include the name in their title.During the 1930s and 40s the city became a center of the Rebetiko music, partly because of the Metaxas censorship, which was stricter in Athens. Vassilis Tsitsanis wrote some of his best songs in Thessaloniki.\nThe city is the birthplace of significant composers in the Greek music scene, such as Manolis Chiotis, Stavros Kouyioumtzis and Dionysis Savvopoulos. It is also notable for its rock music scene and its many rock groups; some became famous such as Xylina Spathia, Trypes or the pop rock Onirama.\nBetween 1962\u20131997 and 2005\u20132008 the city also hosted the Thessaloniki Song Festival. In the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 Greece was represented by Koza Mostra and Agathonas Iakovidis, both from Thessaloniki.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nOn May 1936, a massive strike by tobacco workers led to general anarchy in the city and Ioannis Metaxas (future dictator, then PM) ordered its repression. The events and the deaths of the protesters inspired Yiannis Ritsos to write the Epitafios.\nOn 22 May 1963, Grigoris Lambrakis, pacifist and MP, was assassinated by two far-right extremists driving a three-wheeled vehicle. The event led to political crisis. Costa Gavras directed Z (1969 film) based on it, two years after the military junta had seized power in Greece.\nNotable films set or shot in Thessaloniki among others include Mademoiselle Docteur/Salonique, nid d'espions (1937) by Georg Wilhelm Pabst, The Barefooted Battalion (1954) by Greg Tallas (Gregory Thalassinos), O Ats\u00eddas (1961) by Giannis Dalianidis,  Parenthesis (1968) by Takis Kanellopoulos,  Triumph of the Spirit (1989) by Robert M. Young, Eternity and a Day by Theo Angelopoulos (1998) and Ouzeri Tsitsanis (2015) by Manousos Manousakis.\nThe 1963 book I am David, written by Anne Holm, makes mention of the main character David making his way there after escaping from the Eastern Bloc, before continuing his ultimate journey to Denmark.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThessaloniki is a major center of education for Greece. Three of the country's largest universities are located in central Thessaloniki: Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the University of Macedonia and the International Hellenic University. Aristotle University was founded in 1926 and is currently the largest university in Greece by number of students, which number at more than 80,000 in 2010, and is a member of the Utrecht Network. For the academic year 2009\u20132010, Aristotle University was ranked as one of the 150 best universities in the world for arts and humanities and among the 250 best universities in the world overall by the Times QS World University Rankings, making it one of the top 2% of best universities worldwide. Leiden ranks Aristotle University as one of the top 100 European universities and the best university in Greece, at number 97. Since 2010, Thessaloniki is also home to the Open University of Thessaloniki, which is funded by Aristotle University, the University of Macedonia and the municipality of Thessaloniki.\nAdditionally, a TEI (Technological Educational Institute), namely the Alexander Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki, is located in the western suburb of Sindos; home also to the industrial zone of the city. Numerous public and private vocational institutes (Greek: IEK) provide professional training to young students, while a large number of private colleges offer American and UK academic curriculum, via cooperation with foreign universities. In addition to Greek students, the city hence attracts many foreign students either via the Erasmus programme for public universities, or for a complete degree in public universities or in the city's private colleges. As of 2006 the city's total student population was estimated around 200,000.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nTram was the main, oldest and most popular public urban mean of Thessalonians in the past. It functioned from 1893 to 1957, when it was disestablished by the government of Konstantinos Karamanlis. The French Compagnie de Tramways et d' \u00c9clairage \u00c9lectrique de Salonique operated it from 1912 until 1940, when the company was purchased by the Hellenic State. The operating base and tram station was in the district of D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nBefore the economic crisis of 2009, there were various proposals for new tram lines.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nThessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (OASTH) operates buses as the only form of public transport in Thessaloniki. It was founded in 1957 and operates a fleet of 604 vehicles on 75 routes throughout the Thessaloniki metropolitan area. International and regional bus links are provided by KTEL at its Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal, located to the west of the city centre.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe creation of a metro system for Thessaloniki goes back as far as 1918, when Thomas Hayton Mawson and Ernest H\u00e9brard proposed the creation of a Thessaloniki Metropolitan Railway. In 1968 a circular metro line was proposed, and in 1987 the first serious proposal was presented and construction briefly started in 1988, before stalling and finally being abandoned due to lack of funding. Both the 1918 and 1988 proposals ran almost the identical route to the current Line 1.\nConstruction on Thessaloniki's current metro began in 2006 and is classified as a megaproject: it has a budget of \u20ac1.57 billion ($1.77 billion). Line 1 and Line 2 are currently under construction and will enter service, in phases, between 2020 and 2021. Line 1 is 9.5 kilometres (5.9 mi) long and stops at 13 stations, while Line 2 is 4.8 kilometres (3.0 mi) long and stops at a further 5 stations, while also calling at 11 of the Line 1 stations. Important archaeological discoveries have been made during construction, and some of the system's stations will house archaeological exhibitions. One stop, Venizelou, will house the only open archaeological site within a metro station anywhere in the world.Line 2 is to be expanded further, with a loop extension to the western suburbs of the city, towards Evosmos and Stavroupoli, and one overground extension towards the Airport. The western extension is more high-priority than the airport one, as the airport will be served by a 10-minute shuttle bus to the terminus of Line 2, Mikra.Once opened in 2020, it is expected that 320,000 people will use the metro every day, or 116 million people every year.\n\n\n=== Commuter/suburban rail (Proastiakos) ===\n\nCommuter rail services have recently been established between Thessaloniki and the city of Larissa (the service is known in Greek as the \"Proastiakos\", meaning \"Suburban Railway\"). The service is operated using Siemens Desiro EMU trains on a modernised electrified double track and stops at 11 refurbished stations, covering the journey in 1 hour and 33 minutes. Furthermore, an additional line has also been established, although with the use of regional trains, between Thessaloniki and the city of Edessa.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki Airport \"Makedonia\" ===\n\nInternational and domestic air traffic to and from the city is served by Thessaloniki Airport \"Makedonia\". The short length of the airport's two runways means that it does not currently support intercontinental flights, although a major extension \u2013 lengthening one of its runways into the Thermaic Gulf \u2013 is under construction, despite considerable opposition from local environmental groups. Following the completion of the runway works, the airport will be able to serve intercontinental flights and cater for larger aircraft in the future. Construction of a second terminal began in September 2018, due to be completed in 2021.\n\n\n=== Railways and ferry connections ===\n\nBecause of the Greek economic crisis, all international train links from the city were suspended in February 2011. Until then, the city was a major railway hub for the Balkans, with direct connections to Sofia, Skopje, Belgrade, Moscow, Vienna, Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul, alongside Athens and other destinations in Greece. Daily through trains to Sofia and Belgrade were restarted in May 2014. Thessaloniki remains one of Greece's most important railway hubs and has the biggest marshalling yard in the country.\nRegional train services within Greece (operated by TrainOSE, the Hellenic Railways Organization's train operating company), link the city with other parts of the country, from its central railway passenger station, called the \"New railway station\" located at the western end of Thessaloniki's city center.\nThe Port of Thessaloniki connects the city with seasonal ferries to the Sporades and other north Aegean islands, with its passenger terminal, being one of the largest in the Aegean Sea basin; having handled around 162,731 passengers in 2007. Meanwhile, ongoing actions have been going on for more connections and the port is recently being upgraded, as Thessaloniki is also slowly turning into a major tourist port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Motorways ===\n\nThessaloniki lies on the crossroads of the A1/E75, A2/E90 and A25 motorways; which connect the city with other parts of the country, as well as the Republic of North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey.\nThe city itself is bypassed by the C-shaped Thessaloniki Inner Ring Road (Esoteriki Peripheriaki Odos,  Greek: \u0395\u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2), which all of the above motorways connect onto it. The western end of the route begins at the junction with the A1/A2 motorways in Lachanagora District. Clockwise it heads northeast around the city, passing through the northwestern suburbs, the forest of Seich Sou and through to the southeast suburb/borough of Kalamaria. The ring road ends at a large junction with the A25 motorway, which then continues south to Chalkidiki, passing through Thessaloniki's outer southeast suburbs.\nThe speed limit on this motorway is 90 kilometres per hour (56 mph), it currently has three traffic lanes for each direction and forms the city's most vital road link; handling more than 120,000 vehicles daily, instead of 30,000 as it was meant to handle when designed in 1975.\nAn outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (Greek: \u0395\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2, outer ring road) carries all traffic that completely bypasses the city. It is Part of Motorway 2.\n\n\n==== Future plans ====\nDespite the large effort that was made in 2004 to improve the motorway features of the Thessaloniki ring road, the motorway is still insufficient to tackle Thessaloniki's increasing traffic and metropolitan population. To tackle this problem, the government has introduced large scale redevelopment plans throughout 2011 with tenders expected to be announced within early 2012; that include the total restructuring of the A16 in the western side of the city, with new junctions and new emergency lanes throughout the whole length of the motorway. In the eastern side an even larger scale project has been announced, for the construction of a new elevated motorway section above the existing, which would allow faster travel for drivers heading through to the airport and Chalkidiki that do not wish to exit into the city, and will decongest the existing motorway for city commuters. The plans also include adding one more lane in each direction on the existing A16 ring road and on the A25 passing through Thessaloniki's southeast suburbs, from its junction with the A16 in Kalamaria, up to the airport exit (\u0395\u039f67); which will make it an 8 lane highway.Additional long term plans further include the extension of the planned outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (Greek: \u0395\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2, outer ring road) to circle around the entire Thessaloniki metropolitan area, crossing over the Thermaic Gulf from the east, to join with the A1/E75 motorway. Preliminary plans have been announced which include a 4.5 km (3 mi) bridge over the gulf, as part of the southern bypass of the city; to cater for the large number of travellers from Macedonia and the rest of Greece heading to the airport, and to the increasingly popular tourist region of Chalkidiki.\nMotorways:\nA1/E75 W (Republic of North Macedonia, Larissa, Athens)\nA2/E90 W (Kozani, Ioannina, Igoumenitsa) N (Kavala, Xanthi, Alexandroupolis, Turkey)\nA25 (\u0395\u039f12)/\u039579 \u039d (Serres, Bulgaria)\nA25 (\u0395\u039f67) S (Airport, Nea Moudania)\nNational Roads:\n\u0395\u039f2/\u039586 W (Edessa, Giannitsa)\n\u0395\u039f12/\u039579 \u039d (Serres, Drama)\n\u0395\u039f16, SW (Polygyros, Ouranopolis)\n\u0395\u039f65, \u039d (Kilkis, Doirani)\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nConsulates\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nThessaloniki is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nBattle of Thessalonica (fourteen events at various times)\nMacedonians (Greeks)\nMount Chortiatis, above the city\nLake Koroneia, 14 km from the city\nDelta of Axios National Park, west of the city\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\nMunicipality of Thessaloniki\nThessaloniki Port Authority\n\u039f\u0391\u03a3\u0398 \u2013 Organisation of Urban Transport of Thessaloniki (Greek & English)\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nYou in Thessaloniki on YouTube: Official promotional video for Thessaloniki by the Greek National Tourism Organization\nThessaloniki The Official website of the Greek National Tourism Organisation\n\n\n=== Cultural ===\nThessaloniki Concert Hall Organisation\nThessaloniki Film Festival\nThessaloniki Info & Links\nThessaloniki360 Virtual City Guide\nThessaloniki Tsimiski.gr street\n\n\n=== Events ===\nThessaloniki 2012 (celebrations for the 100 years of the incorporation of the city to Greece)\nThessaloniki 2014 (official website of Thessaloniki European Youth Capital 2014)\n\n\n=== Local guides ===\nGreek Local Yellow Pages of Thessaloniki",

        "wiki": "The Arch of Galerius (Greek: \u0391\u03c8\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5) or Kamara (\u039a\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1) and the Rotunda (\u03a1\u03bf\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1) are neighbouring early 4th-century AD monuments in the city of Thessaloniki, in the region of Central Macedonia in northern Greece.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe 4th-century Roman Emperor Galerius commissioned these two structures as elements of an imperial precinct linked to his Thessaloniki palace. Archeologists have found substantial remains of the palace to the southwest. These three monumental structures were connected by a road that ran through the arch, which rose above the major east-west road of the city.\n\nAt the crux of the major axes of the city, the Arch of Galerius emphasized the power of the emperor and linked the monumental structures with the fabric of 4th-century Thessaloniki. The arch was composed of a masonry core faced with marble sculptural panels celebrating a victory over Narses (Narseh), the seventh emperor in the Sassanid Persian Empire, in 299 AD. About two-third of the arch is preserved.\nThe Rotunda was a massive circular structure with a masonry core that had an oculus like the Pantheon in Rome. It has gone through multiple periods of use and modification as a polytheist temple, a Christian basilica, a Muslim mosque, and again a Christian church (and archaeological site). A minaret is preserved from its use as a mosque, and ancient remains are exposed on its southern side.\n\n\n== Location and description of the Arch ==\n\nThe Arch of Galerius stands on what is now the intersection of Egnatia & Dimitriou Gounari streets. The arch was built in 298 to 299 AD and dedicated in 303 AD to celebrate the victory of the tetrarch Galerius over the Sassanid Persians at the Battle of Satala and capture of their capital Ctesiphon in 298.\n\nThe structure was an octopylon (eight-pillared gateway) forming a triple arch that was built of a rubble masonry core faced first with brick and then with marble panels with sculptural relief. The central arched opening was 9.7 m wide and 12.5 m high, and the secondary openings on other side were 4.8 m wide and 6.5 m high. The central arch spanned the portion of the  Via Egnatia (primary Roman road from Dyrrhacium to Byzantium) that passed through the city as a Decumanus (east-west major street). A road connecting the Rotunda (125m northeast) with the Palace complex (235m southwest) passed through the arch along its long axis.\nOnly the northwestern three of the eight pillars and parts of the masonry cores of the arches above survive: i.e., the entire eastern side (4 pillars) and the southernmost one of the western pillars are lost. Extensive consolidation with modern brick has been performed on the exposed masonry cores to protect the monument. The two pillars flanking the central arched passageway retain their sculpted marble slabs, which depict the wars of Galerius against the Persians in broadly panegyric terms.\n\n\n=== Sculptural program of the Arch ===\n\nUnderstanding of the sculptural program of the arch is limited by the loss of the majority of the marble panels, but the remains give an impression of the whole. Four vertically stacked registers of sculpted decoration were carved on each pillar, each separated by elaborate moldings. A label for the Tigris River indicates that there were likely labels on other representations as the builders deemed necessary. Artistic license was taken in the representations, for instance, the Caesar Galerius is shown in personal combat with the Sassanid Shah Narses in one of the panels; although they never met in battle. On the arch a mounted Galerius attacks a similarly mounted Narses with a lance as an eagle bearing a victory wreath in its talons approaches Galerius. The Caesar sits securely on his rearing horse, while the Persian king appears nearly unhorsed. Terrified Persians cower under the hooves of the Caesar's horse in the chaos of battle. The panel expresses the power of the Caesar Galerius.\n\nThe relief of the imperial family conjoined in a sacrifice of thanksgiving owes its distant prototype to the Augustan reliefs on the Ara Pacis in Rome. Galerius' wife, Diocletian's daughter Valeria, is shown at his side, helping authenticate his connection to his predecessor. Here as elsewhere all the faces have been carefully chiselled off, whether as damnatio memoriae or in later cultural intolerance of images.\nIn another panel, the tetrarchs are all arrayed in the toga as a Victoria holds a victory wreath out to the heads of the two Augusti. A third panel celebrates the unity of the tetrarchy, with a depiction of the tetrarchs standing together; the depersonalized manner in which the tetrarchs are portrayed is reminiscent of the schematic statues of the tetrarchs in porphyry at St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. Only Galerius is dressed in armor, and he makes the offering upon the altar.\nWhat remains of the arch asserts the glory of the tetrarchy and the prominence of Galerius within that system. The arch celebrates the Roman Empire as part of Galerius\u2019 victory over the Sassanid king. Galerius is also pictured on his horse at the right, while attacking a Sassanid guard.\n\n\n== Rotunda of Galerius ==\n\n\n=== Location and description of the Rotunda ===\n\nThe Rotunda of Galerius is 125m northeast of the Arch of Galerius at 40\u00b037'59.77\"N, 22\u00b057'9.77\"E. It is also known (by its consecration and use) as the Greek Orthodox Church of Agios Georgios, and is informally called the Church of the Rotunda (or simply The Rotunda).\nThe cylindrical structure was built in 306 AD on the orders of the tetrarch Galerius, who was thought to have intended it to be his mausoleum.The Rotunda has a diameter of 24.5 m. Its walls are more than 6 m thick, which is why it has withstood Thessaloniki's earthquakes. The walls are interrupted by eight rectangular bays, with the west bay forming the entrance. A flat brick dome, 30 m high at the peak, crowns the cylindrical structure. In its original design, the dome of the Rotunda had an oculus, as does the Pantheon in Rome.\n\n\n=== Uses of the Rotunda ===\n\nAfter Galerius's death in 311, he was buried at Gamzigrad (Felix Romuliana) near Zajecar, Serbia. The Rotunda stood empty for several decades until the Emperor Theodosius I ordered its conversion into a Christian church in the late fourth century. The church was embellished with very high quality mosaics. Only fragments have survived of the original decoration, for example, a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer, in front of complex architectural fantasies.\nThe building was used as a church (Church of Asomaton or Archangelon) for over 1,200 years until the city fell to the Ottomans. In 1590 it was converted into a mosque, called the Mosque of Suleyman Hortaji Effendi, and a minaret was added to the structure. It was used as a mosque until 1912, when the Greeks captured the city during the Balkan War. Greek Orthodox officials reconsecrated the structure as a church, and they left the minaret. The structure was damaged during an earthquake in 1978 but was subsequently restored. As of 2004, the minaret was still being stabilized with scaffolding. The building is now a historical monument under the Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities of the Greek Ministry of Culture, although the Greek Orthodox Church has access to the monument for various festivities some days of the year (as Church of Saint George).\nThe Rotunda is the oldest of Thessaloniki's churches. Some Greek publications claim it is the oldest Christian church in the world, although there are competitors for that title. It is the most important surviving example of a church from the early Christian period of the Greek-speaking part of the Roman Empire.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Roman domes\nHistory of Roman and Byzantine domes\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== The arch ===\nDyggve, E.

          "the construction compares very much to the Pantheon in Rome, and to little else in size and spendour. Unfortunately, the mosaics and fresco here are far from the preservation its pendant in Rome has. But still the remnants are impressive and sure worth the 2\u20ac entrance fee. there",

          "It's clear off the bat why this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In fact once you walk into the building, the most amazing part is it actually feels a lot bigger. There isn't a lot of information save for a sign at the entrance, so that was a bit of bummer, but it certainly is",
          "The Rotunda is a circular structure that has a cupola like the Pantheon in Rome. It was built in 306 AD on the orders of the tetrarch Galerius, who intended it to be his mausoleum. After Galerius's death in 311 and his burial at Serbia, the Rotunda stood empty for several years",

        "wiki": "Alexander III of Macedon (Greek: \u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0393\u02b9 \u1f41 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd, Al\u00e9xandros III ho Maked\u020fn; 20/21 July 356 BC \u2013 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great (Greek: \u1f08\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2, Al\u00e9xandros ho M\u00e9gas), was a king (basileus) of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty. He was born in Pella in 356 BC and succeeded his father Philip II to the throne at the age of 20. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through western Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty, he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders.During his youth, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle until age 16. After Philip's assassination in 336 BC, he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. Alexander was awarded the generalship of Greece and used this authority to launch his father's pan-Hellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of Persia. In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Empire (Persian Empire) and began a series of campaigns that lasted 10 years. Following the conquest of Anatolia, Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela. He subsequently overthrew Persian King Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. At that point, his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Beas River.\nAlexander endeavoured to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" and invaded India in 326 BC, winning an important victory over the Pauravas at the Battle of the Hydaspes. He eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops, dying in Babylon in 323 BC, the city that he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the Diadochi, Alexander's surviving generals and heirs.\nAlexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism. He founded some twenty cities that bore his name, most notably Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization, aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the Greek genocide of the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of Achilles, and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He was undefeated in battle and became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves. Military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics. He is often ranked among the most influential people in history.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\n\n=== Lineage and childhood ===\n\nAlexander was born in Pella, the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon, on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion, which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC, although the exact date is uncertain. He was the son of the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias, the daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus. Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander.Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood. According to the ancient Greek biographer Plutarch, on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip, Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread \"far and wide\" before dying away. Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a seal engraved with a lion's image. Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was Zeus. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.On the day Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a siege on the city of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games. It was also said that on this day, the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down. This led Hegesias of Magnesia to say that it had burnt down because Artemis was away, attending the birth of Alexander. Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, Lanike, sister of Alexander's future general Cleitus the Black. Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict Leonidas, a relative of his mother, and by Lysimachus of Acarnania. Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play the lyre, ride, fight, and hunt.\n\nWhen Alexander was ten years old, a trader from Thessaly brought Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteen talents. The horse refused to be mounted, and Philip ordered it away. Alexander, however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow, asked to tame the horse, which he eventually managed. Plutarch stated that Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed his son tearfully, declaring: \"My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is too small for you\", and bought the horse for him. Alexander named it Bucephalas, meaning \"ox-head\". Bucephalas carried Alexander as far as India. When the animal died (because of old age, according to Plutarch, at age thirty), Alexander named a city after him, Bucephala.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nWhen Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for a tutor, and considered such academics as Isocrates and Speusippus, the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the Academy to take up the post. In the end, Philip chose Aristotle and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at Mieza as a classroom. In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown of Stageira, which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those who were in exile.Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles, such as Ptolemy, Hephaistion, and Cassander. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the 'Companions'. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of Homer, and in particular the Iliad; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.During his youth, Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court, who received the protection of Philip II for several years as they opposed Artaxerxes III. Among them were Artabazos II and his daughter Barsine, future mistress of Alexander, who resided at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC, as well as Amminapes, future satrap of Alexander, or a Persian nobleman named Sisines. This gave the Macedonian court a good knowledge of Persian issues, and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the management of the Macedonian state.Suda writes that, also, Anaximenes of Lampsacus was one of his teachers. Anaximenes, also accompanied him on his campaigns.\n\n\n== Philip's heir ==\n\n\n=== Regency and ascent of Macedon ===\n\nAt age 16, Alexander's education under Aristotle ended. Philip waged war against Byzantion, leaving Alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent. During Philip's absence, the Thracian Maedi revolted against Macedonia. Alexander responded quickly, driving them from their territory. He colonized it with Greeks, and founded a city named Alexandropolis.Upon Philip's return, he dispatched Alexander with a small force to subdue revolts in southern Thrace. Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus, Alexander is reported to have saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC, and they marched south through Thermopylae, taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of Elatea, only a few days' march from both Athens and Thebes. The Athenians, led by Demosthenes, voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia. Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes' favour, but Athens won the contest. Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on the request of the Amphictyonic League), capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes and accepting the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it.\n\nAs Philip marched south, his opponents blocked him near Chaeronea, Boeotia. During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea, Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated.After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, welcomed by all cities; however, when they reached Sparta, they were refused, but did not resort to war. At Corinth, Philip established a \"Hellenic Alliance\" (modelled on the old anti-Persian alliance of the Greco-Persian Wars), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta. Philip was then named Hegemon (often translated as \"Supreme Commander\") of this league (known by modern scholars as the League of Corinth), and announced his plans to attack the Persian Empire.\n\n\n=== Exile and return ===\nWhen Philip returned to Pella, he fell in love with and married Cleopatra Eurydice in 338 BC, the niece of his general Attalus. The marriage made Alexander's position as heir less secure, since any son of Cleopatra Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half-Macedonian. During the wedding banquet, a drunken Attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir.\nAt the wedding of Cleopatra, whom Philip fell in love with and married, she being much too young for him, her uncle Attalus in his drink desired the Macedonians would implore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece. This so irritated Alexander, that throwing one of the cups at his head, \"You villain,\" said he, \"what, am I then a bastard?\" Then Philip, taking Attalus's part, rose up and would have run his son through; but by good fortune for them both, either his over-hasty rage, or the wine he had drunk, made his foot slip, so that he fell down on the floor. At which Alexander reproachfully insulted over him: \"See there,\" said he, \"the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia, overturned in passing from one seat to another.\"\nIn 337 BC, Alexander fled Macedon with his mother, dropping her off with her brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with one or more Illyrian kings, perhaps with Glaukias, and was treated as a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.In the following year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him. Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Nearchus, Ptolemy and Erigyius, and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains.\n\n\n== King of Macedon ==\n\n\n=== Accession ===\n\nIn summer 336 BC, while at Aegae attending the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra to Olympias's brother, Alexander I of Epirus, Philip was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards, Pausanias. As Pausanias tried to escape, he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers, including two of Alexander's companions, Perdiccas and Leonnatus. Alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army at the age of 20.\n\n\n=== Consolidation of power ===\nAlexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin, the former Amyntas IV, executed. He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of Lyncestis killed, but spared a third, Alexander Lyncestes. Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa, her daughter by Philip, burned alive. When Alexander learned about this, he was furious. Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus, who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra's uncle.Attalus was at that time corresponding with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to leave alive. Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon. When news of the revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly. He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, and ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force. He then continued south towards the Peloponnese.Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels. The famous encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic occurred during Alexander's stay in Corinth. When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for him, the philosopher disdainfully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side, as he was blocking the sunlight. This reply apparently delighted Alexander, who is reported to have said \"But verily, if I were not Alexander, I would like to be Diogenes.\" At Corinth, Alexander took the title of Hegemon (\"leader\") and, like Philip, was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia. He also received news of a Thracian uprising.\n\n\n=== Balkan campaign ===\n\nBefore crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders. In the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from Amphipolis, he travelled east into the country of the \"Independent Thracians\"; and at Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights. The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi, and defeated their army near the Lyginus river (a tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish.News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulantii were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier.While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace. Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign, leaving Antipater as regent.According to ancient writers Demosthenes called Alexander \"Margites\" (Greek: \u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2) and a boy. Greeks used the word Margites to describe fool and useless people, on account of the Margites.\n\n\n=== Maps of campaigns ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Conquest of the Persian Empire ==\n\n\n=== Asia Minor ===\n\nIn 336 BC Philip II had already sent Parmenion, with Amyntas, Andromenes and Attalus, and an army of 10,000 men into Anatolia to make preparations for an invasion to free the Greeks living on the western coast and islands from Achaemenid rule.  At first, all went well. The Greek cities on the western coast of Anatolia revolted until the news arrived that Philip had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son Alexander. The Macedonians were demoralized by Philip's death and were subsequently defeated near Magnesia by the Achaemenids under the command of the mercenary Memnon of Rhodes.Taking over the invasion project of Philip II, Alexander's army crossed the Hellespont in 334 BC with approximately 48,100 soldiers, 6,100 cavalry and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000, drawn from Macedon and various Greek city-states, mercenaries, and feudally raised soldiers from Thrace, Paionia, and Illyria. He showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods. This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy.After an initial victory against Persian forces at the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of Sardis; he then proceeded along the Ionian coast, granting autonomy and democracy to the cities. Miletus, held by Achaemenid forces, required a delicate siege operation, with Persian naval forces nearby. Further south, at Halicarnassus, in Caria, Alexander successfully waged his first large-scale siege, eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain Memnon of Rhodes and the Persian satrap of Caria, Orontobates, to withdraw by sea. Alexander left the government of Caria to a member of the Hecatomnid dynasty, Ada, who adopted Alexander.From Halicarnassus, Alexander proceeded into mountainous Lycia and the Pamphylian plain, asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the Persians naval bases. From Pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and Alexander moved inland. At Termessos, Alexander humbled but did not storm the Pisidian city. At the ancient Phrygian capital of Gordium, Alexander \"undid\" the hitherto unsolvable Gordian Knot, a feat said to await the future \"king of Asia\". According to the story, Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword.\n\n\n=== The Levant and Syria ===\n\nIn spring 333 BC, Alexander crossed the Taurus into Cilicia. After a long pause due to an illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius' significantly larger army, he marched back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure. He offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.\nAlexander proceeded to take possession of Syria, and most of the coast of the Levant. In the following year, 332 BC, he was forced to attack Tyre, which he captured after a long and difficult siege. The men of military age were massacred and the women and children sold into slavery.\n\n\n=== Egypt ===\n\nWhen Alexander destroyed Tyre, most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated. However, Alexander met with resistance at Gaza. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. When \"his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible... this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the\nattempt\". After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery.Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC, where he was regarded as a liberator. He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert. Henceforth, Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with the Horns of Ammon as a symbol of his divinity. During his stay in Egypt, he founded Alexandria-by-Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom after his death.\n\n\n=== Assyria and Babylonia ===\n\nLeaving Egypt in 331 BC, Alexander marched eastward into Mesopotamia (now northern Iraq) and again defeated Darius, at the Battle of Gaugamela. Darius once more fled the field, and Alexander chased him as far as Arbela. Gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two. Darius fled over the mountains to Ecbatana (modern Hamadan), while Alexander captured Babylon.\n\n\n=== Persia ===\n\nFrom Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, one of the Achaemenid capitals, and captured its treasury. He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.On entering Persepolis, Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days. Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months. During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of Xerxes I and spread to the rest of the city. Possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Persian War by Xerxes; Plutarch and Diodorus allege that Alexander's companion, the hetaera Tha\u00efs, instigated and started the fire. Even as he watched the city burn, Alexander immediately began to regret his decision. Plutarch claims that he ordered his men to put out the fires, but that the flames had already spread to most of the city. Curtius claims that Alexander did not regret his decision until the next morning. Plutarch recounts an anecdote in which Alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of Xerxes as if it were a live person:\n\nShall I pass by and leave you lying there because of the expeditions you led against Greece, or shall I set you up again because of your magnanimity and your virtues in other respects?\n\n\n=== Fall of the Empire and the East ===\n\nAlexander then chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia. The Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny, and was taken prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius' successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander. Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne. The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius.Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him. This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan, and Alexandria Eschate (\"The Furthest\") in modern Tajikistan. The campaign took Alexander through Media, Parthia, Aria (West Afghanistan), Drangiana, Arachosia (South and Central Afghanistan), Bactria (North and Central Afghanistan), and Scythia.In 329 BC, Spitamenes, who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana, betrayed Bessus to Ptolemy, one of Alexander's trusted companions, and Bessus was executed. However, when, at some point later, Alexander was on the Jaxartes dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army, Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt. Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the Battle of Jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes, defeating him in the Battle of Gabai. After the defeat, Spitamenes was killed by his own men, who then sued for peace.\n\n\n=== Problems and plots ===\n \nDuring this time, Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot, and in the Anabasis of Alexander, Arrian states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment, and likely died soon after. It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior to his accusation he had fallen out of favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.\n\n\n=== Macedon in Alexander's absence ===\nWhen Alexander set out for Asia, he left his general Antipater, an experienced military and political leader and part of Philip II's \"Old Guard\", in charge of Macedon. Alexander's sacking of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence. The one exception was a call to arms by Spartan king Agis III in 331 BC, whom Antipater defeated and killed in the battle of Megalopolis. Antipater referred the Spartans' punishment to the League of Corinth, which then deferred to Alexander, who chose to pardon them. There was also considerable friction between Antipater and Olympias, and each complained to Alexander about the other.In general, Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander's campaign in Asia. Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire. However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's strength, greatly weakening it in the years after Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War (171\u2013168 BC).\n\n\n== Indian campaign ==\n\n\n=== Forays into the Indian subcontinent ===\n \n\nAfter the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Raoxshna in Old Iranian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara (a region presently straddling eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan), to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis (Indian name Ambhi), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 talents in gold\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund, supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.\nOn the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5,000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus (Indian name Puru), to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC.\nIn the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought against him from the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos.The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, \"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble.\" A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.After Aornos, Alexander crossed the Indus and fought and won an epic battle against King Porus, who ruled a region lying between the Hydaspes and the Acesines (Chenab), in what is now the Punjab, in the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC. Alexander was impressed by Porus' bravery, and made him an ally. He appointed Porus as satrap, and added to Porus' territory land that he did not previously own, towards the south-east, up to the Hyphasis (Beas). Choosing a local helped him control these lands so distant from Greece. Alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the Hydaspes river, naming one Bucephala, in honour of his horse, who died around this time. The other was Nicaea (Victory), thought to be located at the site of modern-day Mong, Punjab. Philostratus the Elder in the Life of Apollonius of Tyana writes that in the army of Porus there was an elephant who fought brave against Alexander's army and Alexander dedicated it to the Helios (Sun) and named it Ajax, because he thought that a so great animal deserved a great name. The elephant had gold rings around its tusks and an inscription was on them written in Greek: \"Alexander the son of Zeus dedicates Ajax to the Helios\" (\u0391\u039b\u0395\u039e\u0391\u039d\u0394\u03a1\u039f\u03a3 \u039f \u0394\u0399\u039f\u03a3 \u03a4\u039f\u039d \u0391\u0399\u0391\u039d\u03a4\u0391 \u03a4\u03a9\u0399 \u0397\u039b\u0399\u03a9\u0399).\n\n\n=== Revolt of the army ===\n\nEast of Porus' kingdom, near the Ganges River, was the Nanda Empire of Magadha, and further east, the Gangaridai Empire of Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent. Fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, Alexander's army mutinied at the Hyphasis River (Beas), refusing to march farther east. This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests.\nAs for the Macedonians, however, their struggle with Porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into India. For having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand horse, they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river Ganges also, the width of which, as they learned, was thirty-two furlongs, its depth a hundred fathoms, while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes of men-at-arms and horsemen and elephants. For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand chariots, and six thousand war elephants.\nAlexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther, but his general Coenus pleaded with him to change his opinion and return; the men, he said, \"longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland\". Alexander eventually agreed and turned south, marching along the Indus. Along the way his army conquered the Malhi (in modern-day Multan) and other Indian tribes and Alexander sustained an injury during the siege.Alexander sent much of his army to Carmania (modern southern Iran) with general Craterus, and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admiral Nearchus, while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along the Gedrosian Desert and Makran. Alexander reached Susa in 324 BC, but not before losing many men to the harsh desert.\n\n\n== Last years in Persia ==\n\nDiscovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to Susa. As a gesture of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.\n\nAfter three days, unable to persuade his men to back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts in the army and conferred Macedonian military titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men at which he and they ate together. In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year. Meanwhile, upon his return to Persia, Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae had desecrated it, and swiftly executed them. Alexander admired Cyrus the Great, from an early age reading Xenophon's Cyropaedia, which described Cyrus's heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator. During his visit to Pasargadae Alexander ordered his architect Aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus' tomb.Afterwards, Alexander travelled to Ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the Persian treasure. There, his closest friend and possible lover, Hephaestion, died of illness or poisoning. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander, and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in Babylon, as well as a decree for public mourning. Back in Babylon, Alexander planned a series of new campaigns, beginning with an invasion of Arabia, but he would not have a chance to realize them, as he died shortly after Hephaestion.\n\n\n== Death and succession ==\n\nOn either 10 or 11 June 323 BC, Alexander died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are two different versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until he was unable to speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination, foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication, while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness. The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, as the head of the alleged plot. Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence, and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas, Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer. There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.The strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death; such long-acting poisons were probably not available. However, in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander, Leo Schep from the New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed that the plant white hellebore (Veratrum album), which was known in antiquity, may have been used to poison Alexander. In a 2014 manuscript in the journal Clinical Toxicology, Schep suggested Alexander's wine was spiked with Veratrum album, and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the Alexander Romance. Veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was poisoned, Veratrum album offers the most plausible cause. Another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx (modern-day Mavroneri in Arcadia, Greece) that contained calicheamicin, a dangerous compound produced by bacteria.Several natural causes (diseases) have been suggested, including malaria and typhoid fever. A 1998 article in the New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis. Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus. Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.\n\n\n=== After death ===\n\nAlexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed in a gold casket. According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest \"would be happy and unvanquishable forever\". Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative.\n\nWhile Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. His successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late Antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at Amphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege. However, the memorial was found to be dedicated to the dearest friend of Alexander the Great, Hephaestion.\n\nPompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy.The so-called \"Alexander Sarcophagus\", discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 331. However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus' death.\nDemades likened the Macedonian army, after the death of Alexander, to the blinded Cyclop, due to the many random and disorderly movements that it made. In addition, Leosthenes, also, likened the anarchy between the generals, after Alexander's death, to the blinded Cyclop \"who after he had lost his eye went feeling and groping about with his hands before him, not knowing where to lay them\".\n\n\n=== Division of the empire ===\n\nAlexander's death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece, they were not immediately believed. Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was \"t\u00f4i kratist\u00f4i\"\u2014\"to the strongest\". Another theory is that his successors willfully or erroneously misheard \"t\u00f4i Krater\u00f4i\"\u2014\"to Craterus\", the general leading his Macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of Macedonia.Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him.Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only.Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between \"The Successors\" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocs: Ptolemaic Egypt, Seleucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia, Attalid Anatolia, and Antigonid Macedon. In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered.\n\n\n=== Will ===\n\nDiodorus stated that Alexander had given detailed written instructions to Craterus some time before his death. Craterus started to carry out Alexander's commands, but the successors chose not to further implement them, on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant. Nevertheless, Perdiccas read Alexander's will to his troops.Alexander's will called for military expansion into the southern and western Mediterranean, monumental constructions, and the intermixing of Eastern and Western populations. It included:\n\nConstruction of a monumental tomb for his father Philip, \"to match the greatest of the pyramids of Egypt\"\nErection of great temples in Delos, Delphi, Dodona, Dium, Amphipolis, and a monumental temple to Athena at Troy\nConquest of Arabia and the entire Mediterranean basin\nCircumnavigation of Africa\nDevelopment of cities and the \"transplant of populations from Asia to Europe and in the opposite direction from Europe to Asia, in order to bring the largest continent to common unity and to friendship by means of intermarriage and family ties\"\n\n\n== Character ==\n\n\n=== Generalship ===\n\nAlexander earned the epithet \"the Great\" due to his unparalleled success as a military commander. He never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered. This was due to use of terrain, phalanx and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and the fierce loyalty of his troops. The Macedonian phalanx, armed with the sarissa, a spear 6 metres (20 ft) long, had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training, and Alexander used its speed and maneuverability to great effect against larger but more disparate Persian forces. Alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army, which employed various languages and weapons. He overcame this by being personally involved in battle, in the manner of a Macedonian king.In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of his forces, perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000. Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about 3 km (1.86 mi). By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the Persians' scimitars and javelins. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians.At Issus in 333 BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in Bactria and Sogdiana, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center. In India, confronted by Porus' elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers.\n\n\n=== Physical appearance ===\nGreek biographer Plutarch (c.\u2009 45 \u2013 c.\u2009120 AD) describes Alexander's appearance as:\n\nThe outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which Lysippus made, and it was by this artist alone that Alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modelled. For those peculiarities which many of his successors and friends afterwards tried to imitate, namely, the poise of the neck, which was bent slightly to the left, and the melting glance of his eyes, this artist has accurately observed. Apelles, however, in painting him as wielder of the thunder-bolt, did not reproduce his complexion, but made it too dark and swarthy. Whereas he was of a fair colour, as they say, and his fairness passed into ruddiness on his breast particularly, and in his face. Moreover, that a very pleasant odour exhaled from his skin and that there was a fragrance about his mouth and all his flesh, so that his garments were filled with it, this we have read in the Memoirs of Aristoxenus.\nGreek historian Arrian (Lucius Flavius Arrianus 'Xenophon' c.\u2009 86 \u2013 c.\u2009160 AD) described Alexander as:\n\n [T]he strong, handsome commander with one eye dark as the night and one blue as the sky.\nThe semi-legendary Alexander Romance also suggests that Alexander exhibited heterochromia iridum: that one eye was dark and the other light.British historian Peter Green provided a description of Alexander's appearance, based on his review of statues and some ancient documents:\n\n Physically, Alexander was not prepossessing. Even by Macedonian standards he was very short, though stocky and tough. His beard was scanty, and he stood out against his hirsute Macedonian barons by going clean-shaven. His neck was in some way twisted, so that he appeared to be gazing upward at an angle. His eyes (one blue, one brown) revealed a dewy, feminine quality. He had a high complexion and a harsh voice. \nHistorian and Egyptologist Joann Fletcher has said that the Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great had blond hair.Ancient authors recorded that Alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by Lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image. Lysippos had often used the contrapposto sculptural scheme to portray Alexander and other characters such as Apoxyomenos, Hermes and Eros. Lysippos' sculpture, famous for its naturalism, as opposed to a stiffer, more static pose, is thought to be the most faithful depiction.\n\n\n=== Personality ===\n\nSome of Alexander's strongest personality traits formed in response to his parents. His mother had huge ambitions, and encouraged him to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire. Olympias' influence instilled a sense of destiny in him, and Plutarch tells how his ambition \"kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years\". However, his father Philip was Alexander's most immediate and influential role model, as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year, winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds. Alexander's relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality; he had a need to outdo his father, illustrated by his reckless behaviour in battle. While Alexander worried that his father would leave him \"no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world\", he also downplayed his father's achievements to his companions.According to Plutarch, among Alexander's traits were a violent temper and rash, impulsive nature, which undoubtedly contributed to some of his decisions. Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father, he was open to reasoned debate. He had a calmer side\u2014perceptive, logical, and calculating. He had a great desire for knowledge, a love for philosophy, and was an avid reader. This was no doubt in part due to Aristotle's tutelage; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn. His intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general. He had great self-restraint in \"pleasures of the body\", in contrast with his lack of self-control with alcohol.\n\nAlexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences. However, he had little interest in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (tim\u00ea) and glory (kudos). He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death\u2014only Alexander had the ability to do so.During his final years, and especially after the death of Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition, an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical clich\u00e9.He appears to have believed himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. Olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus, a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform. This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen. However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine. Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.\n\n\n=== Personal relationships ===\n\nAlexander married three times: Roxana, daughter of the Sogdian nobleman Oxyartes of Bactria, out of love; and the Persian princesses Stateira II and Parysatis II, the former a daughter of Darius III and latter a daughter of Artaxerxes III, for political reasons. He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon by Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon.Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander. This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months.Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy in modern times. The Roman era writer Athenaeus says, based on the scholar Dicaearchus, who was Alexander's contemporary, that the king \"was quite excessively keen on boys\", and that Alexander sexually embraced his eunuch Bagoas in public. This episode is also told by Plutarch, probably based on the same source. None of Alexander's contemporaries, however, are known to have explicitly described Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion as sexual, though the pair was often compared to Achilles and Patroclus, whom classical Greek culture painted as a couple. Aelian writes of Alexander's visit to Troy where \"Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles, and Hephaestion that of Patroclus, the latter hinting that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles.\" Some modern historians (e.g., Robin Lane Fox) believe not only that Alexander's youthful relationship with Hephaestion was sexual, but that their sexual contacts may have continued into adulthood, which went against the social norms of at least some Greek cities, such as Athens, though some modern researchers have tentatively proposed that Macedonia (or at least the Macedonian court) may have been more tolerant of homosexuality between adults.Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life. However, Ogden calculates that Alexander, who impregnated his partners thrice in eight years, had a higher matrimonial record than his father at the same age. Two of these pregnancies \u2014 Stateira's and Barsine's \u2014 are of dubious legitimacy.According to Diodorus Siculus, Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly, showing great self-control in \"pleasures of the body\". Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her. Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including Ada of Caria, who adopted him, and even Darius' mother Sisygambis, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.\n\n\n== Battle record ==\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nAlexander's legacy extended beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Hellenistic kingdoms ===\n\nAlexander's most immediate legacy was the introduction of Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia. At the time of his death, Alexander's empire covered some 5,200,000 km2 (2,000,000 sq mi), and was the largest state of its time. Many of these areas remained in Macedonian hands or under Greek influence for the next 200\u2013300 years. The successor states that emerged were, at least initially, dominant forces, and these 300 years are often referred to as the Hellenistic period.The eastern borders of Alexander's empire began to collapse even during his lifetime. However, the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful Indian dynasties in history, the Maurya Empire. Taking advantage of this power vacuum, Chandragupta Maurya (referred to in Greek sources as \"Sandrokottos\"), of relatively humble origin, took control of the Punjab, and with that power base proceeded to conquer the Nanda Empire.\n\n\n=== Founding of cities ===\n\nOver the course of his conquests, Alexander founded some twenty cities that bore his name, most of them east of the Tigris. The first, and greatest, was Alexandria in Egypt, which would become one of the leading Mediterranean cities. The cities' locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions. At first, the cities must have been inhospitable, little more than defensive garrisons. Following Alexander's death, many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece. However, a century or so after Alexander's death, many of the Alexandrias were thriving, with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both Greek and local peoples.\n\n\n=== Funding of temples ===\n\nIn 334 BC, Alexander the Great donated funds for the completion of the new temple of Athena Polias in Priene, in modern-day western Turkey. An inscription from the temple, now housed in the British Museum, declares: \"King Alexander dedicated [this temple] to Athena Polias.\" This inscription is one of the few independent archaeological discoveries confirming an episode from Alexander's life. The temple was designed by Pytheos, one of the architects of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus.Libanius wrote that Alexander founded the temple of Zeus Bottiaios (Ancient Greek: \u0392\u03bf\u03c4\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u0394\u1fd6\u03cc\u03c2), in the place where later the city of Antioch was built.\n\n\n=== Hellenization ===\n\nHellenization was coined by the German historian Johann Gustav Droysen to denote the spread of Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. That this export took place is undoubted, and can be seen in the great Hellenistic cities of, for instance, Alexandria, Antioch and Seleucia (south of modern Baghdad). Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture. This culminated in his aspiration to homogenize the populations of Asia and Europe. However, his successors explicitly rejected such policies. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states.The core of the Hellenistic culture promulgated by the conquests was essentially Athenian. The close association of men from across Greece in Alexander's army directly led to the emergence of the largely Attic-based \"koine\", or \"common\" Greek dialect. Koine spread throughout the Hellenistic world, becoming the lingua franca of Hellenistic lands and eventually the ancestor of modern Greek. Furthermore, town planning, education, local government, and art current in the Hellenistic period were all based on Classical Greek ideals, evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as Hellenistic. Aspects of Hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century.\n\n\n==== Hellenization in Central Asia and India ====\n\nSome of the most pronounced effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-rising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250\u2013125 BC) (in modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan) and the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC \u2013 10 AD) in modern Afghanistan and India. On the Silk Road trade routes, Hellenistic culture hybridized with Iranian and Buddhist cultures. The cosmopolitan art and mythology of Gandhara (a region spanning the upper confluence of the Indus, Swat and Kabul rivers in modern Pakistan) of the ~3rd century BC to the ~5th century AD are most evident of the direct contact between Hellenistic civilization and South Asia, as are the Edicts of Ashoka, which directly mention the Greeks within Ashoka's dominion as converting to Buddhism and the reception of Buddhist emissaries by Ashoka's contemporaries in the Hellenistic world. The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China, Sri Lanka and Hellenistic Asia and Europe (Greco-Buddhist monasticism).\nSome of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of the Buddha appeared at this time, perhaps modeled on Greek statues of Apollo in the Greco-Buddhist style. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion: the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks; however, similar practices were also observed amongst the native Indic culture. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan, while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain (Mount Meru) like the petals of a flower. The Yavanajataka (lit. Greek astronomical treatise) and Paulisa Siddhanta texts depict the influence of Greek astronomical ideas on Indian astronomy.\nFollowing the conquests of Alexander the Great in the east, Hellenistic influence on Indian art was far-ranging. In the area of architecture, a few examples of the Ionic order can be found as far as Pakistan with the Jandial temple near Taxila. Several examples of capitals displaying Ionic influences can be seen as far as Patna, especially with the Pataliputra capital, dated to the 3rd century BC. The Corinthian order is also heavily represented in the art of Gandhara, especially through Indo-Corinthian capitals.\n\n\n=== Influence on Rome ===\n\nAlexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans, especially generals, who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements. Polybius began his Histories by reminding Romans of Alexander's achievements, and thereafter Roman leaders saw him as a role model. Pompey the Great adopted the epithet \"Magnus\" and even Alexander's anastole-type haircut, and searched the conquered lands of the east for Alexander's 260-year-old cloak, which he then wore as a sign of greatness. Julius Caesar dedicated a Lysippean equestrian bronze statue but replaced Alexander's head with his own, while Octavian visited Alexander's tomb in Alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from a sphinx to Alexander's profile. The emperor Trajan also admired Alexander, as did Nero and Caracalla. The Macriani, a Roman family that in the person of Macrinus briefly ascended to the imperial throne, kept images of Alexander on their persons, either on jewelry, or embroidered into their clothes.\n\nOn the other hand, some Roman writers, particularly Republican figures, used Alexander as a cautionary tale of how autocratic tendencies can be kept in check by republican values. Alexander was used by these writers as an example of ruler values such as amicita (friendship) and clementia (clemency), but also iracundia (anger) and cupiditas gloriae (over-desire for glory).Emperor Julian in his satire called \"The Caesars\", describes a contest between the previous Roman emperors, with Alexander the Great called in as an extra contestant, in the presence of the assembled gods.\n\n\n=== Unsuccessful plan to cut a canal through the isthmus ===\nPausanias writes that Alexander wanted to dig the Mimas mountain (today at the Karaburun area), but he didn't succeed. He also mentions that this was the only unsuccessful project of Alexander. In addition, Pliny the Elder writes about this unsuccessful plan adding that the distance was 12 kilometres (7 1\u20442 mi), and the purpose was to cut a canal through the isthmus, so as to connect the Caystrian and Hermaean bays.\n\n\n=== Naming of the Icarus island in the Persian Gulf ===\nArrian wrote that  Aristobulus said that the Icarus island (modern Failaka Island) in the Persian Gulf had this name because Alexander ordered the island to be named like this, after the Icarus island in the Aegean Sea.\n\n\n=== Legend ===\n\nLegendary accounts surround the life of Alexander the Great, many deriving from his own lifetime, probably encouraged by Alexander himself. His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in Cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis. Writing shortly after Alexander's death, another participant, Onesicritus, invented a tryst between Alexander and Thalestris, queen of the mythical Amazons. When Onesicritus read this passage to his patron, Alexander's general and later King Lysimachus reportedly quipped, \"I wonder where I was at the time.\"In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in Alexandria, a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the Alexander Romance, later falsely ascribed to Callisthenes and therefore known as Pseudo-Callisthenes. This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages, containing many dubious stories, and was translated into numerous languages.\n\n\n=== In ancient and modern culture ===\n\nAlexander the Great's accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures. Alexander has figured in both high and popular culture beginning in his own era to the present day. The Alexander Romance, in particular, has had a significant impact on portrayals of Alexander in later cultures, from Persian to medieval European to modern Greek.Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore, more so than any other ancient figure. The colloquial form of his name in modern Greek (\"O Megalexandros\") is a household name, and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the Karagiozis shadow play. One well-known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary mermaid who would grasp a ship's prow during a storm and ask the captain \"Is King Alexander alive?\" The correct answer is \"He is alive and well and rules the world!\" causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm. Any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging Gorgon who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea, all hands aboard.\n\nIn pre-Islamic Middle Persian (Zoroastrian) literature, Alexander is referred to by the epithet gujastak, meaning \"accursed\", and is accused of destroying temples and burning the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism. In Sunni Islamic Persia, under the influence of the Alexander Romance (in Persian: \u0627\u0633\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647\u200e Iskandarnamah), a more positive portrayal of Alexander emerges. Firdausi's Shahnameh (\"The Book of Kings\") includes Alexander in a line of legitimate Persian shahs, a mythical figure who explored the far reaches of the world in search of the Fountain of Youth. Later Persian writers associate him with philosophy, portraying him at a symposium with figures such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, in search of immortality.The figure of Dhul-Qarnayn (literally \"the Two-Horned One\") mentioned in the Quran is believed by scholars to be based on later legends of Alexander. In this tradition, he was a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of Gog and Magog. He then travelled the known world in search of the Water of Life and Immortality, eventually becoming a prophet.The Syriac version of the Alexander Romance portrays him as an ideal Christian world conqueror who prayed to \"the one true God\". In Egypt, Alexander was portrayed as the son of Nectanebo II, the last pharaoh before the Persian conquest. His defeat of Darius was depicted as Egypt's salvation, \"proving\" Egypt was still ruled by an Egyptian.According to Josephus, Alexander was shown the Book of Daniel when he entered Jerusalem, which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. This is cited as a reason for sparing Jerusalem.In Hindi and Urdu, the name \"Sikandar\", derived from the Persian name for Alexander, denotes a rising young talent, and the Delhi Sultanate ruler Aladdin Khajli stylized himself as \"Sikandar-i-Sani\" (the Second Alexander the Great). In medieval India, Turkic and Afghan sovereigns from the Iranian-cultured region of Central Asia brought positive cultural connotations of Alexander to the Indian subcontinent, resulting in the efflorescence of Sikandernameh (Alexander Romances) written by Indo-Persian poets such as Amir Khusrow and the prominence of Alexander the Great as a popular subject in Mughal-era Persian miniatures. In medieval Europe, Alexander the Great was revered as a member of the Nine Worthies, a group of heroes whose lives were believed to encapsulate all the ideal qualities of chivalry.In Greek Anthology there are poems referring to Alexander.Irish playwright Aubrey Thomas de Vere wrote Alexander the Great, a Dramatic Poem.\nIn popular culture, the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden included a song titled \"Alexander the Great\" on their 1986 album Somewhere in Time. Written by bass player Steve Harris, the song retells Alexander's life.\n\n\n== Historiography ==\n\nApart from a few inscriptions and fragments, texts written by people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost. Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and Nearchus; Aristobulus, a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these original sources have survived. The earliest of these is Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st century AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd century AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd century AD), and finally Justin, whose work dated as late as the 4th century. Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAlexander the Great in the Qur'an\nAncient Macedonian army\nBucephalus\nChronology of European exploration of Asia\nDiogenes and Alexander\nPtolemaic cult of Alexander the Great\nList of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources\nList of people known as The Great\n\n\n== Annotations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nAlexander the Great (king of Macedonia) at the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\nDelamarche, F\u00e9lix (1833), The Empire and Expeditions of Alexander the Great.\nRomm, James; Cartledge, Paul, \"Two Great Historians On Alexander the Great\", Forbes (conversations) Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, Part 5, Part 6.\nAlexander the Great at Curlie\nAlexander the Great: An annotated list of primary sources, Livius.\nThe Elusive Tomb of Alexander the Great, Arch\u00e6ology.\nAlexander the Great and Sherlock Holmes, Sherlockian Sherlock.\nIn Our Time: Alexander the Great BBC discussion with Paul Cartledge, Diana Spencer and Rachel Mairs hosted by Melvyn Bragg, first broadcast 1 October 2015.",

          "The Monastery of Vlatadon is located on the northern side of Ano Poli of Thessaloniki, close to the castle walls with a magnificent view to the city. The Monastery was established by two monks who were brothers, Dorotheos and Markos Vlatis, which is why the monastery was called",
          "It was a great suprise for us, walking back to the port from the castle, we got to Vlatadon Monastery. It is a beautiful building, the church was amazing, the view was breathtaking.",
          "We walked up here from the port, as we were visiting Thessaloniki from a cruise ship. There are great views over the city. The site is quite large, but most of the buildings were closed to visitors when we were there. There was an interesting small chapel open, also a shop (with",

          "This site is said to be the exact location where St.Paul preached to the Thessalonians. I am not 100% sure but, I found a church in the middle of the site which was very nice and souvenir shop.",
          "This is a UNESCO monastery, and once you go inside, you understand why. Such beautiful frescoes have been preserved.",
          "This small monastery is simply breath-taking. Built on the site where St Paul is believed to have preached to the Thessalonians, it was founded in the mid-14th century and has been in continuous use since then. The small chapel looks quite uninteresting from the outside.",
          "I'm not sure it's worth the drive up just for the view, no matter how panoramic it is (you can get the same view from the Eptapyrgio Castle or anywhere else on that height), especially when the monastery is closed - as it seems to be often. The most important building, located",

          "Did Paul visited this place? Drank the water from here? Climb the wall next to it? I wish there are some explanation or board. The staff in the museum are very friendly. The church is under renovation and repainting.",

          "The moment you step inside the monastery, you are in ancient times. Not only because of the preservation of the objects and hard to beleive artefacts which are 2.000 years old, but becasue of the tranquility of this sacred place. Absolutely amazing view on the city.",

          "This is a very beautiful church and it feels very peaceful to go there. They have some very interesting icons surrounded by a wooden floral frame (corfian school style). A christening was about to take place. Both my partner and I were in shorts. A man who was working there",
          "It's quite a climb to get here but worth it for the views and the sense of being far away from the buzz of the city",

          "Location on a hill top of the city. Great sea view. Quiet and meditative. Simple but evoke spirituality. We walked for 30 minutes uphill. Tough on a sunny day but pleasant in seeing the local houses in an old town area. There is a chapel stands where the spot St. Paul preached",

The monastery of Vlatadon is one of the oldest and most important Byzantine",

          "I was very moved to step inside the small church and see the Byzantine frescoes. The tears were because the Turkish occupiers in 1430 had chipped away at every accessible wall painting. Still it was beautiful and to think Paul preached there was a great thrill.",
          "The monastery it self is in the old part of town and has beautiful views from it. When I was visiting it was Sunday and I ran into a Greek wedding party so it was even more interesting to witness the local wedding customs. The inside is also beautiful so if you like visiting",
          "It was a decent hike to get there but well worth it, such a beautiful Monastery sitting above the whole town from ancient times is a must see",

          "Lovely grounds, complete with peacocks. We went with a friend who is an expert in the Christian history of the region, so he was able to tell us a lot about the various sites and locations. Some of the \"Letters from Paul\" to the Thessalonians were spoken/written here. The monks",

          "Being the only byzantine monastery in Thessaloniki, it really worths a visit. The breathtaking view of the town, the peacocks, the atmosphere of the monastery and the sense of history within its walls are unique. I was astonished by the frescos, which were destroyed during the",
          "Even writing about it is a waist of my time. Nothing intresting, and we searched. Nothing special regarding construction techniques, facade is dull and unappealing. There is an aviary with (ugly) peacocks, nowhere decent to sit, gardens are not kept, gardens is not even the word",

          "I walked there and enjoyed both the walk and the monastery. As another reviewer has said, it's not as far as it looks on the map and it's only the last part that is a little steep. The monastery itself is quite small, but very beautiful. It's a quiet place after the cafe life of",

        "wiki": "The Hagia Sophia (Greek: \u1f09\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u03a3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1, Holy Wisdom) in Thessaloniki, Greece, is one of the oldest churches in that city still standing today. It is one of several monuments in Thessaloniki included as a World Heritage Site on the UNESCO list.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince the 3rd century, there was a church in the location of the current Hagia Sophia. In the 8th century, the present structure was erected, based on the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul, Turkey). In 1205, when the Fourth Crusade captured the city, the Hagia Sophia was converted into the cathedral of Thessaloniki, which it remained after the city was returned to the Byzantine Empire in 1246. After the capture of Thessaloniki by the Ottoman Sultan Murad II on 29 March 1430, the church was converted into a mosque.  It was reconverted to a church upon the liberation of Thessaloniki in 1912.\nIts ground plan is that of a domed Greek cross basilica. Together with the G\u00fcl and the Kalenderhane Mosques in Istanbul and the destroyed Church of the Dormition in Nicaea, it represents one of the main architectural examples of this type, typical of the Byzantine middle period.In the Iconoclastic era, the apse of the church was embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross, similarly to the Hagia Irene in Constantinople and the Church of the Dormition in Nicaea. The cross was substituted with the image of the Theotokos (God-bearer, or Mary) in 787-797 after the victory of the Iconodules. The mosaic in the dome now represents the Ascension with the inscription from Acts 1:11 \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?\". The dome is ringed by the figures of all Twelve Apostles, Mary and two angels.\nBetween 1907 and 1909 Byzantine historian Charles Diehl restored the whole building that underwent many damages during a fire in 1890. Much of the interior decoration was plastered over after the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917. The dome was not restored until 1980.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Roman and Byzantine domes\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCathedral church of Holy God's Wisdom of Thessaloniki\nAgia Sofia Thessaloniki\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKrautheimer, Richard (1986).

          "The church is free and open to the public. There was a funeral going on when I visited. The outside is ok but the inside is impressive. The icons, the chandlers, the designs in the dome are all marvelous. I highly recommend you take a peak inside.",
          "This orthodox is a mandatory stop will in Thessaloniki. Nice open space in front of the church, but the best is it's inside. Its pillars and portraits depict it's old history!! It is a a must stop while in Thessaloniki",

          "Not much to look at from outside, the interior is more impressive, huge pillars and dark wood. However the grounds are neglected. Isn't it in the interests of City/Church to look after those things?",

          "Very nice orthodox church. The Wall and everywhere with Hand painting. A Place to visit. Very peaceful. Although we are not orthodox, we prayed there. A wonderful Place",
          "The architecture shows that this is a structure of the 8th century, a Greek basilica. A lot of history also for this church. Under the Ottomans it was turned into a mosque. Now again it is a Greek-Orthodox basilica. Really nice to visit, and to breath the air of centuries past.",
          "I visited Agia Sofia Church in September 2017. It is an Authentic Greek Orthodox Church. It is old but requires maintenance at least from outside. From the inside the Church is old but I guess it is kept as is on purpose. The location is convenient if you are visiting the city",

          "A very seriously built church for its time. It is rich of engravings, paintings and icons. The church itself is a nice architectural example with the complexity of the building and the improvements which were made after the experience with Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.",
          "A bit too dark for me. I'm glad I visited, but the church did not feel as welcoming as Agios Demetrius. There is certainly a very deep spiritual history, and impressive architecture and mosaics, but not a lot of light and an overall heavy feel for me.",

It is also known in Greek as \u03b7 \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 (i Simprot\u00e9vousa), literally \"the co-capital\", a reference to its historical status as the \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 (Simvasil\u00e9vousa) or \"co-reigning\" city of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, alongside Constantinople.Thessaloniki is located on the Thermaic Gulf, at the northwest corner of the Aegean Sea. It is bounded on the west by the delta of the Axios. The municipality of Thessaloniki, the historical center, had a population of 325,182 in 2011, while the Thessaloniki Urban Area had a population of 824,676 and the Thessaloniki metropolitan area had 1,030,338 inhabitants in 2011. It is Greece's second major economic, industrial, commercial and political centre; it is a major transportation hub for Greece and southeastern Europe, notably through the Port of Thessaloniki. The city is renowned for its festivals, events and vibrant cultural life in general, and is considered to be Greece's cultural capital. Events such as the Thessaloniki International Fair and the Thessaloniki International Film Festival are held annually, while the city also hosts the largest bi-annual meeting of the Greek diaspora. Thessaloniki was the 2014 European Youth Capital.The city of Thessaloniki was founded in 315 BC by Cassander of Macedon. An important metropolis by the Roman period, Thessaloniki was the second largest and wealthiest city of the Byzantine Empire. It was conquered by the Ottomans in 1430, and remained an important seaport and multi-ethnic metropolis during the nearly five centuries of Turkish rule. It passed from the Ottoman Empire to Greece on 8 November 1912. It is home to numerous notable Byzantine monuments, including the Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as several Roman, Ottoman and Sephardic Jewish structures. The city's main university, Aristotle University, is the largest in Greece and the Balkans.Thessaloniki is a popular tourist destination in Greece. In 2013, National Geographic Magazine included Thessaloniki in its top tourist destinations worldwide, while in 2014 Financial Times FDI magazine (Foreign Direct Investments) declared Thessaloniki as the best mid-sized European city of the future for human capital and lifestyle. Among street photographers, the center of Thessaloniki is also considered the most popular destination for street photography in Greece.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe original name of the city was \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thessalon\u00edk\u0113. It was named after princess Thessalonike of Macedon, the half sister of Alexander the Great, whose name means \"Thessalian victory\", from \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 Thessalos, and \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 'victory' (Nike), honoring the Macedonian victory at the Battle of Crocus Field (353/352 BC).\nMinor variants are also found, including \u0398\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thettalon\u00edki, \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 Thessalon\u00edkia, \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thessalon\u00edki, and \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd Thessalonik\u00e9on.The name \u03a3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Salon\u00edki is first attested in Greek in the Chronicle of the Morea (14th century), and is common in folk songs, but it must have originated earlier, as al-Idrisi called it Salunik already in the 12th century. It is the basis for the city's name in other languages: \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0479\u043d\u044a (Solun) in Old Church Slavonic, \u05e1\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05d4 (Salonika) in Ladino, \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0643 (Sel\u00e2nik) in Ottoman Turkish and Selanik in modern Turkish, Salonicco in Italian, Solun or \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d in the local and neighboring South Slavic languages, \u0421\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 (Salon\u00edki) in Russian, and S\u00e3run\u00e3 in Aromanian, and Salonica or Salonika in English.Thessaloniki was revived as the city's official name in 1912, when it joined the Kingdom of Greece during the Balkan Wars. In local speech, the city's name is typically pronounced with a dark and deep L characteristic of Modern Macedonian accent. The name is often abbreviated as \u0398\u03b5\u03c3/\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== From classical antiquity to the Roman Empire ===\n\nThe city was founded around 315 BC by the King Cassander of Macedon, on or near the site of the ancient town of Therma and 26 other local villages. He named it after his wife Thessalonike, a half-sister of Alexander the Great and princess of Macedonia as daughter of Philip II. Under the kingdom of Macedonia the city retained its own autonomy and parliament and evolved to become the most important city in Macedonia.After the fall of the Kingdom of Macedonia in 168 BC, in 148 BC Thessalonica was made the capital of the Roman province of Macedonia.  Thessalonica became a free city of the Roman Republic under Mark Antony in 41 BC. It grew to be an important trade hub located on the Via Egnatia, the road connecting Dyrrhachium with Byzantium, which facilitated trade between Thessaloniki and great centers of commerce such as Rome and Byzantium.  Thessaloniki also lay at the southern end of the main north\u2013south route through the Balkans along the valleys of the Morava and Axios river valleys, thereby linking the Balkans with the rest of Greece. The city became the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia; later it became the capital of all the Greek provinces of the Roman Empire because of its importance in the Balkan peninsula.\nAt the time of the Roman Empire, about 50 A.D., Thessaloniki was also one of the early centers of Christianity; while on his second missionary journey, Paul the Apostle visited this city's chief synagogue on three Sabbaths and sowed the seeds for Thessaloniki's first Christian church.  Later, Paul wrote two letters to the new church at Thessaloniki, preserved in the Biblical canon as First and Second Thessalonians.  Some scholars hold that the First Epistle to the Thessalonians is the first written book of the New Testament.\n\nIn 306 AD, Thessaloniki acquired a patron saint, St. Demetrius, a Christian whom Galerius is said to have put to death. Most scholars agree with Hippolyte Delehaye's theory that Demetrius was not a Thessaloniki native, but his veneration was transferred to Thessaloniki when it replaced Sirmium as the main military base in the Balkans. A basilical church dedicated to St. Demetrius, Hagios Demetrios, was first built in the 5th century AD and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided into the tetrarchy, Thessaloniki became the administrative capital of one of the four portions of the Empire under Galerius Maximianus Caesar, where Galerius commissioned an imperial palace, a new hippodrome, a triumphal arch and a mausoleum among others.In 379, when the Roman Prefecture of Illyricum was divided between the East and West Roman Empires, Thessaloniki became the capital of the new Prefecture of Illyricum. The following year, the Edict of Thessalonica made Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire. In 390, Gothic troops under the Roman Emperor Theodosius I, led a massacre against the inhabitants of Thessalonica, who had risen in revolt against the Gothic soldiers.  By the time of the Fall of Rome in 476, Thessaloniki was the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era and Middle Ages ===\n\nFrom the first years of the Byzantine Empire, Thessaloniki was considered the second city in the Empire after Constantinople, both in terms of wealth and size. with a population of 150,000 in the mid-12th century. The city held this status until its transfer to Venetian control in 1423. In the 14th century, the city's population exceeded 100,000 to 150,000, making it larger than London at the time.During the 6th and 7th centuries, the area around Thessaloniki was invaded by Avars and Slavs, who unsuccessfully laid siege to the city several times, as narrated in the Miracles of Saint Demetrius. Traditional historiography stipulates that many Slavs settled in the hinterland of Thessaloniki; however, modern scholars consider this migration to have been on a much smaller scale than previously thought. In the 9th century, the Byzantine Greek missionaries Cyril and Methodius, both natives of the city, created the first literary language of the Slavs, the Old Church Slavonic, most likely based on the Slavic dialect used in the hinterland of their hometown.An Arab naval attack in 904 resulted in the sack of the city.\nThe economic expansion of the city continued through the 12th century as the rule of the Komnenoi emperors expanded Byzantine control to the north. Thessaloniki passed out of Byzantine hands in 1204, when Constantinople was captured by the forces of the Fourth Crusade and incorporated the city and its surrounding territories in the Kingdom of Thessalonica \u2014 which then became the largest vassal of the Latin Empire. In 1224, the Kingdom of Thessalonica was overrun by the Despotate of Epirus, a remnant of the former Byzantine Empire, under Theodore Komnenos Doukas who crowned himself Emperor, and the city became the capital of the short-lived Empire of Thessalonica. Following his defeat at Klokotnitsa however in 1230, the Empire of Thessalonica became a vassal state of the Second Bulgarian Empire until it was recovered again in 1246, this time by the Nicaean Empire.In 1342, the city saw the rise of the Commune of the Zealots, an anti-aristocratic party formed of sailors and the poor, which is nowadays described as social-revolutionary. The city was practically independent of the rest of the Empire, as it had its own government, a form of republic. The zealot movement was overthrown in 1350 and the city was reunited with the rest of the Empire.The capture of Gallipoli by the Ottomans in 1354 kicked off a rapid Turkish expansion in the southern Balkans, conducted both by the Ottomans themselves and by semi-independent Turkish ghazi warrior-bands. By 1369, the Ottomans were able to conquer Adrianople (modern Edirne), which became their new capital until 1453. Thessalonica, ruled by Manuel II Palaiologos (r. 1391\u20131425) itself surrendered after a lengthy siege in 1383\u20131387, along with most of eastern and central Macedonia, to the forces of Sultan Murad I. Initially, the surrendered cities were allowed complete autonomy in exchange for payment of the kharaj poll-tax. Following the death of Emperor John V Palaiologos in 1391, however, Manuel II escaped Ottoman custody and went to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor, succeeding his father. This angered Sultan Bayezid I, who laid waste to the remaining Byzantine territories, and then turned on Chrysopolis, which was captured by storm and largely destroyed. Thessalonica too submitted again to Ottoman rule at this time, possibly after brief resistance, but was treated more leniently: although the city was brought under full Ottoman control, the Christian population and the Church retained most of their possessions, and the city retained its institutions.\n\nThessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until 1403, when Emperor Manuel II sided with Bayezid's eldest son S\u00fcleyman in the Ottoman succession struggle that broke out following the crushing defeat and capture of Bayezid at the Battle of Ankara against Tamerlane in 1402. In exchange for his support, in the Treaty of Gallipoli the Byzantine emperor secured the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the Chalcidice peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers Strymon and Pineios. Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous appanage to John VII Palaiologos. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the Despot Andronikos Palaiologos, who was supervised by Demetrios Leontares until 1415. Thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity after 1403, as the Turks were preoccupied with their own civil war, but was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by Musa \u00c7elebi) and 1416 (during the uprising of Mustafa \u00c7elebi against Mehmed I). Once the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city began to increase again. Just as during the 1383\u20131387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western help, or submission to the Ottomans.In 1423, Despot Andronikos Palaiologos ceded it to the Republic of Venice with the hope that it could be protected from the Ottomans who were besieging the city. The Venetians held Thessaloniki until it was captured by the Ottoman Sultan Murad II on 29 March 1430.\n\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n\nWhen Sultan Murad II captured Thessaloniki and sacked it in 1430, contemporary reports estimated that about one-fifth of the city's population was enslaved. Ottoman artillery was used to secure the city's capture and bypass its double walls. Upon the conquest of Thessaloniki, some of its inhabitants escaped, including intellectuals such as Theodorus Gaza \"Thessalonicensis\" and Andronicus Callistus. However, the change of sovereignty from the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman one did not affect the city's prestige as a major imperial city and trading hub. Thessaloniki and Smyrna, although smaller in size than Constantinople, were the Ottoman Empire's most important trading hubs. Thessaloniki's importance was mostly in the field of shipping, but also in manufacturing, while most of the city's trade was controlled by ethnic Greeks.\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, the city's population of Ottoman Muslims (including those of Turkish origin, as well as Albanian Muslim, Bulgarian Muslim and Greek Muslim of convert origin) grew substantially. According to the 1478 census Sel\u00e2nik (Ottoman Turkish: \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0643\u200e), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniots community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the city's population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regime's invitation to Jewish settlement was a strategy to prevent the ethnic Greek population from dominating the city.Thessaloniki was the capital of the Sanjak of Selanik within the wider Rumeli Eyalet (Balkans) until 1826, and subsequently the capital of Selanik Eyalet (after 1867, the Selanik Vilayet). This consisted of the sanjaks of Selanik, Serres and Drama between 1826 and 1912.\n\nWith the break out of the Greek War of Independence in the spring of 1821, the governor Yusuf Bey imprisoned in his headquarters more than 400 hostages. On 18 May, when Yusuf learned of the insurrection to the villages of Chalkidiki, he ordered half of his hostages to be slaughtered before his eyes. The mulla of Thessaloniki, Hayr\u0131\u00fclah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations: \"Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning. It seems that Yusuf Bey, the Yeniceri Agasi, the Suba\u015f\u0131, the hocas and the ulemas have all gone raving mad.\" It would take until the end of the century for the city's Greek community to recover.Thessaloniki was also a Janissary stronghold where novice Janissaries were trained. In June 1826, regular Ottoman soldiers attacked and destroyed the Janissary base in Thessaloniki while also killing over 10,000 Janissaries, an event known as The Auspicious Incident in Ottoman history. In 1870\u20131917, driven by economic growth, the city's population expanded by 70%, reaching 135,000 in 1917.The last few decades of Ottoman control over the city were an era of revival, particularly in terms of the city's infrastructure. It was at that time that the Ottoman administration of the city acquired an \"official\" face with the creation of the Government House while a number of new public buildings were built in the eclectic style in order to project the European face both of Thessaloniki and the Ottoman Empire. The city walls were torn down between 1869 and 1889, efforts for a planned expansion of the city are evident as early as 1879, the first tram service started in 1888 and the city streets were illuminated with electric lamp posts in 1908. In 1888 the Oriental Railway connected Thessaloniki to Central Europe via rail through Belgrade and to Monastir in 1893, while the Thessaloniki-Istanbul Junction Railway connected it to Constantinople in 1896.\n\n\n=== 20th century and since ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, Thessaloniki was in the center of radical activities by various groups; the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, founded in 1897, and the Greek Macedonian Committee, founded in 1903. In 1903 an anarchist group known as the Boatmen of Thessaloniki planted bombs in several buildings in Thessaloniki, including the Ottoman Bank, with some assistance from the IMRO. The Greek consulate in Ottoman Thessaloniki (now the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle) served as the center of operations for the Greek guerillas.\nDuring this period, and since the 14th century, Thessaloniki's Jewish element was the most dominant; it was the only city in Europe where the Jews were a majority of the total population. The city was ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan. In 1890 its population had risen to 118,000, 47% of which were Jews, followed by Turks (22%), Greeks (14%), Bulgars (8%), Roma (2%), and others (7%). By 1913, the ethnic composition of the city had changed so that the population stood at 157,889, with Jews at 39%, followed again by Turks (29%), Greeks (25%), Bulgars (4%), Roma (2%), and others at 1%. Many varied religions were practiced and many languages spoken, including Ladino, a dialect of Spanish spoken by the city's Jews.\nThessaloniki was also the center of activities of the Young Turks, a political reform movement, which goal was to replace the Ottoman Empire's absolute monarchy with a constitutional government. The Young Turks started out as an underground movement, until finally in 1908, they started the Young Turk Revolution from the city of Thessaloniki, by which their revolutionaries gained control over the Ottoman Empire. Eleftherias (Liberty) Square, where the Young Turks gathered at the outbreak of the revolution, is named after the event.\n\nAs the First Balkan War broke out, Greece declared war on the Ottoman Empire and expanded its borders. When Eleftherios Venizelos, Prime Minister at the time, was asked if the Greek army should move towards Thessaloniki or Monastir (now Bitola, Republic of North Macedonia), Venizelos replied \"\u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2!\" (Thessaloniki, at all costs!). As both Greece and Bulgaria wanted Thessaloniki, the Ottoman garrison of the city entered negotiations with both armies. On 8 November 1912 (26 October Old Style), the feast day of the city's patron saint, Saint Demetrius, the Greek Army accepted the surrender of the Ottoman garrison at Thessaloniki. The Bulgarian army arrived one day after the surrender of the city to Greece and Tahsin Pasha, ruler of the city, told the Bulgarian officials that \"I have only one Thessaloniki, which I have surrendered\". After the Second Balkan War, Thessaloniki and the rest of the Greek portion of Macedonia were officially annexed to Greece by the Treaty of Bucharest in 1913. On 18 March 1913 George I of Greece was assassinated in the city by Alexandros Schinas.In 1915, during World War I, a large Allied expeditionary force established a base at Thessaloniki for operations against pro-German Bulgaria. This culminated in the establishment of the Macedonian Front, also known as the Salonika Front. In 1916, pro-Venizelist Greek army officers and civilians, with the support of the Allies, launched an uprising, creating a pro-Allied temporary government by the name of the \"Provisional Government of National Defence\" that controlled the \"New Lands\" (lands that were gained by Greece in the Balkan Wars, most of Northern Greece including Greek Macedonia, the North Aegean as well as the island of Crete); the official government of the King in Athens, the \"State of Athens\", controlled \"Old Greece\" which were traditionally monarchist. The State of Thessaloniki was disestablished with the unification of the two opposing Greek governments under Venizelos, following the abdication of King Constantine in 1917.On 30 December 1915 an Austrian air raid on Thessaloniki alarmed many town civilians and killed at least one person, and in response the Allied troops based there arrested the German and Austrian and Bulgarian and Turkish vice-consuls and their families and dependents and put them on a battleship, and billeted troops in their consulate buildings in Thessaloniki.\n\nMost of the old center of the city was destroyed by the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, which was started accidentally by an unattended kitchen fire on 18 August 1917. The fire swept through the centre of the city, leaving 72,000 people homeless; according to the Pallis Report, most of them were Jewish (50,000). Many businesses were destroyed, as a result, 70% of the population were unemployed. Two churches and many synagogues and mosques were lost. Nearly one-quarter of the total population of approximately 271,157 became homeless. Following the fire the government prohibited quick rebuilding, so it could implement the new redesign of the city according to the European-style urban plan prepared by a group of architects, including the Briton Thomas Mawson, and headed by French architect Ernest H\u00e9brard. Property values fell from 6.5 million Greek drachmas to 750,000.After the defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War and during the break-up of the Ottoman Empire, a population exchange took place between Greece and Turkey. Over 160,000 ethnic Greeks deported from the former Ottoman Empire \u2013 particularly Greeks from Asia Minor  and East Thrace were resettled in the city, changing its demographics. Additionally many of the city's Muslims, including Ottoman Greek Muslims, were deported to Turkey, ranging at about 20,000 people. This made the Greek element dominant, while the Jewish population was reduced to a minority for the first time since the 14th century.\n\nDuring World War II Thessaloniki was heavily bombarded by Fascist Italy (with 232 people dead, 871 wounded and over 800 buildings damaged or destroyed in November 1940 alone), and, the Italians having failed in their invasion of Greece, it fell to the forces of Nazi Germany on 8 April 1941 and went under German occupation. The Nazis soon forced the Jewish residents into a ghetto near the railroads and on 15 March 1943 began the deportation of the city's Jews to Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. Most were immediately sent to the gas chambers. Of the 45,000 Jews deported to Auschwitz, only 4% survived.\n\nDuring a speech in Reichstag, Hitler claimed that the intention of his Balkan campaign, was to prevent the Allies from establishing \"a new Macedonian front\", like they did during WWI. The importance of Thessaloniki to Nazi Germany can be demonstrated by the fact that, initially, Hitler had planned to incorporate it directly in the Third Reich (that is, make it part of Germany) and not have it controlled by a puppet state such as the Hellenic State or an ally of Germany (Thessaloniki had been promised to Yugoslavia as a reward for joining the Axis on 25 March 1941). As it was the first major city in Greece to fall to the occupying forces, the first Greek resistance group formed in Thessaloniki (under the name \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, Elefther\u00eda, \"Freedom\") as well as the first anti-Nazi newspaper in an occupied territory anywhere in Europe, also by the name Eleftheria. Thessaloniki was also home to a military camp-converted-concentration camp, known in German as \"Konzentrationslager Pavlo Mela\" (Pavlos Melas Concentration Camp), where members of the resistance and other anti-fascists were held either to be killed or sent to other concentration camps. On 30 October 1944, after battles with the retreating German army and the Security Battalions of Poulos, forces of ELAS entered Thessaloniki as liberators headed by Markos Vafiadis (who didn't obey to orders from ELAS leadership in Athens to not enter the city). Pro-EAM celebrations and demonstrations followed in the city. In the 1946 monarchy referendum, the majority of the locals voted in favor of a republic, contrary to the rest of Greece.After the war, Thessaloniki was rebuilt with large-scale development of new infrastructure and industry throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Many of its architectural treasures still remain, adding value to the city as a tourist destination, while several early Christian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1988. In 1997, Thessaloniki was celebrated as the European Capital of Culture, sponsoring events across the city and the region. Agency established to oversee the cultural activities of that year 1997 was still in existence by 2010. In 2004 the city hosted a number of the football events as part of the 2004 Summer Olympics.Today, Thessaloniki has become one of the most important trade and business hubs in Southeastern Europe, with its port, the Port of Thessaloniki being one of the largest in the Aegean and facilitating trade throughout the Balkan hinterland. On 26 October 2012 the city celebrated its centennial since its incorporation into Greece. The city also forms one of the largest student centers in Southeastern Europe, is host to the largest student population in Greece and was the European Youth Capital in 2014.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nThessaloniki lies on the northern fringe of the Thermaic Gulf on its eastern coast and is bound by Mount Chortiatis on its southeast. Its proximity to imposing mountain ranges, hills and fault lines, especially towards its southeast have historically made the city prone to geological changes.\nSince medieval times, Thessaloniki was hit by strong earthquakes, notably in 1759, 1902, 1978 and 1995. On 19\u201320 June 1978, the city suffered a series of powerful earthquakes, registering 5.5 and 6.5 on the Richter scale. The tremors caused considerable damage to a number of buildings and ancient monuments, but the city withstood the catastrophe without any major problems. One apartment building in central Thessaloniki collapsed during the second earthquake, killing many, raising the final death toll to 51.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThessaloniki's climate is directly affected by the sea it is situated on. The city lies in a transitional climatic zone, so its climate displays characteristics of several climates. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, it has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) that borders on a Mediterranean climate (Csa), as well as a semi-arid climate (BSk), observed on the periphery of the region. Its average annual precipitation of 450 mm (17.7 inches) is due to the Pindus rain shadow drying the westerly winds. However, the city has a summer precipitation between 20 to 30 mm (0.79 to 1.18 inches), which prevents it from qualifying as a Mediterranean climate (Csa), and increases gradually towards the north and west, turning humid subtropical.Winters are relatively dry, with common morning frost. Snowfalls occur sporadically more or less every winter, but the snow cover does not last for more than a few days. Fog is common, with an average of 193 foggy days in a year. During the coldest winters, temperatures can drop to \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F). The record minimum temperature in Thessaloniki was \u221214 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F). On average, Thessaloniki experiences frost (sub-zero temperature) 32 days a year. The coldest month of the year in the city is January, with an average 24-hour temperature of 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F). Wind is also usual in the winter months, with December and January having an average wind speed of 26 km/h (16 mph).Thessaloniki's summers are hot and quite dry. Maximum temperatures usually rise above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), but they rarely approach or go over 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F); the average number of days the temperature is above 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) is 32. The maximum recorded temperature in the city was 44 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F). Rain seldom falls in summer, mainly during thunderstorms. In the summer months Thessaloniki also experiences strong heat waves. The hottest month of the year in the city is July, with an average 24-hour temperature of 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F). The average wind speed for June and July in Thessaloniki is 20 kilometres per hour (12 mph).\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAccording to the Kallikratis reform, as of 1 January 2011 the Thessaloniki Urban Area (Greek: \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2) which makes up the \"City of Thessaloniki\", is made up of six self-governing municipalities (Greek: \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9) and one municipal unit (Greek: \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1). The municipalities that are included in the Thessaloniki Urban Area are those of Thessaloniki (the city center and largest in population size), Kalamaria, Neapoli-Sykies, Pavlos Melas, Kordelio-Evosmos, Ampelokipoi-Menemeni, and the municipal units of Pylaia and Panorama, part of the municipality of Pylaia-Chortiatis. Prior to the Kallikratis reform, the Thessaloniki Urban Area was made up of twice as many municipalities, considerably smaller in size, which created bureaucratic problems.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki Municipality ===\n\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki (Greek: \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2) is the second most populous in Greece, after Athens, with a resident population of 325,182 (in 2011) and an area of 19.307 square kilometres (7.454 square miles). The municipality forms the core of the Thessaloniki Urban Area, with its central district (the city center), referred to as the Kentro, meaning 'center' or 'downtown'.The city's first mayor, Osman Sait Bey, was appointed when the institution of mayor was inaugurated under the Ottoman Empire in 1912. The incumbent mayor is Konstantinos Zervas. In 2011, the municipality of Thessaloniki had a budget of \u20ac464.33 million while the budget of 2012 stands at \u20ac409.00 million.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nThessaloniki is the second largest city in Greece. It is an influential city for the northern parts of the country and is the capital of the region of Central Macedonia and the Thessaloniki regional unit. The Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace is also based in Thessaloniki, being that the city is the de facto capital of the Greek region of Macedonia.It is customary every year for the Prime Minister of Greece to announce his administration's policies on a number of issues, such as the economy, at the opening night of the Thessaloniki International Fair. In 2010, during the first months of the 2010 Greek debt crisis, the entire cabinet of Greece met in Thessaloniki to discuss the country's future.In the Hellenic Parliament, the Thessaloniki urban area constitutes a 16-seat constituency. As of the 2019 Greek legislative election the largest party in Thessaloniki is the New Democracy with 35.55% of the vote, followed by the Coalition of the Radical Left (31.29%) and the Movement for Change (6.05%). The table below summarizes the results of the latest elections.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nArchitecture in Thessaloniki is the direct result of the city's position at the centre of all historical developments in the Balkans. Aside from its commercial importance, Thessaloniki was also for many centuries the military and administrative hub of the region, and beyond this the transportation link between Europe and the Levant.\nMerchants, traders and refugees from all over Europe settled in the city. The need for commercial and public buildings in this new era of prosperity led to the construction of large edifices in the city center. During this time, the city saw the building of banks, large hotels, theatres, warehouses, and factories. Architects who designed some of the most notable buildings of the city, in the late 19th and early 20th century, include Vitaliano Poselli, Pietro Arrigoni, Xenophon Paionidis, Salvatore Poselli, Leonardo Gennari, Eli Modiano, Mosh\u00e9 Jacques, Joseph Pleyber, Frederic Charnot, Ernst Ziller, Roubens Max, Levi Ernst, Angelos Siagas, Alexandros Tzonis using mainly the styles of Eclecticism, Art Nouveau and Neobaroque.\n\nThe city layout changed after 1870, when the seaside fortifications gave way to extensive piers, and many of the oldest walls of the city were demolished, including those surrounding the White Tower, which today stands as the main landmark of the city. As parts of the early Byzantine walls were demolished, this allowed the city to expand east and west along the coast.The expansion of Eleftherias Square towards the sea completed the new commercial hub of the city and at the time was considered one of the most vibrant squares of the city. As the city grew, workers moved to the western districts, because of their proximity to factories and industrial activities; while the middle and upper classes gradually moved from the city-center to the eastern suburbs, leaving mainly businesses. In 1917, a devastating fire swept through the city and burned uncontrollably for 32 hours. It destroyed the city's historic center and a large part of its architectural heritage, but paved the way for modern development featuring wider diagonal avenues and monumental squares.\n\n\n=== City centre ===\n\nAfter the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, a team of architects and urban planners including Thomas Mawson and Ernest Hebrard, a French architect, chose the Byzantine era as the basis of their (re)building designs for Thessaloniki's city centre. The new city plan included axes, diagonal streets and monumental squares, with a street grid that would channel traffic smoothly. The plan of 1917 included provisions for future population expansions and a street and road network that would be, and still is sufficient today. It contained sites for public buildings and provided for the restoration of Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques.\n\nAlso called the historic centre, it is divided into several districts, including Dimokratias Square (Democracy Sq. known also as Vardaris) Ladadika (where many entertainment venues and tavernas are located), Kapani (were the city's central Modiano market is located), Diagonios, Navarinou, Rotonda, Agia Sofia and Hippodromio, which are all located around Thessaloniki's most central point, Aristotelous Square.\nVarious commercial stoas around Aristotelous are named from the city's past and historic personalities of the city, like stoa Hirsch, stoa Carasso/Ermou, Pelosov, Colombou, Modiano, Morpurgo, Mordoch, Simcha, Malakopi, Olympios, Emboron, Rogoti, Vyzantio, Tatti, Agiou Mina, Karipi etc.The western portion of the city centre is home to Thessaloniki's law courts, its central international railway station and the port, while its eastern side hosts the city's two universities, the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Centre, the city's main stadium, its archaeological and Byzantine museums, the new city hall and its central parks and gardens, namely those of the \u03a7\u0391\u039d\u0398 and Pedion tou Areos.\n\n\n=== Ano Poli ===\n\nAno Poli (also called Old Town and literally the Upper Town) is the heritage listed district north of Thessaloniki's city center that was not engulfed by the great fire of 1917 and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site by ministerial actions of Melina Merkouri, during the 1980s. It consists of Thessaloniki's most traditional part of the city, still featuring small stone paved streets, old squares and homes featuring old Greek and Ottoman architecture. It is the favorite area of Thessaloniki's poets, intellectuals and bohemians.\n\nAno Poli also, is the highest point in Thessaloniki and as such, is the location of the city's acropolis, its Byzantine fort, the Heptapyrgion, a large portion of the city's remaining walls, and with many of its additional Ottoman and Byzantine structures still standing. The area provides access to the Seich Sou Forest National Park and features panoramic views of the whole city and the Thermaic Gulf. On clear days Mount Olympus, at about 100 km (62 mi) away across the gulf, can also be seen towering the horizon.\n\n\n=== Northwestern Thessaloniki ===\nNorthwestern Thessaloniki had always been associated with industry and the working class because as the city grew during the 1920s, many workers had moved there, because of its proximity near factories and industrial activities.\nToday many factories and industries have been moved further out west and the area is experiencing rapid growth as does the southeast. Many factories in this area have been converted to cultural centers, while past military grounds that are being surrounded by densely built neighborhoods are awaiting transformation into parklands.\nNorthwest Thessaloniki forms the main entry point into the city of Thessaloniki with the avenues of Monastiriou, Lagkada and 26is Octovriou passing through it, as well as the extension of the A1 motorway, feeding into Thessaloniki's city center. The area is home to the Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal (KTEL), the Zeitenlik Allied memorial military cemetery and to large entertainment venues of the city, such as Milos, Fix, Vilka (which are housed in converted old factories). Northwestern Thessaloniki is also home to Moni Lazariston, located in Stavroupoli, which today forms one of the most important cultural centers for the city, including MOMus\u2013Museum of Modern Art\u2013Costakis Collection and two theatres of the National Theatre of Northern Greece. Construction on the Holocaust Museum of Greece began in the city in 2018 in the area of the Old Railway Station.\nIn this area are located the Railway Museum of Thessaloniki and the Water Supply Museum.\n\n\n=== Southeastern Thessaloniki ===\n\nThe area along the today Vasileos Georgiou and Vasilissis Olgas avenues, was up until the 1920s home to the city's most affluent residents and formed the outermost suburbs of the city at the time, with the area close to the Thermaic Gulf coast called Exoch\u00e8s (des Campagnes), from the 19th century holiday villas which defined the area. Some of them include Villa Allatini, Villa Bianca, Villa Mehmet Kapanci, Villa Modiano, Villa Mordoch and others.Today southeastern Thessaloniki has in some way become a natural extension of the city center, with the avenues of Megalou Alexandrou, Georgiou Papandreou (Antheon), Vasileos Georgiou, Vasilissis Olgas, Delfon, Konstantinou Karamanli (Nea Egnatia) and Papanastasiou passing through it, enclosing an area traditionally called \u039d\u03c4\u03b5\u03c0\u03ce (Dep\u00f3, lit. D\u00e9p\u00f4t), from the name of the old tram station, owned by a French company.\nThe municipality of Kalamaria is also located in southeastern Thessaloniki and was firstly inhabited mainly by Greek refugees from Asia Minor and East Thrace after 1922.Southeastern Thessaloniki is also home to three of the city's football stadiums, the Thessaloniki Concert Hall, the Poseidonio aquatic and athletic complex, the Northern Greece Naval Command and the old royal palace (called Palataki), located on the most westerly point of Karabournaki cape.\nOther extended residential areas that belong to southeastern Thessaloniki are Charilaou and Toumba, which is divided in \"Ano Toumpa\" and \"Kato Toumpa\". Toumba was named after the homonymous hill of Toumba, situated in the northwest of the area. It was created by refugees after the 1922 Asia Minor disaster and the population exchange (1923\u201324). Toumba is one of the most famous areas of Thessaloniki, mainly due to the football stadium of the local team PAOK FC and its important archaeological site on the hill of Toumba, where extensive archaeological research takes place.\n\n\n=== Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments (UNESCO) ===\n\nBecause of Thessaloniki's importance during the early Christian and Byzantine periods, the city is host to several paleochristian monuments that have significantly contributed to the development of Byzantine art and architecture throughout the Byzantine Empire as well as Serbia. The evolution of Imperial Byzantine architecture and the prosperity of Thessaloniki go hand in hand, especially during the first years of the Empire, when the city continued to flourish. It was at that time that the Complex of Roman emperor Galerius was built, as well as the first church of Hagios Demetrios.By the 8th century, the city had become an important administrative center of the Byzantine Empire, and handled much of the Empire's Balkan affairs. During that time, the city saw the creation of more notable Christian churches that are now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as Hagia Sophia of Thessaloniki, the Church of the Acheiropoietos, the Church of Panagia Chalkeon. When the Ottoman Empire took control of Thessaloniki in 1430, most of the city's churches were converted into mosques, but have survived to this day. Travelers such as Paul Lucas and Abdulmejid I document the city's wealth in Christian monuments during the years of the Ottoman control of the city.\nThe church of Hagios Demetrios was burnt down during the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, as did many other of the city's monuments, but it was rebuilt. During World War II, the city was extensively bombed and as such many of Thessaloniki's paleochristian and Byzantine monuments were heavily damaged. Some of the sites were not restored until the 1980s. Thessaloniki has more UNESCO World Heritage Sites listed than any other city in Greece, a total of 15 monuments. They have been listed since 1988.\n\n\n=== Urban sculpture ===\n\nThere are around 150 statues or busts in the city. Probably the most famous one is the equestrian statue of Alexander the Great on the promenade, placed in 1973 and created by sculptor Evangelos Moustakas. An equestrian statue of Constantine I, by sculptor Georgios Dimitriades, is located in Demokratias Square. Other notable statues include that of Eleftherios Venizelos by sculptor Giannis Pappas, Pavlos Melas by Natalia Mela, the statue of Emmanouel Pappas by Memos Makris, Chrysostomos of Smyrna by Athanasios Apartis, such as various creations by George Zongolopoulos.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki 2012 Program ===\n\nWith the 100th anniversary of the 1912 incorporation of Thessaloniki into Greece, the government announced a large-scale redevelopment program for the city of Thessaloniki, which aims in addressing the current environmental and spatial problems that the city faces. More specifically, the program will drastically change the physiognomy of the city by relocating the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center and grounds of the Thessaloniki International Fair outside the city centre and turning the current location into a large metropolitan park, redeveloping the coastal front of the city, relocating the city's numerous military camps and using the grounds and facilities to create large parklands and cultural centers; and the complete redevelopment of the harbor and the Lachanokipoi and Dendropotamos districts (behind and near the Port of Thessaloniki) into a commercial business district, with possible highrise developments.The plan also envisions the creation of new wide avenues in the outskirts of the city and the creation of pedestrian-only zones in the city centre. Furthermore, the program includes plans to expand the jurisdiction of Seich Sou Forest National Park and the improvement of accessibility to and from the Old Town. The ministry has said that the project will take an estimated 15 years to be completed, in 2025.Part of the plan has been implemented with extensive pedestrianization's within the city center by the municipality of Thessaloniki and the revitalization the eastern urban waterfront/promenade, \u039d\u03ad\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 (N\u00e9a Paral\u00eda, lit. new promenade), with a modern and vibrant design. Its first section opened in 2008, having been awarded as the best public project in Greece of the last five years by the Hellenic Institute of Architecture.The municipality of Thessaloniki's budget for the reconstruction of important areas of the city and the completion of the waterfront, opened in January 2014, was estimated at around \u20ac28.2 million (US$39.9 million) for the year 2011 alone.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThessaloniki rose to economic prominence as a major economic hub in the Balkans during the years of the Roman Empire. The Pax Romana and the city's strategic position allowed for the facilitation of trade between Rome and Byzantium (later Constantinople and now Istanbul) through Thessaloniki by means of the Via Egnatia. The Via Egnatia also functioned as an important line of communication between the Roman Empire and the nations of Asia, particularly in relation to the Silk Road. With the partition of the Roman Emp. into East (Byzantine) and West, Thessaloniki became the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire after New Rome (Constantinople) in terms of economic might. Under the Empire, Thessaloniki was the largest port in the Balkans. As the city passed from Byzantium to the Republic of Venice in 1423, it was subsequently conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Under Ottoman rule the city retained its position as the most important trading hub in the Balkans. Manufacturing, shipping and trade were the most important components of the city's economy during the Ottoman period, and the majority of the city's trade at the time was controlled by ethnic Greeks. Plus, the Jewish community was also an important factor in the trade sector.Historically important industries for the economy of Thessaloniki included tobacco (in 1946 35% of all tobacco companies in Greece were headquartered in the city, and 44% in 1979) and banking (in Ottoman years Thessaloniki was a major center for investment from western Europe, with the Bank of Thessaloniki (French: Banque de Salonique) having a capital of 20 million French francs in 1909).\n\n\n=== Services ===\n\nThe service sector accounts for nearly two thirds of the total labour force of Thessaloniki. Of those working in services, 20% were employed in trade, 13% in education and healthcare, 7.1% in real estate, 6.3% in transport, communications & storing, 6.1% in the finance industry & service-providing organizations, 5.7% in public administration & insurance services and 5.4% in hotels & restaurants.The city's port, the Port of Thessaloniki, is one of the largest ports in the Aegean and as a free port, it functions as a major gateway to the Balkan hinterland. In 2010, more than 15.8 million tons of products went through the city's port, making it the second-largest port in Greece after Aghioi Theodoroi, surpassing Piraeus. At 273,282 TEUs, it is also Greece's second-largest container port after Piraeus. As a result, the city is a major transportation hub for the whole of south-eastern Europe, carrying, among other things, trade to and from the neighbouring countries.In recent years Thessaloniki has begun to turn into a major port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean. The Greek ministry of tourism considers Thessaloniki to be Greece's second most important commercial port, and companies such as Royal Caribbean International have expressed interest in adding the Port of Thessaloniki to their destinations. A total of 30 cruise ships are expected to arrive at Thessaloniki in 2011.\n\n\n=== Companies ===\nRecent historyAfter WWII and the Greek civil war, heavy industrialization of the city's suburbs began in the middle 1950s.During the 1980s a spate of factory shut downs occurred, mostly of automobile manufacters, such as Agricola (vehicles), AutoDiana, EBIAM, Motoemil, Pantelemidis-TITAN and C.AR (automobiles). Since the 1990s, companies took advantage of cheaper labour markets and more lax regulations in other countries, and among the largest companies to shut down factories were Goodyear, AVEZ pasta industry (one of the first industrial factories in northern Greece, built in 1926),  Philkeram Johnson, AGNO dairy and VIAMIL.\nHowever, Thessaloniki still remains a major business hub in the Balkans and Greece, with a number of important Greek companies headquartered in the city, such as the Hellenic Vehicle Industry (ELVO), Namco (automobiles), Astra Airlines, Ellinair, Pyramis and MLS Multimedia, which introduced the first Greek-built smartphone in 2012.\nIndustryIn early 1960s, with the collaboration of Standard Oil and ESSO-Pappas, a large industrial zone was created, containing refineries, oil refinery and steel production (owned by Hellenic Steel Co.). The zone attracted also a series of different factories during the next decades.\nTitan Cement has also facilities outside the city, on the road to Serres, such as the AGET Heracles, a member of the Lafarge group, and Alumil SA.\nMultinational companies such as Air Liquide, Cyanamid, Nestl\u00e9, Pfizer, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company and Vivartia have also industrial facilities in the suburbs of the city.\nFoodstuffFoodstuff or drink companies headquartered in the city include the Macedonian Milk Industry (Mevgal), Allatini, Barbastathis, Hellenic Sugar Industry, Haitoglou Bros, Mythos Brewery, Malamatina, while the Goody's chain started from the city.The American Farm School also has important contribution in food production.\n\n\n=== Macroeconomic indicators ===\nIn 2011, the regional unit of Thessaloniki had a Gross Domestic Product of \u20ac18.293 billion (ranked 2nd amongst the country's regional units), comparable to Bahrain or Cyprus, and a per capita of \u20ac15,900 (ranked 16th). In Purchasing Power Parity, the same indicators are \u20ac19,851 billion (2nd) and \u20ac17,200 (15th) respectively. In terms of comparison with the European Union average, Thessaloniki's GDP per capita indicator stands at 63% the EU average and 69% in PPP \u2013 this is comparable to the German state of Brandenburg. Overall, Thessaloniki accounts for 8.9% of the total economy of Greece. Between 1995 and 2008 Thessaloniki's GDP saw an average growth rate of 4.1% per annum (ranging from +14.5% in 1996 to \u221211.1% in 2005) while in 2011 the economy contracted by \u22127.8%.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical ethnic statistics ===\nThe tables below show the ethnic statistics of Thessaloniki during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki is the most populous in the Thessaloniki Urban Area. Its population has increased in the latest census and the metropolitan area's population rose to over one million. The city forms the base of the Thessaloniki metropolitan area, with latest census in 2011 giving it a population of 1,030,338.\n\n\n=== Jews of Thessaloniki ===\n\nThe Jewish population in Greece is the oldest in mainland Europe (see Romaniotes). When Paul the Apostle came in Thessaloniki he taught in the area of what today is called Upper City. Later, during the Ottoman period, with the coming of Sephardic Jews from Spain, the community of Thessaloniki became mostly Sephardic. Thessaloniki became the largest center in Europe of the Sephardic Jews, who nicknamed the city la madre de Israel (Israel's mother) and \"Jerusalem of the Balkans\". It also included the historically significant and ancient Greek-speaking Romaniote community. During the Ottoman era, Thessaloniki's Sephardic community of was half the population according to the Ottoman Census of 1902 and almost 40% the city's population of 157,000 about 1913; Jewish merchants were prominent in commerce until the ethnic Greek population increased after independence in 1912. By the 1680s, about 300 families of Sephardic Jews, followers of Sabbatai Zevi, had converted to Islam, becoming a sect known as the D\u00f6nmeh (convert), and migrated to Salonika, whose population was majority Jewish. They established an active community that thrived for about 250 years. Many of their descendants later became prominent in trade. Many Jewish inhabitants of Thessaloniki spoke Ladino, the Romance language of the Sephardic Jews.\n\nFrom the second half of the 19th century with the Ottoman reforms, the Jewish community had a new revival. Many French and especially Italian Jews (from Livorno and other cities), influential in introducing new methods of education and developing new schools and intellectual environment for the Jewish population, were established in Thessaloniki. Such modernists introduced also new techniques and ideas from the industrialized Western Europe and from the 1880s the city began to industrialize. The Italian Jews Allatini brothers led Jewish entrepreneurship, establishing milling and other food industries, brickmaking and processing plants for tobacco. Several traders supported the introduction of a large textile-production industry, superseding the weaving of cloth in a system of artisanal production. Notable names of the era include among others the Italo-Jewish Modiano family and the Allatini. Benrubis founded also in 1880 one of the first retail companies in the Balkans.\nAfter the Balkan Wars, Thessaloniki was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece in 1913. At first the community feared that the annexation would lead to difficulties and during the first years its political stance was, in general, anti-Venizelist and pro-royalist/conservative. The Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 during World War I burned much of the center of the city and left 50,000 Jews homeless of the total of 72,000 residents who were burned out. Having lost homes and their businesses, many Jews emigrated: to the United States, Palestine, and Paris. They could not wait for the government to create a new urban plan for rebuilding, which was eventually done.After the Greco-Turkish War in 1922 and the bilateral population exchange between Greece and Turkey, many refugees came to Greece. Nearly 100,000 ethnic Greeks resettled in Thessaloniki, reducing the proportion of Jews in the total community. After this, Jews made up about 20% of the city's population. During the interwar period, Greece granted Jewish citizens the same civil rights as other Greek citizens. In March 1926, Greece re-emphasized that all citizens of Greece enjoyed equal rights, and a considerable proportion of the city's Jews decided to stay. During the Metaxas regime the stance towards Jews became even better.\n\nWorld War II brought a disaster for the Jewish Greeks, since in 1941 the Germans occupied Greece and began actions against the Jewish population. Greeks of the Resistance helped save some of the Jewish residents. By the 1940s, the great majority of the Jewish Greek community firmly identified as both Greek and Jewish. According to Misha Glenny, such Greek Jews had largely not encountered \"anti-Semitism as in its North European form.\"In 1943 the Nazis began brutal actions against the historic Jewish population in Thessaloniki, forcing them into a ghetto near the railroad lines and beginning deportation to concentration and labor camps. They deported and exterminated approximately 96% of Thessaloniki's Jews of all ages during the Holocaust. The Thessaloniki Holocaust memorial in Eleftherias (\"Freedom\") Square was built in 1997 in memory of all the Jewish people from Thessaloniki, who died in the Holocaust. The site was chosen because it was the place where Jewish residents were rounded up before embarking to trains for concentration camps. Today, a community of around 1200 remains in the city. Communities of descendants of Thessaloniki Jews \u2013 both Sephardic and Romaniote \u2013 live in other areas, mainly the United States and Israel. Israeli singer Yehuda Poliker recorded a song about the Jewish people of Thessaloniki, called \"Wait for me, Thessaloniki\".\n\n\n=== Others ===\nSince the late 19th century, many merchants from Western Europe (mainly from France and Italy) were established in the city. They had an important role in the social and economic life of the city and introduced new industrial techniques. Their main district was what is known today as the \"Frankish district\" (near Ladadika), where the Catholic church designed by Vitaliano Poselli is also situated. Many of them left after the incorporation of the city into the Greek kingdom, others, who were of Jewish faith, were exterminated by the Nazis.\nThe Bulgarian community of the city increased during the late 19th century. The community had a Men's High School, a Girl's High School, a trade union and a gymnastics society. A large part of them were Catholics, as a result of actions by the Lazarists society, which had its base in the city.\nAnother group is the Armenian community which dates back to the Byzantine and Ottoman periods. During the 20th century, after the Armenian Genocide and the defeat of the Greek army in the Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322), many fled to Greece including Thessaloniki. There is also an Armenian cemetery and an Armenian church at the center of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Leisure and entertainment ===\n\nThessaloniki is not only regarded as the cultural and entertainment capital of northern Greece but also the cultural capital of the country. The city's main theaters, run by the National Theatre of Northern Greece (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0398\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf \u0392\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2) which was established in 1961, include the Theater of the Society of Macedonian Studies, where the National Theater is based, the Royal Theater (\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0398\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf)-the first base of the National Theater-, Moni Lazariston, and the Earth Theater and Forest Theater, both amphitheatrical open-air theatres overlooking the city.\n\nThe title of the European Capital of Culture in 1997 saw the birth of the city's first opera and today forms an independent section of the National Theatre of Northern Greece. The opera is based at the Thessaloniki Concert Hall, one of the largest concert halls in Greece. Recently a second building was also constructed and designed by Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. Thessaloniki is also the seat of two symphony orchestras, the Thessaloniki State Symphony Orchestra and the Symphony Orchestra of the Municipality of Thessaloniki.\nOlympion Theater, the site of the Thessaloniki International Film Festival and the Plateia Assos Odeon multiplex are the two major cinemas in downtown Thessaloniki. The city also has a number of multiplex cinemas in major shopping malls in the suburbs, most notably in Mediterranean Cosmos, the largest retail and entertainment development in the Balkans.\nThessaloniki is renowned for its major shopping streets and lively laneways. Tsimiski Street and Proxenou Koromila avenue are the city's most famous shopping streets and are among Greece's most expensive and exclusive high streets. The city is also home to one of Greece's most famous and prestigious hotels, Makedonia Palace hotel, the Hyatt Regency Casino and hotel (the biggest casino in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe) and Waterland, the largest water park in southeastern Europe.\nThe city has long been known in Greece for its vibrant city culture, including having the most cafes and bars per capita of any city in Europe; and as having some of the best nightlife and entertainment in the country, thanks to its large young population and multicultural feel. Lonely Planet listed Thessaloniki among the world's \"ultimate party cities\".\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\n\nAlthough Thessaloniki is not renowned for its parks and greenery throughout its urban area, where green spaces are few, it has several large open spaces around its waterfront, namely the central city gardens of Palios Zoologikos Kipos (which is recently being redeveloped to also include rock climbing facilities, a new skatepark and paintball range), the park of Pedion tou Areos, which also holds the city's annual floral expo; and the parks of the Nea Paralia (waterfront) that span for 3 km (2 mi) along the coast, from the White Tower to the concert hall.\nThe Nea Paralia parks are used throughout the year for a variety of events, while they open up to the Thessaloniki waterfront, which is lined up with several caf\u00e9s and bars; and during summer is full of Thessalonians enjoying their long evening walks (referred to as \"the volta\" and is embedded into the culture of the city). Having undergone an extensive revitalization, the city's waterfront today features a total of 12 thematic gardens/parks.Thessaloniki's proximity to places such as the national parks of Pieria and beaches of Chalkidiki often allow its residents to easily have access to some of the best outdoor recreation in Europe; however, the city is also right next to the Seich Sou forest national park, just 3.5 km (2 mi) away from Thessaloniki's city center; and offers residents and visitors alike, quiet viewpoints towards the city, mountain bike trails and landscaped hiking paths. The city's zoo, which is operated by the municipality of Thessaloniki, is also located nearby the national park.Other recreation spaces throughout the Thessaloniki metropolitan area include the Fragma Thermis, a landscaped parkland near Thermi and the Delta wetlands west of the city center; while urban beaches that have continuously been awarded the blue flags, are located along the 10 km (6 mi) coastline of Thessaloniki's southeastern suburbs of Thermaikos, about 20 km (12 mi) away from the city center.\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nBecause of the city's rich and diverse history, Thessaloniki houses many museums dealing with many different eras in history. Two of the city's most famous museums include the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki and the Museum of Byzantine Culture.\nThe Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki was established in 1962 and houses some of the most important ancient Macedonian artifacts, including an extensive collection of golden artwork from the royal palaces of Aigai and Pella. It also houses exhibits from Macedon's prehistoric past, dating from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. The Prehistoric Antiquities Museum of Thessaloniki has exhibits from those periods as well.\n\nThe Museum of Byzantine Culture is one of the city's most famous museums, showcasing the city's glorious Byzantine past. The museum was also awarded Council of Europe's museum prize in 2005. The museum of the White Tower of Thessaloniki houses a series of galleries relating to the city's past, from the creation of the White Tower until recent years.One of the most modern museums in the city is the Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum and is one of the most high-tech museums in Greece and southeastern Europe. It features the largest planetarium in Greece, a cosmotheater with the country's largest flat screen, an amphitheater, a motion simulator with 3D projection and 6-axis movement and exhibition spaces. Other industrial and technological museums in the city include the Railway Museum of Thessaloniki, which houses an original Orient Express train, the War Museum of Thessaloniki and others. The city also has a number of educational and sports museums, including the Thessaloniki Olympic Museum.\nThe Atat\u00fcrk Museum in Thessaloniki is the historic house where Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, founder of modern-day Turkey, was born. The house is now part of the Turkish consulate complex, but admission to the museum is free. The museum contains historic information about Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk and his life, especially while he was in Thessaloniki.\nOther ethnological museums of the sort include the Historical Museum of the Balkan Wars, the Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki and the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle, containing information about the freedom fighters in Macedonia and their struggle to liberate the region from the Ottoman yoke. Construction on the Holocaust Museum of Greece began in the city in 2018.The city also has a number of important art galleries. Such include the Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art, housing exhibitions from a number of well-known Greek and foreign artists. The Teloglion Foundation of Art is part of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and includes an extensive collection of works by important artists of the 19th and 20th centuries, including works by prominent Greeks and native Thessalonians. The Thessaloniki Museum of Photography also houses a number of important exhibitions, and is located within the old port of Thessaloniki.\n\n\n=== Archaeological sites ===\n\nThessaloniki is home to a number of prominent archaeological sites. Apart from its recognized UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Thessaloniki features a large two-terraced Roman forum featuring two-storey stoas, dug up by accident in the 1960s. The forum complex also boasts two Roman baths, one of which has been excavated while the other is buried underneath the city. The forum also features a small theater, which was also used for gladiatorial games. Although the initial complex was not built in Roman times, it was largely refurbished in the 2nd century. It is believed that the forum and the theater continued to be used until at least the 6th century.Another important archaeological site is the imperial palace complex which Roman emperor Galerius, located at Navarinou Square, commissioned when he made Thessaloniki the capital of his portion of the Roman Empire. The large octagonal portion of the complex, most of which survives to this day, is believed to have been an imperial throne room. Various mosaics from the palatial complex have also survived. Some historians believe that the complex must have been in use as an imperial residence until the 11th century.Not far from the palace itself is the Arch of Galerius, known colloquially as the Kamara. The arch was built to commemorate the emperor's campaigns against the Persians. The original structure featured three arches; however, only two full arches and part of the third survive to this day. Many of the arches' marble parts survive as well, although it is mostly the brick interior that can be seen today.\nOther monuments of the city's past, such as the Incantadas, a Caryatid portico from the ancient forum, have been removed or destroyed over the years. The Incantadas in particular are on display at the Louvre. Thanks to a private donation of \u20ac180,000, it was announced on 6 December 2011 that a replica of the Incantadas would be commissioned and later put on display in Thessaloniki.The construction of the Thessaloniki Metro inadvertently started the largest archaeological dig not only of the city, but of Northern Greece; the dig spans 20 km2 (7.7 sq mi) and has unearthed 300,000 individual artefacts from as early as the Roman Empire and as late as the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917. Ancient Thessaloniki's Decumanus Maximus was also found and 75 metres (246 ft) of the marble-paved and column-lined road were unearthed along with shops, other buildings, and plumbing, prompting one scholar to describe the discovery as \"the Byzantine Pompeii\". Some of the artefacts will be put on display inside the metro stations, while Venizelou will feature the world's first open archaeological site located within a metro station.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThessaloniki is home of a number of festivals and events. The Thessaloniki International Fair is the most important event to be hosted in the city annually, by means of economic development. It was first established in 1926 and takes place every year at the 180,000 m2 (1,937,503.88 sq ft) Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center. The event attracts major political attention and it is customary for the Prime Minister of Greece to outline his administration's policies for the next year, during event. Over 250,000 visitors attended the exposition in 2010.  The new Art Thessaloniki,  is starting first time 29.10. \u2013 1 November 2015 as an international contemporary art fair. \nThe Thessaloniki International Film Festival is established as one of the most important film festivals in Southern Europe, with a number of notable film makers such as Francis Ford Coppola, Faye Dunaway, Catherine Deneuve, Irene Papas and Fatih Ak\u0131n taking part, and was established in 1960. The Documentary Festival, founded in 1999, has focused on documentaries that explore global social and cultural developments, with many of the films presented being candidates for FIPRESCI and Audience Awards.The Dimitria festival, founded in 1966 and named after the city's patron saint of St. Demetrius, has focused on a wide range of events including music, theatre, dance, local happenings, and exhibitions. The \"DMC DJ Championship\" has been hosted at the International Trade Fair of Thessaloniki, has become a worldwide event for aspiring DJs and turntablists. The \"International Festival of Photography\" has taken place every February to mid-April. Exhibitions for the event are sited in museums, heritage landmarks, galleries, bookshops and caf\u00e9s. Thessaloniki also holds an annual International Book Fair.Between 1962\u20131997 and 2005\u20132008 the city also hosted the Thessaloniki Song Festival, Greece's most important music festival, at Alexandreio Melathron.In 2012 the city hosted its first pride parade, Thessaloniki Pride, which took place between 22 and 23 June. It has been held every year ever since, however in 2013 transgender people participating in the parade became victims of police brutality. The issue was soon settled by the government. The city's Greek Orthodox Church leadership has consistently rallied against the event, but mayor Boutaris sided with Thessaloniki Pride, saying also that Thessaloniki would seek to host EuroPride 2020. The event was given to Thessaloniki in September 2017, beating Bergen, Brussels, and Hamburg.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe main stadium of the city is the Kaftanzoglio Stadium (also home ground of Iraklis F.C.), while other main stadiums of the city include the football Kleanthis Vikelidis Stadium and Toumba Stadium home grounds of Aris F.C. and PAOK FC, respectively, all of whom are founding members of the Greek league.\nBeing the largest \"multi-sport\" stadium in the city, Kaftanzoglio Stadium regularly plays host to athletics events; such as the European Athletics Association event \"Olympic Meeting Thessaloniki\" every year; it has hosted the Greek national championships in 2009 and has been used for athletics at the Mediterranean Games and for the European Cup in athletics. In 2004 the stadium served as an official Athens 2004 venue, while in 2009 the city and the stadium hosted the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final.\nThessaloniki's major indoor arenas include the state-owned Alexandreio Melathron, P.A.O.K. Sports Arena and the YMCA indoor hall. Other sporting clubs in the city include Apollon FC based in Kalamaria, Agrotikos Asteras F.C. based in Evosmos and YMCA. Thessaloniki has a rich sporting history with its teams winning the first ever panhellenic football (Aris FC), basketball (Iraklis BC), and water polo (AC Aris) tournaments.\nDuring recent years, PAOK FC has emerged as the strongest football club of the city, winning also the Greek championship without a defeat (2018\u201319 season).\nThe city played a major role in the development of basketball in Greece. The local YMCA was the first to introduce the sport to the country, while Iraklis B.C. won the first ever Greek championship. From 1982 to 1993 Aris B.C. dominated the league, regularly finishing in first place. In that period Aris won a total of 9 championships, 7 cups and one European Cup Winners' Cup. The city also hosted the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in which Greece came third. In volleyball, Iraklis has emerged since 2000 as one of the most successful teams in Greece and Europe \u2013 see 2005\u201306 CEV Champions League. In October 2007, Thessaloniki also played host to the first Southeastern European Games.The city is also the finish point of the annual Alexander The Great Marathon, which starts at Pella, in recognition of its Ancient Macedonian heritage.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nThessaloniki is home to the ERT3 TV-channel and Radio Macedonia, both services of Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) operating in the city and are broadcast all over Greece.\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki also operates three radio stations, namely FM100, FM101 and FM100.6; and TV100, a television network which was also the first non-state-owned TV station in Greece and opened in 1988. Several private TV-networks also broadcast out from Thessaloniki, with Makedonia TV being the most popular.\nThe city's main newspapers and some of the most circulated in Greece, include Makedonia, which was also the first newspaper published in Thessaloniki in 1911 and Aggelioforos. A large number of radio stations also broadcast from Thessaloniki as the city is known for its music contributions.\n\n\n==== TV broadcasting ====\nERT3 (Panhellenic broadcasting)\nMakedonia TV (Panhellenic)\n4E TV (Panhellenic)\nTV 100 (Regional)\nVergina TV (Regional)\nAtlas TV (Regional)\n\n\n==== Press ====\nMakedonia (national publication)\nAggelioforos (national)\nMetrosport (sports, national)\nFair Play (sports, national)\nAris Ise (sports, weekly, national )\nForza (sports, weekly, national)\nThessaloniki (weekly, national)\nKarfitsa (weekly)\nIkonomiki (financial)\n\n\n=== Notable Thessalonians ===\n\nThroughout its history, Thessaloniki has been home to a number of well-known figures. It was also the birthplace or base of various Saints and other religious figures, such as Demetrius of Thessaloniki, Cyril and Methodius (creators of the first Slavic alphabet), Saint Mitre (Saint Demetrius, not to be confused with the previous), Gregorios Palamas, Eustathius of Thessalonica and Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople. Other Byzantine-era notables included jurist Constantine Armenopoulos, the anti-Palamian theologians Prochoros and Demetrios Kydones, such as scholars Theodorus Gaza (Thessalonicensis) and Matthaios Kamariotis.\nMany of the country's best-known musicians and movie personalities are from Thessaloniki, such as Zoe Laskari, Costas Hajihristos, Stella Haskil, Giannis Dalianidis, Maria Plyta, Harry Klynn, Antonis Remos, Paschalis Terzis, Nikos Papazoglou, Nikolas Asimos, Giorgos Hatzinasios, Alberto Eskenazi, Stavros Kouyioumtzis, Giannis Kalatzis, Natassa Theodoridou, Katia Zygouli, Kostas Voutsas, Takis Kanellopoulos, Titos Vandis, Manolis Chiotis, Dionysis Savvopoulos, Marinella, Yvonne Sanson and the classical composer Emilios Riadis. Additionally, there have been a number of politicians born in the city: Ioannis Skandalidis, Alexandros Zannas, Evangelos Venizelos, Christos Sartzetakis, fourth President of Greece, Niki Kerameus and Yiannis Boutaris. Sports personalities from the city include Georgios Roubanis, Giannis Ioannidis, Faidon Matthaiou, Alketas Panagoulias, Panagiotis Fasoulas, Eleni Daniilidou, Traianos Dellas, Giorgos Koudas, Kleanthis Vikelidis, Christos Kostis, Dimitris Salpingidis and Nikos Zisis. Benefactor Ioannis Papafis, architect Lysandros Kaftanzoglou and writers, such as Grigorios Zalykis, Manolis Anagnostakis, Kleitos Kyrou, Albertos Nar, Giorgos Ioannou, Elias Petropoulos, Kostis Moskof, Rena Molho and Dinos Christianopoulos are also from Thessaloniki.\nThe city is also the birthplace or base of a number of international personalities, which include Bulgarians (Atanas Dalchev), Jews (Moshe Levy, Maurice Abravanel, Isaak Benrubi, Isaac and Daniel Carasso, Rapha\u00ebl Salem, Baruch Uziel, Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz, Salamo Arouch), Slav Macedonians (Dimo Todorovski), Italians (Luisa Poselli, Giacomo Poselli, Vittorio Citterich), French (Louis Dumont), Spanish (Juana Mord\u00f3), Turks (Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet, Afet \u0130nan, Cahit Arf, Mehmet Cavit Bey, Sabiha Sertel, Abdul Kerim Pasha, Hasan Tahsin Uzer, Hasan Tahsin) and Armenians (Jean Tatlian).\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nBecause Thessaloniki remained under Ottoman rule for about 100 years more than southern Greece, it has retained a lot of its Eastern character, including its culinary tastes. Spices in particular play an important role in the cuisine of Thessaloniki, something which is not true to the same degree about Greece's southern regions. Thessaloniki's Ladadika borough is a particularly busy area in regards to Thessalonian cuisine, with most tavernas serving traditional meze and other such culinary delights.Bougatsa, a breakfast pastry, which can be either sweet or savory, is very popular throughout the city and has spread around other parts of Greece and the Balkans as well. Another popular snack is koulouri.\nNotable sweets of the city are Trigona, Rox\u00e1kia and Armenov\u00edl. A stereotypical Thessalonian coffee drink is Frapp\u00e9 coffee. Frapp\u00e9 was invented in the Thessaloniki International Fair in 1957 and has since spread throughout Greece and Cyprus to become a hallmark of the Greek coffee culture.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nA touristic boom took place in the 2010s, during the years of mayor Boutaris, especially from the neighboring countries, Austria, Israel and Turkey. In 2010 the sleepovers of foreign tourists in the city were around 250,000. In 2018 the sleepovers of foreign tourists was estimated to reach 3,000,000 people.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe city is viewed as a romantic one in Greece, and as such Thessaloniki is commonly featured in Greek songs. There are a number of famous songs that go by the name 'Thessaloniki' (rebetiko, la\u00efko etc.) or include the name in their title.During the 1930s and 40s the city became a center of the Rebetiko music, partly because of the Metaxas censorship, which was stricter in Athens. Vassilis Tsitsanis wrote some of his best songs in Thessaloniki.\nThe city is the birthplace of significant composers in the Greek music scene, such as Manolis Chiotis, Stavros Kouyioumtzis and Dionysis Savvopoulos. It is also notable for its rock music scene and its many rock groups; some became famous such as Xylina Spathia, Trypes or the pop rock Onirama.\nBetween 1962\u20131997 and 2005\u20132008 the city also hosted the Thessaloniki Song Festival. In the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 Greece was represented by Koza Mostra and Agathonas Iakovidis, both from Thessaloniki.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nOn May 1936, a massive strike by tobacco workers led to general anarchy in the city and Ioannis Metaxas (future dictator, then PM) ordered its repression. The events and the deaths of the protesters inspired Yiannis Ritsos to write the Epitafios.\nOn 22 May 1963, Grigoris Lambrakis, pacifist and MP, was assassinated by two far-right extremists driving a three-wheeled vehicle. The event led to political crisis. Costa Gavras directed Z (1969 film) based on it, two years after the military junta had seized power in Greece.\nNotable films set or shot in Thessaloniki among others include Mademoiselle Docteur/Salonique, nid d'espions (1937) by Georg Wilhelm Pabst, The Barefooted Battalion (1954) by Greg Tallas (Gregory Thalassinos), O Ats\u00eddas (1961) by Giannis Dalianidis,  Parenthesis (1968) by Takis Kanellopoulos,  Triumph of the Spirit (1989) by Robert M. Young, Eternity and a Day by Theo Angelopoulos (1998) and Ouzeri Tsitsanis (2015) by Manousos Manousakis.\nThe 1963 book I am David, written by Anne Holm, makes mention of the main character David making his way there after escaping from the Eastern Bloc, before continuing his ultimate journey to Denmark.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThessaloniki is a major center of education for Greece. Three of the country's largest universities are located in central Thessaloniki: Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the University of Macedonia and the International Hellenic University. Aristotle University was founded in 1926 and is currently the largest university in Greece by number of students, which number at more than 80,000 in 2010, and is a member of the Utrecht Network. For the academic year 2009\u20132010, Aristotle University was ranked as one of the 150 best universities in the world for arts and humanities and among the 250 best universities in the world overall by the Times QS World University Rankings, making it one of the top 2% of best universities worldwide. Leiden ranks Aristotle University as one of the top 100 European universities and the best university in Greece, at number 97. Since 2010, Thessaloniki is also home to the Open University of Thessaloniki, which is funded by Aristotle University, the University of Macedonia and the municipality of Thessaloniki.\nAdditionally, a TEI (Technological Educational Institute), namely the Alexander Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki, is located in the western suburb of Sindos; home also to the industrial zone of the city. Numerous public and private vocational institutes (Greek: IEK) provide professional training to young students, while a large number of private colleges offer American and UK academic curriculum, via cooperation with foreign universities. In addition to Greek students, the city hence attracts many foreign students either via the Erasmus programme for public universities, or for a complete degree in public universities or in the city's private colleges. As of 2006 the city's total student population was estimated around 200,000.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nTram was the main, oldest and most popular public urban mean of Thessalonians in the past. It functioned from 1893 to 1957, when it was disestablished by the government of Konstantinos Karamanlis. The French Compagnie de Tramways et d' \u00c9clairage \u00c9lectrique de Salonique operated it from 1912 until 1940, when the company was purchased by the Hellenic State. The operating base and tram station was in the district of D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nBefore the economic crisis of 2009, there were various proposals for new tram lines.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nThessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (OASTH) operates buses as the only form of public transport in Thessaloniki. It was founded in 1957 and operates a fleet of 604 vehicles on 75 routes throughout the Thessaloniki metropolitan area. International and regional bus links are provided by KTEL at its Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal, located to the west of the city centre.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe creation of a metro system for Thessaloniki goes back as far as 1918, when Thomas Hayton Mawson and Ernest H\u00e9brard proposed the creation of a Thessaloniki Metropolitan Railway. In 1968 a circular metro line was proposed, and in 1987 the first serious proposal was presented and construction briefly started in 1988, before stalling and finally being abandoned due to lack of funding. Both the 1918 and 1988 proposals ran almost the identical route to the current Line 1.\nConstruction on Thessaloniki's current metro began in 2006 and is classified as a megaproject: it has a budget of \u20ac1.57 billion ($1.77 billion). Line 1 and Line 2 are currently under construction and will enter service, in phases, between 2020 and 2021. Line 1 is 9.5 kilometres (5.9 mi) long and stops at 13 stations, while Line 2 is 4.8 kilometres (3.0 mi) long and stops at a further 5 stations, while also calling at 11 of the Line 1 stations. Important archaeological discoveries have been made during construction, and some of the system's stations will house archaeological exhibitions. One stop, Venizelou, will house the only open archaeological site within a metro station anywhere in the world.Line 2 is to be expanded further, with a loop extension to the western suburbs of the city, towards Evosmos and Stavroupoli, and one overground extension towards the Airport. The western extension is more high-priority than the airport one, as the airport will be served by a 10-minute shuttle bus to the terminus of Line 2, Mikra.Once opened in 2020, it is expected that 320,000 people will use the metro every day, or 116 million people every year.\n\n\n=== Commuter/suburban rail (Proastiakos) ===\n\nCommuter rail services have recently been established between Thessaloniki and the city of Larissa (the service is known in Greek as the \"Proastiakos\", meaning \"Suburban Railway\"). The service is operated using Siemens Desiro EMU trains on a modernised electrified double track and stops at 11 refurbished stations, covering the journey in 1 hour and 33 minutes. Furthermore, an additional line has also been established, although with the use of regional trains, between Thessaloniki and the city of Edessa.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki Airport \"Makedonia\" ===\n\nInternational and domestic air traffic to and from the city is served by Thessaloniki Airport \"Makedonia\". The short length of the airport's two runways means that it does not currently support intercontinental flights, although a major extension \u2013 lengthening one of its runways into the Thermaic Gulf \u2013 is under construction, despite considerable opposition from local environmental groups. Following the completion of the runway works, the airport will be able to serve intercontinental flights and cater for larger aircraft in the future. Construction of a second terminal began in September 2018, due to be completed in 2021.\n\n\n=== Railways and ferry connections ===\n\nBecause of the Greek economic crisis, all international train links from the city were suspended in February 2011. Until then, the city was a major railway hub for the Balkans, with direct connections to Sofia, Skopje, Belgrade, Moscow, Vienna, Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul, alongside Athens and other destinations in Greece. Daily through trains to Sofia and Belgrade were restarted in May 2014. Thessaloniki remains one of Greece's most important railway hubs and has the biggest marshalling yard in the country.\nRegional train services within Greece (operated by TrainOSE, the Hellenic Railways Organization's train operating company), link the city with other parts of the country, from its central railway passenger station, called the \"New railway station\" located at the western end of Thessaloniki's city center.\nThe Port of Thessaloniki connects the city with seasonal ferries to the Sporades and other north Aegean islands, with its passenger terminal, being one of the largest in the Aegean Sea basin; having handled around 162,731 passengers in 2007. Meanwhile, ongoing actions have been going on for more connections and the port is recently being upgraded, as Thessaloniki is also slowly turning into a major tourist port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Motorways ===\n\nThessaloniki lies on the crossroads of the A1/E75, A2/E90 and A25 motorways; which connect the city with other parts of the country, as well as the Republic of North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey.\nThe city itself is bypassed by the C-shaped Thessaloniki Inner Ring Road (Esoteriki Peripheriaki Odos,  Greek: \u0395\u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2), which all of the above motorways connect onto it. The western end of the route begins at the junction with the A1/A2 motorways in Lachanagora District. Clockwise it heads northeast around the city, passing through the northwestern suburbs, the forest of Seich Sou and through to the southeast suburb/borough of Kalamaria. The ring road ends at a large junction with the A25 motorway, which then continues south to Chalkidiki, passing through Thessaloniki's outer southeast suburbs.\nThe speed limit on this motorway is 90 kilometres per hour (56 mph), it currently has three traffic lanes for each direction and forms the city's most vital road link; handling more than 120,000 vehicles daily, instead of 30,000 as it was meant to handle when designed in 1975.\nAn outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (Greek: \u0395\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2, outer ring road) carries all traffic that completely bypasses the city. It is Part of Motorway 2.\n\n\n==== Future plans ====\nDespite the large effort that was made in 2004 to improve the motorway features of the Thessaloniki ring road, the motorway is still insufficient to tackle Thessaloniki's increasing traffic and metropolitan population. To tackle this problem, the government has introduced large scale redevelopment plans throughout 2011 with tenders expected to be announced within early 2012; that include the total restructuring of the A16 in the western side of the city, with new junctions and new emergency lanes throughout the whole length of the motorway. In the eastern side an even larger scale project has been announced, for the construction of a new elevated motorway section above the existing, which would allow faster travel for drivers heading through to the airport and Chalkidiki that do not wish to exit into the city, and will decongest the existing motorway for city commuters. The plans also include adding one more lane in each direction on the existing A16 ring road and on the A25 passing through Thessaloniki's southeast suburbs, from its junction with the A16 in Kalamaria, up to the airport exit (\u0395\u039f67); which will make it an 8 lane highway.Additional long term plans further include the extension of the planned outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (Greek: \u0395\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2, outer ring road) to circle around the entire Thessaloniki metropolitan area, crossing over the Thermaic Gulf from the east, to join with the A1/E75 motorway. Preliminary plans have been announced which include a 4.5 km (3 mi) bridge over the gulf, as part of the southern bypass of the city; to cater for the large number of travellers from Macedonia and the rest of Greece heading to the airport, and to the increasingly popular tourist region of Chalkidiki.\nMotorways:\nA1/E75 W (Republic of North Macedonia, Larissa, Athens)\nA2/E90 W (Kozani, Ioannina, Igoumenitsa) N (Kavala, Xanthi, Alexandroupolis, Turkey)\nA25 (\u0395\u039f12)/\u039579 \u039d (Serres, Bulgaria)\nA25 (\u0395\u039f67) S (Airport, Nea Moudania)\nNational Roads:\n\u0395\u039f2/\u039586 W (Edessa, Giannitsa)\n\u0395\u039f12/\u039579 \u039d (Serres, Drama)\n\u0395\u039f16, SW (Polygyros, Ouranopolis)\n\u0395\u039f65, \u039d (Kilkis, Doirani)\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nConsulates\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nThessaloniki is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nBattle of Thessalonica (fourteen events at various times)\nMacedonians (Greeks)\nMount Chortiatis, above the city\nLake Koroneia, 14 km from the city\nDelta of Axios National Park, west of the city\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\nMunicipality of Thessaloniki\nThessaloniki Port Authority\n\u039f\u0391\u03a3\u0398 \u2013 Organisation of Urban Transport of Thessaloniki (Greek & English)\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nYou in Thessaloniki on YouTube: Official promotional video for Thessaloniki by the Greek National Tourism Organization\nThessaloniki The Official website of the Greek National Tourism Organisation\n\n\n=== Cultural ===\nThessaloniki Concert Hall Organisation\nThessaloniki Film Festival\nThessaloniki Info & Links\nThessaloniki360 Virtual City Guide\nThessaloniki Tsimiski.gr street\n\n\n=== Events ===\nThessaloniki 2012 (celebrations for the 100 years of the incorporation of the city to Greece)\nThessaloniki 2014 (official website of Thessaloniki European Youth Capital 2014)\n\n\n=== Local guides ===\nGreek Local Yellow Pages of Thessaloniki",

        "wiki": "The Museum for the Macedonian Struggle is located in the centre of the city Thessaloniki in Central Macedonia, Greece. It occupies a neo-classical building designed by the renowned architect Ernst Ziller and built in 1893. In its six ground-floor rooms the museum graphically illustrates the modern and contemporary history of Greek Macedonia. It presents the social, economic, political and military developments that shaped the presence of Hellenism in the region. This approach enables the visitor to form a global picture, not only of the revolutionary movements in the area, but also of the rapidly changing society of the southern Balkans and its agonizing struggles to balance between tradition and modernization.\n\n\n== The building ==\nOn 23 August 1890, a huge fire destroyed the southeastern quarters of Thessaloniki.  Among the losses was the humble residence that housed the Consulate General of Greece It was next to a little-known church of St. Demetrius, also destroyed by the fire. Both buildings and the site were the property of the Greek Orthodox Community.Soon, with the insurance money, the donation by Andreas Syngros and the help offered by the Greek government, a sufficient amount was collected to reconstruct the buildings of the Greek community. Among them was a new church dedicated to Saint Gregory Palamas and beside it a magnificent neoclassical residence was built to plans by Ernst Ziller, appropriate for a consular mansion. In discussions that took place between the leaders of the Greek community of Thessaloniki, Andreas Syngros and the Greek consul Georgios Dokos, it was deemed essential for the consulate to remain on the same site in order to facilitate the covert collaboration of the community elders with the consulate. The foundations were laid in September 1892, and work was completed in August 1893. In 1894, it was rented by the city\u2019s Greek community to the Hellenic state to house the Greek Consulate in Thessaloniki.\n\nThe term of office of Lambros Koromilas (1904-1907) was of major importance because he organised the special secret services for the Greek Struggle for Macedonia within the consulates, known as the \u201cCenters\u201d. The \u201cCenter\u201d in Thessaloniki collaborated with the other \u201ccenters\u201d in Macedonia and directed operations. It was staffed mainly by officers, who were in contact with local agents and armed bands. They were also in communication with the national committees that were staffed by the inhabitants of Macedonian villages and cities. The Consulate building frequently hosted fighters who entered unnoticed through a side door into the courtyard of the neighboring episcopal residence.\nThe importance of the work done by the Greek Consulate at that time is corroborated by the testimony of the protagonists in the Macedonian Struggle. The General Konstantinos Mazarakis-Ainian, then working as a \u201cspecial clerk\u201d at the consulate, reports in his memoirs: \u201cMy work began at the Consulate. From morning to midnight I was at work there. I met people coming in from the countryside. A little door in the courtyard communicated with the Cathedral. From there they were able to escape the eyes of the Turkish sentry in front of the Consulate. It was the office of information and advice about resistance against the Bulgarians\u2026\u201dAlexandros Zannas, scion of one of the most eminent families in Thessaloniki, had been working for the national Greek cause since adolescence. In his memoirs he declared characteristically: \u201c\u2026We were very good friends with everybody who worked there\u2026 I used to see them all just about every day, because the secret postal service in Macedonia would stop by our house and usually either I or my brothers would then bring the mail to the Consulate\u2026 The letters were brought from the interior by various railway employees\u2026and were handed over to Tsapoulas, a man from our village who owned the coffee shop opposite the railway station. My sister, a primary school teacher, would pick them up from him and bring them home\u2026 Then we\u2019d take them to the Greek Consulate\u2026\u201d.The successful activity of Lambros Koromilas alarmed the Ottoman authorities who demanded his departure in 1907. In the years to follow, however, the \u201cCenter\u201d continued its task. During the period of the Young Turks, when the national struggle was being conducted by political representatives, the Greek internal organization was careful to act in secret, revealing its presence solely to selected officials.\nThe Balkan Wars brought victory to Greece and led to the union of Macedonia with Greece. Since the consular service was no longer required, the building was thereafter utilized for other purposes. In 1915, the Agricultural Bank of Macedonia operated on its ground floor and basement. In 1917, for a period of three years, it provided temporary accommodation to the National Bank of Greece until its branch, which was destroyed in the great fire that struck the city that same year, could be rebuilt.\nIn 1923, the 23rd Primary School was housed in the building. During the German Occupation (1941\u20131944), the Red Cross distributed food in the basement, and for a few months at the end of the Civil War (1949), the basement was used for the detention of political prisoners. In the decades that followed, it hosted a girls\u2019 school, a night school and, since 1970, the 43rd Primary School.\n\n\n== The museum ==\n\n\u0391s early as the 1930s, there were thoughts of creating a Museum of the Macedonian Struggle. The Macedonian Educational Brotherhood (1940) and later the Society for Macedonian Studies took an active part in establishing this museum. After the 1978 Thessaloniki earthquake, the building was judged unsuitable to house a school. In 1979, the society of \u201cFriends of the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle\u201d was established and a request made to use the building as a museum. The building was restored and became the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle in 1980, and was inaugurated in 1982 by Konstantinos Karamanlis, the Macedonia-born President of the Hellenic Republic and descendant of a fighter of the Macedonian Struggle\nSince 1999 the museum has been run by the \u201cFoundation for the Museum for the Macedonian Struggle\u201d. With the new century the Foundation has initiated, in addition to its exhibition and publishing activity, new educational programmes and technologically innovative applications.\nThe museum is open Tuesday to Friday 09:00-14:00, Wednesday 18:00-20:00, Saturday and Sunday 11:00-14:30.\n\n\n== The collection ==\nThe museum\u2019s collection consists of rare 19th and 20th century artifacts related to everyday life in Macedonia, the weaponry and personal objects of fighters, as well as rare original documents from the period between 1770 and 1912. Part of the collection is displayed in the permanent exhibition, while the remaining artifacts are kept in the Research Center for Macedonian History and Documentation (KEMIT) and used in the Museum\u2019s periodic exhibitions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== The exhibition ==\n\nThe presentation of the historical background in the first two rooms helps visitors understand the unconventional nature of the Macedonian Struggle. Its various aspects, constituent elements and principal actors are presented in the thematic units of the museum\u2019s permanent exhibition, and particularly in those rooms devoted to the Makedonomachoi and their actions, to the senior and junior clergy, to the key role of the Greek Consulate-General in Thessaloniki and to the emblematic figure of Pavlos Melas. This is followed by brief units on the Young Turk movement, which marked the formal end of the armed phase of the Struggle with Bulgarian bands, and the Balkan Wars, which marked the end of the Ottoman presence in Macedonia in 1913. A brief documentary informs visitors on later historical developments. In the basement four full-scale dioramas familiarise visitors with every day life in early 20th century Macedonia. The collection of the first floor includes military relics of the Balkan Wars belonging to Greek, Serb, Bulgarian and Ottoman Army. At the lecture room visitors will find a collection of hand-crafted models of vehicles and artillery used by the Greek Army. Furthermore, documentary films on various relevant topics are presented.\n\n\n== Research Center for Macedonian History and Documentation ==\nIn 1988 the museum founded the Research Center for Macedonian History and Documentation (KEMIT) to promote the historical study of Macedonia and of the Macedonian Question in particular. This facility, which houses a specialized library, digitized resources and extensive archival material (Greek and international; public and private), is used by both scholars and students.\nKEMIT\u2019s archival material dates between 1770 and 1912. Also kept at KEMIT is the photographic archive that contains some 4,000 photographs of the people, cities, towns and villages of Macedonia in the 19th and 20th century.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuseum of the Macedonian Struggle Foundation (official site)\nThe Museums of Macedonia\nHellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism\nwww.hri.org\ntravelthessaloniki.com",

        "wiki": "The Church of Hosios David (Greek: \u038c\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0394\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b4) is a late 5th-century church in Thessaloniki, Greece. In Byzantine times, it functioned as the katholikon of the Latomos Monastery (Greek: \u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03ae \u039b\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5/\u039b\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd), and received rich mosaic and fresco decoration, which was renewed in the 12th\u201314th centuries. The surviving examples are of high artistic quality. Under Ottoman rule, the building was converted into a mosque (probably in the 16th century), until it was reconsecrated as a Greek Orthodox church in 1921, receiving its present name. In 1988, included among the Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki on the list of World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe original architecture of the Church of Hosios David was constructed in a cross pattern with squares as the main shape of the floor plan. This pattern would later become more popular. The structure contained square bays in the corners. The bays all connected to the main cross room via hallways. The bays also connected to the outside.\n\nSometime during the middle Byzantine period the structure was damaged by earthquakes. Parts of the structure collapsed including the tribelon. The middle Byzantine period also saw the addition of marbling and a second round of fresco paintings.\n\n\n== Decoration ==\nThe marble decoration in the Church of Hosios David depicted crosses, vines and leaves in swirling detailing.\nThe mosaic of the Theophany is a detailed mosaic in a naturalistic style depicting Christ holding a text saying in Greek, \u201cBehold our God, in whom we hope and we rejoice in our salvation, that he may grand rest to this home.\u201d The mosaic contains symbolism indicating the Evangelists. The mosaic representing the Theophany is complex, with a detailed border, and a lot of elements within the scene. The focus of the image is Christ as shown by his gaze, his position in the center and the halos surrounding Christ\u2019s head and body.\nByzantine murals were discovered under the plaster at the Church of Hosios David. These murals are what is left of extensive fresco paintings from the middle Byzantine period approximately 1160-70. The east part of the south and north barrel-vaults contains depictions of the nativity, the presentation in the temple, our lady of the passion, Christ on the mount of olives, entry into Jerusalem, theophany, and decorative panels meant to resemble marble slabs. The south barrel has the rest of the nativity and presentation in the temple. This area also depicts images of the baptism and transfiguration. The Church of Hosios David contains few borders between the different fresco scenes, which is an uncommon feature for this time.\nMost of the frescos were created during the middle Byzantine period. The frescos: our lady of the passion, the entry into Jerusalem, and Christ on the Mount of Olives are likely later, during the Palaeologan period, approximately c. 1300.. Many of the frescos today are damaged because of effects of time such as: earthquakes, cracking, water damage, and the plaster applied to cover them in the Turkish era.\n\n\n== After the Byzantine Era ==\nThe Church of Hosios David has a simple exterior and is more removed from the heart of Thessaloniki, closer to the mountains. This contributed to the theory that the Church of Hosios David was not converted to a mosque immediately after the Turks conquered the area, as the Turks converted all the best churches, and best locations first. The mosque was called Suluca or Murad Mosque. When the Church of Hosios David was converted to a mosque the walls and by extension the art was covered with plaster. In addition the Turkish period added a minaret at the south-west corner bay. Only the base remains today, together with the spiral staircase with in the remaining part of the minaret.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nEntwistle, Chris, and Liz James, eds.

It was built between 1922 and 1925, after the great fire, on the site of the old Talmud Tora synagogue.\nIt is in the center of the city and forms the central point of the city's market which encompasses over several blocks. It took its name from the architect Eli Modiano, a member of the well known Italo-Jewish Modiano family of the city, who owned the area and later the market. The architectural office of Modiano was also inside the building.\nInside the stoa there are fish markets, butcher shops, tavernas and bars. It is a place of social meeting and historical significance for the city. The building is currently under restoration and is expected to reopen in 2020-21.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nModiano Market\n\u0397 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ac\u03c2 \u039c\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf",

Events such as the Thessaloniki International Fair and the Thessaloniki International Film Festival are held annually, while the city also hosts the largest bi-annual meeting of the Greek diaspora. Thessaloniki was the 2014 European Youth Capital.The city of Thessaloniki was founded in 315 BC by Cassander of Macedon. An important metropolis by the Roman period, Thessaloniki was the second largest and wealthiest city of the Byzantine Empire. It was conquered by the Ottomans in 1430, and remained an important seaport and multi-ethnic metropolis during the nearly five centuries of Turkish rule. It passed from the Ottoman Empire to Greece on 8 November 1912. It is home to numerous notable Byzantine monuments, including the Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as several Roman, Ottoman and Sephardic Jewish structures. The city's main university, Aristotle University, is the largest in Greece and the Balkans.Thessaloniki is a popular tourist destination in Greece. In 2013, National Geographic Magazine included Thessaloniki in its top tourist destinations worldwide, while in 2014 Financial Times FDI magazine (Foreign Direct Investments) declared Thessaloniki as the best mid-sized European city of the future for human capital and lifestyle. Among street photographers, the center of Thessaloniki is also considered the most popular destination for street photography in Greece.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe original name of the city was \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thessalon\u00edk\u0113. It was named after princess Thessalonike of Macedon, the half sister of Alexander the Great, whose name means \"Thessalian victory\", from \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 Thessalos, and \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 'victory' (Nike), honoring the Macedonian victory at the Battle of Crocus Field (353/352 BC).\nMinor variants are also found, including \u0398\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thettalon\u00edki, \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 Thessalon\u00edkia, \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Thessalon\u00edki, and \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd Thessalonik\u00e9on.The name \u03a3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 Salon\u00edki is first attested in Greek in the Chronicle of the Morea (14th century), and is common in folk songs, but it must have originated earlier, as al-Idrisi called it Salunik already in the 12th century. It is the basis for the city's name in other languages: \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0479\u043d\u044a (Solun) in Old Church Slavonic, \u05e1\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05d4 (Salonika) in Ladino, \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0643 (Sel\u00e2nik) in Ottoman Turkish and Selanik in modern Turkish, Salonicco in Italian, Solun or \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043d in the local and neighboring South Slavic languages, \u0421\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 (Salon\u00edki) in Russian, and S\u00e3run\u00e3 in Aromanian, and Salonica or Salonika in English.Thessaloniki was revived as the city's official name in 1912, when it joined the Kingdom of Greece during the Balkan Wars. In local speech, the city's name is typically pronounced with a dark and deep L characteristic of Modern Macedonian accent. The name is often abbreviated as \u0398\u03b5\u03c3/\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== From classical antiquity to the Roman Empire ===\n\nThe city was founded around 315 BC by the King Cassander of Macedon, on or near the site of the ancient town of Therma and 26 other local villages. He named it after his wife Thessalonike, a half-sister of Alexander the Great and princess of Macedonia as daughter of Philip II. Under the kingdom of Macedonia the city retained its own autonomy and parliament and evolved to become the most important city in Macedonia.After the fall of the Kingdom of Macedonia in 168 BC, in 148 BC Thessalonica was made the capital of the Roman province of Macedonia.  Thessalonica became a free city of the Roman Republic under Mark Antony in 41 BC. It grew to be an important trade hub located on the Via Egnatia, the road connecting Dyrrhachium with Byzantium, which facilitated trade between Thessaloniki and great centers of commerce such as Rome and Byzantium.  Thessaloniki also lay at the southern end of the main north\u2013south route through the Balkans along the valleys of the Morava and Axios river valleys, thereby linking the Balkans with the rest of Greece. The city became the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia; later it became the capital of all the Greek provinces of the Roman Empire because of its importance in the Balkan peninsula.\nAt the time of the Roman Empire, about 50 A.D., Thessaloniki was also one of the early centers of Christianity; while on his second missionary journey, Paul the Apostle visited this city's chief synagogue on three Sabbaths and sowed the seeds for Thessaloniki's first Christian church.  Later, Paul wrote two letters to the new church at Thessaloniki, preserved in the Biblical canon as First and Second Thessalonians.  Some scholars hold that the First Epistle to the Thessalonians is the first written book of the New Testament.\n\nIn 306 AD, Thessaloniki acquired a patron saint, St. Demetrius, a Christian whom Galerius is said to have put to death. Most scholars agree with Hippolyte Delehaye's theory that Demetrius was not a Thessaloniki native, but his veneration was transferred to Thessaloniki when it replaced Sirmium as the main military base in the Balkans. A basilical church dedicated to St. Demetrius, Hagios Demetrios, was first built in the 5th century AD and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided into the tetrarchy, Thessaloniki became the administrative capital of one of the four portions of the Empire under Galerius Maximianus Caesar, where Galerius commissioned an imperial palace, a new hippodrome, a triumphal arch and a mausoleum among others.In 379, when the Roman Prefecture of Illyricum was divided between the East and West Roman Empires, Thessaloniki became the capital of the new Prefecture of Illyricum. The following year, the Edict of Thessalonica made Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire. In 390, Gothic troops under the Roman Emperor Theodosius I, led a massacre against the inhabitants of Thessalonica, who had risen in revolt against the Gothic soldiers.  By the time of the Fall of Rome in 476, Thessaloniki was the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\n\n=== Byzantine era and Middle Ages ===\n\nFrom the first years of the Byzantine Empire, Thessaloniki was considered the second city in the Empire after Constantinople, both in terms of wealth and size. with a population of 150,000 in the mid-12th century. The city held this status until its transfer to Venetian control in 1423. In the 14th century, the city's population exceeded 100,000 to 150,000, making it larger than London at the time.During the 6th and 7th centuries, the area around Thessaloniki was invaded by Avars and Slavs, who unsuccessfully laid siege to the city several times, as narrated in the Miracles of Saint Demetrius. Traditional historiography stipulates that many Slavs settled in the hinterland of Thessaloniki; however, modern scholars consider this migration to have been on a much smaller scale than previously thought. In the 9th century, the Byzantine Greek missionaries Cyril and Methodius, both natives of the city, created the first literary language of the Slavs, the Old Church Slavonic, most likely based on the Slavic dialect used in the hinterland of their hometown.An Arab naval attack in 904 resulted in the sack of the city.\nThe economic expansion of the city continued through the 12th century as the rule of the Komnenoi emperors expanded Byzantine control to the north. Thessaloniki passed out of Byzantine hands in 1204, when Constantinople was captured by the forces of the Fourth Crusade and incorporated the city and its surrounding territories in the Kingdom of Thessalonica \u2014 which then became the largest vassal of the Latin Empire. In 1224, the Kingdom of Thessalonica was overrun by the Despotate of Epirus, a remnant of the former Byzantine Empire, under Theodore Komnenos Doukas who crowned himself Emperor, and the city became the capital of the short-lived Empire of Thessalonica. Following his defeat at Klokotnitsa however in 1230, the Empire of Thessalonica became a vassal state of the Second Bulgarian Empire until it was recovered again in 1246, this time by the Nicaean Empire.In 1342, the city saw the rise of the Commune of the Zealots, an anti-aristocratic party formed of sailors and the poor, which is nowadays described as social-revolutionary. The city was practically independent of the rest of the Empire, as it had its own government, a form of republic. The zealot movement was overthrown in 1350 and the city was reunited with the rest of the Empire.The capture of Gallipoli by the Ottomans in 1354 kicked off a rapid Turkish expansion in the southern Balkans, conducted both by the Ottomans themselves and by semi-independent Turkish ghazi warrior-bands. By 1369, the Ottomans were able to conquer Adrianople (modern Edirne), which became their new capital until 1453. Thessalonica, ruled by Manuel II Palaiologos (r. 1391\u20131425) itself surrendered after a lengthy siege in 1383\u20131387, along with most of eastern and central Macedonia, to the forces of Sultan Murad I. Initially, the surrendered cities were allowed complete autonomy in exchange for payment of the kharaj poll-tax. Following the death of Emperor John V Palaiologos in 1391, however, Manuel II escaped Ottoman custody and went to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor, succeeding his father. This angered Sultan Bayezid I, who laid waste to the remaining Byzantine territories, and then turned on Chrysopolis, which was captured by storm and largely destroyed. Thessalonica too submitted again to Ottoman rule at this time, possibly after brief resistance, but was treated more leniently: although the city was brought under full Ottoman control, the Christian population and the Church retained most of their possessions, and the city retained its institutions.\n\nThessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until 1403, when Emperor Manuel II sided with Bayezid's eldest son S\u00fcleyman in the Ottoman succession struggle that broke out following the crushing defeat and capture of Bayezid at the Battle of Ankara against Tamerlane in 1402. In exchange for his support, in the Treaty of Gallipoli the Byzantine emperor secured the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the Chalcidice peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers Strymon and Pineios. Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous appanage to John VII Palaiologos. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the Despot Andronikos Palaiologos, who was supervised by Demetrios Leontares until 1415. Thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity after 1403, as the Turks were preoccupied with their own civil war, but was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by Musa \u00c7elebi) and 1416 (during the uprising of Mustafa \u00c7elebi against Mehmed I). Once the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city began to increase again. Just as during the 1383\u20131387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western help, or submission to the Ottomans.In 1423, Despot Andronikos Palaiologos ceded it to the Republic of Venice with the hope that it could be protected from the Ottomans who were besieging the city. The Venetians held Thessaloniki until it was captured by the Ottoman Sultan Murad II on 29 March 1430.\n\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n\nWhen Sultan Murad II captured Thessaloniki and sacked it in 1430, contemporary reports estimated that about one-fifth of the city's population was enslaved. Ottoman artillery was used to secure the city's capture and bypass its double walls. Upon the conquest of Thessaloniki, some of its inhabitants escaped, including intellectuals such as Theodorus Gaza \"Thessalonicensis\" and Andronicus Callistus. However, the change of sovereignty from the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman one did not affect the city's prestige as a major imperial city and trading hub. Thessaloniki and Smyrna, although smaller in size than Constantinople, were the Ottoman Empire's most important trading hubs. Thessaloniki's importance was mostly in the field of shipping, but also in manufacturing, while most of the city's trade was controlled by ethnic Greeks.\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, the city's population of Ottoman Muslims (including those of Turkish origin, as well as Albanian Muslim, Bulgarian Muslim and Greek Muslim of convert origin) grew substantially. According to the 1478 census Sel\u00e2nik (Ottoman Turkish: \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0643\u200e), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniots community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the city's population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regime's invitation to Jewish settlement was a strategy to prevent the ethnic Greek population from dominating the city.Thessaloniki was the capital of the Sanjak of Selanik within the wider Rumeli Eyalet (Balkans) until 1826, and subsequently the capital of Selanik Eyalet (after 1867, the Selanik Vilayet). This consisted of the sanjaks of Selanik, Serres and Drama between 1826 and 1912.\n\nWith the break out of the Greek War of Independence in the spring of 1821, the governor Yusuf Bey imprisoned in his headquarters more than 400 hostages. On 18 May, when Yusuf learned of the insurrection to the villages of Chalkidiki, he ordered half of his hostages to be slaughtered before his eyes. The mulla of Thessaloniki, Hayr\u0131\u00fclah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations: \"Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning. It seems that Yusuf Bey, the Yeniceri Agasi, the Suba\u015f\u0131, the hocas and the ulemas have all gone raving mad.\" It would take until the end of the century for the city's Greek community to recover.Thessaloniki was also a Janissary stronghold where novice Janissaries were trained. In June 1826, regular Ottoman soldiers attacked and destroyed the Janissary base in Thessaloniki while also killing over 10,000 Janissaries, an event known as The Auspicious Incident in Ottoman history. In 1870\u20131917, driven by economic growth, the city's population expanded by 70%, reaching 135,000 in 1917.The last few decades of Ottoman control over the city were an era of revival, particularly in terms of the city's infrastructure. It was at that time that the Ottoman administration of the city acquired an \"official\" face with the creation of the Government House while a number of new public buildings were built in the eclectic style in order to project the European face both of Thessaloniki and the Ottoman Empire. The city walls were torn down between 1869 and 1889, efforts for a planned expansion of the city are evident as early as 1879, the first tram service started in 1888 and the city streets were illuminated with electric lamp posts in 1908. In 1888 the Oriental Railway connected Thessaloniki to Central Europe via rail through Belgrade and to Monastir in 1893, while the Thessaloniki-Istanbul Junction Railway connected it to Constantinople in 1896.\n\n\n=== 20th century and since ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, Thessaloniki was in the center of radical activities by various groups; the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, founded in 1897, and the Greek Macedonian Committee, founded in 1903. In 1903 an anarchist group known as the Boatmen of Thessaloniki planted bombs in several buildings in Thessaloniki, including the Ottoman Bank, with some assistance from the IMRO. The Greek consulate in Ottoman Thessaloniki (now the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle) served as the center of operations for the Greek guerillas.\nDuring this period, and since the 14th century, Thessaloniki's Jewish element was the most dominant; it was the only city in Europe where the Jews were a majority of the total population. The city was ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan. In 1890 its population had risen to 118,000, 47% of which were Jews, followed by Turks (22%), Greeks (14%), Bulgars (8%), Roma (2%), and others (7%). By 1913, the ethnic composition of the city had changed so that the population stood at 157,889, with Jews at 39%, followed again by Turks (29%), Greeks (25%), Bulgars (4%), Roma (2%), and others at 1%. Many varied religions were practiced and many languages spoken, including Ladino, a dialect of Spanish spoken by the city's Jews.\nThessaloniki was also the center of activities of the Young Turks, a political reform movement, which goal was to replace the Ottoman Empire's absolute monarchy with a constitutional government. The Young Turks started out as an underground movement, until finally in 1908, they started the Young Turk Revolution from the city of Thessaloniki, by which their revolutionaries gained control over the Ottoman Empire. Eleftherias (Liberty) Square, where the Young Turks gathered at the outbreak of the revolution, is named after the event.\n\nAs the First Balkan War broke out, Greece declared war on the Ottoman Empire and expanded its borders. When Eleftherios Venizelos, Prime Minister at the time, was asked if the Greek army should move towards Thessaloniki or Monastir (now Bitola, Republic of North Macedonia), Venizelos replied \"\u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2!\" (Thessaloniki, at all costs!). As both Greece and Bulgaria wanted Thessaloniki, the Ottoman garrison of the city entered negotiations with both armies. On 8 November 1912 (26 October Old Style), the feast day of the city's patron saint, Saint Demetrius, the Greek Army accepted the surrender of the Ottoman garrison at Thessaloniki. The Bulgarian army arrived one day after the surrender of the city to Greece and Tahsin Pasha, ruler of the city, told the Bulgarian officials that \"I have only one Thessaloniki, which I have surrendered\". After the Second Balkan War, Thessaloniki and the rest of the Greek portion of Macedonia were officially annexed to Greece by the Treaty of Bucharest in 1913. On 18 March 1913 George I of Greece was assassinated in the city by Alexandros Schinas.In 1915, during World War I, a large Allied expeditionary force established a base at Thessaloniki for operations against pro-German Bulgaria. This culminated in the establishment of the Macedonian Front, also known as the Salonika Front. In 1916, pro-Venizelist Greek army officers and civilians, with the support of the Allies, launched an uprising, creating a pro-Allied temporary government by the name of the \"Provisional Government of National Defence\" that controlled the \"New Lands\" (lands that were gained by Greece in the Balkan Wars, most of Northern Greece including Greek Macedonia, the North Aegean as well as the island of Crete); the official government of the King in Athens, the \"State of Athens\", controlled \"Old Greece\" which were traditionally monarchist. The State of Thessaloniki was disestablished with the unification of the two opposing Greek governments under Venizelos, following the abdication of King Constantine in 1917.On 30 December 1915 an Austrian air raid on Thessaloniki alarmed many town civilians and killed at least one person, and in response the Allied troops based there arrested the German and Austrian and Bulgarian and Turkish vice-consuls and their families and dependents and put them on a battleship, and billeted troops in their consulate buildings in Thessaloniki.\n\nMost of the old center of the city was destroyed by the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, which was started accidentally by an unattended kitchen fire on 18 August 1917. The fire swept through the centre of the city, leaving 72,000 people homeless; according to the Pallis Report, most of them were Jewish (50,000). Many businesses were destroyed, as a result, 70% of the population were unemployed. Two churches and many synagogues and mosques were lost. Nearly one-quarter of the total population of approximately 271,157 became homeless. Following the fire the government prohibited quick rebuilding, so it could implement the new redesign of the city according to the European-style urban plan prepared by a group of architects, including the Briton Thomas Mawson, and headed by French architect Ernest H\u00e9brard. Property values fell from 6.5 million Greek drachmas to 750,000.After the defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War and during the break-up of the Ottoman Empire, a population exchange took place between Greece and Turkey. Over 160,000 ethnic Greeks deported from the former Ottoman Empire \u2013 particularly Greeks from Asia Minor  and East Thrace were resettled in the city, changing its demographics. Additionally many of the city's Muslims, including Ottoman Greek Muslims, were deported to Turkey, ranging at about 20,000 people. This made the Greek element dominant, while the Jewish population was reduced to a minority for the first time since the 14th century.\n\nDuring World War II Thessaloniki was heavily bombarded by Fascist Italy (with 232 people dead, 871 wounded and over 800 buildings damaged or destroyed in November 1940 alone), and, the Italians having failed in their invasion of Greece, it fell to the forces of Nazi Germany on 8 April 1941 and went under German occupation. The Nazis soon forced the Jewish residents into a ghetto near the railroads and on 15 March 1943 began the deportation of the city's Jews to Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. Most were immediately sent to the gas chambers. Of the 45,000 Jews deported to Auschwitz, only 4% survived.\n\nDuring a speech in Reichstag, Hitler claimed that the intention of his Balkan campaign, was to prevent the Allies from establishing \"a new Macedonian front\", like they did during WWI. The importance of Thessaloniki to Nazi Germany can be demonstrated by the fact that, initially, Hitler had planned to incorporate it directly in the Third Reich (that is, make it part of Germany) and not have it controlled by a puppet state such as the Hellenic State or an ally of Germany (Thessaloniki had been promised to Yugoslavia as a reward for joining the Axis on 25 March 1941). As it was the first major city in Greece to fall to the occupying forces, the first Greek resistance group formed in Thessaloniki (under the name \u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, Elefther\u00eda, \"Freedom\") as well as the first anti-Nazi newspaper in an occupied territory anywhere in Europe, also by the name Eleftheria. Thessaloniki was also home to a military camp-converted-concentration camp, known in German as \"Konzentrationslager Pavlo Mela\" (Pavlos Melas Concentration Camp), where members of the resistance and other anti-fascists were held either to be killed or sent to other concentration camps. On 30 October 1944, after battles with the retreating German army and the Security Battalions of Poulos, forces of ELAS entered Thessaloniki as liberators headed by Markos Vafiadis (who didn't obey to orders from ELAS leadership in Athens to not enter the city). Pro-EAM celebrations and demonstrations followed in the city. In the 1946 monarchy referendum, the majority of the locals voted in favor of a republic, contrary to the rest of Greece.After the war, Thessaloniki was rebuilt with large-scale development of new infrastructure and industry throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Many of its architectural treasures still remain, adding value to the city as a tourist destination, while several early Christian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1988. In 1997, Thessaloniki was celebrated as the European Capital of Culture, sponsoring events across the city and the region. Agency established to oversee the cultural activities of that year 1997 was still in existence by 2010. In 2004 the city hosted a number of the football events as part of the 2004 Summer Olympics.Today, Thessaloniki has become one of the most important trade and business hubs in Southeastern Europe, with its port, the Port of Thessaloniki being one of the largest in the Aegean and facilitating trade throughout the Balkan hinterland. On 26 October 2012 the city celebrated its centennial since its incorporation into Greece. The city also forms one of the largest student centers in Southeastern Europe, is host to the largest student population in Greece and was the European Youth Capital in 2014.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Geology ===\nThessaloniki lies on the northern fringe of the Thermaic Gulf on its eastern coast and is bound by Mount Chortiatis on its southeast. Its proximity to imposing mountain ranges, hills and fault lines, especially towards its southeast have historically made the city prone to geological changes.\nSince medieval times, Thessaloniki was hit by strong earthquakes, notably in 1759, 1902, 1978 and 1995. On 19\u201320 June 1978, the city suffered a series of powerful earthquakes, registering 5.5 and 6.5 on the Richter scale. The tremors caused considerable damage to a number of buildings and ancient monuments, but the city withstood the catastrophe without any major problems. One apartment building in central Thessaloniki collapsed during the second earthquake, killing many, raising the final death toll to 51.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThessaloniki's climate is directly affected by the sea it is situated on. The city lies in a transitional climatic zone, so its climate displays characteristics of several climates. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, it has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) that borders on a Mediterranean climate (Csa), as well as a semi-arid climate (BSk), observed on the periphery of the region. Its average annual precipitation of 450 mm (17.7 inches) is due to the Pindus rain shadow drying the westerly winds. However, the city has a summer precipitation between 20 to 30 mm (0.79 to 1.18 inches), which prevents it from qualifying as a Mediterranean climate (Csa), and increases gradually towards the north and west, turning humid subtropical.Winters are relatively dry, with common morning frost. Snowfalls occur sporadically more or less every winter, but the snow cover does not last for more than a few days. Fog is common, with an average of 193 foggy days in a year. During the coldest winters, temperatures can drop to \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F). The record minimum temperature in Thessaloniki was \u221214 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F). On average, Thessaloniki experiences frost (sub-zero temperature) 32 days a year. The coldest month of the year in the city is January, with an average 24-hour temperature of 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F). Wind is also usual in the winter months, with December and January having an average wind speed of 26 km/h (16 mph).Thessaloniki's summers are hot and quite dry. Maximum temperatures usually rise above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), but they rarely approach or go over 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F); the average number of days the temperature is above 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) is 32. The maximum recorded temperature in the city was 44 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F). Rain seldom falls in summer, mainly during thunderstorms. In the summer months Thessaloniki also experiences strong heat waves. The hottest month of the year in the city is July, with an average 24-hour temperature of 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F). The average wind speed for June and July in Thessaloniki is 20 kilometres per hour (12 mph).\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAccording to the Kallikratis reform, as of 1 January 2011 the Thessaloniki Urban Area (Greek: \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2) which makes up the \"City of Thessaloniki\", is made up of six self-governing municipalities (Greek: \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9) and one municipal unit (Greek: \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1). The municipalities that are included in the Thessaloniki Urban Area are those of Thessaloniki (the city center and largest in population size), Kalamaria, Neapoli-Sykies, Pavlos Melas, Kordelio-Evosmos, Ampelokipoi-Menemeni, and the municipal units of Pylaia and Panorama, part of the municipality of Pylaia-Chortiatis. Prior to the Kallikratis reform, the Thessaloniki Urban Area was made up of twice as many municipalities, considerably smaller in size, which created bureaucratic problems.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki Municipality ===\n\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki (Greek: \u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2) is the second most populous in Greece, after Athens, with a resident population of 325,182 (in 2011) and an area of 19.307 square kilometres (7.454 square miles). The municipality forms the core of the Thessaloniki Urban Area, with its central district (the city center), referred to as the Kentro, meaning 'center' or 'downtown'.The city's first mayor, Osman Sait Bey, was appointed when the institution of mayor was inaugurated under the Ottoman Empire in 1912. The incumbent mayor is Konstantinos Zervas. In 2011, the municipality of Thessaloniki had a budget of \u20ac464.33 million while the budget of 2012 stands at \u20ac409.00 million.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nThessaloniki is the second largest city in Greece. It is an influential city for the northern parts of the country and is the capital of the region of Central Macedonia and the Thessaloniki regional unit. The Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace is also based in Thessaloniki, being that the city is the de facto capital of the Greek region of Macedonia.It is customary every year for the Prime Minister of Greece to announce his administration's policies on a number of issues, such as the economy, at the opening night of the Thessaloniki International Fair. In 2010, during the first months of the 2010 Greek debt crisis, the entire cabinet of Greece met in Thessaloniki to discuss the country's future.In the Hellenic Parliament, the Thessaloniki urban area constitutes a 16-seat constituency. As of the 2019 Greek legislative election the largest party in Thessaloniki is the New Democracy with 35.55% of the vote, followed by the Coalition of the Radical Left (31.29%) and the Movement for Change (6.05%). The table below summarizes the results of the latest elections.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nArchitecture in Thessaloniki is the direct result of the city's position at the centre of all historical developments in the Balkans. Aside from its commercial importance, Thessaloniki was also for many centuries the military and administrative hub of the region, and beyond this the transportation link between Europe and the Levant.\nMerchants, traders and refugees from all over Europe settled in the city. The need for commercial and public buildings in this new era of prosperity led to the construction of large edifices in the city center. During this time, the city saw the building of banks, large hotels, theatres, warehouses, and factories. Architects who designed some of the most notable buildings of the city, in the late 19th and early 20th century, include Vitaliano Poselli, Pietro Arrigoni, Xenophon Paionidis, Salvatore Poselli, Leonardo Gennari, Eli Modiano, Mosh\u00e9 Jacques, Joseph Pleyber, Frederic Charnot, Ernst Ziller, Roubens Max, Levi Ernst, Angelos Siagas, Alexandros Tzonis using mainly the styles of Eclecticism, Art Nouveau and Neobaroque.\n\nThe city layout changed after 1870, when the seaside fortifications gave way to extensive piers, and many of the oldest walls of the city were demolished, including those surrounding the White Tower, which today stands as the main landmark of the city. As parts of the early Byzantine walls were demolished, this allowed the city to expand east and west along the coast.The expansion of Eleftherias Square towards the sea completed the new commercial hub of the city and at the time was considered one of the most vibrant squares of the city. As the city grew, workers moved to the western districts, because of their proximity to factories and industrial activities; while the middle and upper classes gradually moved from the city-center to the eastern suburbs, leaving mainly businesses. In 1917, a devastating fire swept through the city and burned uncontrollably for 32 hours. It destroyed the city's historic center and a large part of its architectural heritage, but paved the way for modern development featuring wider diagonal avenues and monumental squares.\n\n\n=== City centre ===\n\nAfter the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, a team of architects and urban planners including Thomas Mawson and Ernest Hebrard, a French architect, chose the Byzantine era as the basis of their (re)building designs for Thessaloniki's city centre. The new city plan included axes, diagonal streets and monumental squares, with a street grid that would channel traffic smoothly. The plan of 1917 included provisions for future population expansions and a street and road network that would be, and still is sufficient today. It contained sites for public buildings and provided for the restoration of Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques.\n\nAlso called the historic centre, it is divided into several districts, including Dimokratias Square (Democracy Sq. known also as Vardaris) Ladadika (where many entertainment venues and tavernas are located), Kapani (were the city's central Modiano market is located), Diagonios, Navarinou, Rotonda, Agia Sofia and Hippodromio, which are all located around Thessaloniki's most central point, Aristotelous Square.\nVarious commercial stoas around Aristotelous are named from the city's past and historic personalities of the city, like stoa Hirsch, stoa Carasso/Ermou, Pelosov, Colombou, Modiano, Morpurgo, Mordoch, Simcha, Malakopi, Olympios, Emboron, Rogoti, Vyzantio, Tatti, Agiou Mina, Karipi etc.The western portion of the city centre is home to Thessaloniki's law courts, its central international railway station and the port, while its eastern side hosts the city's two universities, the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Centre, the city's main stadium, its archaeological and Byzantine museums, the new city hall and its central parks and gardens, namely those of the \u03a7\u0391\u039d\u0398 and Pedion tou Areos.\n\n\n=== Ano Poli ===\n\nAno Poli (also called Old Town and literally the Upper Town) is the heritage listed district north of Thessaloniki's city center that was not engulfed by the great fire of 1917 and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site by ministerial actions of Melina Merkouri, during the 1980s. It consists of Thessaloniki's most traditional part of the city, still featuring small stone paved streets, old squares and homes featuring old Greek and Ottoman architecture. It is the favorite area of Thessaloniki's poets, intellectuals and bohemians.\n\nAno Poli also, is the highest point in Thessaloniki and as such, is the location of the city's acropolis, its Byzantine fort, the Heptapyrgion, a large portion of the city's remaining walls, and with many of its additional Ottoman and Byzantine structures still standing. The area provides access to the Seich Sou Forest National Park and features panoramic views of the whole city and the Thermaic Gulf. On clear days Mount Olympus, at about 100 km (62 mi) away across the gulf, can also be seen towering the horizon.\n\n\n=== Northwestern Thessaloniki ===\nNorthwestern Thessaloniki had always been associated with industry and the working class because as the city grew during the 1920s, many workers had moved there, because of its proximity near factories and industrial activities.\nToday many factories and industries have been moved further out west and the area is experiencing rapid growth as does the southeast. Many factories in this area have been converted to cultural centers, while past military grounds that are being surrounded by densely built neighborhoods are awaiting transformation into parklands.\nNorthwest Thessaloniki forms the main entry point into the city of Thessaloniki with the avenues of Monastiriou, Lagkada and 26is Octovriou passing through it, as well as the extension of the A1 motorway, feeding into Thessaloniki's city center. The area is home to the Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal (KTEL), the Zeitenlik Allied memorial military cemetery and to large entertainment venues of the city, such as Milos, Fix, Vilka (which are housed in converted old factories). Northwestern Thessaloniki is also home to Moni Lazariston, located in Stavroupoli, which today forms one of the most important cultural centers for the city, including MOMus\u2013Museum of Modern Art\u2013Costakis Collection and two theatres of the National Theatre of Northern Greece. Construction on the Holocaust Museum of Greece began in the city in 2018 in the area of the Old Railway Station.\nIn this area are located the Railway Museum of Thessaloniki and the Water Supply Museum.\n\n\n=== Southeastern Thessaloniki ===\n\nThe area along the today Vasileos Georgiou and Vasilissis Olgas avenues, was up until the 1920s home to the city's most affluent residents and formed the outermost suburbs of the city at the time, with the area close to the Thermaic Gulf coast called Exoch\u00e8s (des Campagnes), from the 19th century holiday villas which defined the area. Some of them include Villa Allatini, Villa Bianca, Villa Mehmet Kapanci, Villa Modiano, Villa Mordoch and others.Today southeastern Thessaloniki has in some way become a natural extension of the city center, with the avenues of Megalou Alexandrou, Georgiou Papandreou (Antheon), Vasileos Georgiou, Vasilissis Olgas, Delfon, Konstantinou Karamanli (Nea Egnatia) and Papanastasiou passing through it, enclosing an area traditionally called \u039d\u03c4\u03b5\u03c0\u03ce (Dep\u00f3, lit. D\u00e9p\u00f4t), from the name of the old tram station, owned by a French company.\nThe municipality of Kalamaria is also located in southeastern Thessaloniki and was firstly inhabited mainly by Greek refugees from Asia Minor and East Thrace after 1922.Southeastern Thessaloniki is also home to three of the city's football stadiums, the Thessaloniki Concert Hall, the Poseidonio aquatic and athletic complex, the Northern Greece Naval Command and the old royal palace (called Palataki), located on the most westerly point of Karabournaki cape.\nOther extended residential areas that belong to southeastern Thessaloniki are Charilaou and Toumba, which is divided in \"Ano Toumpa\" and \"Kato Toumpa\". Toumba was named after the homonymous hill of Toumba, situated in the northwest of the area. It was created by refugees after the 1922 Asia Minor disaster and the population exchange (1923\u201324). Toumba is one of the most famous areas of Thessaloniki, mainly due to the football stadium of the local team PAOK FC and its important archaeological site on the hill of Toumba, where extensive archaeological research takes place.\n\n\n=== Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments (UNESCO) ===\n\nBecause of Thessaloniki's importance during the early Christian and Byzantine periods, the city is host to several paleochristian monuments that have significantly contributed to the development of Byzantine art and architecture throughout the Byzantine Empire as well as Serbia. The evolution of Imperial Byzantine architecture and the prosperity of Thessaloniki go hand in hand, especially during the first years of the Empire, when the city continued to flourish. It was at that time that the Complex of Roman emperor Galerius was built, as well as the first church of Hagios Demetrios.By the 8th century, the city had become an important administrative center of the Byzantine Empire, and handled much of the Empire's Balkan affairs. During that time, the city saw the creation of more notable Christian churches that are now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as Hagia Sophia of Thessaloniki, the Church of the Acheiropoietos, the Church of Panagia Chalkeon. When the Ottoman Empire took control of Thessaloniki in 1430, most of the city's churches were converted into mosques, but have survived to this day. Travelers such as Paul Lucas and Abdulmejid I document the city's wealth in Christian monuments during the years of the Ottoman control of the city.\nThe church of Hagios Demetrios was burnt down during the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, as did many other of the city's monuments, but it was rebuilt. During World War II, the city was extensively bombed and as such many of Thessaloniki's paleochristian and Byzantine monuments were heavily damaged. Some of the sites were not restored until the 1980s. Thessaloniki has more UNESCO World Heritage Sites listed than any other city in Greece, a total of 15 monuments. They have been listed since 1988.\n\n\n=== Urban sculpture ===\n\nThere are around 150 statues or busts in the city. Probably the most famous one is the equestrian statue of Alexander the Great on the promenade, placed in 1973 and created by sculptor Evangelos Moustakas. An equestrian statue of Constantine I, by sculptor Georgios Dimitriades, is located in Demokratias Square. Other notable statues include that of Eleftherios Venizelos by sculptor Giannis Pappas, Pavlos Melas by Natalia Mela, the statue of Emmanouel Pappas by Memos Makris, Chrysostomos of Smyrna by Athanasios Apartis, such as various creations by George Zongolopoulos.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki 2012 Program ===\n\nWith the 100th anniversary of the 1912 incorporation of Thessaloniki into Greece, the government announced a large-scale redevelopment program for the city of Thessaloniki, which aims in addressing the current environmental and spatial problems that the city faces. More specifically, the program will drastically change the physiognomy of the city by relocating the Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center and grounds of the Thessaloniki International Fair outside the city centre and turning the current location into a large metropolitan park, redeveloping the coastal front of the city, relocating the city's numerous military camps and using the grounds and facilities to create large parklands and cultural centers; and the complete redevelopment of the harbor and the Lachanokipoi and Dendropotamos districts (behind and near the Port of Thessaloniki) into a commercial business district, with possible highrise developments.The plan also envisions the creation of new wide avenues in the outskirts of the city and the creation of pedestrian-only zones in the city centre. Furthermore, the program includes plans to expand the jurisdiction of Seich Sou Forest National Park and the improvement of accessibility to and from the Old Town. The ministry has said that the project will take an estimated 15 years to be completed, in 2025.Part of the plan has been implemented with extensive pedestrianization's within the city center by the municipality of Thessaloniki and the revitalization the eastern urban waterfront/promenade, \u039d\u03ad\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 (N\u00e9a Paral\u00eda, lit. new promenade), with a modern and vibrant design. Its first section opened in 2008, having been awarded as the best public project in Greece of the last five years by the Hellenic Institute of Architecture.The municipality of Thessaloniki's budget for the reconstruction of important areas of the city and the completion of the waterfront, opened in January 2014, was estimated at around \u20ac28.2 million (US$39.9 million) for the year 2011 alone.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThessaloniki rose to economic prominence as a major economic hub in the Balkans during the years of the Roman Empire. The Pax Romana and the city's strategic position allowed for the facilitation of trade between Rome and Byzantium (later Constantinople and now Istanbul) through Thessaloniki by means of the Via Egnatia. The Via Egnatia also functioned as an important line of communication between the Roman Empire and the nations of Asia, particularly in relation to the Silk Road. With the partition of the Roman Emp. into East (Byzantine) and West, Thessaloniki became the second-largest city of the Eastern Roman Empire after New Rome (Constantinople) in terms of economic might. Under the Empire, Thessaloniki was the largest port in the Balkans. As the city passed from Byzantium to the Republic of Venice in 1423, it was subsequently conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Under Ottoman rule the city retained its position as the most important trading hub in the Balkans. Manufacturing, shipping and trade were the most important components of the city's economy during the Ottoman period, and the majority of the city's trade at the time was controlled by ethnic Greeks. Plus, the Jewish community was also an important factor in the trade sector.Historically important industries for the economy of Thessaloniki included tobacco (in 1946 35% of all tobacco companies in Greece were headquartered in the city, and 44% in 1979) and banking (in Ottoman years Thessaloniki was a major center for investment from western Europe, with the Bank of Thessaloniki (French: Banque de Salonique) having a capital of 20 million French francs in 1909).\n\n\n=== Services ===\n\nThe service sector accounts for nearly two thirds of the total labour force of Thessaloniki. Of those working in services, 20% were employed in trade, 13% in education and healthcare, 7.1% in real estate, 6.3% in transport, communications & storing, 6.1% in the finance industry & service-providing organizations, 5.7% in public administration & insurance services and 5.4% in hotels & restaurants.The city's port, the Port of Thessaloniki, is one of the largest ports in the Aegean and as a free port, it functions as a major gateway to the Balkan hinterland. In 2010, more than 15.8 million tons of products went through the city's port, making it the second-largest port in Greece after Aghioi Theodoroi, surpassing Piraeus. At 273,282 TEUs, it is also Greece's second-largest container port after Piraeus. As a result, the city is a major transportation hub for the whole of south-eastern Europe, carrying, among other things, trade to and from the neighbouring countries.In recent years Thessaloniki has begun to turn into a major port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean. The Greek ministry of tourism considers Thessaloniki to be Greece's second most important commercial port, and companies such as Royal Caribbean International have expressed interest in adding the Port of Thessaloniki to their destinations. A total of 30 cruise ships are expected to arrive at Thessaloniki in 2011.\n\n\n=== Companies ===\nRecent historyAfter WWII and the Greek civil war, heavy industrialization of the city's suburbs began in the middle 1950s.During the 1980s a spate of factory shut downs occurred, mostly of automobile manufacters, such as Agricola (vehicles), AutoDiana, EBIAM, Motoemil, Pantelemidis-TITAN and C.AR (automobiles). Since the 1990s, companies took advantage of cheaper labour markets and more lax regulations in other countries, and among the largest companies to shut down factories were Goodyear, AVEZ pasta industry (one of the first industrial factories in northern Greece, built in 1926),  Philkeram Johnson, AGNO dairy and VIAMIL.\nHowever, Thessaloniki still remains a major business hub in the Balkans and Greece, with a number of important Greek companies headquartered in the city, such as the Hellenic Vehicle Industry (ELVO), Namco (automobiles), Astra Airlines, Ellinair, Pyramis and MLS Multimedia, which introduced the first Greek-built smartphone in 2012.\nIndustryIn early 1960s, with the collaboration of Standard Oil and ESSO-Pappas, a large industrial zone was created, containing refineries, oil refinery and steel production (owned by Hellenic Steel Co.). The zone attracted also a series of different factories during the next decades.\nTitan Cement has also facilities outside the city, on the road to Serres, such as the AGET Heracles, a member of the Lafarge group, and Alumil SA.\nMultinational companies such as Air Liquide, Cyanamid, Nestl\u00e9, Pfizer, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company and Vivartia have also industrial facilities in the suburbs of the city.\nFoodstuffFoodstuff or drink companies headquartered in the city include the Macedonian Milk Industry (Mevgal), Allatini, Barbastathis, Hellenic Sugar Industry, Haitoglou Bros, Mythos Brewery, Malamatina, while the Goody's chain started from the city.The American Farm School also has important contribution in food production.\n\n\n=== Macroeconomic indicators ===\nIn 2011, the regional unit of Thessaloniki had a Gross Domestic Product of \u20ac18.293 billion (ranked 2nd amongst the country's regional units), comparable to Bahrain or Cyprus, and a per capita of \u20ac15,900 (ranked 16th). In Purchasing Power Parity, the same indicators are \u20ac19,851 billion (2nd) and \u20ac17,200 (15th) respectively. In terms of comparison with the European Union average, Thessaloniki's GDP per capita indicator stands at 63% the EU average and 69% in PPP \u2013 this is comparable to the German state of Brandenburg. Overall, Thessaloniki accounts for 8.9% of the total economy of Greece. Between 1995 and 2008 Thessaloniki's GDP saw an average growth rate of 4.1% per annum (ranging from +14.5% in 1996 to \u221211.1% in 2005) while in 2011 the economy contracted by \u22127.8%.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Historical ethnic statistics ===\nThe tables below show the ethnic statistics of Thessaloniki during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n\n=== Population growth ===\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki is the most populous in the Thessaloniki Urban Area. Its population has increased in the latest census and the metropolitan area's population rose to over one million. The city forms the base of the Thessaloniki metropolitan area, with latest census in 2011 giving it a population of 1,030,338.\n\n\n=== Jews of Thessaloniki ===\n\nThe Jewish population in Greece is the oldest in mainland Europe (see Romaniotes). When Paul the Apostle came in Thessaloniki he taught in the area of what today is called Upper City. Later, during the Ottoman period, with the coming of Sephardic Jews from Spain, the community of Thessaloniki became mostly Sephardic. Thessaloniki became the largest center in Europe of the Sephardic Jews, who nicknamed the city la madre de Israel (Israel's mother) and \"Jerusalem of the Balkans\". It also included the historically significant and ancient Greek-speaking Romaniote community. During the Ottoman era, Thessaloniki's Sephardic community of was half the population according to the Ottoman Census of 1902 and almost 40% the city's population of 157,000 about 1913; Jewish merchants were prominent in commerce until the ethnic Greek population increased after independence in 1912. By the 1680s, about 300 families of Sephardic Jews, followers of Sabbatai Zevi, had converted to Islam, becoming a sect known as the D\u00f6nmeh (convert), and migrated to Salonika, whose population was majority Jewish. They established an active community that thrived for about 250 years. Many of their descendants later became prominent in trade. Many Jewish inhabitants of Thessaloniki spoke Ladino, the Romance language of the Sephardic Jews.\n\nFrom the second half of the 19th century with the Ottoman reforms, the Jewish community had a new revival. Many French and especially Italian Jews (from Livorno and other cities), influential in introducing new methods of education and developing new schools and intellectual environment for the Jewish population, were established in Thessaloniki. Such modernists introduced also new techniques and ideas from the industrialized Western Europe and from the 1880s the city began to industrialize. The Italian Jews Allatini brothers led Jewish entrepreneurship, establishing milling and other food industries, brickmaking and processing plants for tobacco. Several traders supported the introduction of a large textile-production industry, superseding the weaving of cloth in a system of artisanal production. Notable names of the era include among others the Italo-Jewish Modiano family and the Allatini. Benrubis founded also in 1880 one of the first retail companies in the Balkans.\nAfter the Balkan Wars, Thessaloniki was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece in 1913. At first the community feared that the annexation would lead to difficulties and during the first years its political stance was, in general, anti-Venizelist and pro-royalist/conservative. The Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 during World War I burned much of the center of the city and left 50,000 Jews homeless of the total of 72,000 residents who were burned out. Having lost homes and their businesses, many Jews emigrated: to the United States, Palestine, and Paris. They could not wait for the government to create a new urban plan for rebuilding, which was eventually done.After the Greco-Turkish War in 1922 and the bilateral population exchange between Greece and Turkey, many refugees came to Greece. Nearly 100,000 ethnic Greeks resettled in Thessaloniki, reducing the proportion of Jews in the total community. After this, Jews made up about 20% of the city's population. During the interwar period, Greece granted Jewish citizens the same civil rights as other Greek citizens. In March 1926, Greece re-emphasized that all citizens of Greece enjoyed equal rights, and a considerable proportion of the city's Jews decided to stay. During the Metaxas regime the stance towards Jews became even better.\n\nWorld War II brought a disaster for the Jewish Greeks, since in 1941 the Germans occupied Greece and began actions against the Jewish population. Greeks of the Resistance helped save some of the Jewish residents. By the 1940s, the great majority of the Jewish Greek community firmly identified as both Greek and Jewish. According to Misha Glenny, such Greek Jews had largely not encountered \"anti-Semitism as in its North European form.\"In 1943 the Nazis began brutal actions against the historic Jewish population in Thessaloniki, forcing them into a ghetto near the railroad lines and beginning deportation to concentration and labor camps. They deported and exterminated approximately 96% of Thessaloniki's Jews of all ages during the Holocaust. The Thessaloniki Holocaust memorial in Eleftherias (\"Freedom\") Square was built in 1997 in memory of all the Jewish people from Thessaloniki, who died in the Holocaust. The site was chosen because it was the place where Jewish residents were rounded up before embarking to trains for concentration camps. Today, a community of around 1200 remains in the city. Communities of descendants of Thessaloniki Jews \u2013 both Sephardic and Romaniote \u2013 live in other areas, mainly the United States and Israel. Israeli singer Yehuda Poliker recorded a song about the Jewish people of Thessaloniki, called \"Wait for me, Thessaloniki\".\n\n\n=== Others ===\nSince the late 19th century, many merchants from Western Europe (mainly from France and Italy) were established in the city. They had an important role in the social and economic life of the city and introduced new industrial techniques. Their main district was what is known today as the \"Frankish district\" (near Ladadika), where the Catholic church designed by Vitaliano Poselli is also situated. Many of them left after the incorporation of the city into the Greek kingdom, others, who were of Jewish faith, were exterminated by the Nazis.\nThe Bulgarian community of the city increased during the late 19th century. The community had a Men's High School, a Girl's High School, a trade union and a gymnastics society. A large part of them were Catholics, as a result of actions by the Lazarists society, which had its base in the city.\nAnother group is the Armenian community which dates back to the Byzantine and Ottoman periods. During the 20th century, after the Armenian Genocide and the defeat of the Greek army in the Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322), many fled to Greece including Thessaloniki. There is also an Armenian cemetery and an Armenian church at the center of the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Leisure and entertainment ===\n\nThessaloniki is not only regarded as the cultural and entertainment capital of northern Greece but also the cultural capital of the country. The city's main theaters, run by the National Theatre of Northern Greece (Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0398\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf \u0392\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2) which was established in 1961, include the Theater of the Society of Macedonian Studies, where the National Theater is based, the Royal Theater (\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0398\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf)-the first base of the National Theater-, Moni Lazariston, and the Earth Theater and Forest Theater, both amphitheatrical open-air theatres overlooking the city.\n\nThe title of the European Capital of Culture in 1997 saw the birth of the city's first opera and today forms an independent section of the National Theatre of Northern Greece. The opera is based at the Thessaloniki Concert Hall, one of the largest concert halls in Greece. Recently a second building was also constructed and designed by Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. Thessaloniki is also the seat of two symphony orchestras, the Thessaloniki State Symphony Orchestra and the Symphony Orchestra of the Municipality of Thessaloniki.\nOlympion Theater, the site of the Thessaloniki International Film Festival and the Plateia Assos Odeon multiplex are the two major cinemas in downtown Thessaloniki. The city also has a number of multiplex cinemas in major shopping malls in the suburbs, most notably in Mediterranean Cosmos, the largest retail and entertainment development in the Balkans.\nThessaloniki is renowned for its major shopping streets and lively laneways. Tsimiski Street and Proxenou Koromila avenue are the city's most famous shopping streets and are among Greece's most expensive and exclusive high streets. The city is also home to one of Greece's most famous and prestigious hotels, Makedonia Palace hotel, the Hyatt Regency Casino and hotel (the biggest casino in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe) and Waterland, the largest water park in southeastern Europe.\nThe city has long been known in Greece for its vibrant city culture, including having the most cafes and bars per capita of any city in Europe; and as having some of the best nightlife and entertainment in the country, thanks to its large young population and multicultural feel. Lonely Planet listed Thessaloniki among the world's \"ultimate party cities\".\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\n\nAlthough Thessaloniki is not renowned for its parks and greenery throughout its urban area, where green spaces are few, it has several large open spaces around its waterfront, namely the central city gardens of Palios Zoologikos Kipos (which is recently being redeveloped to also include rock climbing facilities, a new skatepark and paintball range), the park of Pedion tou Areos, which also holds the city's annual floral expo; and the parks of the Nea Paralia (waterfront) that span for 3 km (2 mi) along the coast, from the White Tower to the concert hall.\nThe Nea Paralia parks are used throughout the year for a variety of events, while they open up to the Thessaloniki waterfront, which is lined up with several caf\u00e9s and bars; and during summer is full of Thessalonians enjoying their long evening walks (referred to as \"the volta\" and is embedded into the culture of the city). Having undergone an extensive revitalization, the city's waterfront today features a total of 12 thematic gardens/parks.Thessaloniki's proximity to places such as the national parks of Pieria and beaches of Chalkidiki often allow its residents to easily have access to some of the best outdoor recreation in Europe; however, the city is also right next to the Seich Sou forest national park, just 3.5 km (2 mi) away from Thessaloniki's city center; and offers residents and visitors alike, quiet viewpoints towards the city, mountain bike trails and landscaped hiking paths. The city's zoo, which is operated by the municipality of Thessaloniki, is also located nearby the national park.Other recreation spaces throughout the Thessaloniki metropolitan area include the Fragma Thermis, a landscaped parkland near Thermi and the Delta wetlands west of the city center; while urban beaches that have continuously been awarded the blue flags, are located along the 10 km (6 mi) coastline of Thessaloniki's southeastern suburbs of Thermaikos, about 20 km (12 mi) away from the city center.\n\n\n=== Museums and galleries ===\n\nBecause of the city's rich and diverse history, Thessaloniki houses many museums dealing with many different eras in history. Two of the city's most famous museums include the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki and the Museum of Byzantine Culture.\nThe Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki was established in 1962 and houses some of the most important ancient Macedonian artifacts, including an extensive collection of golden artwork from the royal palaces of Aigai and Pella. It also houses exhibits from Macedon's prehistoric past, dating from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. The Prehistoric Antiquities Museum of Thessaloniki has exhibits from those periods as well.\n\nThe Museum of Byzantine Culture is one of the city's most famous museums, showcasing the city's glorious Byzantine past. The museum was also awarded Council of Europe's museum prize in 2005. The museum of the White Tower of Thessaloniki houses a series of galleries relating to the city's past, from the creation of the White Tower until recent years.One of the most modern museums in the city is the Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum and is one of the most high-tech museums in Greece and southeastern Europe. It features the largest planetarium in Greece, a cosmotheater with the country's largest flat screen, an amphitheater, a motion simulator with 3D projection and 6-axis movement and exhibition spaces. Other industrial and technological museums in the city include the Railway Museum of Thessaloniki, which houses an original Orient Express train, the War Museum of Thessaloniki and others. The city also has a number of educational and sports museums, including the Thessaloniki Olympic Museum.\nThe Atat\u00fcrk Museum in Thessaloniki is the historic house where Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, founder of modern-day Turkey, was born. The house is now part of the Turkish consulate complex, but admission to the museum is free. The museum contains historic information about Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk and his life, especially while he was in Thessaloniki.\nOther ethnological museums of the sort include the Historical Museum of the Balkan Wars, the Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki and the Museum of the Macedonian Struggle, containing information about the freedom fighters in Macedonia and their struggle to liberate the region from the Ottoman yoke. Construction on the Holocaust Museum of Greece began in the city in 2018.The city also has a number of important art galleries. Such include the Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art, housing exhibitions from a number of well-known Greek and foreign artists. The Teloglion Foundation of Art is part of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and includes an extensive collection of works by important artists of the 19th and 20th centuries, including works by prominent Greeks and native Thessalonians. The Thessaloniki Museum of Photography also houses a number of important exhibitions, and is located within the old port of Thessaloniki.\n\n\n=== Archaeological sites ===\n\nThessaloniki is home to a number of prominent archaeological sites. Apart from its recognized UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Thessaloniki features a large two-terraced Roman forum featuring two-storey stoas, dug up by accident in the 1960s. The forum complex also boasts two Roman baths, one of which has been excavated while the other is buried underneath the city. The forum also features a small theater, which was also used for gladiatorial games. Although the initial complex was not built in Roman times, it was largely refurbished in the 2nd century. It is believed that the forum and the theater continued to be used until at least the 6th century.Another important archaeological site is the imperial palace complex which Roman emperor Galerius, located at Navarinou Square, commissioned when he made Thessaloniki the capital of his portion of the Roman Empire. The large octagonal portion of the complex, most of which survives to this day, is believed to have been an imperial throne room. Various mosaics from the palatial complex have also survived. Some historians believe that the complex must have been in use as an imperial residence until the 11th century.Not far from the palace itself is the Arch of Galerius, known colloquially as the Kamara. The arch was built to commemorate the emperor's campaigns against the Persians. The original structure featured three arches; however, only two full arches and part of the third survive to this day. Many of the arches' marble parts survive as well, although it is mostly the brick interior that can be seen today.\nOther monuments of the city's past, such as the Incantadas, a Caryatid portico from the ancient forum, have been removed or destroyed over the years. The Incantadas in particular are on display at the Louvre. Thanks to a private donation of \u20ac180,000, it was announced on 6 December 2011 that a replica of the Incantadas would be commissioned and later put on display in Thessaloniki.The construction of the Thessaloniki Metro inadvertently started the largest archaeological dig not only of the city, but of Northern Greece; the dig spans 20 km2 (7.7 sq mi) and has unearthed 300,000 individual artefacts from as early as the Roman Empire and as late as the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917. Ancient Thessaloniki's Decumanus Maximus was also found and 75 metres (246 ft) of the marble-paved and column-lined road were unearthed along with shops, other buildings, and plumbing, prompting one scholar to describe the discovery as \"the Byzantine Pompeii\". Some of the artefacts will be put on display inside the metro stations, while Venizelou will feature the world's first open archaeological site located within a metro station.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThessaloniki is home of a number of festivals and events. The Thessaloniki International Fair is the most important event to be hosted in the city annually, by means of economic development. It was first established in 1926 and takes place every year at the 180,000 m2 (1,937,503.88 sq ft) Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center. The event attracts major political attention and it is customary for the Prime Minister of Greece to outline his administration's policies for the next year, during event. Over 250,000 visitors attended the exposition in 2010.  The new Art Thessaloniki,  is starting first time 29.10. \u2013 1 November 2015 as an international contemporary art fair. \nThe Thessaloniki International Film Festival is established as one of the most important film festivals in Southern Europe, with a number of notable film makers such as Francis Ford Coppola, Faye Dunaway, Catherine Deneuve, Irene Papas and Fatih Ak\u0131n taking part, and was established in 1960. The Documentary Festival, founded in 1999, has focused on documentaries that explore global social and cultural developments, with many of the films presented being candidates for FIPRESCI and Audience Awards.The Dimitria festival, founded in 1966 and named after the city's patron saint of St. Demetrius, has focused on a wide range of events including music, theatre, dance, local happenings, and exhibitions. The \"DMC DJ Championship\" has been hosted at the International Trade Fair of Thessaloniki, has become a worldwide event for aspiring DJs and turntablists. The \"International Festival of Photography\" has taken place every February to mid-April. Exhibitions for the event are sited in museums, heritage landmarks, galleries, bookshops and caf\u00e9s. Thessaloniki also holds an annual International Book Fair.Between 1962\u20131997 and 2005\u20132008 the city also hosted the Thessaloniki Song Festival, Greece's most important music festival, at Alexandreio Melathron.In 2012 the city hosted its first pride parade, Thessaloniki Pride, which took place between 22 and 23 June. It has been held every year ever since, however in 2013 transgender people participating in the parade became victims of police brutality. The issue was soon settled by the government. The city's Greek Orthodox Church leadership has consistently rallied against the event, but mayor Boutaris sided with Thessaloniki Pride, saying also that Thessaloniki would seek to host EuroPride 2020. The event was given to Thessaloniki in September 2017, beating Bergen, Brussels, and Hamburg.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe main stadium of the city is the Kaftanzoglio Stadium (also home ground of Iraklis F.C.), while other main stadiums of the city include the football Kleanthis Vikelidis Stadium and Toumba Stadium home grounds of Aris F.C. and PAOK FC, respectively, all of whom are founding members of the Greek league.\nBeing the largest \"multi-sport\" stadium in the city, Kaftanzoglio Stadium regularly plays host to athletics events; such as the European Athletics Association event \"Olympic Meeting Thessaloniki\" every year; it has hosted the Greek national championships in 2009 and has been used for athletics at the Mediterranean Games and for the European Cup in athletics. In 2004 the stadium served as an official Athens 2004 venue, while in 2009 the city and the stadium hosted the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final.\nThessaloniki's major indoor arenas include the state-owned Alexandreio Melathron, P.A.O.K. Sports Arena and the YMCA indoor hall. Other sporting clubs in the city include Apollon FC based in Kalamaria, Agrotikos Asteras F.C. based in Evosmos and YMCA. Thessaloniki has a rich sporting history with its teams winning the first ever panhellenic football (Aris FC), basketball (Iraklis BC), and water polo (AC Aris) tournaments.\nDuring recent years, PAOK FC has emerged as the strongest football club of the city, winning also the Greek championship without a defeat (2018\u201319 season).\nThe city played a major role in the development of basketball in Greece. The local YMCA was the first to introduce the sport to the country, while Iraklis B.C. won the first ever Greek championship. From 1982 to 1993 Aris B.C. dominated the league, regularly finishing in first place. In that period Aris won a total of 9 championships, 7 cups and one European Cup Winners' Cup. The city also hosted the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in which Greece came third. In volleyball, Iraklis has emerged since 2000 as one of the most successful teams in Greece and Europe \u2013 see 2005\u201306 CEV Champions League. In October 2007, Thessaloniki also played host to the first Southeastern European Games.The city is also the finish point of the annual Alexander The Great Marathon, which starts at Pella, in recognition of its Ancient Macedonian heritage.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nThessaloniki is home to the ERT3 TV-channel and Radio Macedonia, both services of Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) operating in the city and are broadcast all over Greece.\nThe municipality of Thessaloniki also operates three radio stations, namely FM100, FM101 and FM100.6; and TV100, a television network which was also the first non-state-owned TV station in Greece and opened in 1988. Several private TV-networks also broadcast out from Thessaloniki, with Makedonia TV being the most popular.\nThe city's main newspapers and some of the most circulated in Greece, include Makedonia, which was also the first newspaper published in Thessaloniki in 1911 and Aggelioforos. A large number of radio stations also broadcast from Thessaloniki as the city is known for its music contributions.\n\n\n==== TV broadcasting ====\nERT3 (Panhellenic broadcasting)\nMakedonia TV (Panhellenic)\n4E TV (Panhellenic)\nTV 100 (Regional)\nVergina TV (Regional)\nAtlas TV (Regional)\n\n\n==== Press ====\nMakedonia (national publication)\nAggelioforos (national)\nMetrosport (sports, national)\nFair Play (sports, national)\nAris Ise (sports, weekly, national )\nForza (sports, weekly, national)\nThessaloniki (weekly, national)\nKarfitsa (weekly)\nIkonomiki (financial)\n\n\n=== Notable Thessalonians ===\n\nThroughout its history, Thessaloniki has been home to a number of well-known figures. It was also the birthplace or base of various Saints and other religious figures, such as Demetrius of Thessaloniki, Cyril and Methodius (creators of the first Slavic alphabet), Saint Mitre (Saint Demetrius, not to be confused with the previous), Gregorios Palamas, Eustathius of Thessalonica and Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople. Other Byzantine-era notables included jurist Constantine Armenopoulos, the anti-Palamian theologians Prochoros and Demetrios Kydones, such as scholars Theodorus Gaza (Thessalonicensis) and Matthaios Kamariotis.\nMany of the country's best-known musicians and movie personalities are from Thessaloniki, such as Zoe Laskari, Costas Hajihristos, Stella Haskil, Giannis Dalianidis, Maria Plyta, Harry Klynn, Antonis Remos, Paschalis Terzis, Nikos Papazoglou, Nikolas Asimos, Giorgos Hatzinasios, Alberto Eskenazi, Stavros Kouyioumtzis, Giannis Kalatzis, Natassa Theodoridou, Katia Zygouli, Kostas Voutsas, Takis Kanellopoulos, Titos Vandis, Manolis Chiotis, Dionysis Savvopoulos, Marinella, Yvonne Sanson and the classical composer Emilios Riadis. Additionally, there have been a number of politicians born in the city: Ioannis Skandalidis, Alexandros Zannas, Evangelos Venizelos, Christos Sartzetakis, fourth President of Greece, Niki Kerameus and Yiannis Boutaris. Sports personalities from the city include Georgios Roubanis, Giannis Ioannidis, Faidon Matthaiou, Alketas Panagoulias, Panagiotis Fasoulas, Eleni Daniilidou, Traianos Dellas, Giorgos Koudas, Kleanthis Vikelidis, Christos Kostis, Dimitris Salpingidis and Nikos Zisis. Benefactor Ioannis Papafis, architect Lysandros Kaftanzoglou and writers, such as Grigorios Zalykis, Manolis Anagnostakis, Kleitos Kyrou, Albertos Nar, Giorgos Ioannou, Elias Petropoulos, Kostis Moskof, Rena Molho and Dinos Christianopoulos are also from Thessaloniki.\nThe city is also the birthplace or base of a number of international personalities, which include Bulgarians (Atanas Dalchev), Jews (Moshe Levy, Maurice Abravanel, Isaak Benrubi, Isaac and Daniel Carasso, Rapha\u00ebl Salem, Baruch Uziel, Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz, Salamo Arouch), Slav Macedonians (Dimo Todorovski), Italians (Luisa Poselli, Giacomo Poselli, Vittorio Citterich), French (Louis Dumont), Spanish (Juana Mord\u00f3), Turks (Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet, Afet \u0130nan, Cahit Arf, Mehmet Cavit Bey, Sabiha Sertel, Abdul Kerim Pasha, Hasan Tahsin Uzer, Hasan Tahsin) and Armenians (Jean Tatlian).\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nBecause Thessaloniki remained under Ottoman rule for about 100 years more than southern Greece, it has retained a lot of its Eastern character, including its culinary tastes. Spices in particular play an important role in the cuisine of Thessaloniki, something which is not true to the same degree about Greece's southern regions. Thessaloniki's Ladadika borough is a particularly busy area in regards to Thessalonian cuisine, with most tavernas serving traditional meze and other such culinary delights.Bougatsa, a breakfast pastry, which can be either sweet or savory, is very popular throughout the city and has spread around other parts of Greece and the Balkans as well. Another popular snack is koulouri.\nNotable sweets of the city are Trigona, Rox\u00e1kia and Armenov\u00edl. A stereotypical Thessalonian coffee drink is Frapp\u00e9 coffee. Frapp\u00e9 was invented in the Thessaloniki International Fair in 1957 and has since spread throughout Greece and Cyprus to become a hallmark of the Greek coffee culture.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nA touristic boom took place in the 2010s, during the years of mayor Boutaris, especially from the neighboring countries, Austria, Israel and Turkey. In 2010 the sleepovers of foreign tourists in the city were around 250,000. In 2018 the sleepovers of foreign tourists was estimated to reach 3,000,000 people.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe city is viewed as a romantic one in Greece, and as such Thessaloniki is commonly featured in Greek songs. There are a number of famous songs that go by the name 'Thessaloniki' (rebetiko, la\u00efko etc.) or include the name in their title.During the 1930s and 40s the city became a center of the Rebetiko music, partly because of the Metaxas censorship, which was stricter in Athens. Vassilis Tsitsanis wrote some of his best songs in Thessaloniki.\nThe city is the birthplace of significant composers in the Greek music scene, such as Manolis Chiotis, Stavros Kouyioumtzis and Dionysis Savvopoulos. It is also notable for its rock music scene and its many rock groups; some became famous such as Xylina Spathia, Trypes or the pop rock Onirama.\nBetween 1962\u20131997 and 2005\u20132008 the city also hosted the Thessaloniki Song Festival. In the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 Greece was represented by Koza Mostra and Agathonas Iakovidis, both from Thessaloniki.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nOn May 1936, a massive strike by tobacco workers led to general anarchy in the city and Ioannis Metaxas (future dictator, then PM) ordered its repression. The events and the deaths of the protesters inspired Yiannis Ritsos to write the Epitafios.\nOn 22 May 1963, Grigoris Lambrakis, pacifist and MP, was assassinated by two far-right extremists driving a three-wheeled vehicle. The event led to political crisis. Costa Gavras directed Z (1969 film) based on it, two years after the military junta had seized power in Greece.\nNotable films set or shot in Thessaloniki among others include Mademoiselle Docteur/Salonique, nid d'espions (1937) by Georg Wilhelm Pabst, The Barefooted Battalion (1954) by Greg Tallas (Gregory Thalassinos), O Ats\u00eddas (1961) by Giannis Dalianidis,  Parenthesis (1968) by Takis Kanellopoulos,  Triumph of the Spirit (1989) by Robert M. Young, Eternity and a Day by Theo Angelopoulos (1998) and Ouzeri Tsitsanis (2015) by Manousos Manousakis.\nThe 1963 book I am David, written by Anne Holm, makes mention of the main character David making his way there after escaping from the Eastern Bloc, before continuing his ultimate journey to Denmark.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThessaloniki is a major center of education for Greece. Three of the country's largest universities are located in central Thessaloniki: Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the University of Macedonia and the International Hellenic University. Aristotle University was founded in 1926 and is currently the largest university in Greece by number of students, which number at more than 80,000 in 2010, and is a member of the Utrecht Network. For the academic year 2009\u20132010, Aristotle University was ranked as one of the 150 best universities in the world for arts and humanities and among the 250 best universities in the world overall by the Times QS World University Rankings, making it one of the top 2% of best universities worldwide. Leiden ranks Aristotle University as one of the top 100 European universities and the best university in Greece, at number 97. Since 2010, Thessaloniki is also home to the Open University of Thessaloniki, which is funded by Aristotle University, the University of Macedonia and the municipality of Thessaloniki.\nAdditionally, a TEI (Technological Educational Institute), namely the Alexander Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki, is located in the western suburb of Sindos; home also to the industrial zone of the city. Numerous public and private vocational institutes (Greek: IEK) provide professional training to young students, while a large number of private colleges offer American and UK academic curriculum, via cooperation with foreign universities. In addition to Greek students, the city hence attracts many foreign students either via the Erasmus programme for public universities, or for a complete degree in public universities or in the city's private colleges. As of 2006 the city's total student population was estimated around 200,000.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Tram ===\n\nTram was the main, oldest and most popular public urban mean of Thessalonians in the past. It functioned from 1893 to 1957, when it was disestablished by the government of Konstantinos Karamanlis. The French Compagnie de Tramways et d' \u00c9clairage \u00c9lectrique de Salonique operated it from 1912 until 1940, when the company was purchased by the Hellenic State. The operating base and tram station was in the district of D\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nBefore the economic crisis of 2009, there were various proposals for new tram lines.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nThessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (OASTH) operates buses as the only form of public transport in Thessaloniki. It was founded in 1957 and operates a fleet of 604 vehicles on 75 routes throughout the Thessaloniki metropolitan area. International and regional bus links are provided by KTEL at its Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal, located to the west of the city centre.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe creation of a metro system for Thessaloniki goes back as far as 1918, when Thomas Hayton Mawson and Ernest H\u00e9brard proposed the creation of a Thessaloniki Metropolitan Railway. In 1968 a circular metro line was proposed, and in 1987 the first serious proposal was presented and construction briefly started in 1988, before stalling and finally being abandoned due to lack of funding. Both the 1918 and 1988 proposals ran almost the identical route to the current Line 1.\nConstruction on Thessaloniki's current metro began in 2006 and is classified as a megaproject: it has a budget of \u20ac1.57 billion ($1.77 billion). Line 1 and Line 2 are currently under construction and will enter service, in phases, between 2020 and 2021. Line 1 is 9.5 kilometres (5.9 mi) long and stops at 13 stations, while Line 2 is 4.8 kilometres (3.0 mi) long and stops at a further 5 stations, while also calling at 11 of the Line 1 stations. Important archaeological discoveries have been made during construction, and some of the system's stations will house archaeological exhibitions. One stop, Venizelou, will house the only open archaeological site within a metro station anywhere in the world.Line 2 is to be expanded further, with a loop extension to the western suburbs of the city, towards Evosmos and Stavroupoli, and one overground extension towards the Airport. The western extension is more high-priority than the airport one, as the airport will be served by a 10-minute shuttle bus to the terminus of Line 2, Mikra.Once opened in 2020, it is expected that 320,000 people will use the metro every day, or 116 million people every year.\n\n\n=== Commuter/suburban rail (Proastiakos) ===\n\nCommuter rail services have recently been established between Thessaloniki and the city of Larissa (the service is known in Greek as the \"Proastiakos\", meaning \"Suburban Railway\"). The service is operated using Siemens Desiro EMU trains on a modernised electrified double track and stops at 11 refurbished stations, covering the journey in 1 hour and 33 minutes. Furthermore, an additional line has also been established, although with the use of regional trains, between Thessaloniki and the city of Edessa.\n\n\n=== Thessaloniki Airport \"Makedonia\" ===\n\nInternational and domestic air traffic to and from the city is served by Thessaloniki Airport \"Makedonia\". The short length of the airport's two runways means that it does not currently support intercontinental flights, although a major extension \u2013 lengthening one of its runways into the Thermaic Gulf \u2013 is under construction, despite considerable opposition from local environmental groups. Following the completion of the runway works, the airport will be able to serve intercontinental flights and cater for larger aircraft in the future. Construction of a second terminal began in September 2018, due to be completed in 2021.\n\n\n=== Railways and ferry connections ===\n\nBecause of the Greek economic crisis, all international train links from the city were suspended in February 2011. Until then, the city was a major railway hub for the Balkans, with direct connections to Sofia, Skopje, Belgrade, Moscow, Vienna, Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul, alongside Athens and other destinations in Greece. Daily through trains to Sofia and Belgrade were restarted in May 2014. Thessaloniki remains one of Greece's most important railway hubs and has the biggest marshalling yard in the country.\nRegional train services within Greece (operated by TrainOSE, the Hellenic Railways Organization's train operating company), link the city with other parts of the country, from its central railway passenger station, called the \"New railway station\" located at the western end of Thessaloniki's city center.\nThe Port of Thessaloniki connects the city with seasonal ferries to the Sporades and other north Aegean islands, with its passenger terminal, being one of the largest in the Aegean Sea basin; having handled around 162,731 passengers in 2007. Meanwhile, ongoing actions have been going on for more connections and the port is recently being upgraded, as Thessaloniki is also slowly turning into a major tourist port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Motorways ===\n\nThessaloniki lies on the crossroads of the A1/E75, A2/E90 and A25 motorways; which connect the city with other parts of the country, as well as the Republic of North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey.\nThe city itself is bypassed by the C-shaped Thessaloniki Inner Ring Road (Esoteriki Peripheriaki Odos,  Greek: \u0395\u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2), which all of the above motorways connect onto it. The western end of the route begins at the junction with the A1/A2 motorways in Lachanagora District. Clockwise it heads northeast around the city, passing through the northwestern suburbs, the forest of Seich Sou and through to the southeast suburb/borough of Kalamaria. The ring road ends at a large junction with the A25 motorway, which then continues south to Chalkidiki, passing through Thessaloniki's outer southeast suburbs.\nThe speed limit on this motorway is 90 kilometres per hour (56 mph), it currently has three traffic lanes for each direction and forms the city's most vital road link; handling more than 120,000 vehicles daily, instead of 30,000 as it was meant to handle when designed in 1975.\nAn outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (Greek: \u0395\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2, outer ring road) carries all traffic that completely bypasses the city. It is Part of Motorway 2.\n\n\n==== Future plans ====\nDespite the large effort that was made in 2004 to improve the motorway features of the Thessaloniki ring road, the motorway is still insufficient to tackle Thessaloniki's increasing traffic and metropolitan population. To tackle this problem, the government has introduced large scale redevelopment plans throughout 2011 with tenders expected to be announced within early 2012; that include the total restructuring of the A16 in the western side of the city, with new junctions and new emergency lanes throughout the whole length of the motorway. In the eastern side an even larger scale project has been announced, for the construction of a new elevated motorway section above the existing, which would allow faster travel for drivers heading through to the airport and Chalkidiki that do not wish to exit into the city, and will decongest the existing motorway for city commuters. The plans also include adding one more lane in each direction on the existing A16 ring road and on the A25 passing through Thessaloniki's southeast suburbs, from its junction with the A16 in Kalamaria, up to the airport exit (\u0395\u039f67); which will make it an 8 lane highway.Additional long term plans further include the extension of the planned outer ring road known as Eksoteriki Peripheriaki Odos (Greek: \u0395\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2, outer ring road) to circle around the entire Thessaloniki metropolitan area, crossing over the Thermaic Gulf from the east, to join with the A1/E75 motorway. Preliminary plans have been announced which include a 4.5 km (3 mi) bridge over the gulf, as part of the southern bypass of the city; to cater for the large number of travellers from Macedonia and the rest of Greece heading to the airport, and to the increasingly popular tourist region of Chalkidiki.\nMotorways:\nA1/E75 W (Republic of North Macedonia, Larissa, Athens)\nA2/E90 W (Kozani, Ioannina, Igoumenitsa) N (Kavala, Xanthi, Alexandroupolis, Turkey)\nA25 (\u0395\u039f12)/\u039579 \u039d (Serres, Bulgaria)\nA25 (\u0395\u039f67) S (Airport, Nea Moudania)\nNational Roads:\n\u0395\u039f2/\u039586 W (Edessa, Giannitsa)\n\u0395\u039f12/\u039579 \u039d (Serres, Drama)\n\u0395\u039f16, SW (Polygyros, Ouranopolis)\n\u0395\u039f65, \u039d (Kilkis, Doirani)\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\nConsulates\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nThessaloniki is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nBattle of Thessalonica (fourteen events at various times)\nMacedonians (Greeks)\nMount Chortiatis, above the city\nLake Koroneia, 14 km from the city\nDelta of Axios National Park, west of the city\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\nMunicipality of Thessaloniki\nThessaloniki Port Authority\n\u039f\u0391\u03a3\u0398 \u2013 Organisation of Urban Transport of Thessaloniki (Greek & English)\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nYou in Thessaloniki on YouTube: Official promotional video for Thessaloniki by the Greek National Tourism Organization\nThessaloniki The Official website of the Greek National Tourism Organisation\n\n\n=== Cultural ===\nThessaloniki Concert Hall Organisation\nThessaloniki Film Festival\nThessaloniki Info & Links\nThessaloniki360 Virtual City Guide\nThessaloniki Tsimiski.gr street\n\n\n=== Events ===\nThessaloniki 2012 (celebrations for the 100 years of the incorporation of the city to Greece)\nThessaloniki 2014 (official website of Thessaloniki European Youth Capital 2014)\n\n\n=== Local guides ===\nGreek Local Yellow Pages of Thessaloniki",

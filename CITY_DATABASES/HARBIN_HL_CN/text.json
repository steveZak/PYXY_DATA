          "Went here with my wife and 5 year old aon. I like the beluga which is quite unique and Im not there are that many park that has that. Quite amazing creatures. The park itself is relative small compared to other ocean park but it was enough for me. I also find the animals",
          "After seeing a few enclosures we felt very bad and wanted to leave the place as soon as possible. The pool of sea lions was maybe 40 cm high, 2 polar bears were kept in a 30 square meters cage and most animals looked very unhappy. I can't recommend this place to anyone who is",
          "we should not have animals being captured like that anymore luckily in europe it is not allowed anymore",
          "Honestly, I feel badly having given my money to this place. The enclosures for the mammals (wolves, polar bears, and beluga whales)are way too small, and these animals look pretty miserable. We walked thru the entire aquarium but left as soon as possible.",
          "The lasting impression i was left with was how poor the Beluga Whales were kept in such a relatively small space. Theybwere ckearly constrained by the space Also the visitors space was atrocious both in design and comfort The penguins were cute on the other hand",
          "Located opposite Sun Island. Small place but the show was impressing. Really enjoyed the 2 hour happy time. Visited on Dec 2018.",
          "If you haven't seen white dolphin, it is a place to go. The show is worth the visit. It is clean, well organized, with fair price for the ticket. Howevrr, the food indide is not too ompressive. Recommend to bring your own snacks along if you could.",
          "I've been there in December of 2018 and I was absolutely amazed by it all. It has some rare polar animals, but the most impressive part of it surely is the Beluga whale show. It was sweet and it's absolutely child appropriate.",
          "the place is small and busy,especially the show place white whale show no seats,all people stand,and very crowd.",
          "We were quite excited before we went there but disappointed soon after we saw the condition in which the animals were kept in. The tanks for the Beluga was quite small and even the cages for other animals were small and looked artificial. The polar bear and arctic wolves looked",
          "I thought it was OK. Seeing the Polar Bears and the Arctic Wolves was great. Sort of mixed feelings seeming them in small cages, the bears were just napping, but the wolves looked like they wanted to be outside where they can run and roam. However, seeing them this close was",
          "It is a small Aquarium that takes 2-3 hours to finish Ordinary seal and sea elephant show fun but not much surprise if you had been to more big Aquarium worldwide Food selling there is bad dont ever think of eating there Animals are ok with local treasure of snow wolves and snow",
          "We loved visiting the Polar land and I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. We fed fishes (carp) with a little baby bottle, we fed seals with little fish and we saw a sea lion show which although in Chinese (which we don't speak), the tricks were brilliant and the",
          "The seating area for show was a bit small. Have to go early for good location. The best is the beluga white whale show. Magnificent. The sea elephant show was pretty nice if not for the small sitting capacity. The food quality could be improved. Also magnificent coral tank",
          "It was a wonderful place to visit, more than what we expected. We enjoyed the white whale performance, it is really wonderful. Should make a trip to this Polarland while visit the Sun Island.",
          "I can\u2019t compare this place to anything I have seen before. Part water world, part zoo and part aquarium. Nice shows wit belugas, sea lions and others. The problem is, they keep the animals and belugas in really small places, especially the polar bears. Worth to visit especially",
          "We enjoyed Polarland, was fun with a number of interesting animals. The Polar Bears and Wolves are particularly active.",
          "Personal opinion is WORTH VISIT! Beautiful Beluga with amazing performance! Other the Belugas, it has different kind of sea creatures too. Must go and GO EARLY to get the best view seats.",
          "It's not a very big place, but everything inside it is actually pretty cool. They have beluga here, penguin, seal, polar bear, and a few others winter animal. And they have their own shows. You can watch them all within 2-3hours I guess. Once you get in, you actually will get",
          "This is one of the must go places. Fee is RMB160 (but it's worth it). Beluga show, Walrus & Seal show & Stingray show about 15 to 3mins apart showtime at different locations, hence you are able to enjoy all 3 shows and able to revisit the whole exhibit of marine lives and the",
          "Congested place for most of the aquatic animals, especially the mammals. Sad to see the polar bears and wolves, used to roaming 100s of kms, pace about in such small places. Utterly commercialized place with shops & unlimited feeds available which can only damage the health of",
          "Well, beside visiting the Ice and Snow \u2744\ufe0f if you are in Harbin, this place is not bad but please do not have too high expectations. Mostly spoken in Chinese. Please have your meal first before coming here as not much to eat. Ticket is around RMB 130 per person.",
          "and ice world. it's so cold so u need more cloth and many friends like to watch nice view.wellcome u come to ice world and watch difference view.",
          "Here you'll get to see a stressed and depressed polar bear pacing in his too small cell; a sea lion being fed buckets of fish while humans run around doing inane tricks which he hardly participates in; and and a couple of belugas swimming in a tank with some swimmers. The",
          "We had a great time watching the white beluga whales performance. Please do not miss the timing of this show. It is very well choreographed and the whales have very good bonding with the 2 trainers. Personally I feel that the animals are much loved by the trainers there. Even",
          "Stopped here with my tour guide. Still had Christmas theme going even though it was January 7. Lots to see and learn. I was surprised how big it was and how many different animals/fishes they had to offer. The whales were the best part, complete with the Titanic music theme.",
          "I had a great time here. The beluga show is amazing, and the polar bear also. It is a small place, as many people high light, but I loved and I recommended.",
          "The white whale show is not to be missed. Wonderful! The place is not very huge, but some interesting sea creatures and animals.",
          "This place is quite different from your usual aquarium. You can milk bottle the fishes, get the seals to do tricks and you feed them and also the most amazing beluga show. The only thing I don't like about this park is i feel some of the animals have too small an enclosure and",
          "This place is definitely a hit with kids. Some of the rare cuties to see, the Belugas, the seals close up. However, it was quite sad to see them enclosed in a small space. There were lots of other creatures to look at, Fishes, penguins, jellyfishes, stingrays, etc. Definitely",
          "Great show. HOWEVER it concerned me that the Beluga whales only had a VERY limited enclosure as with the Polar bears.",
          "We did not intend to go here but dropped in because we had some spare time. Some fantastic animals on show but enclosures were too small. The belugas were stunning and their performance was amazing.",
          "Loved the Baluga whales dancing to the Titanic theme song. The tanks were of course far too small, but that is expected from acquariums!",
          "Not worth the money, two polar bears which paced about out of boredom, a few penguins , sea lions and Beluga whales. Found the whole place looking tired, and the animal looking sad. Mostly geared up for children, couldn't get in to see the sea lion show and just missed the",
          "The polarland park is located on Sun Island near the Snow and Ice exhibition areas. But it is small compared to other larger attractions of the same kind elsewhere. The main reason for coming here is to see the Beluga show. This 10-minute show is the highlight of the experience",
          "a very small attraction, 2 storeys high and traffic is in one-way direction. takes about 1.5-3 hours to cover everything, the shows are entertaining",
          "A few good animal exhibits - polar wolf, polar bears, penguins, seals (though was a bit sad to see these magnificent animals in such cooped up homes. Polarland appears to be striving for a Disney feel with different themes as you walk through sections - to the extent of playing",
          "The Beluga show is quite awe inspiring, but a little sad to see such large animals kept in a small space. Other parts of the aquarium exhibit beautiful sea life in good condition and clean facilities.",
          "We had an absolutely fantastic day at Harbin Polarland. We got in at around 10am and left at about 12:30. I probably could have lingered even longer. I was really charmed by the presentation of the place, each of the rooms is decorated really nicely, with lots of kitsch and",
          "The beluga show is one of its kind in the world where there was amazing chemistry between the beluga and their trainers! However, the exhibits that the animals were housed in were way too small which is quite heartbreaking.",
          "The beluga (white whale, \u767d\u9cb8) show is - as most people say - outstanding. Come early before viewing time and go to the lower level below the surface! Also stay for a few minutes after the show - the divers sometimes make some extra practice rounds with the whales. The",
          "The place is little bit pricey with ticket price of 150RMB (adult). There are some fishes to be seen and penquins, polar bears etc. The big bears, for example, are living in really small gages so many of us my start to feel only sad when seeing them. The best parts are sea lion",
          "We went there August 2016. 150\u00a5 per person isn't cheap. You can see everything in 1,5-2h. They have show for sea lion 11.00,13.00 and 15.00 o'clock and beluga whale show 12.00, 14.00 and 16.00 o'clock. The shows are crowded and no chance to get a seat. Positive: My favorite",
          "This is also one of the prominent places visited by many travellers. Though it has show timings, I was not interested to spend time there, hence we just passed by this place. I think this place is good for families as kids would love to watch animals shows etc.",
          "While the property is quite large, the enclosures for the animals at the Polarland are quite small. Many in our group agreed, that by Western standards, it would be considered animal cruelty. I realize it was entertaining for the locals, however, coming from Canada, we treat our",
          "We went to the information centre for tourists, in search for directions to the Polarland, and found out that they were organising local tours intended for locals, offering slightly cheaper tickets and free transport from Central Street to and fro Polarland and the Ice and Snow",
          "This is a place you must visit when you are in Harbin. The animals are lively unlike normal hot summer zoo where everything are basically lying and sleeping. Among other normal animals like penguins that you can expect to see in a winter zoo, there were a group of white wolfs",
          "Not very easy to get a taxis. Best to pre-book a taxis beforehand. It is located at Sun island an isolated, desserted island. There are several times of White Whale performance that form a heart shape with the divers so cute. e.g 11am. You can revisit those floor that you have",
          "Having been there once,and what attracting me most is the Ocean heart, it looks really awesome as you see in the pics, and the meaning of the sight is good too.Come to see it yourself.",
          "Was not sure if I would like this place as not keen on animals in cages.While I would say the polar bears and wolves need bigger cages,the actual viewing is good and the shows with the beliga whales and the sea lions are well done.However do not go during Chinese national",
          "It's a must see. Observing tigers in their natural environment can be quite exciting. After taking a bus ride the guide take you to same cages when you can feed tigers.",
          "Polar land is just a few metres from the Snow carving exhibition so can easily combine the visits. The Beluga whales were great, penguins cute, but the polar bears did seem distressed. The Aquarium is well set up and full of signs in English, and different shows throughout the",
          "This was a good for the kids, but without kids I would'nt bother. When the beluga show is on, get to the pool 20 mins early to get a spot in the below ground room, as a lot of that show is below the water....and worth a look. You want get in there once the show starts....but",
          "There are polar bears, penguins, sea lion show (which we miss). Check the show schedule because the seating area is limited for the underwater whale show.",
          "it was located opposite to a park. it was in a huge building, with walrus and seal show. , i think the interesting part was the beluga show. and like its name after there was 2 huge polar bear in it.",
          "Nicely laid out aquarium with a good variety of animals and fish. They seemed well cared for as far as we could see. Expect very large crowds for both he seal and beluga show and if you want a seat make sure to get there well before the show is scheduled to start.",
          "They tried hard to make a nice water park. The animals shelters are super small for their size. It is very warm inside for animals whose habitat should be much colder. There is minimal seating for the shows - other than the sea lions, everything is pretty much standing room only",
          "Animals don't have enough space to move around. They make a lot of money over the animals but not providing them right living environments. It makes you sad to see them like that. Beluga whale show was the best but again it was over crowded..",
          "Nice place but could be more pleasant. The beluga show was amazing but there wasn't enough space for people to see, we had to stand the whole time with a big crowd. The sea lion show was also good, in a bigger room, but long waiting time ):",
          "This is small compared to Ocean Park but they have a huge Polar Bear. The Beluga whale show is ok. Unable to watch their Sea Lion Show",
          "similar with our local ocean park BUT it has beluga whales, seals, fox, an 2 HUGE POLAR BEARS!!! highlight was the show involving beluga whales which was pretty interesting and worthwhile to watch.",
          "How do belugas puff rings our of their nozzle? They are uber cute! small aquarium, but definitely a must see while you are in Harbin",
          "The shows and the animals are amazing, but the space is heartbreaking.... I hope they will do something about it for the animals, as much money those animals bring in...",
          "First of all, we reached Sun city quite late, almost 2 hrs before closing time and the ticket prices was relatively expensive. So we decided to pop indoors to Polarland. Ticket cost 80rmb for entrance and performance. This place is relatively lowly maintained, paint and deco",
          "It's just a fun place to visit for families. The beluga show is just amazing. Other than that it's a pretty good and fun place to visit with families. Finding snacks to your choice is a a bit of a challenge though. Pretty good for China.",
          "The Beluga Show is astonishing and really needs to be seen to be believed, however brace yourself for some tragic sights - particularly the plight of the polar bears. Just like with the Tiger Park, I left here with mixed emotions. Guilt that I'd paid to see some animals in",
          "If you don't like crowds pushing their way for the best view at others expense, stay away. If you can tolerate that, it's one of the nicer things to do in Harbin other than of course the ice festival. The shows are the main attraction as it is nicely done. Go early, get a good",
          "Overall, so so. Nothing fantastic to rave about, except for the whale performance. The place is a little less well maintain but I must give the thumbs up for the whale performance.",
          "This doesn't stack up to western aquariums, but the beluga whale show (about ten minutes) was not something I had seen before. Nor had I seen a trained walrus perform for a crowd -- was impressed with both the whales and walrus. The sea lion also performed well. Also saw",
          "This was recommended to us and was nice but it was so crowded. The shows are in Mandarin so if you don't speak the language, don't bother...unless you love seals.",
          "The main attraction of the Polar Land is the Beluga Show. It is beautifully choreographed on the song ' My heart will go on' and the two Belugas dance around like child's play.",
          "All that's been said about animal abuse and tiny cages and so forth, obviously. The place is very crowded, extremely loud with bad music and endless announcements, full of screaming kids and adults. No place to sit down but a few cold drafty plastic picnic tables at a snack bar",
          "It is funny to go, it is in front of the Snow festival, it is not so expensive and have some amusing shows, like the one of the belugas. Interesting for the children",
          "It's a cross between a zoo and an aquarium; and that makes it unique in its own way. As it's already well-described by many, I shall offer some tips if you love to see/photograph artic animals like polar bears, snow wolves, snow foxes....and the lovely and ever-active belugas -",
          "Polarland for adults is boring unless you are into sea lion and beluga performances. The marine themed park houses a small number of animals, such as snow foxes, penguins, fish, jelly fish, etc. The 2 shows mentioned above were jammed packed. The staff basically allowed everyone",
          "The animals are in really small indoor enclosures--compared to real zoological parks this is not somewhere to go if you are an animal friend. The beluga show is nice but the seal show is designed for local audiences and isn't much at all.",
          "I originally did not want to come here as it's advertised as an aquarium with a couple of polar bears. I've seen polar bears and numerous aquariums in the world and was hesitant in coming here. But after watching the Beluga whale show, I'm glad I came. They put on the best",
          "Our one day guide took us here for her commission, which left an even worse taste in the mouth. A massive polar bear was left to walk up and down (in reverse) on a narrow ledge about 3 times his length, locked out of his house with another swimming up and down in the small pool",
          "Only the 2 animal shows make the ticket price worth paying. Nothing else. So i would rate it as average.",
          "Wonderful show that amazes the audience of how they actually train these lovely animals. The show is one on a life time for me.",
          "Once you have been to Ocean Park or Sea World, its hard to compare .... The facilities are small and older but the shows are very good.",
          "Rather crowded at the performance area, then again it china.. You finish the whole place in 10mins (excluding the show).",
          "Visitors hoping to take their time to visit different parts of the aquarium will be disappointed. The aquarium, with a nice but deceptive name, is designed such that visitors walk on a planned round route so there is no turning back. Visitors will cramp to look at the limited",
          "The aquarium isn't too big so you will probably spend about two hours tops if you catch both the sea lion show and the beluga show. The animals are really intelligent! There are also gorgeous artic foxes and wolves as well as a lovely polar bear. The habitats are a little",
          "Yes the place is very small and it may never become a world class aquarium like the ones you see in the US, Australia or Singapore. But the Beluga show was truly amazing and moving. Beluga is a such beautiful animal and I have seen them in other aquariums but never watched a",
          "Yes it's small and cramped. But it is an opportunity to see creatures we haven't seen in many zoos i.e. arctic foxes, arctic wolves, belugas. We liked the easy way for visitors to feed the seals. An hour should do - avoid the show, as you're likely to be crushed by the crowds.",
          "I didn't enjoy my visit to this aquarium at all. The place is pretty small and in general not very well maintained, as has been said earlier. There are literally seven aquaria with random fishes in them and nothing is extremely impressive. I felt it was a horrid place for the",
          "This is not a big aquarium, however besides the usual aquariums\u2019 displays expected, the main attractions are the Sea Lion Show and the Underwater White Whale performances. The Sea Lion show is full of fun and will amuse the whole family including the children. The Underwater",

          "I live in Harbin and the correct name is Polar Land, not Pole Aquarium. As many others have said, it is a mix of feelings. The place is cool, despite being relatively small, but I've been there a few times, once I always take tourists to the most important spots of the city. In",
          "I went to this place knowing I would come away with mixed feelings. Typically Chinese theme parks and businesses like this offer kitsch and commercial melodrama - the 'polar aquarium' can be seen as all of this yet it is a strange experience in itself that may be of interest to",
          "It is must see in Harbin. You fill find not only different kinds of fish but also same polar animals like wolf, fox, and of course polar bears",
          "It was nice here with the penguins, polar bears, arctic fox and all, and they have walrus circus show and beluga kissing show as their highlight, but I think the aquarium is way too small. The polar bears can't do anything but swim around the small tank, as well as the beluga.",
          "A real tourist trap. The attendants pack as many spectators into each show as physically possible, without any regard for the number of seats actually available. The animals themselves are kept in much-too-small enclosures, with barely enough room inside to move around.",
          "The exhibitions here are quite well presented and the shows very entertaining, even without a word of English, (The walrus actually understood more Chinese than we did). BUT the polar bears are stressedin a small enclosure, the seals are in a small pool, and the two Beluga",
          "A quite good setup with a few large aquaria and 2 show ponds. The first show we saw was a 2 part show, firstly a walrus for a 15 minute show and then a seal. Well trained, fat and sleek so looked well fed. Like all trained animal shows throughout the world I always wonder how",
          "This place is a tourist trap. They let infinite number of tourists in to watch the beluga whale show without considering space limitations. The only show we saw were ugly humans clamoring and pushing each other to catch a glimpse of the whales. It was so crowded, safety is an",

          "this place boasts of a lot of uncommon animals- arcitic fox, polar bear, beluga and more. it has two shows. one is that of the seals which the children could enjoy and the beluga show which is really fascinating for both the adult and young ones.",

          "Plus: closest i've been to these animals. sealions in the sealion show did impress me. they were really fast and smart but do wonder how they tolerated the loud music and lights. good place to warm up in between outdoor activities. (located close to the snow",
          "The next went to the Harbin Pole Aquarium We paid 520yuan/ RMB for persons just to get in. About 100USD Many exhibits were based on trains, like models covering 35% of the total space of the exhibit. The sea lion show that we entered, and the announcers were shouting through",
          "We thought this aquarium was very well done. I have seen posting from people that are concerned about the size of some of the displays being to small. That maybe true, however, visiting it to support it will definitely provide the funds to expand. We loved the Beluga whale",
          "I'm not sure what was worse - the deranged pair of polar bears, the Arctic foxes trying to sleep under very bright lights in a tiny enclosure, or the belugas in their small aquarium. Big crowds also enhance the \"fun\" of this activity. Avoid at all costs!",
          "This Polar museum/ aquarium is small yet you can find harbin pole foxs, penguins, belugas whales. There have 2 shows running daily which is nice to watch. However, its pretty sad to see especially 2 belugas whales shared a small space. =(",
          "First aquarium where I had seen polar bears, penguins, sea lions, and also whales at the same place. The beluga whale show was very nice and was very tender and cute to see the whales face... cannot imagine such huge animal with such cute face. Must take your kids to the",
          "This is one of the better action displays for dolphins, a white whale etc that I have seen. More precise than Underwater World in Qld even with all the commentary being in Mandarin/Chinese. You did not need to understand the laungusge to watch the pleasure the mammals had in",

          "This place was super interesting, but not because it's a great aquarium. It's a very odd place that reminded me of the kinds of trippy 70's entertainment places with lots of flashy stuff and lots of commercialism. Many places in the US now do more about the natural environment &",

        "wiki": "The Harbin International Ice and Snow festival (Chinese: \u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8\u56fd\u9645\u51b0\u96ea\u8282; pinyin: H\u0101'\u011brb\u012bn Gu\u00f3j\u00ec B\u012bngxu\u011b Ji\u00e9) is an annual winter festival that takes place with a theme in Harbin, Heilongjiang, China, and now is the largest ice and snow festival in the world. At first participants in the festival were mainly Chinese, however it has since become an international festival and competition, with the 2018 festival attracting 18 million visitors and generating 28.7 billion yuan ($4.4 billion) of revenue. The festival includes the world's biggest ice sculptures.Officially, the festival starts on January 5 and lasts till late February. However, exhibits often open earlier and stay longer, weather permitting. While ice sculptures are erected throughout the city, there are two main exhibition areas:  \n\nSun Island is a recreational area on the opposite side of the Songhua River from the city, which features an expo of enormous snow sculptures.\nIce and Snow World is an area open in the afternoon and at night which features illuminated full size buildings made from blocks of 2\u20133' thick ice taken directly from the Songhua River. The park usually opens from late December to late February. In 1999, the first Ice and Snow World opened to public to celebrate the millennium. Each year the park has to be rebuild with newly designed ice buildings and snow and ice sculptures. In recent years, the park has been as large as 80 hectares.During the festival, there are ice lantern park touring activities held in many parks in the city. Winter activities during the festival include Yabuli alpine skiing, winter-swimming in the Songhua River, and the ice-lantern exhibition in Zhaolin Garden.\nHarbin is located in Northeast China and receives cold winter wind from Siberia. The average temperature in summer is 21.2 \u00b0C (70.2 \u00b0F), and \u201316.8 \u00b0C (1.8 \u00b0F) in winter. Annual lows of -25 \u00b0C (\u201313 \u00b0F) are not uncommon.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe festival originated in Harbin's traditional ice lantern show and garden party that takes place in winter, which began in 1963. It was interrupted for a number of years during the Cultural Revolution, but has since been resumed when an annual event at Zhaolin Park was announced on January 5, 1985.In 2001 the Harbin Ice Festival was merged with Heilongjiang's International Ski Festival and got its new formal name, the Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival.\nIn 2007, the festival featured a Canadian themed sculpture, in the memory of a Canadian doctor Norman Bethune. It was awarded a Guinness Record for the world's largest snow sculpture: 250 metres long, 28 feet (8.5 m) high, using over 13,000 cubic metres of snow. The composition consisted of two parts: the \"Niagara Falls\" and the \"crossing the Bering Strait\" (the latter depicting the migration of the First Nations).\nIn 2014, the festival celebrated its 30th anniversary with the theme \"50-Year Ice Snow, Charming Harbin\". Various fairs, competitions and expos were held from December 20, 2013 to February 28, 2014.In 2015, the 31st Harbin Ice Snow Festival opened on January 5 and was themed \"Ice Snow Harbin, Charming China Dreams around the world [\" with opening ceremony, firework show, ice lanterns , birthday parties, snow sculpture competitions and expos, as well as winter swimming, winter fishing, group wedding ceremony, fashion shows, concerts, ice sport games lasting from December 22, 2014 to early March 2015.At the 35th annual festival held in 2019, the festival's most popular attraction, the Harbin Ice and Snow World, took up over 600,000 square meters and included more than 100 landmarks. It was made from 110,000 cubic meters of ice and 120,000 cubic meters of snow. The festival also included ice sculptures by artists from 12 different countries competing in the annual competition.With its 36th year in 2020, this festival is presently viewed as one of the world's top winter celebrations, joining the positions of the Sapporo Snow Festival in Japan, Canada's Quebec Winter Carnival and Norway's Holmenkollen Ski Festival. In 2020 the sculptures are produced using roughly 220,000 cubic meters of ice blocks, all pulled from the close by Songhua River.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n \nSwing saws are used to carve ice into blocks, taken from the frozen surface of the Songhua River. Chisels, ice picks and various types of saws are then used by ice sculptors to carve out large scaled ice sculptures, many of them intricately designed and worked on all day and night prior to the commencement of the festival. Deionised water can also be used, producing ice blocks as transparent as glass to make clear sculptures rather than translucent ones. Multicoloured lights are also used to give colour to ice, creating variations on sculptured spectacles when lit up especially at night. Some ice sculptures made in previous years include: buildings and monuments of different architectural types and styles, figures including animals people and mythical creatures, slippery dips or ice slides and lanterns. Apart from winter recreational activities available in Harbin, these exquisitely detailed, mass-produced ice sculptures are the main draw card in attracting tourists around the world to the festival.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nOther large ice and snow festivals include Japan's Sapporo Snow Festival, Canada's Quebec City Winter Carnival, and Norway's Holmenkollen Ski Festival.\nIce palace\nSnow sculpture\nSand sculpture\nWinter carnival\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFeature on the Boston Globe Big Picture",

          "I assume it will even be better to be there when the sculptures are made. But we still found this breathtaking. This can even be more beautiful when you visit at night time. We had a wonderful tour guide who explained the history of the park to us and informed us that this is",

          "This was the 1st of several ice parks. We were warned to watch out for those who will insist on acting as our photographers and all those offering services. It was not a nice introduction, to say the least. Upon entering, because it was the first one we went, we were quite",

          "This is a great place to experience ice creations in a smaller park, compared to the Ice and Snow Festival. Zhaolin Park is remarkable, it's centrally located and well worth a visit even if you're going to the Ice and Snow Festival.",

          "They say the ice sculptures started here. It does not have the massive ice buildings of the ice and snow centre but there are many more sculptures, it's a lot less busy a lot more quite and an absolute joy to wander about at your own pace. It only opens at night, 17:00 -",
          "Lovely little park, where the Harbin Ice Festival apparently first started in 1963. It's a nice tranquil place in the middle of the city and is best visited around 30 mins before sunset, so you are there when the lights come on and don't have to stay too long for the full effect",
          "We came to Zhaolin Park the day after visiting the Ice and Snow world and didn't think we would be as pleasantly surprised as we were. The sculptures were definitely not even as close to as big as ice and snow world, but we thoroughly enjoyed them nonetheless. The sculptures",
          "This is a much smaller park than Sun Island or Ice and Snow World. Still it is worthwhile. If you go to the larger venues first then you may find it to be an anti-climatic experience. However, it is the perfect way to start my Harbin ice sculpture viewing experience before",

          "If this is your last place to visit after Sun Island and the Ice and Snow Show you could be dissapointed if comparing. inside the park you can find many ice sculptures with cool carving very detailed, it should take around 1-2 hrs max. Cost is 150 cny, for local is cheaper (50",

          "We visited this park to see the tomb/statue of General Li Zhaolin, which is located at the Northern section of the park. We visited at 7am and there were quite a few locals walking, playing table tennis,doing tai chi and other excercises. This is the oldest park in Harbin.",
          "i went there in late Feb 2016.most of the display is destroyed by the weather or humans being. Left the skeleton of the display. Desserted place very few visitors walking inside the park. Heard brick of ice are falling off from the display. Quite dangerous to visit there. No",
          "The huge advantage of this display is that it is right in the centre of the city. From where we were staying at the Holiday Inn it was barely a 10 minute drive. This is a little different from the other ice and snow displays because it also showcases some intricate ice carvings.",

          "The park is nice itself and can be take as an alternative to ice world in sun island for people who dont want to pay 240\u5143 for entering ice world. But if you already saw ice world on sun island which is just amazig this is only wasting of money. Entrance fee to Zhaolin park is",

          "Easy to walk to from the pedestrian street in town. Make sure you your first night ad it's a good test to see if you can cope with the night temperatures before you go to the big one. We loved it! It's like a mini version of the Ice and Snow Amusement World.",

          "The ice sculptures are fantastic as is the the exhibit lighting. I could not believe how they put the exhibits together with all those ice blocks for just a few winter months. Well worth the time and money, but dress VERY warm!",
          "Visited in Aug 2011 and recently from 2-5 May, I truly loved this small park. Though it's small, it features amusement thems like bumper cars, merry-go-arounds, and other rides here! Never being here in the winter but it seems like it's more beautiful in the winter when they",
          "A smaller run park near to our hotel, it's installed with smaller scale sculptures, nicer at night with lights. Entrance tickets are exp compared to the ice sculpture scale at sun city which was more worth it.",
          "It's one of the first parks where the ice sculptures are displayed.but they are very delicately made.all details are carved beautifuly.although it's much smaller than the main park but it's worth a visit",
          "We were still glad we visited. We agree it is better to see this before the ice sculptures on snow island. Very nice at night in the snow.",
          "This park visit it best in the evening. There are led lights installed into or in front of the sculptures. The park is in walking distance from the flood control memorial tower and central street. It\u2019s a pity that local tourist needs to touch the fragile sculptures which result",
          "Zhaolin Park is in the centre of Harbin, one block East of Central Street. During the Ice Festival it's home to the largest collection of ice sculptures, with relatively few larger set pieces. However it's more convenient to visit in the evening, or you could do as I did and",
          "This is where it all started I believe in 1963. Now the park hosts a Lantern Festival which for all intents is a much smaller version of the relocated International Ice festival but still worth a visit. It is less crowded and is in the centre of Harbin so easily accessed.",
          "The first time I visited Harbin I went to this park during the day. It was really good but of course was no where near as impressive as the larger parks over the river. This time I went in the evening and it was so much better. The lights were brilliant and there was a really",
          "This park as part of the ice festival is a must. We did this before the bigger park and it was brilliant! It cost 150rmb after 4pm, don't go in the daytime everything is much more beautiful in the evening with the lights. Not very busy either so plenty of opportunities to get",
          "After visiting Sun Island Snow sculptures and the later the Ice Festival at night, we visited this park the following day. Although smaller than the previous two it was fascinating to see the Ice Sculptures being made and be able to appreciate the skill of the people making",
          "If you want to see award winning ice sculptures, this is the place. During the day, these ice sculptures looked pretty plain so you really have to come here after sunset to take in the beauty of ice under color lights. This is the reason why you do not see many professional",
          "A fairly small park with beautiful ice carvings illuminated from dusk. Foreigners pay double,which is disappointing. Best go there at 4pm. It shuts between 3 and 4 and was really freezing in January.",
          "Smaller ice show than the larger Ice Show but still worth a visit. The ice sculptures are carved from blocks of ice (man made blocks -not cut from river ice). Sculptures lit up at night, some are quite simple and others are more complex. While we were there we were able to watch",
          "We had 4 days in Harbin and before we went to Snow and Ice World (the large display) we went here. Its in walking distance from the Holiday Inn and was an enjoyable treat after dinner. If you want a smaller display of ice sculptures that is near the city centre then this is for",
          "This is a much smaller park than Ice & Snow World with sculptures that are no where near the same quality. Still... it's within walking distance of Zhongyang, only takes about an hour or so to walk around & is a pretty park. Recommend going at night.",
          "As we drove to this park the taxi driver told us it was a lot, lot smaller than ice world - he was right! Despite this, it ended up being out favourite ice park visited, as it is more intimate, focuses on detailed sculpture and is an easy walk from the pedestrian street.",
          "To enjoy zhaolin park snow/ice exhibits it is advisable to do it on your first day in harbin only. It would be a climb down after the snow & ice festival!!!! Beware of agents who offer to buy your tickets - apparently for local chinese the entry ticket is less than 100 yuan",
          "Small makes it sound small, but it isn't really, it's just small compared to Ice and Snow world. Actually, this is very expansive, and has so many things to look at. Bundle up, though! All that ice makes the temperature even more freezing (if possible).",
          "In this park was the first ice festival. Nowadays it's still intresting to visit. It's smaller but with a lot more icesculptures. The 200 RMB entrance is bit steep, but if you have a chance,pay a visit",
          "This is the smaller version of the Ice and Snow park but its great! I would definitely recommend going here BEFORE you go to the big park. This one was great for younger kids as they have lots of interactive ice sculptures and slides. We had a blast sliding on the ice and",
          "We went in the afternoon so no light show. Some of the ice sculptures are melting but still very impressed. We spent 2 hours strolling the park. There is display of winning ice sculptures worth seeing and better than those at the ice and snow festival. Entrance is RMB100 pp and",
          "This place has displays very similar to the snow & ice world, and can probably be given a miss if plan on visiting the other one later on. Otherwise, the ice sculptures are ver lifelike and skillfully carved, and one can eadily spend a couple of hours wsndering around and",
          "This is the smaller version of the Snow and Ice Festival. The entrance is in the South and the ticket booth is right near the entrance. Surprisingly, there was no English written anywhere on the ticket booth. Admission was 200RMB. My proposal is to do the Snow Expo in Sun",
          "Nice addition to the main attractions of the Ice Festival & the Snow Festival, if you are going to Harbin in the future & want advice on what order to do things in, I would do this in the early evening of your first day if you arrive in the afternoon, after visiting the park",
          "This park was more about the ice sculptures than the building of Ice that were at Ice and Snow World. Definitely worth the trip. We were there early in the day, and there is just a different quality to seeing the ice park in the sun versus at night",
          "This park is where it all started 50 years ago with what is now known as the Ice Lantern Festival. A much smaller scale but very pleasant - no crowds and easy to navigate. 200rmb to get in so not cheap and if you intend doing both this and the Ice an Snow Festival then do this",
          "This place was AWESOME!! I don't think it would have the same impact during the day but the lights at night really make the experience! My daughter loved the interactive displays like the piano and the slide. The downside is that it closes at 9pm so if you go there after",
          "Have wanted to come to Harbin for the Ice Festival for many years! Finally made it and first night here we went to the Ice Sculpture at Zhaolin Park. Still not finished but about 75% of the sculptures are done. Quite expensive entry at 200RMB p/p, but if you have come for the",
          "Was very quiet here which was nice, we didn't have to queue for the slide at all. It's definitely the little brother of Snow World as it's quite small and less grande. It's also little expensive for what it is (200RMB). Overall am glad we went but it didn't impress all that much.",
          "The place is really alive with all the music (from loud speaker tough - not live one), and there are a lot international shop as well, but most interesting part, there are a lot of russian building there, and if you come in winter, you can see a lot of ice sculpture as well",
          "This is where the Ice festival all started and some people miss this park in the middle of the city but try going early in the morning when there are no crowds and enjoy the serenity as well as the sculptures",
          "Everyone heads for the big parks for the ice festival, but in Zhaolin Park, there is some of the most beautiful and detailed ice carvings in Harbin. A short stroll from the main 'walking street' of Harbin",
          "Our hotel was almost discouraging us to go here. I really don't know why. They kept saying it wasn't as good as the ice festival, and although it wasn't as big and crowded and massive to scale, it was still very pretty and we had the place to ourselves. The park is very",

          "This park is in the city centre, a walk from our hotel. It was RMB200 to get in, ridiculously expensive when you only pay RMB300 for the bigger and better Ice and Snow World. It is very pretty and the sculptures and lanterns are beautiful but it's not worth the money.",

          "While the park might be nice during the year, if you are planning on taking a look at the ice lanterns, do not pay full price: 200 kuai for it wouldn't be worth it (save your money for the big festival in the north bank of the river), but for 80 yuan is ok. It is a nice park,",

          "It was unique view of a Catholic church in China. Unfortunately we could not go inside due to maintenance. Even the view from outside was breathe taking. A surprise to see such a building in China.",
          "Expected more from this place. It was good but not spectacular. Feel like the shopping mall around this lovely church gets more attention. But anyway still worth to visit! And is a must while in Harbin.",
          "Stunning architecture, but it was closed during my visit on 2 January 2020. Walkable distance to the Zhongyang Pedestrian Street.",
          "...pretty definitively it seemed: there was police-like tape around it! However, it\u2019s still worth seeing because it has an absolutely stunning exterior and looks wonderfully when lit up.",
          "I visited this cathedral in the evening. It was beautiful with the lighting, providing an atmosphere of serenity & romance. As a major attraction, expect the surrounding square to be lively. If your time permits, suggest you visit during the day as well as evening to fully",
          "It was under renovation during our visit but the exterior still shows some artworks and history. Beautiful at night.",
          "Russian style cathedral . its beautiful , we reached late so didnt go inside but its looks awesome esp at night",
          "Different from the many European style Churches/Cathedral that I've visited. The exterior design and color of this Cathedral has shown Russia's influence on the area's culture and history. However, the building is still under renovation and no entry is allowed. Suggest to take a",
          "St. Sophia is a very lovely Russian-style church, and quite striking with the green domes. However, other than a great stop for photos, when I visited the place was walled-off and not open for visitors. Quite disappointing. So walk by, snap a picture, and keep walking!",
          "Very nice, the chruch adn surrounding reflect the glory of the chruch. Realy classic. Many dove flying around, seems they are familiar with people around them,",
          "Unfortunately the building was undergoing renovations when we came but we could view this beautiful structure from the outside. The building is quite large and it shows the Russian style building back in the day.",
          "Located near to the Zhongyang street. Within walking distance from our hostel. Very special outlook decoration. Visited on Dec 2018.",
          "Saint Sophia church is a standard small Russian church set in an open square. Nothing special about this really...just an average church.",
          "Unfortunately it was closed for renovations, but you can certainly walk around it and take photos. Not much else to say except that I hope it opens up soon.",
          "Under renovation but still good to look from the outside. It is not far from the central street and a good start for both attractions.",
          "Unfortunately church is under renovation, allegedly damaged by large number of pigeons living on and in the building. But just being on the plaza and viewing the church from outside is amazing enough. Architecture beautifully stands out in the middle of typical Chinese city.",

          "Amazing sight! To find it, just show a photo to any taxi driver - everyone knows where it is. Taxis are so cheap and it\u2019s a sight worth seeing....",

          "Heard about it for a long time and when I finally went to Harbin the Cathedral was closed for renovation and won't reopen until sometime next year. However, the fence around it was posted with giant pictures of the church and that gave people a sense of the former glory of the",
          "The church is unfortunately right now under renovation and most of the building is covered, not much to see. The renovation is past due, so I\u2019m happy they finally get into it and next time I get to Harbin would be nice to see the finished done.",
          "Perhaps no one really looked after the interior of this place after the Russian occupation ended. It's lovely from the outside, and quite empty - almost rundown, inside. The peeled paints and the empty hall is like telling the story, of the era of revolutions.",

          "This is very picturesque. However, early July 2018, outside is covered by scaffolding, so temporarily not picturesque. The square is still alive with people for people watching. Was here in January 2018, no scaffolding, but it was obviously winter and VERY COLD. In July,",
          "Architecturally attractive from.the inside but a disappointment after you pay a fee to enter. The pews are removed and what you see are mostly pictures of old Harbin. The dome and aged walls gives you an idea of how old the church is but if you want a peaceful ambiance for",
          "the cathedral is in a state of decay. Scaffolding was being erected around the outside during our visit, so hopefully they are carrying out renovations. The inside is an exhibition of photographs of Harbin. There is a nice painting of the last supper. wall frescos have badly",

          "It was to observe an actual religious structure that was used by the Russians in the past. The exterior is beautiful. The interior is not very appealing. It needs to be enhanced.",
          "Interesting museum of old Harbin. Sad to say we don't read Mandarin so were unable to get as much out of it as we might. If they want to attract more international tourist more English translations would help",
          "One of those places you ask yourself after travelling a long way to see it - \"Is that it?\" Walk around it for 5 minutes then go somewhere else.",
          "The cathedral is small but beautiful, especially at golden hour. The inside has been converted to a museum, but still has the original chandeliers. There was a photographic history of Harbin on display while we were there, which was interesting was I wish you could see the",
          "Although today it\u2019s not a church anymore, is still a majestic building with magnificent architecture. Clearly influenced by the orthodox Russian church on the region. It hosts The arts and culture academy of Harbin and art exhibitions are held there. In the surrounding many",

          "The building itself looks really good, you can really see the Russian influence. The inside is disappointing though, as it has been turned into a museum (it really is more a collection of photos). No text is in English so except for looking at the ceiling, it is not worth paying",

          "The church is beautiful outside but gutted inside. On the plus side the inside is a photography exhibition of pictures of Haerbin going back to the 1880s all the way to now. Really interesting and definitely worth a stop for more than just a few tourist snapshots",
          "ticket cost RMB15 per adult. spend 45min - 1hr here. take some pictures, enjoy the warmth and leave.",
          "Place is not big but with its rich culture n links to the Russian past, it's definitely worth a visit",
          "Very beautiful outside. Inside there are just photos of the time Harbin was full of russian people. Nothing religious inside.",
          "This must have been in magnificent church in its hay-day. It is now just a over-priced museum of old photos of Harbin. I got in for half price, seniors discount. Save your money and just photo/selfie from the outside. Go early without all the tourists in front of the Church.",
          "Would recommend a visit if you have extra time in Harbin but not a must see. The Orthodox Russian architecture is a lovely contrast to the buildings around it, only about half an hour to an hour here (max).",
          "The cathedral really is a beautiful place although completely over crowded on the Sunday morning we visited - was hard to get a serene sense of its beauty (most likely due to the volume of people in town for the Snow Festival).",
          "Outside the cathedral is beautiful. The square around it is great for pictures but once inside it's a disappointment. They have lots and lots of pictures depicting Harbin thru the years. I know it's China but it would have been nice if they had given a short explanation of",
          "It\u2019s no longer a church for many decades, but now a museum. There are hundreds of pictures of old Harbin, as an exhibition (text mostly in Chinese), and hundreds of people inside and outside. Only one religious painting on the front wall, above the altar, with the Last Supper.",
          "Inside of this church is not well kept, and felt cramped as there're lots of visitors and the interior that's open to the public is quite small. There's really not much to see inside, with pictures of the history of this church and Harbin on the walls.",
          "Visited here and its a nice place. I guess this is the Notre Dame version of Harbin. Large crowd and you dont need to spend too much time here. Decent place to see and spend 1-2 hour",
          "The cathedral offers classic orthodox architecture in an open square the fills tourists with food carts at night. The building\u2019s interior is in poor repair. Only the ground floor is open to the public. It contains an interesting photo exhibition but sadly there\u2019s not a lot of",
          "Both the architecture of the cathedral and the historical photos inside are fascinating. Outside there is a special spot on the right for feeding the pigeons -- fun to watch the kids there.",
          "This doesn't look much during the day - bit dirty and drab - but at night it comes alive as it is beautifully lit. During the day worth going into the museum to view the history of Harbin - a photographic display - which we found if you went in the main door and moved left -",
          "If you've seen the cathedrals in Europe, this church is nothing. It's quite nice to look at from the outside, but the inside of the church hasn't been preserved as a church at all, no pews or anything. Only one painting of the last supper, and quite poorly preserved. The inside",
          "There is a large collection of photos which tells about the history of the place and of Harbin The design of the church is heavily influenced by the Russian but the structure is not well kept. The museam speak volume of the area rather than of the church so if one is keen to",
          "I was expecting a grand cathedral. Instead I found what was more of a museum than anything once inside. And not much English to explain the photos. I enjoyed the outside more than the inside which says something. Not an active place to say a prayer either. Disappointed.",
          "If you are in Harbin for the Festival, you must definitively go see the Cathedral. It is quite cheap to enter the cathedral, but I would not advise to do it as the inside has sadly become a not really interesting museum. The outside however is breathtaking, and it is even more",
          "If you live history and architecture, this is the place to visit. Beautiful, well preserved church. Chandeliers and paintings on the inside as well as a walk through the historical record of this church.",
          "The cathedral represents the history of Harbin. Worthwhile visiting especially being my first time to visit the city. The multi cultural heritage adds charm to the city which makes it stands out from other cities of China",
          "It was really odd to see such a beautiful cathedral building standing in the midst of all these other industrial sites. It was definitely nothing like the ones you see in Rome or someplace else. The night we went, there was an event happening, so we couldn\u2019t go inside but we",
          "It is quite small, when you hear word \"cathedral\" expect something grand. It is a beautiful church, unusual style for China. Didn't go inside, as it looked very packed. 15kuai to go inside.",
          "Went there on daytime and nighttime. Beautiful sight and rich in architecture. Not a costly venture as the cathedral is to be appreciated from the outside.",
          "This old church remains only the outside parts as the inside has been ruined by the war. From the inside we can see the photos of what happen during the time. However the facade of the church \u26ea including the door are remains in good condition. This is one of the landmark of",
          "The church architecture is beautiful however inside is too crowded and not much to see even for 15 rmb fare.",
          "Great architecture. Close to shops, prolly just go to take few pictures and go to other sites. It is in sofia square and close to central street.",
          "More the size of a small church, we enjoyed walking around the outside of this unique looking cathedral. The architecture is very pretty with the domes. The small pigeon collective also took flight and looped around the building a few times which was a cool site. We paid to go",
          "I was on a tour guide and was allowed only 10 minutes to take photos as the tour bus had nowhere to park. Best to visit in the evening where the Cathedral's exterior light brings out the red/orange facade of the building and yet have enough ambient light to capture the image",
          "It's a gorgeous building. The grandeur is all around. It is also THE place for wedding photos. The visit inside is quite fascinating. Great history of the town, as well as a magnificent interior, though not in the condition of its glory days. It's a must if you visit",
          "Not bad, beautiful building from outside. Great place to visit and close proximity to other attractions, Starlin park, Zhong yang street etc. Good for a short visit to warm up, some interesting photos on the wall, but with kids you probably will be hard pressed to keep their",
          "Located in the heart of harbin city, Surrounded by many local and russian gift shops and shopping malls nearby.",
          "The inside is awesomely unique and untouched. The cathedral is full of photos of the history of Harbin, an awesome display and well worth a visit.",
          "Saint Sophia Cathedral still retain its good architecture and rustic looks with the red tiles structure. Try to visit in the morning so you can see the structure with the sun light on it to give it more texture on surface. Inside is not so interesting because it was not well",
          "Enjoy one of the most beautiful cathedral in Harbin. For best picture, I recommend to take a tripod and DSLR if possible to take a long exposure shot. (It really pays off than just to click with your best mobile phone camera during low lights when the place is most beautiful).",
          "Sometimes called Harbin's Hagia Sophia, this former Russian Orthodox church is now an architectural museum. It's a popular place for people to come and take photos (especially selfies). When I was there, I saw a couple having wedding photos done with the building as a backdrop.",
          "Despite having lived in Harbin for a year, I had only visited St Sophia's once and never inside so I took my three teenagers and 7 year old. Had a coffee on the other side of the square which was around 35 rmb but was not great. The kids had ice creams which cost about the same",
          "The Saint Sophia Cathedral is probably the most famous Russian cathedral in China. The outside is well restored and very impressive. The Entry Fee for visiting the inside of the cathedral is RMB 15 per adult, but the inside left me somewhat disappointed. All the internal",
          "No longer a functional religious building, this cathedral is now a nice museum for its special history, architecture, the excellent exhibit of old photos on how the city grew to be and how Russians lived here. It is beautiful and educational!",
          "A beautiful small cathedral as I start a review of place which I wanted to see and then wanted to write about. It's must watch in Harbin just because this is the only structure which gave some sense of normality to a city stuffed with sky scrapers. It's a russian architecture",
          "One of the most beautiful Orthodox churches in East Asia \u060c Harbin is a beautiful city and maybe in afew years it will become one of the most beautiful city in east asia",
          "A beautiful Cathedral believed to be a Russian Orthodox Church. Take close look at the fine details on the outside of the church and you realize the effort and careful work put into building it. Too bad it is no longer a church as such, but a museum, open from 8:30 am till 5 pm,",
          "Beautifully preserve church on the outside and Museum in the inside. However it a little bit small. It would be great if there some english explanation on the wall next to all the historical picture",
          "I found this Cathedral to be really interesting due to the overt religious implications outside and lack of religion inside. All the walls looked like they had religious art removed and there was no altar or other religious furniture inside. The Cathedral has been changed into",
          "We visited this Russian Church during our trip to North East China. .It was dark and cold when we were there.This neo Byzantine orthodox church was built during the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway in 1903. The St Sophia Cathedral was a beacon church for the Czar's",
          "We were very impressed with its exterior when we saw it on 10 May. We stayed at ibis, Zhaolin Street (\u5146\u9e9f\u8857 Zhaolin Jie), so it was a 5-min walk to St Sophia's Square and St Sophia's Cathedral. We only saw the interior on 12 May. Admission fee was not expensive but we can't",
          "A cathedral that was never consecrated, it was allowed to go into disrepair until recently. When I went there was a display of photographs showing how Harbin has developed. The decayed interior was beautiful and only added to the effect.",
          "Quite interesting when we visited cathedrals in the European countries they are usually well refurnished and carrying out religious functions as what they should be. This Cathedral is aged and the past glory was not restored. Contrary to that it has on show many photos of",
          "It was Cathedral but nowadays turn into museum where the Harbin history shows in here.It feels like in Rusia when you're in here not like in China.I think it's a must visit when you're in Harbin.",
          "Its an overrated place, i really don't think it should be in must visit place list in Harbin. Its just a building, not even church. Inside this building there are Historical photos of Harbin for which explanation is only in Chinese so if you can't read Chinese don't waste",
          "Imagine a Chinese city. Where people only speak Chinese. No english at all. But there is another language used in the city. That's russian! And the stores sell russian products, and there is russian arquitecture around. Surreal. This church, although is only a shell, is the",
          "The Cathedral is a most do, although the inside was destroyed in the past, still you should go in, some pictures of the history of Harbin can be seen. The architecture is great and you can use your imagination how it most of looked.",
          "The building now houses a picture trail of the development of Harbin. It costs 15rmb, ( there are concessions), which are purchased from the booth just outside. The pictures are interesting but would benefit from an English language narrative. That said you can follow the basic",
          "Really don't think it's worth going to see. Wasn't impressed with this at all. Not worth paying to come from other side of town to see this.Was really disappointed. It's a church, you look at it, take a photo , and that's it. Appreciate its historical heritage.",
          "This church appears older than its one hundred years. Inside it has been left in its slightly run down state. It has a large collection of history photos and other paraphernalia. Some is in English. The structure is externally in excellent condition.",
          "Such beautiful architecture. It would be good to have some English subtitles in the museum section as we missed a lot of the history, however still worth a visit.",
          "Worth seeing. There is a museum inside, not sure this is worth it. Would recommend just seeing the cathedral on the outside.",
          "We\u2019ve been to Saint Sophia Cathedral before and it has always been a pleasant experience. This time we were visiting family in Harbin and decided to visit Saint Sophia again. We made this decision as were headed to Center Street. We did and it was a mistake. It was a mistake",
          "I love the brick construction of this cathedral, so gorgeous. The inside still has some of the wall painting and decoration, but the plaster is chipped and gone in some places, exposing brick and board. Which, to me, makes it dilapidatedly beautiful. It would, of course, be",
          "This is an included tour destination, and the outside of the building is worth seeing, but the inside is a photographic museum. There is nothing left of the religious interior.",
          "Just visited the beautiful St Sophia Cathedral in the heart of Harbin in icy January. The historical architecture is magnificent. Walk around it to appreciate the details, and take some selfie photos as this is the most highly rated tourist attraction of the city. The church",
          "Really beautiful cathedral. A must if you're in town. They don't allow people inside though. We were looking forward to see the architecture inside",
          "We went to visit the St Sophia Cathedral, which I had read had been turned into an \"architectural\" museum. The 15RMB price tag for entrance was affordable so we investigated. Inside is housed a collection of photos showing the history of Harbin. They were interesting and",
          "We visited in the morning. Lovely to walk around the outside and admire architecture I don't think I've seen. It is a museum now and serves no religious purpose. When we visited there was a photography exhibition that showed the Russian lifestyle in the early 1900s. There are",
          "The cathedral is a beautiful building and it still has painted walls and ceilings inside, but it's no longer used as a church. It houses the Arts Centre and has displays of old photographs for visitors to see at a cost of 15RMB. It's an interesting look back at the history of",
          "Beautiful architecture, historical site nice for a photo shoot. Russian in China...interesting except the local speaks mandarin..lol",
          "Nice and amazing structure from outside, worth of pics at day and night. But, inside there is just a bunch of images with some history but really nothing exciting, even the building itself is in bad shape and nothing worth to take a picture from. I would sugest skip entering",

        "wiki": "Harbin (Manchu: \u1865\u1820\u182f\u182a\u1873\u1828 (); Chinese: \u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8 H\u0101'\u011brb\u012bn) is a sub-provincial city and the provincial capital of Heilongjiang province, People's Republic of China, as well as the second largest city by urban population and largest city by metropolitan population (urban and rural together) in Northeast China.  Harbin has direct jurisdiction over nine metropolitan districts, two county-level cities and seven counties, and is the eighth most populous Chinese city according to the 2010 census, the built-up area (which consists of all districts except Shuangcheng and Acheng) had 5,282,093 inhabitants, while the total metropolitan population was up to 10,635,971.  Harbin serves as a key political, economic, scientific, cultural and communications hub in Northeast China, as well as an important industrial base of the nation.Harbin, whose name was originally a Manchu word meaning \"a place for drying fishing nets\", grew from a small rural settlement on the Songhua River to become one of the largest cities in Northeast China. Founded in 1898 with the coming of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the city first prospered as a region inhabited by an overwhelming majority of immigrants from the Russian Empire.With its often harsh winters, Harbin is heralded as the Ice City (\u51b0\u57ce) for its well-known winter tourism and recreations. Harbin is notable for its ice sculpture festival in the winter. Besides being well known for its historical Russian legacy, the city serves as an important gateway in Sino-Russian trade today. In the 1920s, the city was considered China's fashion capital since new designs from Paris and Moscow reached here first before arriving in Shanghai. The city was voted \"China Top Tourist City\" by the China National Tourism Administration in 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nHuman settlement in the Harbin area dates from at least 2200 BC during the late Stone Age. Wanyan Aguda, the founder and first emperor (reigned 1115-1123) of the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), was born in the Jurchen Wanyan tribes who resided near the Ashi River in this region.  In AD 1115 Aguda established Jin's capital Shangjing (Upper Capital) Huining Prefecture in today's Acheng District of Harbin. After Aguda's death, the new emperor Wanyan Sheng ordered the construction of a new city on a uniform plan. The planning and construction emulated major Chinese cities, in particular Bianjing (Kaifeng), although the Jin capital was smaller than its Northern Song prototype. Huining Prefecture served as the first superior capital of the Jin empire until Wanyan Liang (the fourth emperor of Jin Dynasty) moved the capital to Yanjing (now Beijing) in 1153. Liang even went so far as to destroy all palaces in his former capital in 1157. Wanyan Liang's successor Wanyan Yong (Emperor Shizong) restored the city and established it as a secondary capital in 1173. Ruins of the Shangjing Huining Prefecture were discovered and excavated about 2 km (1.2 mi)from present-day Acheng's central urban area. The site of the old Jin capital ruins is a national historic reserve, and includes the Jin Dynasty History Museum. The museum, open to the public, was renovated in late 2005. Mounted statues of Aguda and of his chief commander Wanyan Zonghan (also Nianhan) stand in the grounds of the museum.\nMany of the artifacts found there are on display in nearby Harbin.\nAfter the Mongol conquest of the Jin Empire (1211\u20131234), Huining Prefecture was abandoned. In the 17th century, the Manchus used building materials from Huining Prefecture to construct their new stronghold in Alchuka. The region of Harbin remained largely rural until the 1800s, with over ten villages and about 30,000 people in the city's present-day urban districts by the end of the 19th century.\n\n\n=== International city ===\n\nA small village in 1898 grew into the modern city of Harbin. Polish engineer Adam Szyd\u0142owski drew plans for the city following the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which the Russian Empire had financed. The Russians selected Harbin as the base of their administration over this railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. The railways were largely constructed by Russian engineers and indentured workers. The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the Trans-Siberian Railway: substantially reducing the distance from Chita to Vladivostok and also linking the new port city of Dalny (Dalian) and the Russian Naval Base Port Arthur (L\u00fcshun). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a \"boomtown\", growing into a city within five years. The majority of settlers in Harbin came from southern Ukraine (Russian Empire). In addition to Ukrainians there were many Russians, Jews, Poles, Georgians, and Tatars.The city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar Simon Karlinsky, who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian Jewish family, wrote that in Harbin \"the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned\u2014well before the October Revolution\u2014by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners\", giving the city a very European appearance. Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms which soon turned Manchuria into the \"breadbasket of China\" while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize.  Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria.  A sign of Harbin's wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play K zvezdam by Leonid Andreyev had its premiere there.   \n\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies. Churches were rebuilt for Russian Orthodox, Lutheran/German Protestant, and Polish Catholic Christians. Chinese capitalists also established businesses, especially in brewing, food and textiles. Harbin became the economic hub of northeastern China and an international metropolis.The rapid growth of the city challenged the public healthcare system. The worst-ever recorded outbreak of pneumonic plague was spread to Harbin through the Trans-Manchurian railway from the border trade port of Manzhouli. The plague lasted from late autumn of 1910 to spring 1911 and killed 1,500 Harbin residents (mostly ethnic Chinese), or about five percent of its population at the time. This turned out to be the beginning of the large so-called Manchurian plague pandemic which ultimately claimed 60,000 victims. In the winter of 1910, Dr. Wu Lien-teh (later the founder of Harbin Medical University) was given instructions from the Foreign Office, Peking, to travel to Harbin to investigate the plague. Dr. Wu asked for imperial sanction to cremate plague victims, as cremation of these infected victims turned out to be the turning point of the epidemic. The suppression of this plague pandemic changed medical progress in China. Bronze statues of Dr. Wu Lien-teh are built in Harbin Medical University to remember his contributions in promoting public health, preventive medicine and medical education.The first generation of Harbin Russians were mostly the builders and employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They moved to Harbin in order to work on the railroad. At the time Harbin was not an established city. The city was almost built from scratch by the builders and early settlers. Houses were constructed, furniture and personal items were brought in from Russia. After the Manchurian plague epidemic, Harbin's population continued to increase sharply, especially inside the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. In 1913 the Chinese Eastern Railway census showed its ethnic composition as: Russians \u2013 34313, Chinese (that is, including Hans, Manchus etc.) \u2013 23537, Jews \u2013 5032, Poles \u2013 2556, Japanese \u2013 696, Germans \u2013 564, Tatars \u2013 234, Latvians \u2013 218, Georgians \u2013 183, Estonians \u2013 172, Lithuanians \u2013 142, Armenians \u2013 124; there were also Karaims, Ukrainians, Bashkirs, and some Western Europeans. In total, 68549 citizens of 53 nationalities, speaking 45 languages. Research shows that only 11.5 percent of all residents were born in Harbin. By 1917, Harbin's population exceeded 100,000, with over 40,000 of them were ethnic Russians.\n\nAfter Russia's Great October Socialist Revolution in November 1917, more than 100,000 defeated Russian White Guards and refugees retreated to Harbin, which became a major center of White Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s and the largest Russian enclave outside the Soviet Union. Karlinsky noted that a major difference with the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who arrived in Harbin was: \"Unlike the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who went to Paris or Prague or even to Shanghai, the new residents of Harbin were not a minority surrounded by a foreign population. They found themselves instead in an almost totally Russian city, populated mainly by people with roots in the south of European Russia.\" The city had a Russian school system, as well as publishers of Russian-language newspapers and journals. Russian Harbintsy community numbered around 120,000 at its peak in the early 1920s. Many of Harbin's Russians were wealthy, which sometime confused foreign visitors who expected them to be poor, with for instance the American writer Harry A. Franck in his 1923 book Wanderings in North China writing the Russian \"ladies as well gowned as at the Paris races [who] strolled with men faultlessly garbed by European standards\", leading him to wonder how they had achieved this \"deceptive appearance\".The Harbin Institute of Technology was established in 1920 as the Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry to educate railway engineers via a Russian method of instruction. Students could select from two majors at the time: Railway Construction or Electric Mechanic Engineering. On 2 April 1922, the school was renamed the Sino-Russian Industrial University. The original two majors eventually developed into two major departments: the Railway Construction Department and the Electric Engineering Department.  Between 1925 and 1928 the University's Rector was  Leonid Aleksandrovich Ustrugov, the Russian Deputy Minister of Railways under Nicholas II before the Russian Revolution, Minister of Railways under Admiral Kolchak's government, and a key figure in the development of the Chinese Eastern Railway.\nThe Russian community in Harbin made it their mission to preserve the pre-revolutionary culture of Russia. The city had numerous Russian language newspapers, journals, libraries, theaters and two opera companies. One of the famous Russian poets in Harbin was Valery Pereleshin, who started publishing his intensely homoerotic poetry in 1937, and was also one of the few Russian writers in Harbin who learned Mandarin. The subject of Pereleshin's poetry caused problems with the Russian Fascist Party, and led Pereelshin leaving Harbin for Shanghai, and ultimately to the United States. Not all of the Russian newspapers were of high quality, with Karlinsky calling Nash put', the newspaper of the Russian Fascist Party \"the lowest example of gutter journalism that Harbin had ever seen\". Nikolai Baikov, a Russian writer in Harbin was known for his novels of exile life in that city together with his accounts of his travels across Manchuria and the folklore of its Manchu and Chinese population. Boris Yulsky, a young Russian writer who published his short stories in the newspaper Rubezh was considered to be a promising writer whose career was cut short when he gave up literature for activism in the Russian Fascist Party and cocaine addiction. Moya-tvoya (mine \u2013 yours), a pidgin language that was a combination of Russian and Mandarin Chinese that had developed in the 19th century when Chinese went to work in Siberia, was considered essential by the Chinese business people of Harbin. \nIn the early 1920s, according to Chinese scholars' recent studies, over 20,000 Jews lived in Harbin. After 1919, Dr. Abraham Kaufman played a leading role in Harbin's large Russian Jewish community. The Republic of China discontinued diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1920, so many Russians found themselves stateless. When the Chinese Eastern Railway and government in Beijing announced in 1924 that they agreed the railroad would only employ Russian or Chinese nationals, the emigres were forced to announce their ethnic and political allegiance. Most accepted Soviet citizenship.\nThe Chinese warlord Zhang Xueliang, the \"Young Marshal\" seized the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929. Soviet military force quickly put an end to the crisis and forced the Nationalist Chinese to accept restoration of joint Soviet-Chinese administration of the railway.\n\n\n=== Japanese invasion period ===\n\nJapan invaded Manchuria outright after the Mukden Incident in September 1931. After the Japanese captured Qiqihar in the Jiangqiao Campaign, the Japanese 4th Mixed Brigade moved toward Harbin, closing in from the west and south. Bombing and strafing by Japanese aircraft forced the Chinese army to retreat from Harbin. Within a few hours the Japanese occupation of Harbin was complete.With the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, the so-called \"pacification of Manchukuo\" began, as volunteer armies continued to fight the Japanese. Harbin became a major operations base for the infamous medical experimenters of Unit 731, who killed people of all ages and ethnicities. All these units were known collectively as the Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department of the Kwantung Army. The main facility of the Unit 731 was built in 1935 at Pingfang District, approximately 24 km (15 mi) south of Harbin urban area at that time. Between 3,000 and 12,000 citizens including men, women, and children\u2014from which around 600 every year were provided by the Kempeitai\u2014died during the human experimentation conducted by Unit 731 at the camp based in Pingfang alone, which does not include victims from other medical experimentation sites. Almost 70 percent of the victims who died in the Pingfang camp were Chinese, including both civilian and military. Close to 30 percent of the victims were Russian. The Russian Fascist Party had the task of capturing \"unreliable\" Russians living in Harbin to hand over to Unit 731 to serve as the unwilling subjects of the gruesome experiments. Some others were South East Asians and Pacific Islanders, at the time colonies of the Empire of Japan, and a small number of the prisoners of war from the Allies of World War II (although many more Allied POWs were victims of Unit 731 at other sites). Prisoners of war were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia, after infected with various diseases. Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. Unit 731 and its affiliated units (Unit 1644 and Unit 100 among others) were involved in research, development, and experimental deployment of epidemic-creating biowarfare weapons in assaults against the Chinese populace (both civilian and military) throughout World War II. Human targets were also used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in different positions. Flame throwers were tested on humans. Humans were tied to stakes and used as targets to test germ-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, and explosive bombs. Twelve Unit 731 members were found guilty in the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials but later repatriated; others received secret immunity by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur before the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in exchange for biological warfare work in the Cold War for the American Force.\n\nChinese revolutionaries including Zhao Shangzhi, Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, Zhao Yiman continued to struggle against the Japanese in Harbin and its administrative area, commanding the main anti-Japanese guerrilla army-Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army\u2014which was originally organized by the Manchurian branch of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The army was supported by the Comintern after the CPC Manchurian Provincial Committee was dissolved in 1936.\n\nUnder the Manchukuo r\u00e9gime and Japanese occupation, Harbin Russians had a difficult time. In 1935, the Soviet Union sold the Chinese Eastern Railway (KVZhD) to the Japanese, and many Russian emigres left Harbin (48133 of them were arrested during the Soviet Great Purge between 1936 and 1938 as \"Japanese spies\"). Most departing Russians returned to the Soviet Union, but a substantial number moved south to Shanghai or emigrated to the United States and Australia. By the end of the 1930s, the Russian population of Harbin had dropped to around 30,000.Many of Harbin's Jews (13,000 in 1929) fled after the Japanese occupation as the Japanese associated closely with militant anti-Soviet Russian Fascists, whose ideology of anti-Bolshevism and nationalism was laced with virulent anti-Semitism. The Kwantung Army sponsored and financed the Russian Fascist Party, which after 1932 started to play an over-sized role in the Harbin's Russian community as its thugs began to harness and some times killed those opposed to it. Most Jews left for Shanghai, Tianjin, and the British Mandate of Palestine. In the late 1930s, some German Jews fleeing the Nazis moved to Harbin. Japanese officials later facilitated Jewish emigration to several cities in western Japan, notably Kobe, which came to have Japan's largest synagogue.\n\n\n=== After World War II ===\n\nThe Soviet Army took the city on 20 August 1945 and Harbin never came under the control of the Kuomintang, whose troops stopped 60 km (37 mi) short of the city. The city's administration was transferred by the departing Soviet Army to the Chinese People's Liberation Army in April 1946. On 28 April 1946, the communist government of Harbin was established, making the 700,000-citizen-city the first large city governed by the communists. During the short occupation of Harbin by the Soviet Army (August 1945 to April 1946), thousands of Russian emigres who have been identified as members of the Russian Fascist Party and fled communism after the Russian October Revolution, were forcibly deported to the Soviet Union. After 1952 the Soviet Union launched a second wave of immigration back to Russia. By 1964, the Russian population in Harbin had been reduced to 450. The rest of the European community (Russians, Germans, Poles, Greeks, etc.) emigrated during the years 1950\u201354 to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel and the US, or were repatriated to their home countries. By 1988 the original Russian community numbered just thirty, all of them elderly. Modern Russians living in Harbin mostly moved there in the 1990s and 2000s, and have no relation to the first wave of emigration.\nHarbin was one of the key construction cities of China during the First Five-Year Plan period from 1951 to 1956. 13 of the 156 key construction projects were aid-constructed by the Soviet Union in Harbin. This project made Harbin an important industrial base of China. During the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1961, Harbin experienced a very tortuous development course as several Sino-Soviet contracts were cancelled by the Soviet Union. During the Cultural Revolution many foreign and Christian things were uprooted, such as the St. Nicholas church which was destroyed by Red Guards in 1966. On 23 August 1966, the Red Guards stormed into St. Nicholas Cathedral, burned its icons on the streets while chanting xenophobic slogans before destroying St. Nicholas Cathedral.  As the normal economic and social order was seriously disrupted, Harbin's economy also suffered from serious setbacks. One of the main reasons of this setback is with its Soviet ties deteriorating and the Vietnam War escalating, China became concerned of a possible nuclear attack. Mao Zedong ordered an evacuation of military and other key state enterprises away from the northeastern frontier, with Harbin being the core zone of this region, bordering the Soviet Union. During this Third Front Development Era of China, several major factories of Harbin were relocated to Southwestern Provinces including Gansu, Sichuan, Hunan and Guizhou, where they would be strategically secure in the event of a possible war. Some major universities of China were also moved out of Harbin, including Harbin Military Academy of Engineering (predecessor of Changsha's National University of Defense Technology) and Harbin Institute of Technology (Moved to Chongqing in 1969 and relocated to Harbin in 1973).\n\nNational economy and social service have obtained significant achievements since the Chinese economic reform first introduced in 1979. Harbin holds the China Harbin International economic and Trade Fair each year since 1990. Harbin once housed one of the largest Jewish communities in the Far East before World War II. It reached its peak in the mid-1920s when 25,000 European Jews lived in the city. Among them were the parents of Ehud Olmert, the former Prime Minister of Israel. In 2004, Olmert came to Harbin with an Israeli trade delegation to visit the grave of his grandfather in Huang Shan Jewish Cemetery, which had over 500 Jewish graves identified.On 5 October 1984, Harbin was designated a sub-provincial city by the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee. The eight counties of Harbin originally formed part of Songhuajiang Prefecture whose seat was practically located inside the urban area of Harbin since 1972. The prefecture was officially merged into Harbin city on 11 August 1996, increasing Harbin's total population to 9.47 million.Harbin hosted the third Asian Winter Games in 1996. In 2009, Harbin held the XXIV Winter Universiade.\nA memorial hall honoring Korean nationalist and independence activist Ahn Jung-geun was unveiled at Harbin Railway Station on 19 January 2014. Ahn assassinated four-time Prime Minister of Japan and former Resident-General of Korea It\u014d Hirobumi at No.1 platform of Harbin Railway Station on 26 October 1909, as Korea on the verge of annexation by Japan after the signing of the Eulsa Treaty. South Korean President Park Geun-Hye raised an idea of erecting a monument for Ahn while meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to China in June 2013. After that China began to build a memorial hall honoring Ahn at Harbin Railway Station. As the hall was unveiled on 19 January 2014, the Japanese side soon lodged protest with China over the construction of Ahn's memorial hall.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHarbin, with a total land area of 53,068 km2 (20,490 sq mi), is located in southern Heilongjiang province and is the provincial capital.

As a result, Harbin is China's base for the production of commodity grain and an ideal location for setting up agricultural businesses.\nHarbin also has industries such as light industry, textile, medicine, food, aircraft, automobile, metallurgy, electronics, building materials, and chemicals which help to form a fairly comprehensive industrial system. Several major corporations are based in the city. Harbin Electric Company Limited, Harbin Aircraft Industry Group and Northeast Light Alloy Processing Factory are some of key enterprises. Power manufacturing is a main industry in Harbin; hydro and thermal power equipment manufactured here makes up one-third of the total installed capacity in China. According to Platts, in 2009-10 Harbin Electric was the second largest manufacturer of steam turbines by worldwide market share, tying Dongfang Electric and slightly behind Shanghai Electric. Harbin Pharmaceutical Group, which mainly focus on research, development, manufacture and sale of medical products, is China's second-biggest pharmaceutical company by market value.Foreign investors seem upbeat about the city. Harbin International Trade and Economic Fair has been held annually since 1990. This investment and trade fair cumulatively attracting more than 1.9 million exhibitors and visitors from more than 80 countries and regions to attend, resulting over US$100 billion contract volume concluded according to the statistics of 2013. Harbin is among major destinations of FDI in Northeast China, with utilized FDI totaling US$980 million in 2013. After the 18th regular meeting between Sino-Russian Prime Ministers between Li Keqiang and Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev in October 2013, two sides come to make an agreement that the Harbin International Trade and Economic Fair will be renamed \"China-Russia EXPO\" and be co-sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, Heilongjiang Provincial government, the Russian Ministry of Economic Development and Russia's Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\nIn the financial sector, Longjiang Bank and Harbin Bank are some of the largest banks in Northeast China, with headquarters in Harbin.

The cuisine of Harbin consists of European dishes and Northern Chinese dishes mainly typified by heavy sauce and deep-frying.One of the most famous dishes in Northeastern Chinese cuisine is Guo Bao Rou, a form of sweet and sour pork. It is a classic dish from Harbin which originated in the early 20th century in Daotai Fu (pinyin: D\u00e0ot\u00e1i F\u01d4). It consists of a bite-sized pieces of pork in a potato starch batter, deep-fried until crispy. They are then lightly coated in a variation of a sweet and sour sauce, made from freshly prepared syrup, rice vinegar, sugar, flavoured with ginger, cilantro, sliced carrot and garlic. The Harbin Guobaorou is distinct from that of other areas of China, such as Liaoning, where the sauce may be made using either tomato ketchup or orange juice. Rather the Harbin style is dominated by the honey and ginger flavours and has a clear or honey yellow colour. Originally the taste was fresh and salty. In order to fete foreign guests, Zheng Xingwen, the chef of Daotai Fu, altered the dish into a sweet and sour taste. Usually, people prefer to go to several small or middle size restaurants to enjoy this dish, because it is difficult to handle the frying process at home.Demoli Stewed Live Fish is one among other notable dishes in Harbin, which is originated in a village named Demoli on the expressway from Harbin to Jiamusi. The village is now Demoli Service Area on Harbin-Tongjiang Expressway. Stewed Chicken with Mushrooms, Braised Pork with Vermicelli, and quick-boil pork with Chinese sauerkraut are also typical authentic local dishes.\nSince Russia had a strong influence of Harbin's history, the local cuisine of Harbin also contains Russian-style dishes and flavor. There are several authentic Russian-style restaurants in Harbin, especially alongside the Zhongyang Street.\n\nA popular regional specialty is Harbin-style smoked savory red sausage. This product similar to Lithuanian and German sausages which are very mild, and they tend to be much more of European flavours than other Chinese sausages. In 1900, Russian merchant Ivan Yakovlevich Churin founded a branch in Harbin, which was named Churin Foreign trading company (pinyin: Qiulin Yanghang; Russian: \u0426\u044e\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044c \u042f\u043d\u0445\u0430\u043d) selling imported clothes, leather boots, canned foods, vodka, etc., and began to expand sales network in other cities in Manchuria. The influx of Europeans through the Trans-Siberian Railway and Chinese Eastern Railway, increased demand of European flavor food. In 1909, Churin's Sausage Factory was founded, and first produced European flavor sausage with the manufacturing process of Lithuanian staff. Since then European style sausage become a specialty of the city.A Russian style large round bread \u5927\u5217\u5df4 d\u00e0 li\u011b ba, derived from the Russian word khleb for \"bread\" is also produced in Harbin's bakeries. Dalieba is a miche like sourdough bread. First introduced to the locals by a Russian baker, it has been sold in bakeries in Harbin for over a hundred years. Dalieba's sour and chewy taste is different from other traditional soft and fluffy Asian style breads in other parts of China.\nKvass, a Russia-originated fermented beverage made from black or regular rye bread, is also popular in Harbin.\nMadier (\"\u9a6c\u8fed\u5c14\", derived from \"Modern\") ice-cream provided in the Zhongyang Street is also well known in northern China. This ice cream is made from a specific traditional recipe and it tastes a little salty but more sweet and milky.

          "So this tower is pretty overrated. It does have decent views of the city at the top. But I don\u2019t think the 150 rmb cost per person is really worth it. The tower itself isn\u2019t that high, going about 190 metres up high. When you get off the elevator, you need to walk up about 4 or",
          "The entrance fee is a expensive with 150 RMB but on a clear day the views are very beautiful and you get a good impression of the lay out of this city.",
          "Be aware that after you get off the elevator you will need to climb a number of steps to get to either of the observation decks. It is nice view of the city ...but not a necessary stop.",
          "nothing special you could see through the tower and nothing interesting you enter in this tower. you could choose the ticket package with meal or no, but the environment is really general, even it is not attractive to enjoy Russian cuisine there.",
          "Dragon Tower was pretty average. The ticket was cheap (65rmb) and I didn\u2019t need to show my passport. I went during national holiday, so it was a little busy. The tower gave good views of Harbin, but wasn\u2019t super interesting. I visited because it was close, and I had some time to",
          "Very average tower, view is not too \"wow\" and windows poorly maintained. 150 kuai were a little too much for such deceiving experience. Recommend other iconic towers like the one in Shanghai or Guangzhou. The absence of pictures shows my deception after visiting the tower.",
          "Similar to the Shanghai Tower, nothing special. Does get a good 360 degree view of Harbin. Offers outside deck, and inside decks for viewing, which is necessary in this freezing winter temperature.",
          "I struggled with a rating of average to very good but what I can tell you is there are opportunities for discounts at the kiosk using Chinese Credit Card so try to go with someone that is local. The experience is confusing. There are three parts to the tower. The first part I",
          "There are good views to be had up this tall, dramatic tower. Also, there are quite a few interesting exhibits inside. My boy had to be dragged away from the entertainment, video game area - with lots of weaponry - shooting at tanks and helicopters. Probably shouldn't have taken",
          "Food very very badly done (steak can only well done no other choice & 30mins to wait ) Waiter totally no manners at all ( must pay 1st before they serve ) Deserts serve 1st follow by soup & lastly main course . Steak totally can\u2019t chew & is very harder Food is not cheap also .",
          "On a low pollution day, it provides a great view of the city. Good chance you'll experience wind. A bit pricey for Harbin; not all elevator, there are stairs, but no big deal; you can ring the bell and/or hit the drum; might as well check out all the 'exhibits' on 2nd floor",

          "This is a bit pricey for Harbin standards but the dinner was a nice touch in the 360 degree views. The 3D Picture room was cool and definitely worth some photos.

          "This is an excellent opportunity to see a different view of Harbin. It is a lot of fun to walk along the glass floor and look straight down to the ground below (perhaps not recommended if you're afraid of heights). It is pretty neat to go outside to see the city, although I",

          "The visit to Longta Tower was our first stop. Very nice tower with many viewing platforms. If you have been to Eiffel Tower then this may not be so spectacular. But it is the tallest tower in Asia. One word of advice, consider joining a 1 day tour because traffic is very bad",

          "It's difficult to describe the ice sculptures themselves. You really have to see them to appreciate the size of each work, and the scale of the whole park. It's incredible and really a unique lifetime experience. The best time to visit is at sunset, to see the fading sun",

          "For those who don't know, ice sculptures are only available in January in Harbin. Hence, the best time to go is in January as you are able to see both ice and snow sculptures than to snow sculptures only which is available in December. I would also suggest to go earlier as the",

          "The Harbin Ice and Snow World was the main reason we traveled to China in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere winter. This was part of our 23-day adventure arranged by Allison Chiang at Odynovo Tours. As usual everything ran like clockwork and John (our guide) was just as",
          "We decided to go to Harbin over a long weekend, as it wasn\u2019t that far by flight from our home city Beijing. And the time was perfect, as for ongoing annual ice and snow festival. It truly deserves a visit!",
          "We travelled to Harbin during Christmas period because we know normally the ice world will be start operation on that time. The tried operation period started on 23/12/2018. We came on 24th. We bought the ticket on the spot. Adult cost cny330. Below 18 years old cost cny200. We",
          "This is perhaps the only place throughout alI four seasons in China that you're able to experience the beautiful ice carvings. The lightings were very beautiful but it was super cold inside. Worth a visit!",

          "Huge and Impressive. Just look at all the pictures to feel its size. It is a wonder to build it every year. Definitely one of the best in the world. Plan your visit late in the afternoon to see the lights after dark.",
          "Bus 47 from Harbin railway station stop will take you there. It is the second stop after crossing the river. Entrance fee is 330 Yuan. It's hard to believe they can stack up ice cubes that much to create lots of gigantic architecture we can walk through and climb up. There",
          "My fiance and I traveled 8 hours by train from Beijing to Harbin to visit the Ice and Snow World, only to find that the attraction had abruptly closed for the season two days prior due to rising temperatures and safety hazards due to the melting ice. I understand that safety is",
          "This is a magic place as well as impressive. Adults and children find something to excite them. Very well organised and surprisingly not huge crowds though the week I was there the school holidays had not started . Yes it's cold but there are places to have warm drinks and with",

          "I was very dissapointed with one of the travel agent in jakarta (my tour) which offer our group to harbin at the end of february (Feb 18-Feb 22) By the time they set up the trip they convinced us that for sure we still can see the ice and sbow world statue, but in fact, yes we",
          "This is the place to be! I went in mid January before the rush of tourists and prices increased. Be sure to dress in warm layers, it\u2019s chilly outside. There are vendors who will sell you useful items in the park. The ticket line runs smoothly and there is free WiFi.",
          "This is about $50/person, but definitely worth it. We went at night and it was somewhere between -5 and -10 F. There were a lot of people but it didn't feel crowded at all. The whole family really enjoyed it.",

          "We were told at the park yesterday, that due to very warm and short winter this year, the park will be closed after today. We visited the Harbin Ice Festival last night and it was beyond spectacular, truly more than even the wonderful youtubes I had watched. Nothing like seeing",
          "This is a must see in Harbin... In fact, this is probably why Harbin is worth a trip. This is way more structured than any ice or snow events in Canada. For toddlers, bring a sled along for kids to ride in, sold outside door for rmb100. There are some baby slopes for",
          "Imagine entire buildings made of ice blocks: castles, churches, skyscrapers, walls, etc., all illuminated in changing colors. Only drawback is that is is super cold! -5 F when I was there, but there are side buildings you can go into go get warm. Be sure to go at night for",
          "Amazing ice sculptures with brilliant light displays. Although the temperature was freezing cold with sub-zero degrees during winter, the amazing sights made up for it. Coupled with a new year countdown here, it makes the trip really fulfilling.",
          "I just attended the ice festival and want to provide information on how not to be too cheated. First the taxi have an implicit culture of cheating the foreiginer - this is not typical to other Chinese cities but it appears to be the rule here. They do not cheat locals because",
          "It is better to visit at night because it is turned into a fairyland atmosphere with all the colourful lights. Make sure you wear waterproof shoes and have layers of clothes to protect you against the cold. Luckily they have a few restaurants and shops. After around 20 minutes",
          "Fantastic place to visit. Definitely only visit late evening to get the full effects of the lights. You can buy the plastic sleights outside and inside but they're cheaper outside. You get to use them for free on ice slides inside. Large lines for the trabogling. KFC inside for",

(OK, we hadn\u2019t done our research properly on this occasion). Whilst there we",

          "The pictures are amazing, but the reality is far better! Dozens of massive ice structures, all illuminated with LEDs. The tallest this year was 10 stories high! It's probably not possible to dress too warmly - thermals are required along with several more layers, snow pants &",
          "Reason to visit Harbin is of course the Ice and Snow world. You get to see some amazing sculptures that light up the night sky. It\u2019s cold so be prepared but it\u2019s worth a visit. You can also travel down the slopes if you feel like you want to play! Very well done but clearly has",
          "Long outstanding bucket list item done and definitely worth it. I arrived about an hour after sundown as the tour guide said the lighting shows up best when it\u2019s very dark, and she was right. Make sure you layer up as it can get very cold. It can also get a bit slippery on the",
          "We went with a tour group. We were there around 4.30pm. The sky had turned dark and the lightings on the exhibits were switched on. It was simply stunning! There were many activities like watching 6D show, gliding the ice slides etc but the queues were too long for us as we",
          "What a dream! I went just as the sun was setting, and this place was certainly magical. The line to buy tickets, walk through security, et cetera took me about 40 minutes, but it was fairly painless. I spent a little under 3 hours in the park, taking pictures & riding the",

          "Where else could you see something like this? The structures and artworks made using large blocks of ice are magnificently formed and when illuminated are most beautiful. There are of course other things to do if you so wish, some requiring additional payments. It is expensive",

          "The admission is expensive, at 330 RMB (about $50), but this is a must see exhibition if you're in Harbin in the winter. The artwork using the large ice blocks are beautiful and even so at night when colorfully lit up. You can also pay to go on large slides in the inflatable",

          "I probably represent the minority who think that the ice sculptures are more beautiful in the day. We arrived at about 2PM, got our tickets when we arrived, then walked around until about 6PM after sunset. The sunset hues against the ice carvings were magnificent, and quite",

          "It's very impressive- you can't help but marvel at the effort and vision required to built something at the sheer scale that this is done. Kids will love. Adults will get cold but you can find warming huts around. Pretty amazing lights and structures...none of our photos do it",
          "Get ready for the cold weather also ready your cellphone with a protective case so that your phone will last long. Also dont forget to wear an insole hotpack for your feet. It helps a lot! Quite expensive though RMB100 for 5pairs but really helpful for your half day stay! :)",
          "One of the best things I\u2019ve ever done. I highly recommend going around 3:30pm when it\u2019s day light and waiting for the lights to come on when it\u2019s dark. Awesome place.",

          "We arrived about 5pm (sunset is 4.15) so dark by the time we arrived. Taxi was 70rmb per hour as we asked him to wait for us. I think a great decision as it made for an easy exit and no waiting in the cold. Queues were really Long for all the rides. They looked like so much fun",

          "We had an amazing time attending the ice and snow festival this year! We went during Spring Festival but did not find the festival to be crowded as the event is well planned and spread out to accommodate all the tourists. We did not purchase tickets in advance and were easily",
          "I consider this visit a must do for anyone living in China. The city of Harbin is amazingly modern and well equipped with modern infrastructure. The city has many tourist attractions. But this is surely best of them. It is not too far from city. Like all popular places , it was",
          "This was a fun place to visit. I would def go back. Northern china is a great place. I did feel bad for the reindeer, so I did not partake in the sledding. The sights were fantastic. It was cold so I made sure to take hand warmers which were a lifesaver. My boots had good grip",
          "This is one of those places that is a off the beaten track - most people in my part of the world won't have heard of it. I interrupted a business trip to spend a few days here on the basis of an internet search... it involved a flight from Beijing and a hair-raising \"taxi\"",
          "The ice festival is incredible, involving sculptures, buildings, and even slides made out of ice! I recommend going at night when everything is lit up. Bring plenty of layers! It was minus 20 degrees celsius, which can sap your energy. Fortunately there are restaurants where you",
          "We had a very good time there. The ground was well organized and there were many interesting ice structures. Get your camera ready because there is a beautiful sight in every corner.",
          "I enjoyed the ice sculptures that are in the city of Harbin. And at the Harbin Ice and Snow World I was very impressed what they built with snow and ice. I asked one of the locals and he told me it 10,000 people 15 days to build the 2016 - 2017 Harbin Ice and Snow World. Be sure",

          "First, the \"Need to Knows\" when visiting the annual Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival...appropriate outerwear, a pair or two of gloves, a hat with ear muffs would be a bonus but all of these things can also be purchased once there. We also had hand and feet",
          "An incredible experience - it's overwhelming. The detailed buildings wonderfully lit by multi coloured led lights are a sight to see. Just go!!!",
          "It is a wonderful, huge worth the money and tome to visit in Harbin, right at the border of Russia & North Korea. Be prepared for a long, exhausted walk , wear very, very comfortable boots, jackets (with thermos lining if available) ,hats, gloves, scarves. If senior people are",
          "this place is awesome, seeing of these ice masterpieces standing there. Although Harbin has the lowest temperature i personally survived, this place is so pretty that maybe will make you less concern about the freezing cold. Definitely try the slides! Make sure you are dress",
          "Remarkable how ice and snow can be fashioned into buildings and sculptures! A beautiful sight for photo taking. Lights change colors at night. Be sure to bundle up with many layers of clothing and gloves. You will want to spend at least an hour there. So big and so much to",
          "The place is fully by ice block and they designed resemble as buildings or facilities. They are a house, palace, bridge, gate, tree, car with full light (LED). So the place is very bright and full color as they installed many color of LED in the ice.",
          "Words can\u00b4t describe the beauty of this place of snow and ice. Despite the cold, Harbin and its snow and ice festival must be visited, at least, once in a lifetime.",
          "We got some advice from the concierge and blogs before going. Get taxi to metered to Ice World. Buy tickets there, never anywhere else. Once inside, grab the train ride to see how big it is. No need for tour guide person. Then walk around to see the sights since you know where",
          "FEB 2016. When you go in to buy tix, if you're paying with credit, you have to go to the right side when you walk in. There's no signs in English. We waited in the wrong line for 30 mins before being told go to another line. Then after you have your tix you wait in a line just",
          "Freezing! the only word that i will use to describe when I'm in this festival. the Ice and Snow festival is annual event held by Harbin Government to attract tourist during winter. the statue and all the ice is amazing, even thought sometime i think the ticket price is not",
          "I've never seen anything like this. It's a mini-city constructed of ice blocks from the Songhua River. You can walk up the structures and slide down them. There are tubing runs as well. Just beautiful! And if you get hungry or thirsty, there are concessions throughout as",
          "1. Went there mid Feb so temperature was less(Managable but cold), flight rates were low and place was less crowded. Ice sculptures were intact and in good condition. So suggest to go in FEB :D 2. Reaching there is very easy, as Harbin has good transportation system. Use public",
          "My son and I took the overnight train from Beijing to attend the Ice and Snow festival. It was definitely worth the trip to experience this magical place. It is cold for sure, but it was a site to behold and to our surprise there were so many activities. Our only regret is that",
          "We hopped in a taxi from our hostel, and asked to go to Bingxue, the name of the Harbin Ice and Snow World in Chinese. The taxi started of, and then the driver asked if we had tickets for entry. We told him no, and he said we should buy them first, so that we could skip the line",
          "I've had this on my bucket list for years, and it did. It did not disappoint! We got there around 4:15 and the sun was setting over the ice and it was gorgeous. We stayed until just before 6. The sun had set and the lights had been in for about an hour. This was the perfect",
          "Wear multiple layers. This place is truly amazing and I can't imagine ever seeing anything like it anywhere else in the world. There are sculptures from teams all over the world so you get a nice variety of themes. Plenty for all ages to enjoy. We booked round trip",
          "We saw the sculptures by day light and in the evening when they are beautiful coloured with lights. It's an amazing show. Their are a lot of ice attractions for young and old, like skating, biking, boating, sliding, bobsled. Buy a small plastic sitting pad outside the attraction",
          "what they build here in the winter is amazing, a city out of snow and Ice, Heineken bar, restaurants, beautiful sculptures, massive slides. So much going on in other parts of Harbin and the frozen river- worth the trek for 4 days yes, it is a Tad cold Durrr, -30c and being",
          "Ice grippers for your boots are a must. Well worth visiting twice. Once in the early part of the day and then a separate time for dusk / early evening visit. Photographically the best light is the 30 minutes around sunset. Very very busy at evenings with lots of Chinese. Tripods",
          "Visited last weekend. Well worth the trip from New Zealand to see. Is one of 3 main Ice or snow parks (you should do all 3, see my other reviews). Entrance fee was about 300RMB we arrived about 2pm (no queues) so had to wait a bit for sunset (about 5). it was interesting to see",
          "If you are in Harbin as a tourist, this is it. Do the trip by yourself if you can manage some Chinese. Going with agents or tour groups is not worth it.",
          "This was an amazing experience, such an eye opener and definitely worth braving the cold to see! The sculptures designed by worldwide artists and the sheer size of the ice towers and turrets were equally stunning. Check out the ice and snow slides too, great fun.",
          "The festival is not cheap (300CNY) and if you're not into cold weather it might not be worth it to you. That being said, I am also not the biggest fan of freezing my toes off but I still enjoyed walking around the festival at night. We arrived after sunset and spent ~2h there",
          "Even though I had seen pictures, when you are standing in front of the amazing sculptures, you still can't believe your eyes. This should be one of the wonders of the world, without a doubt. Pro tip: We hired a driver for the day (700RMB for 12 hours). We went to the Sun",
          "This is the second time I have visited the park! I loved it the first time and second time too! It was of course very cold but it's manageable. Just be careful cause it's very slippery everywhere especially the stairs on the sculptures. Because it's getting warmer now, some ice",
          "Great place but wrap up warm. Most people go at night, but I recommend try and go early afternoon, the sculptures and detail is best seen in natural light, plus it less busy. We then had a meal and waited for the lights that came on around 5pm A most do if in Harbin",
          "Just one of the most amazing festivals I have ever seen. As the sun sets by 5:30 it is great to see with small children as it isn't too late. Just beware of the Taxi drivers on the way home. They will try to fleece you. Make sure you know how much your trip is worth.",
          "You pay 300 RMB per person (maybe a little expensive). You need 3 hours (even more) to visit it. You find what you see in pictures. This is feautiful and interesting. Very funy for children.",
          "Suitably clad in salopets, thermal underwear,socks,boots,padded coat plus silk liners in our gloves weovercame te temperature of -28C. Worth every minute. Most of the area closes down for New Year, but not the city centre and the parks. A visit to the river bank on New Years Day",
          "If your going to this avoid the organised trips and go late afternoon by taxi, ( about 20-30rmb). The place changes between day and night with the majority going after dark to see the lighting effects which are great. by going a little early you avoid the Harbin rush hour, get",
          "A visit to The Ice Festival is well worth the time and effort involved. This city may be a little remote and its winter a little on the cool side (!), but it will surprise even seasoned travellers. I visited towards the end of the event amber there was some evidence of melting",
          "Having seen this on TV a few years ago, when I was offered an opportunity to visit I jumped at it. To be honest, I was a little disappointed as the TV program had probably selectively shown only the very best views of the ice buildings and the park was smaller overall than I",
          "Absolutely beautiful, enjoyed each and every moment. So much to absorb and see, but as you can imagine, extremely cold. Dress appropriately!",
          "Absolutely fantastic spectacle, which is spread across different parks. The scale and detail will amaze you and it's like a fairytale event that is great for adults as well as children. Just go prepared for the very cold weather and be careful when navigating steps and slippery",
          "I visited the famous snow and ice sculptures on Sun Island, Harbin, Northeast China, as an extension to a Wendy Wu Chinese New Year tour. From the start, I was made very welcome by my delightful tour guide, Sunie. We visited all the main sights in Harbin, but of course the",
          "This place is a must to see. A special place to see so much. We arrived at 3:30pm and saw so many special ice sculptures. As the sun Set at 4:30 the lights appeared and it was spectacular. We couldnt believe how beautiful it was. The talent to make something ike this is so",
          "It was an excellent experience. I always wanted to go to this place.. finally I got a chance to visit.. as I went through some of the reviews about this place and I was bit scared about the freezing climate but was that bad.. best time to go there is around 4 pm. You will see",
          "It's an awesome place one of its kind ... I think everyone should come here once in life... Please Please don't be scared for cold as we were also scared yes it's cold but if you have exact clothes you will enjoy here... kids enjoy here more ... shoes are very very important",
          "we arrived at the ice and snow world at 3pm. good time to arrive as not too many people around. it was dark by 4:30pm... and then the masses of people started to arrive. so get there early and avoid the lines of people waiting to get in.",
          "Amazing Place to Visit During the Winter Months..Children had a amazing experience trying different rides",
          "Incredible! We were surprised by how expensive the entry fee is- 330 RMB for adults, 200 RMB for children over 1.2 m, but the displays were dazzling and well worth it. Gorgeous ice structures, as well as sledding, ice mazes, ice slides, sleigh rides and other winter fun.",
          "Should visit and it is probably one of the best ice show I have seen. It is cold but well worth the time.",
          "Breathtaking & amazing. The experience borders on the surreal. Cool to go just before sunset, it will be less busy, and then you get to see it during the day as well. Make sure you dress warmly. This is something everyone should see once in their life!",
          "We saw a clip on television and in real life it was equally amazing. We got there at dusk and as darkness fell all the attractions individually lit up. We paid a bit extra for the trip but went on Chinese new so as not to be too many people around. It is wheelchair friendly",
          "Really a spectacular site Tips: Bring your own heat packs, the ones the sell are horrible and work for under 2 hours. Make you you line up for the long ice slide before 7 or you most likely won't get to ride. Well worth the wait. (Far right of the park) Every taxi will",
          "Be Patient 1. Take a taxi, get off at the end of the entrance, avoid the people pushing and just take your time. 2. Know that there will be a long line to buy tickets and there will be fierce chaos and confusion to get into a line. Even after the line to buy a ticket, the lines",
          "Enormous ice buildings and sculptures, lit throughout with neon lights. Just very impressive, especially the clarity of the ice. I seriously recommend investing 20 RMB in a pair of little metal crampons from the sales guys outside the entrance - they will help to keep you safe.",
          "This was awesome, with a few Chinese quirks ^^ The castles and walls and buildings of ice were what I always wanted to build as a kid. There were the ice sculpture galleries, which we wandered through like art critics. There were reindeer pulling small sleighs with Merry",
          "Yes it was very very cold but worth it. One can only be impressed by the masses of ice blocks (cut from the nearby river) used to construct the beautifully lit structures. The Ice Show has a number of ice slides for kids of all ages. The Snow Show nearby (but with a separate",
          "I knew it would be cold but I was not prepared for this. Bring many layers, put a heat patch on your phone/camera so it doesn't freeze and shut off every 5 minutes like mine did. Many little restaurants/cafes inside the \"world\" for you to duck into and warm up, which was great.",
          "I have been wanting to come to Harbin to see the ice festival for many years, and despite this it still exceeded my expectations. I just found it so fun, and magical. There are more things to do at the ice and snow big world than expected. There are lots of food and drink",
          "This was amazing. There are two areas to see. The Ice Festival is all ice buildings and coloured lights. Also the ice sculpture competition. The size, the cold, the lights, what an experience. The snow Festival is best seen in the day. It is in another area and all the buildings",
          "Harbin ice and snow world is more like a theme park with many outdoor activities. We came to see the ice sculptures but were surprised to see the number of family-friendly activities. The information online did suggest that night time was best for a visit. We arrived about 3",
          "It's so amazing seeing the ice sculptures. Going at dusk, shows them off the best. Not cheap to see, about $65 a person Australian. Photos taken later, don't have the same detail, unless you are there for the colours only. Found 2 hours was the maximum time for us. Starts to get",
          "Unless you understand Chinese, it is better to take a taxi to get there. It'll save you a lot of time waiting for the bus and walking. Go around two, so you can see the ice structures before they are lighted. They are just as amazing without the lighting. Of course, with the",
          "You must see this spectacular event once in your lifetime! I am so happy I did it! and if you are on a budget, some good hotels are cheap, as well as taxis, as well as food. Ant there are lots of other sights around (Zhaolin Park, Sun ISland, Ice sculptures spread of\u00b4ver the",
          "Had put this trip off for 20 years. Thought it would be too cold. It was cold but the kids kept you active and they loved it! We were there early in the season and I would be concerned going now around Chinese New Year as I suspect the queues will be immense, the famous 300m",
          "No words can describe- simply beautiful - loads to do. You can buy tickets at the venue. Wrap up for the extreme cold and it is a sight not to be missed in China. Pre-book your internal flights and stay at an international chain hotel if your Mandarin is not so good. Take a",
          "Our trip to China was centred around the Ice Festival - and there was no let down at all. There are three sights. 1) Ice Festival (north side of Songhua River) 2) Snow Sculpture (North of Songhua River) 3) Ice Lantern (Zhaolin Park). All charge separate entry fees. The Ice",
          "This is a must see, very beautiful and wondrous...but you defiantly need to where long down jackets and ski wear is a must. Ques can get long for certain attractions and toilets, not much in a way of food stalls. I came by taxi who waited for me, where by he actually went and",
          "I was a bit nervous about visiting somewhere so cold, but I was so glad I did. With the right clothing the cold is bearable and the sights are well worth the trip. I had 2 hours at the site and this was enough to see everything but not too much to get frostbite. You could spend",

          "It's about 300 yuan per adult and 200 per kid. We went late morning and stayed until after sunset, which is at 4:00. There are several activities for 16+, but there's enough for any age to be entertained for the day if you can manage the cold. I recommend heat packs for your",
          "It is well worth the visit. I originally felt this would be a one and done type of experience -- see it once, mark it off the list, never return again. However, I enjoyed it enough that I will likely do it again in 3-4 years. Amazing ice and snow sculptures with lots of",
          "As a foreign student in China, I was able to get a great discount on the entry fee, so the festival only cost me 200\u5143. It's truly a magical and completely unique experience. I would highly recommend going to the Ice and Snow World to everyone, with a few caveats. 1. Because",
          "The park was pretty well built up and amazing. Definitely impressing and worth seeing. They have Ice castles, slides, sculptures, rides, etc... There is plenty to do for anyone here. If you are active, you can race down the ice slides or ice skate on some rinks. They have",
          "It seems a little expensive (\u00a5330) but that includes all the activities you can do such as slides/ice bikes/ice skating...there are lots of things to do! The ice buildings are also really impressive. I would recommend going at night as it's all lit up however it gets busier",
          "I was there on Jan 13-14th, first of all, place is amazing, is totally worth as bucket list item!, but things you need to know and get prepared since temp, average was on the -15 to -25C. I was told not to bring small children but with the correct preparation and gear I can",
          "Go at sunset on a clear day for maximum effect. Great ice slides and other entertainment especially for the kids big or small. Don't expect fine dining but a warm pizza and coffee are a most welcome break from the cold. And it is cold! Worth the trip.",
          "The ice and snow festival is probably a once in lifetime experience for most people and it is one worth having as most people have probably never seen anything like it. The sculptures are truly amazing, and there are many of the to see. Remember though, it is really, really",
          "Our strategy was to arrive about an hour and a half before sundown so we could see the park in both daylight and darkness. If you plan to do it all/see it all, it will take quite awhile and you'll probably want to spend sometime in the snackbar/exhibit hall. They wanted 20 rmb",
          "What an experience, the coldest I've ever been in -23C but well worth it. I've never seen anything like it on such a scale. the photos don't really do it justice",
          "This year was my third time to visit Harbin Winter Wonderland. I'll be back some day! It's cold but not too cold - just be prepared!",
          "You will be amazed when you step inside the Harbin Ice and Snow World. Definitely a must-visit at least once in your life. You will see big blocks of ice turned into wonderful structures. You should be prepared with your winter gear to be able to see all the structures for about",
          "A must do while in China during the Festival Time. Amazing sculptures and buildings reflecting China. Go around 3 PM in order to see the ice buildings during daylight and than around 4:30 PM when it gets dark and all the lights go on it is a fantastic atmosphere.",
          "Beautiful snow sculptures and they were super huge! We were there before the actual opening (the 29th China-Harbin Sun Island International Snow Sculpture Art Deco Expo - 2017) and some of them were still in the process of being 'sculptured'. Wow...so many sculptors -",
          "Awesome ice sculpture but i would advise to wear more clothes and proper shoe wear as this place is super cold. I think 2 hours visit is fine as most of the people cannot stand the weather out there for too long.",
          "If you like neon lights, big BIG structures, and long queues you'll enjoy this more than I did! There are some genuinely impressive sculptures to enjoy but they're the minority compared to the huge gaudy castles & car-sponsored towers. W/e queues for the sledging were 1hr+",
          "After visiting 115 countries and many cities and events, this festival is one of the most amazing spectacular on the planet. it is taking place in three different parks in the city, all of them are beautiful. entrance fee to all these parks is expensive , but worth paying",
          "Pretty expensive (330RMB) but I liked it. Took a taxi there & back. My hotel was quite close so I paid approx 15/trip..though some taxi drivers wanted 40-50 without a meter, so beware! I went there to see the ice sculptures, but families do skating, sledging. It can be a nice",

          "Ok, so the Harbin Ice and Snow World is really cool. You've seen the pictures, and yeah, it's pretty much that, so rather than write another review about how awesome it is, I'll concentrate on the little things that were hard to research beforehand. First, you'll need 3 hours",
          "We arrived at the famed Ice and Snow World in Harbin before 4pm and saw it before and after the lights came on. The sculptures were sizeable and quite attractive, more so under illumination. Long lines formed in most tall structures. But at -20C, it was just too cold to wait",
          "The Ice and Snow World is absolutely magical and a must see when visiting Northern China. The snow sculptures really are phenomenal. Dress warmly though - it's cold!",
          "This place was on my bucket list for years and to actually see it was incredible. It was well worth the freezing temperature. The structures and sculptures were amazing and fascinating. Worth a visit",
          "Not sure if it's a must see when in China, but it's a nice place to visit. Looks very good at night although with too many colours sometimes. There's many slides, ice skating and skiing, so be ready for some fun! And don't worry, there's also some places where to warm up; like",
          "Entry fee: \u00a5330 RMB if you purchase your ticket at the entrance gate. Be prepared to wait in a queue to buy the ticket and then another queue to enter. It includes most of the activities but not all. Bring some cash to act as a deposit if you want to hire ice skates and/or ski",

          "I would have given a 5-star ratings if they have a cleaner toilet facilities. The photographing services is a big disappointment though. For the hefty sum that they charge the quality of photo is unacceptable. However, overall we did enjoy the spectacular ice sculpture.",
          "The photos did not exaggerate. The Ice and Snow World has massive ice sculptures that light up in color at night. The structures are made completely of ice blocks, from the staircases, to bridges, to the platforms, or the spires. Kids will have a great time sliding down numerous",
          "I have visited a lot of really nice events, shows and concerts around the World - but is really something special. It is an absolut must if you are in the area at the right time of the year. Really fantastic sturcures and figures and a nice ice dancing show as well. THANK YOU !",
          "This is an attraction you must only come in the evening when the skies have darkened. But beware that the crowds are overbearing! The entry to the site is via a \"security\" scan after you have gotten through the main gate. And snaking lines are the norm before you are 'let out'",
          "We took a tourist bus there but for the price probably should just have taken a taxi. This time of year it gets dark at 4:30pm so we got there about 5pm and left 8pm. For adults the ticket cost us 120RMB each. Just depends who you get it from. Plenty of taxi driver take u to",
          "We visited a few days before the official opening but most of the structures were completed. It is amazing to see the huge scale of the buildings carved out of ice but be prepared to wait in line a long time to enter and to share your sightseeing with 40,000 people or more,",
          "I was impressed with the snow sculpture, especially after I have tried to make a snow man. I realized how much snow has to be compacted before the professionals can start the sculpting. The weather was very cold so we took the tram (20rmb) in to the central display area. But we",
          "The city of Harbin is quite populated and busy. It is full of local and foreign tourists in the winter. The Central street is mostly crowded during the winter season. Even before the Ice festival, sculptures have been put up for display. Many artists have been working hard day",

          "Could you imagine being in a world made of ice? Well, this is exactly that! This park is very fun to be at and there is a lot for you guys to do! The night time view is amazing and they also have shows. At this park you will always have something to do, from the slides the high",

          "Truly an ice and snow wonderland. Think a theme park with everything made of ice or snow - castles and forts, mazes, numerous slides for the young (and young at heart). There is ice cycling and ice scootering to try, snacks to sample, and restaurants if you're feeling cold. We",
          "Found it fairly hard to get here after taking the cable car (wanted to try, worth it somehow). Generally, attractions in China are also filled with domestic tourists and they can be very eager to get to places and see the attractions. I'd recommend coming with an open mind. Got",

        "wiki": "Harbin (Manchu: \u1865\u1820\u182f\u182a\u1873\u1828 (); Chinese: \u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8 H\u0101'\u011brb\u012bn) is a sub-provincial city and the provincial capital of Heilongjiang province, People's Republic of China, as well as the second largest city by urban population and largest city by metropolitan population (urban and rural together) in Northeast China.  Harbin has direct jurisdiction over nine metropolitan districts, two county-level cities and seven counties, and is the eighth most populous Chinese city according to the 2010 census, the built-up area (which consists of all districts except Shuangcheng and Acheng) had 5,282,093 inhabitants, while the total metropolitan population was up to 10,635,971.  Harbin serves as a key political, economic, scientific, cultural and communications hub in Northeast China, as well as an important industrial base of the nation.Harbin, whose name was originally a Manchu word meaning \"a place for drying fishing nets\", grew from a small rural settlement on the Songhua River to become one of the largest cities in Northeast China. Founded in 1898 with the coming of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the city first prospered as a region inhabited by an overwhelming majority of immigrants from the Russian Empire.With its often harsh winters, Harbin is heralded as the Ice City (\u51b0\u57ce) for its well-known winter tourism and recreations. Harbin is notable for its ice sculpture festival in the winter. Besides being well known for its historical Russian legacy, the city serves as an important gateway in Sino-Russian trade today. In the 1920s, the city was considered China's fashion capital since new designs from Paris and Moscow reached here first before arriving in Shanghai. The city was voted \"China Top Tourist City\" by the China National Tourism Administration in 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nHuman settlement in the Harbin area dates from at least 2200 BC during the late Stone Age. Wanyan Aguda, the founder and first emperor (reigned 1115-1123) of the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), was born in the Jurchen Wanyan tribes who resided near the Ashi River in this region.  In AD 1115 Aguda established Jin's capital Shangjing (Upper Capital) Huining Prefecture in today's Acheng District of Harbin. After Aguda's death, the new emperor Wanyan Sheng ordered the construction of a new city on a uniform plan. The planning and construction emulated major Chinese cities, in particular Bianjing (Kaifeng), although the Jin capital was smaller than its Northern Song prototype. Huining Prefecture served as the first superior capital of the Jin empire until Wanyan Liang (the fourth emperor of Jin Dynasty) moved the capital to Yanjing (now Beijing) in 1153. Liang even went so far as to destroy all palaces in his former capital in 1157. Wanyan Liang's successor Wanyan Yong (Emperor Shizong) restored the city and established it as a secondary capital in 1173. Ruins of the Shangjing Huining Prefecture were discovered and excavated about 2 km (1.2 mi)from present-day Acheng's central urban area. The site of the old Jin capital ruins is a national historic reserve, and includes the Jin Dynasty History Museum. The museum, open to the public, was renovated in late 2005. Mounted statues of Aguda and of his chief commander Wanyan Zonghan (also Nianhan) stand in the grounds of the museum.\nMany of the artifacts found there are on display in nearby Harbin.\nAfter the Mongol conquest of the Jin Empire (1211\u20131234), Huining Prefecture was abandoned. In the 17th century, the Manchus used building materials from Huining Prefecture to construct their new stronghold in Alchuka. The region of Harbin remained largely rural until the 1800s, with over ten villages and about 30,000 people in the city's present-day urban districts by the end of the 19th century.\n\n\n=== International city ===\n\nA small village in 1898 grew into the modern city of Harbin. Polish engineer Adam Szyd\u0142owski drew plans for the city following the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which the Russian Empire had financed. The Russians selected Harbin as the base of their administration over this railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. The railways were largely constructed by Russian engineers and indentured workers. The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the Trans-Siberian Railway: substantially reducing the distance from Chita to Vladivostok and also linking the new port city of Dalny (Dalian) and the Russian Naval Base Port Arthur (L\u00fcshun). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a \"boomtown\", growing into a city within five years. The majority of settlers in Harbin came from southern Ukraine (Russian Empire). In addition to Ukrainians there were many Russians, Jews, Poles, Georgians, and Tatars.The city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar Simon Karlinsky, who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian Jewish family, wrote that in Harbin \"the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned\u2014well before the October Revolution\u2014by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners\", giving the city a very European appearance. Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms which soon turned Manchuria into the \"breadbasket of China\" while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize.  Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria.  A sign of Harbin's wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play K zvezdam by Leonid Andreyev had its premiere there.   \n\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies. Churches were rebuilt for Russian Orthodox, Lutheran/German Protestant, and Polish Catholic Christians. Chinese capitalists also established businesses, especially in brewing, food and textiles. Harbin became the economic hub of northeastern China and an international metropolis.The rapid growth of the city challenged the public healthcare system. The worst-ever recorded outbreak of pneumonic plague was spread to Harbin through the Trans-Manchurian railway from the border trade port of Manzhouli. The plague lasted from late autumn of 1910 to spring 1911 and killed 1,500 Harbin residents (mostly ethnic Chinese), or about five percent of its population at the time. This turned out to be the beginning of the large so-called Manchurian plague pandemic which ultimately claimed 60,000 victims. In the winter of 1910, Dr. Wu Lien-teh (later the founder of Harbin Medical University) was given instructions from the Foreign Office, Peking, to travel to Harbin to investigate the plague. Dr. Wu asked for imperial sanction to cremate plague victims, as cremation of these infected victims turned out to be the turning point of the epidemic. The suppression of this plague pandemic changed medical progress in China. Bronze statues of Dr. Wu Lien-teh are built in Harbin Medical University to remember his contributions in promoting public health, preventive medicine and medical education.The first generation of Harbin Russians were mostly the builders and employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They moved to Harbin in order to work on the railroad. At the time Harbin was not an established city. The city was almost built from scratch by the builders and early settlers. Houses were constructed, furniture and personal items were brought in from Russia. After the Manchurian plague epidemic, Harbin's population continued to increase sharply, especially inside the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. In 1913 the Chinese Eastern Railway census showed its ethnic composition as: Russians \u2013 34313, Chinese (that is, including Hans, Manchus etc.) \u2013 23537, Jews \u2013 5032, Poles \u2013 2556, Japanese \u2013 696, Germans \u2013 564, Tatars \u2013 234, Latvians \u2013 218, Georgians \u2013 183, Estonians \u2013 172, Lithuanians \u2013 142, Armenians \u2013 124; there were also Karaims, Ukrainians, Bashkirs, and some Western Europeans. In total, 68549 citizens of 53 nationalities, speaking 45 languages. Research shows that only 11.5 percent of all residents were born in Harbin. By 1917, Harbin's population exceeded 100,000, with over 40,000 of them were ethnic Russians.\n\nAfter Russia's Great October Socialist Revolution in November 1917, more than 100,000 defeated Russian White Guards and refugees retreated to Harbin, which became a major center of White Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s and the largest Russian enclave outside the Soviet Union. Karlinsky noted that a major difference with the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who arrived in Harbin was: \"Unlike the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who went to Paris or Prague or even to Shanghai, the new residents of Harbin were not a minority surrounded by a foreign population. They found themselves instead in an almost totally Russian city, populated mainly by people with roots in the south of European Russia.\" The city had a Russian school system, as well as publishers of Russian-language newspapers and journals. Russian Harbintsy community numbered around 120,000 at its peak in the early 1920s. Many of Harbin's Russians were wealthy, which sometime confused foreign visitors who expected them to be poor, with for instance the American writer Harry A. Franck in his 1923 book Wanderings in North China writing the Russian \"ladies as well gowned as at the Paris races [who] strolled with men faultlessly garbed by European standards\", leading him to wonder how they had achieved this \"deceptive appearance\".The Harbin Institute of Technology was established in 1920 as the Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry to educate railway engineers via a Russian method of instruction. Students could select from two majors at the time: Railway Construction or Electric Mechanic Engineering. On 2 April 1922, the school was renamed the Sino-Russian Industrial University. The original two majors eventually developed into two major departments: the Railway Construction Department and the Electric Engineering Department.  Between 1925 and 1928 the University's Rector was  Leonid Aleksandrovich Ustrugov, the Russian Deputy Minister of Railways under Nicholas II before the Russian Revolution, Minister of Railways under Admiral Kolchak's government, and a key figure in the development of the Chinese Eastern Railway.\nThe Russian community in Harbin made it their mission to preserve the pre-revolutionary culture of Russia. The city had numerous Russian language newspapers, journals, libraries, theaters and two opera companies. One of the famous Russian poets in Harbin was Valery Pereleshin, who started publishing his intensely homoerotic poetry in 1937, and was also one of the few Russian writers in Harbin who learned Mandarin. The subject of Pereleshin's poetry caused problems with the Russian Fascist Party, and led Pereelshin leaving Harbin for Shanghai, and ultimately to the United States. Not all of the Russian newspapers were of high quality, with Karlinsky calling Nash put', the newspaper of the Russian Fascist Party \"the lowest example of gutter journalism that Harbin had ever seen\". Nikolai Baikov, a Russian writer in Harbin was known for his novels of exile life in that city together with his accounts of his travels across Manchuria and the folklore of its Manchu and Chinese population. Boris Yulsky, a young Russian writer who published his short stories in the newspaper Rubezh was considered to be a promising writer whose career was cut short when he gave up literature for activism in the Russian Fascist Party and cocaine addiction. Moya-tvoya (mine \u2013 yours), a pidgin language that was a combination of Russian and Mandarin Chinese that had developed in the 19th century when Chinese went to work in Siberia, was considered essential by the Chinese business people of Harbin. \nIn the early 1920s, according to Chinese scholars' recent studies, over 20,000 Jews lived in Harbin. After 1919, Dr. Abraham Kaufman played a leading role in Harbin's large Russian Jewish community. The Republic of China discontinued diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1920, so many Russians found themselves stateless. When the Chinese Eastern Railway and government in Beijing announced in 1924 that they agreed the railroad would only employ Russian or Chinese nationals, the emigres were forced to announce their ethnic and political allegiance. Most accepted Soviet citizenship.\nThe Chinese warlord Zhang Xueliang, the \"Young Marshal\" seized the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929. Soviet military force quickly put an end to the crisis and forced the Nationalist Chinese to accept restoration of joint Soviet-Chinese administration of the railway.\n\n\n=== Japanese invasion period ===\n\nJapan invaded Manchuria outright after the Mukden Incident in September 1931. After the Japanese captured Qiqihar in the Jiangqiao Campaign, the Japanese 4th Mixed Brigade moved toward Harbin, closing in from the west and south. Bombing and strafing by Japanese aircraft forced the Chinese army to retreat from Harbin. Within a few hours the Japanese occupation of Harbin was complete.With the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, the so-called \"pacification of Manchukuo\" began, as volunteer armies continued to fight the Japanese. Harbin became a major operations base for the infamous medical experimenters of Unit 731, who killed people of all ages and ethnicities. All these units were known collectively as the Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department of the Kwantung Army. The main facility of the Unit 731 was built in 1935 at Pingfang District, approximately 24 km (15 mi) south of Harbin urban area at that time. Between 3,000 and 12,000 citizens including men, women, and children\u2014from which around 600 every year were provided by the Kempeitai\u2014died during the human experimentation conducted by Unit 731 at the camp based in Pingfang alone, which does not include victims from other medical experimentation sites. Almost 70 percent of the victims who died in the Pingfang camp were Chinese, including both civilian and military. Close to 30 percent of the victims were Russian. The Russian Fascist Party had the task of capturing \"unreliable\" Russians living in Harbin to hand over to Unit 731 to serve as the unwilling subjects of the gruesome experiments. Some others were South East Asians and Pacific Islanders, at the time colonies of the Empire of Japan, and a small number of the prisoners of war from the Allies of World War II (although many more Allied POWs were victims of Unit 731 at other sites). Prisoners of war were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia, after infected with various diseases. Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. Unit 731 and its affiliated units (Unit 1644 and Unit 100 among others) were involved in research, development, and experimental deployment of epidemic-creating biowarfare weapons in assaults against the Chinese populace (both civilian and military) throughout World War II. Human targets were also used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in different positions. Flame throwers were tested on humans. Humans were tied to stakes and used as targets to test germ-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, and explosive bombs. Twelve Unit 731 members were found guilty in the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials but later repatriated; others received secret immunity by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur before the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in exchange for biological warfare work in the Cold War for the American Force.\n\nChinese revolutionaries including Zhao Shangzhi, Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, Zhao Yiman continued to struggle against the Japanese in Harbin and its administrative area, commanding the main anti-Japanese guerrilla army-Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army\u2014which was originally organized by the Manchurian branch of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The army was supported by the Comintern after the CPC Manchurian Provincial Committee was dissolved in 1936.\n\nUnder the Manchukuo r\u00e9gime and Japanese occupation, Harbin Russians had a difficult time. In 1935, the Soviet Union sold the Chinese Eastern Railway (KVZhD) to the Japanese, and many Russian emigres left Harbin (48133 of them were arrested during the Soviet Great Purge between 1936 and 1938 as \"Japanese spies\"). Most departing Russians returned to the Soviet Union, but a substantial number moved south to Shanghai or emigrated to the United States and Australia. By the end of the 1930s, the Russian population of Harbin had dropped to around 30,000.Many of Harbin's Jews (13,000 in 1929) fled after the Japanese occupation as the Japanese associated closely with militant anti-Soviet Russian Fascists, whose ideology of anti-Bolshevism and nationalism was laced with virulent anti-Semitism. The Kwantung Army sponsored and financed the Russian Fascist Party, which after 1932 started to play an over-sized role in the Harbin's Russian community as its thugs began to harness and some times killed those opposed to it. Most Jews left for Shanghai, Tianjin, and the British Mandate of Palestine. In the late 1930s, some German Jews fleeing the Nazis moved to Harbin. Japanese officials later facilitated Jewish emigration to several cities in western Japan, notably Kobe, which came to have Japan's largest synagogue.\n\n\n=== After World War II ===\n\nThe Soviet Army took the city on 20 August 1945 and Harbin never came under the control of the Kuomintang, whose troops stopped 60 km (37 mi) short of the city. The city's administration was transferred by the departing Soviet Army to the Chinese People's Liberation Army in April 1946. On 28 April 1946, the communist government of Harbin was established, making the 700,000-citizen-city the first large city governed by the communists. During the short occupation of Harbin by the Soviet Army (August 1945 to April 1946), thousands of Russian emigres who have been identified as members of the Russian Fascist Party and fled communism after the Russian October Revolution, were forcibly deported to the Soviet Union. After 1952 the Soviet Union launched a second wave of immigration back to Russia. By 1964, the Russian population in Harbin had been reduced to 450. The rest of the European community (Russians, Germans, Poles, Greeks, etc.) emigrated during the years 1950\u201354 to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel and the US, or were repatriated to their home countries. By 1988 the original Russian community numbered just thirty, all of them elderly. Modern Russians living in Harbin mostly moved there in the 1990s and 2000s, and have no relation to the first wave of emigration.\nHarbin was one of the key construction cities of China during the First Five-Year Plan period from 1951 to 1956. 13 of the 156 key construction projects were aid-constructed by the Soviet Union in Harbin. This project made Harbin an important industrial base of China. During the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1961, Harbin experienced a very tortuous development course as several Sino-Soviet contracts were cancelled by the Soviet Union. During the Cultural Revolution many foreign and Christian things were uprooted, such as the St. Nicholas church which was destroyed by Red Guards in 1966. On 23 August 1966, the Red Guards stormed into St. Nicholas Cathedral, burned its icons on the streets while chanting xenophobic slogans before destroying St. Nicholas Cathedral.  As the normal economic and social order was seriously disrupted, Harbin's economy also suffered from serious setbacks. One of the main reasons of this setback is with its Soviet ties deteriorating and the Vietnam War escalating, China became concerned of a possible nuclear attack. Mao Zedong ordered an evacuation of military and other key state enterprises away from the northeastern frontier, with Harbin being the core zone of this region, bordering the Soviet Union. During this Third Front Development Era of China, several major factories of Harbin were relocated to Southwestern Provinces including Gansu, Sichuan, Hunan and Guizhou, where they would be strategically secure in the event of a possible war. Some major universities of China were also moved out of Harbin, including Harbin Military Academy of Engineering (predecessor of Changsha's National University of Defense Technology) and Harbin Institute of Technology (Moved to Chongqing in 1969 and relocated to Harbin in 1973).\n\nNational economy and social service have obtained significant achievements since the Chinese economic reform first introduced in 1979. Harbin holds the China Harbin International economic and Trade Fair each year since 1990. Harbin once housed one of the largest Jewish communities in the Far East before World War II. It reached its peak in the mid-1920s when 25,000 European Jews lived in the city. Among them were the parents of Ehud Olmert, the former Prime Minister of Israel. In 2004, Olmert came to Harbin with an Israeli trade delegation to visit the grave of his grandfather in Huang Shan Jewish Cemetery, which had over 500 Jewish graves identified.On 5 October 1984, Harbin was designated a sub-provincial city by the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee. The eight counties of Harbin originally formed part of Songhuajiang Prefecture whose seat was practically located inside the urban area of Harbin since 1972. The prefecture was officially merged into Harbin city on 11 August 1996, increasing Harbin's total population to 9.47 million.Harbin hosted the third Asian Winter Games in 1996. In 2009, Harbin held the XXIV Winter Universiade.\nA memorial hall honoring Korean nationalist and independence activist Ahn Jung-geun was unveiled at Harbin Railway Station on 19 January 2014. Ahn assassinated four-time Prime Minister of Japan and former Resident-General of Korea It\u014d Hirobumi at No.1 platform of Harbin Railway Station on 26 October 1909, as Korea on the verge of annexation by Japan after the signing of the Eulsa Treaty. South Korean President Park Geun-Hye raised an idea of erecting a monument for Ahn while meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to China in June 2013. After that China began to build a memorial hall honoring Ahn at Harbin Railway Station. As the hall was unveiled on 19 January 2014, the Japanese side soon lodged protest with China over the construction of Ahn's memorial hall.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHarbin, with a total land area of 53,068 km2 (20,490 sq mi), is located in southern Heilongjiang province and is the provincial capital.

The cuisine of Harbin consists of European dishes and Northern Chinese dishes mainly typified by heavy sauce and deep-frying.One of the most famous dishes in Northeastern Chinese cuisine is Guo Bao Rou, a form of sweet and sour pork. It is a classic dish from Harbin which originated in the early 20th century in Daotai Fu (pinyin: D\u00e0ot\u00e1i F\u01d4). It consists of a bite-sized pieces of pork in a potato starch batter, deep-fried until crispy. They are then lightly coated in a variation of a sweet and sour sauce, made from freshly prepared syrup, rice vinegar, sugar, flavoured with ginger, cilantro, sliced carrot and garlic. The Harbin Guobaorou is distinct from that of other areas of China, such as Liaoning, where the sauce may be made using either tomato ketchup or orange juice. Rather the Harbin style is dominated by the honey and ginger flavours and has a clear or honey yellow colour. Originally the taste was fresh and salty. In order to fete foreign guests, Zheng Xingwen, the chef of Daotai Fu, altered the dish into a sweet and sour taste. Usually, people prefer to go to several small or middle size restaurants to enjoy this dish, because it is difficult to handle the frying process at home.Demoli Stewed Live Fish is one among other notable dishes in Harbin, which is originated in a village named Demoli on the expressway from Harbin to Jiamusi.

        "wiki": "Tourist attractions or scenic areas rated as AAAAA (5A) are the most important and best-maintained tourist attractions in the People's Republic of China, given the highest level in the rating categories used by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. As of 2020, there are 279 tourist attractions listed as 5A.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origins of the rating system for tourist attractions are based on criteria first set out in 1999 by the China National Tourism Administration (predecessor to the current Ministry of Culture and Tourism) and revised in 2004. The criteria includes quality and management factors like ease of transportation links, site safety, cleanliness, etc. and also takes into account the uniqueness and recognition of the sightseeing offering. Tourist attractions were graded according to the criteria on a scale initially from  A to AAAA with AAAAA or 5As added on later as the highest rating. A group of 66 tourist attractions were certified as the first set of AAAAA rated tourist attractions in 2007. The first batch included many of the most iconic historical sites in China including the Forbidden City and Summer Palace. Additional batches of additional sites have been added including 20 new 5A sites in February 2017. On rare occasions a few locations have been downgraded from the highest rating category for deficiencies in visitor experience.\n\n\n== List ==\n\n\n== Downgrading ==\nTourist sites found deficient by the China National Tourism Administration (merged into the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in 2018) have lost their 5A accreditation due to deficiencies in visitor experience. In 2015, Shanhai Pass in Hebei was the first tourist site to be downgraded from 5A. The next wave of downgrading occurred in 2016 with the removal of Orange Isle in Hunan and Shenlong Gorge in Chongqing for \"security concerns, overpricing, poor environmental management and poor facility maintenance, as well as bad service mainly resulting from a lack of staff members.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of protected areas of China\nList of national parks of China\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nComplete list of AAAA tourist attractions (Chinese) at the website of the central government of the People's Republic of China",

          "This event is spectacular, we went with our 12 year old son. He was equally amazed ,apart from the various structures there was numerous slopes for tobogganing and other means of getting down the slope. We arraigned through our concierge tickets and transport so for us getting",

          "Have you got some warm undies? Have you already bought shoe warmers, really solid cap, perhps a ski mask? If so you are ready for Tai Yang Dao because it will take you some time there. The price for an adult is 260 rmb, you may think a bit steep but it's worth it as there is a",
          "Highly recommended place. I would recommend to take the cable car to go there. Nice surrounding within a forest kind area. Have a look at the pictures",
          "I was there during winter in December and the area was filled with ice and snow sculptures of smaller scale compared to the ones at the Harbin Ice and snow expo. The sculptures are mainly for competition and some are very nice and some just average. A good reminder is the",
          "Sun Island constitutes a lot of green but it\u2019s basically an island park with umpteen different sections, nothing particularly flash. The waterfall however was an attractive feature and it was fun to walk through the cave under it. The boat from Taiyangdao Wharf costs \u00a535 per",
          "Amazing cool place so beautiful, clean and proper arrange..I will like to visit it again and again thank so much",

          "You can go to Sun Island via cable car (expensive), boat from Zhongyang Pedestrian Street (2 yuan per trip), or by road via taxi. Entrance to the island is free, but you will have to pay for activities (e.g. pedal boat). Sun Island is divided into different areas, where you can",
          "We took the cable car ride across to the island. I would suggest paying for the cart to take you from place to place as this would be an all day excursion if you walked it. Nothing special here to see. In terms of things to do, not on the top of the list.",

          "It is a park. Nothing to see during winter. Only an ice exhibition with ticket entrance. We choose not to go. We were told by the reception staff that summer is more suitable and more activities than winter season. Visited on Dec 2018.",
          "Sun Island is the island across the river from Harbin and in the summer months is a nice park with walks and the perfect place to picnic...but in winter it is home to the Harbin ice and snow festival parks. The island is accessible by road or cablecar (or walking across the",
          "The main attractions are snow sculptures, but the park is filled with other fun activities. I love the bicycle on ice the best.",
          "Sun island is a lovely place to walk around in the spring, summer and autumn, less so in the winter when the trees are without leaves. At the weekend it does get busy, I strongly advise to visit mid week. Ideal for a picnic.",
          "Besides the cold weather, to see the sculptures it was amazing. You need 3 hours to do the ice sculptures alone. So plan you time well. We took the cable car over to the island, I suggest buying only a one way ticket. And physical walk across the river back it is frozen and so",
          "The indoor ice sculptures are in a small building within the grounds of the snow sculptures on Sun Island (Tai Yang Dao). You enter through the same gate but you need a separate ticket. There was a person with a sign in Chinese who leads people to that attraction. It's further",

          "We got the cable car over, but when we went into park we were so disappointed as a lot of the snow sculptures had started to melt, well that's what we think as you could not make out what a lot of them where meant to be, they were all very clever but not worth the 300 yuan,",
          "The International Snow Sculpting Exhibition/Contest was amazing and the Ice and Snow Festival was unbelievable",
          "Plenty of space for strolling around and admiring the many snow sculptures. Many created by local school students. There are fun ice slides for no additional charge, just a small returnable deposit for the plastic sled.",
          "The Snow Carving Exhibition has to be seen to be believed. One wonders how they can make such massive sculptures some of which dwarf people standing in front of them; particularly the enormous beautifully formed faces. In addition there are many snow activities including",

          "While I would recommend the Ice and Snow Festival before the snow carving at Sun Island (if you could only visit one of them) the snow carving here is amazing too. All we saw at Sun Island was the snow carving (we didn\u2019t tour all of the other attractions) and it was great.",
          "When we first arrived I was concerned that we would not be able to fill a couple of hours, having arrived on the cable car. However when we discovered all the free activities - slides, rides etc in amongst gorgeous snow sculptures we were competely won over. A fun day out!",
          "Sun island is probably main attraction during winter in Harbin. It is not literally an island, it is just an area in the northern part of Harbin (north of Song Hua river). People usually come to see giant ice and snow sculptures on the playground on a frozen lake. I am just",
          "We took the cable car over and visited Polar world. There are buggy transport on the island for RMB 20 round trip. As it was winter we walked back across the Songhua River. Neat experience.",

          "I've never thought I would see the castles and sculptures bigger than houses made of snow, and yet the people of Harbin do this every year! The disappointing part of the visit to the park was that they charged full price, but none of the slides or snow games were open yet",

I disagree, the snow sculptures are a different dynamic and also impressive. The sculptures are incredible. There is one of the",
          "This is in fact not really an island. Many tourist spots are located here so movement between various locations are relatively easy. Many of the tourist attractions are average. Good to kill time but not really having the WOW Factor.",
          "Amazing to see what people can do with snow! We visited the park at the end of february and it was nice and quiet. Most of the sculptures were still in a very good shape and we enjoyed walking around in the park and taking a ride on a sledge on the frozen lake. The easiest way",
          "we didn't enter because it was close at 5:00 pm roughly. We only took the cable car from sun island back to the city.",
          "It was nice and you can get around the entire island within 2 hours at most. The price was reasonable, but you need to pay for extra other attractions, such as the ice museum. It was the week before the golden week and there weren't that many people there. Good thing about that",
          "The sculptures are just amazing. Certain snow creations are massive and very detailed. Visited the festival in Jan 2018",
          "It's huge and really well maintained. Went in summer and it was a delight to visit such nice place. Fully recommended for nature loving people. Refreshing.",
          "sad. squirrel island has a few squirrels captive in a fake log where kids can feed them. a few chipmunks roam about. swan lake has a few decrepit looking birds laying about. there is a fake water fall though which you can walk behind through a fake cave.",
          "Yes, you can see Ice sculptures in June. It is held indoors at a constant 15 degrees C. For 180 RMB you get an entry ticket and winter jacket and pants. We spent just over an hour inside and really enjoyed our time.",
          "If there are places that are a must visit, then it is Sun Island while the ultimate place to visit is Harbin Ice and Snow World. Forget about the other ice and snow parks. They are small compared to these. We didnt get to enjoy the place much because it was just too darn",
          "The snow sculptures you can enjoy during the day so its not so cold. They are as good as the ice sculptures and you can't help marvel at how wonderfully they are made.",
          "This was a wonderful park showcasing some really nice snow sculptures. It looks so realistic. It a nice place to visit.",
          "From the entrance, you can ride the electric car to the sculpture area. In here there so many snow sculpture from around the world artist.in the afternoon around 5pm, there is a outdoor show with great lightning. There's a coffee shop here, so if you feel cold you can wait here,",
          "Very well arranged attraction with toilettes, a cafeteria and of course beautiful ice sculptures. The biggest sculptures are built along the iced lake. On the lake you may rent bikes and other unusual types of transport, making the visit funnier both for kids and adults. Close",
          "Fascinating display of ice sculptures entered into competition. Very different to the sort one might imagine - a Russian entry for example of a \"virgin bride\" .",
          "This is the part of Harbin's winter extravaganza that has large snow sculptures, and it is a separate (expensive!!!) ticket from the ice sculptures and buildings at Ice and Snow World. Plan on spending 1-2 hours there, and dress warmly. We went in January and most of the",
          "We visited for the Snow Sculpture Expo in January. We walked across the frozen river from the Flood Monument and then a short way along Sun Island. I recommend walking from the entrance to the middle of the expo where the large sculptures are rather than taking the car. You get",
          "This is what you come to Harbin to see. Beautiful park with many, many fantastic, and sometimes absolutely monumental sculptures. Take your breath away. A short road train takes you from the car park/visitor centre into the park itself then you walk around completely",
          "Sun Island (Tai Yang Dao), Harbin Ice and Snow World and Zhaolin Park are basically the main reason you visit Harbin in winter (well in our case anyway). There are also random ice sculptures scattered around the city to see for free (mostly on Zhongyang Pedestrian Street).",
          "It's 330\u00a5 (ish) no student discount unfortunately, but this was definitely my FAVOURITE place in Harbin. The snow sculptures are amazing and there are loads of snow activities to do, like hiring rubber dinghies to play in the ice on, and at the end if you keep walking there is a",
          "We went here during the day and lucked into a brilliant blue sky and lots of sun, under which to take in the beauty of these snow sculptures. The largest one this year was of a woman, playing a flute to a group of rams. It was incredible. So many of the smaller sculptures are",
          "There wasn't a lot of reviews or information on how to get your own way to Sun Island. You can take the cable car (not my thing) ; get a taxi; organise a private car / tour or walk there across the frozen lake. If you want to walk, it saves some money and is a bit of a novelty",
          "First of all the snow Sculpture entrance is either opposite Polarland or take the cable car across the river. The Sun Island is a big place, there are many warm places to stay and eat or drink if you are cold. The snow sculptures are just incredible. Go by day when the Sun gives",
          "Visited and its a great place to see huge large snow structures that is the size of a supermarket. Expect alot of walking and you will need about 3-4 hours if you are planning to do everything here. Pace yourself",
          "Whilst the lights of the Ice Festive are a big draw card the Sun Island Park is equally well worth the visit. Stunning ice sculptures and ice rink (frozen lake). If you head towards the back after the lake there is a free tyre tube slide which was not that busy and so much fun.",
          "We really enjoyed the time we spent at the snow sculptures. The scale is amazing, and other activities on slides etc to do as well. We spent about 3 hours in the end there, on a cold but gorgeous blue sky day. We organised a taxi from our hotel who took us there, and we agreed",
          "Can walk here across frozen river and wander the streets OR take a taxi to view the Snow Sculptures which were awesome. We had a brilliant blue sky day - lots of activities if you want.",
          "The Sun Island is defined as the second main venue of Harbin ice festival but it is less attractive than the famous Harbin Ice world. The uncomfortable location, high price and poor exposition - not recommended if you are short of time",
          "We visited on the coldest day of this winter so far and as we come from the sub tropics, we felt it! The small bus trip was welcome as it would have been a long walk without it. Toilets were welcome and very clean. The hunters lodge is worth going in to warm up if nothing else,",
          "We visited with our three kids, and enjoyed being there for about an hour and a half. Cost was around \u00a5300 each. We tried to get a taxi to take us there from the north end of the pedestrian street, but he seemed either unwilling or unable to take us there. We took the cable car",
          "The artwork that they make out of the blocks of snow is amazing. It was truly inspiring to walk through all the great works of art. I really enjoyed myself. No need to take the little bus from the gate to the main site - the walk isn't that far. There was also a free",
          "I stayed at the North Loong Hotel on Sun Island as part of a team that was participating in the International Ice Carving Competition. The room was really comfortable, though I personally would not use wood for the bathroom walls and floor (the shower did not have a separate",
          "We arrive at 4:00pm by walk through the ice river, its too late, all the shop is close and the sky is dark already. Very very closed and slient, difficult to get on a taxi. Better go at daytime.",
          "I visited on the 6th from around 10:00-11:00AM with my dad. We only had a bit of time before we had to catch our flight, so we had to hurry, but we were more than impressed with the beautiful snow sculptures the place had to show! Every sculpture was delicately made and I could",
          "I came to this place in the morning, rather quiet although official opening is a few days later. Displays are almost 90% ready except for one but there is a plus point. You get to see the workers carving the snow structures which is interesting. There is about 10",
          "Best visit in winter time when the snow festival is held. Amazing snow sculptures and great experience to see the wonderful snow and sculptures. Though the staffs in the park were rude but we enjoyed the experience and sights.",
          "We went in the winter but before the ice sculpture event. We were then when they were building the sculptures and it was quite cool to watch them create statues out of blocks of ice. Lovely place but wayyyy too cold. and the one building we went to, with the indoor ice",
          "We enjoyed the snow sculptures laid around Sun Island. It was clear they had encouraged many talents with some sculptures of amazing quality and some not quite so good. But hey, far better that I could make from snow! We enjoyed a couple of hours walking around, slid across the",
          "I'm jealous of everyone who has visited in the winter, but this place is nice in the opposite season as well. There's a paid part and a free part. Both are enjoyable. In the paid part there is tremendous variation for the themes and displays. The gardens are magnificent.",
          "An absolutely marvellous place to visit, the sculptures totally blow you away at their magnificent size and the atmosphere of the park is so free and easy, so easy to just wander and take it all in.",
          "Ticket price: 330 CNY (I bought at official ticket office) How to get there: Take bus number 47 from downtown and stop at TaiYangDaoDaoKou (\u592a\u9633\u5c9b\u9053\u53e3). When you get off the bus, there will be many taxi drivers and ubers offer to take you inside with 5 CNY or more. DO NOT TAKE THAT.",
          "Sun Island is situated in the north bank of the Songhua River in Harbin City. It is surrounded by blue water, rockeries and beautiful flowers park. I was there in mid September when the leaves of trees are still Green, but they say to visit the place in winter to enjoy Art Expo",
          "I preferred this over the Ice city. The snow carving requires artistic skill in what can only be described as numbingly cold temperatures. I was totally awestruck by the sizes and variety of the sculptures, the detail is extraordinary and photo's do not do justice to the",
          "This place is Incredible, no words to describe the magnificence of the art of ice sculptures. Its like they say, one of the things you have to see before you die.",
          "Very artistic ice sculptures of various sizes, from small to full size & opportunity to cuddle fox too.",
          "In spring or Autumn this park must be really nice to visit. However in summer it is too hot to visit in day time. There is no place to rest, very few benches to sit so you just have to keep walking. Ticket is 30 RMB for adult, children under 1.4 m is half. Ticket include entry",
          "We visited the 29th exhibition in Sun Island.Many snow sculptures of various sizes are displayed in this huge outdoor expo site.They ranged from massive to medium to standard size and height. We watch designers and sculptors chiseling and carving huge compacted snow block",
          "FANTASTIC PLACE TO VISIT. Take a taxi from town. There are many taxis there at the end of the time. Buy your crampons as you walk in the gate. Special price for Over 70s and foreigners. TAKE YOUR PASSPORT. We went 2 afternoons and nights. The ice buildings are impressive. The",
          "We came at the very end. Most were melted with new snow sitting on top. It was still interesting to see how massive it was. Grab a map and walk, no need for sightseeing bus unless you are tired. Bring your food and drink. Most food places were closed. We sat at the coffee",
          "Feb 2016. We arrived in day, better for ice sculpture pix along streets. Tram blows by all these so pointless. At night when streets lit they are really pretty to walk, tram again pointless. You walk along street with regular sized ice sculptures, a few large, turn left and",
          "This place is separate from the night ice festival that is lit up. We went here during the day and the snow sculptures were equally amazing. The cold is brutal so wear multiple layers and be mentally prepared. Buy a trolley ticket upon entering the park, something like 20 yuan,",
          "Visited Sun Island for 90 minutes before the ice festival, definitely worth seeing. Wasn't sure beforehand what it was all about, but discovered the Ice festival is basically Ice sculptures whereas Sun Island is Snow sculptures and some of them are huge. So you should see both",
          "No tourist would miss this spot. Classy and beautiful. Prepare your camera for all scenic and fun clicks.",
          "We went during the day, which was great as you could walk around easily and see the sculptures well. Good to do this if you only have one full day, as you will probably want to go and see the Ice & Snow World in the evening when it is all lit up.",
          "We went to see the snow sculptures and were not disappointed. From 3 metre cubes to 18 metre monoliths with complete 70 metre building facia and a princesses castle they were great. Well spread out and a pleasant 3 hour walk to catch them all. For the kids there is a very",
          "Totally different to anything we have ever seen before. A must visit while in Harbin over the Ice Festival.",
          "It's again a must visit place in Harbin ... ice and snow world is made up of ice cubes big structures in contrast this is made up of snow ... we took cable car there from down town that took for round trip 80 rmb and then Bus round trip 10 rmb per person ... the entry ticket",
          "So many different areas within this park. A long day to get around it all, but definitely worth it. The ice sculptures are worth a visit, so clever. We visited a couple of times in our 2.5 week visit to harbin.",
          "Tips: Go behind the child type huge snow sculpture and walk up the stair to the very top of the hill, it's an amazing view. Also, rather than taxi back I highly advise crossing by the river. It's cold but the view and scenery is amazing.",
          "Not bad, a lot of flovers, beautiful place to relax, we rented a boat 120 RMB for a 5 person for a 40 minutel. Dont look a price inside, ask about discount! This is China! Just discount Reccomen tp visit this place may-september (a lot of flower there) Minus is that there are",
          "The only thing that I will add to the many reviews are this, be prepared for extreme conditions. It's harsh being in Harbin but it's almost dangerous in Sun Island. At least in the city, there are many tall buildings that chop the wind down but in Sun island, you are totally",
          "This was a nice afternoon walk-around-the-park style thing for us. We slid down some slides, wandered around the snow sculptures, climbed up the little man-made hill on the far side of the pond.. It was pleasant. We didn't do any of the extra money ice sports, but we still",
          "This was an extra tour, added to the Ice Frestival, and to tell you the truth, I thought it was even better. The size and complexity of the carvings are staggering. A must see.",
          "After our experience with the ice sculptures we were prepared for wow...but this surpassed our expectations in every way. The snow sculpture exhibition is unbelievable. The venue was easy to get to (especially with help from a friendly stranger) and very easy to get around.",
          "Though having travelled a lot all over the world this was something outstanding and special! the huge area is covered with very impressing snow scultpures, you can do some funny ice-sports on the frozen lake, and for handicapped there is even a shuttle going to the most",
          "It took us 20 min drive from Central Boulevard to Sun Island. We paid 240 rmb pee adult to our drivers who got us tickets without queuing. We arrived at about 3.30 pm and the crowd was almost gone. We saw some activities on the frozen Song hua river - fun rides on tyres where",
          "Place to go for the snow sculptures, I would recommend to visit this place during the morning or early afternoon and plant to go to then to the Ice and Snow World at around 16:00. I would say it takes about 3 hrs to visit the whole place at normal pace, no rush, cost is 240cny",
          "We were really impressed at the snow sculptures in Sun Island park. They were so big and very detailed. Well worth a visit; the park is the most expensive snow sculpture exhibition in the city but for good reason.",
          "It's really unbelievable to see such fine work - indeed impressive and amazing! Day was beautiful, sunny and not too cold, -11C, so one could take a good stroll around, take perfect pictures with blue sky!",
          "When in Harbin, you must also go to Sun Island aside from Ice and Snow World. They showcase a different type of ice sculptures with more detail. It's a huge place so you'd probably spend about 3 hours in the area. We visited this place in the afternoon but people told us it's",
          "The Ice World which we had visited at night was brilliantly lighted with coloured bulbs but then, there wasn't much of a surprise this time round as nothing seemed special as compared to previous years which I have seen lots of past pictures before this visit. The only thing",
          "We visited the Sun Island Park in a fine but cold afternoon. At about -20C it was bitingly cold. The snow sculptures are truly impressive. The stroll around the sizeable park was pleasant. We managed to spend 1.5 hrs in the park after a hot drink in a cafe that had a mock up",
          "I guess it's a must when in Harbin, but don't expect anything amazing. There's a beautiful view of the Harbin skyline from there, which is pretty impressive, some ice statues..yeah, other than that not much..",
          "Excellent shows of snow sculpture. Place were clean with many toilet facilities. A must see I will say.",
          "The park is huge - had 3 stages - so you need to allow a couple of hours at least. If you can't or don't want to walk, there are small trams which drive you around cost 20 yuan. The paths are very slippery so take care walking. There are many snow sculptures which are part of",
          "The ice and snow sculptures range in size from car-sized to massive buildings. There are additional attractions like ice slides (that require an additional fee). The site includes cafes and restaurants. Is quite a large site so some walking is required. There is a tram that can",
          "We spent 4 hours here thinking that this is the main attraction in harbin, not realising that it is different from ice and snow world. anyway, we had no regrets spending some time at the playground here, It was not very crowded. rented a sliding board for CNY30/hour to go down",
          "This year it seems that the park cut the expense though each ticket is 280 yuan .The scale is smaller and the work looks not beautiful.",
          "This is well worth the effort for anyone travelling to Harbin. It is a beautiful island with plenty of attractions and points of historical and cultural significance.",
          "The most spectacular display in ice that I\u02bbve ever seen...much more than I imagined it would be. The trip began in the city of Dalian and got progressively colder till ending up in Harbin...this tour was well worth the price!",
          "Now its the best to enjoy the winter in north of China. We really enjoyed our days in Harbin, especially at the Sun Island. We will go there for the Harbin International Snow Sculpture Art Expo next time to enjoy enthralling ice and snow sculptures and architectures.",
          "The snow sculptures are huge and stunning... the place itself is also huge and stunning. I stole a weekend from a business trip to come to Harbin on a whim... turns out it was the best weekend I have ever spent as a sightseer. If you are in China in the Winter, it's worth",
          "This is a very picturesque garden surrounded by water. The artificial waterfall is quite majestic. There is also a swan pond nearby. There is a squirrel island too.",
          "This is a separate island where you can explore nature and also lots of shops of course. You have an option to walk or ride their carts with specific stops in some areas. There are lots of activities in the area like boating, amusement park, feeding the fish, feeding the",
          "We caught one of the ferries shuttling across the river and hen Tom the trolley bus to the park entrance, we decided to walk round as it was a pleasant sunny afternoon. We then took the trolley bus back to Russian street and bought our Russian passports tickets to enter the",
          "This park offers very different leisure activities for for anybody regardless of age, single or groups, interests. You can walk and take it in or you can hire the trolleys to take you around from place to place. The scenery differs from, park to lake, and offers different",
          "There were not many people visiting sun island in the month of December. Most of the ice sculptures were up, but they were still doing the ice and snow sculptures when we were there. Some of the sculptures were magnificent, but some were so-so. There is an ice sculpture area, so",
          "A lot of beautiful flowers, different kind of parks and cool statues. The area is wide enough not to make it too crowded. Do not get confused that also the area with no entrance fee (both sides of the bridges) are called Sun Island. The park is on the eastern side and Polar",
          "Although it had rained a multitude put back the ice blocks used to create the frozen city in half a day. I would recommend staying in Harbin 3 days at least in case the weather shuts this event down for a day.",
          "Locals told us it wasn't worth coming to this place. Glad we didn't listen to them. We took a taxi to the here. Once you enter the park the walkway is lined with snow sculptures done by college students which were somewhat underwhelming. Once you get further in the park then it",
          "This is one of the best and most popular place to visit during the Harbin festival in February each year. I would recommend to explore high rise sculptures and iced structures of people, animals, ships, any many many others. It's worth visiting this place.",
          "Probably had insufficient time to do the the place justice. Enjoyed the Russian village and the boat trip over. Nice park, good place to visit.",
          "I visited the park in late December (xmas), a couple of days before the official opening, so some of the structures were still under construction. however most of the sculptures and some of the slides were already open. overall it's a beautiful site and would be perfect for any",
          "I visited sun island on a Saturday in May. It is pretty crowded. I went to the Russian park which is nothing special. The entrance ticket is like a passport. You can get visa stamps by visiting all the shops in the park. The only foreign looking individuals are the one at the",
          "There is a lot to see here, and the sculptures are so detailed, its easy to stay still for too long and get a bit cold. But you can take your time, as there are lots of little sheds set up selling hot drinks. We would walk around for 30 to 60 minutes, then head inside to warm",
          "The architecture remains Russian and Russian songs are played everywhere. This street is famous for locals, with shops and Western restaurants. However nothing else special and interesting, it disappointed me a bit because i expected something more than historical value/",
          "Go accross the SongHua river by fery or you can grab a taxi (it cost 25RMB) Fyi you must buy the ticket at the official ticket counter and or you will get scam becuase you buy the fake ticket. After you arrive to the islannd you still need to buy the enterance ticket to the",
          "Got to the park by cable car - nice view of snowy Songhua river. The snow sculptures were so beautiful. I spent almost 7 hours in this park. Must visit ...",
          "I'd seen the photos but nothing prepared me for how amazing (& big) the snow buildings and sculptures were - fabulous! Cold? Below freezing - you need many layers...",
          "Since I was on the tour to Harbin to see the Ice Festival, I didn't realize there was a separate area of similar size dedicated to snow sculptures. This is a pretty big deal here. To get the compacted snow they need to create these exhibits, they have to use artificial snow",
          "Definitely a must see in Harbin and one of the best attraction for a winter tour in China. Some of the sculptures are about your height, others are gigantic, but all are simply amazing. The details on some of the statues is unbelievable. It is not as big the Ice and snow world,",
          "This is the place to go to view snow sculptures in Harbin. Unfortunately when we went there in late February 2016, some of the exhibits already melted thus become deformed/misshaped. I guess the optimal time to visit will be in January when the sculptures are still freshly",
          "This is the opposite of Ice and Snow world in Harbin. This park is open from the day until evening, where the later it open in the evening for the lightning of its park. Many activities to do in the park, and there is a tram to take you to different part of the park. From small",
          "This place is on the North bank of the river (and on the opposite side to the city) near Harbin Ice and Snow World, which we visited the night before and was somewhat disappointing as many of the sculptures had badly melted and the place was scruffy. Although some of the",
          "Large and smaller scale ice sculptures, ice lanterns, slides, shops and little houses of the old northern China rural village. Go there a couple of hours before sun set to enjoy the snow sculpture then wait for the lights to come up and the fireworks. There are ice lanterns",
          "As most people will only visit this attraction during winter it is essential to be properly clothed while walking around the many hectares of displays; our guess is that we walked well over 3km covering all the displays. Everything is well laid out with many signs in English",
          "This is a favorite picnic spot in the Summer, but is home to the International Snow Sculpture Art Expo in the winter. There are separate areas for students, all-China, international, and large sculptures. It is similar to the separately held (at another site) Ice Sculpture",
          "Went 6 years ago and had more snow.However the park is now bigger and a bit more interactive and the snow sculpture even more impressive than before.Price at 240 Yuan is a lot more than the 100 Yuan 6 years ago..............",
          "Feb 6 Sun Island is the site of the international snow carving competition among students. Our Hotel Kempinski is nearby. You can choose to walk or take the tram to see the hundred or so snow sculptures, both big and small. All are creative and imaginative. The tram makes",
          "In the pictures it can look like nothing nice, but you have to go there and see it by yourself. Sculptures made of snow are as much impressive as the ice one. I strongly recommend you to go there, especially in the sunny day.",
          "The slides here are well worth the price of entry - rent a plastic toboggan for an hour for 30RMB and then bolt down the slopes. Actually, save yourself the 30RMB and just watch everyone else doing it.",
          "It was memorable visit, we enjoyed alot, there was some agents working to sale tickets with a little less price than normal I.e. 240rmb they offered 200 but we were not sure about so we did not purchased ticket through agent. We enjoyed alot by walking. There was gift items shop",
          "It was a sunny but cold day and the best way to see the artwork. We went the week of CNY and the crowds were small and manageable. We walked casually around the park which is very spread out and with lunch and a little shopping, it took us 4.5 hours as we wanted to see",
          "We went there around 11 am and it was not full and very quite. Most of the tourists are locals. Fantastic place with hundreds of snow and ice figures. There is a cafe where you can drink Chinese traditional green tee with sweet pop corn.",
          "Very small and not so many sculptures. 330rmb for adults and 160rmb for children, but you still have to pay for enjoying some rides inside. There are no taxis at the exit so we had to wait a lot and finally pay an excessive amount to go back to our hotel. The Ice and snow",
          "While we went during the day and did not witness any lights... This place was better than Ice & Snow World (IMO). Again, truly amazing on how these sculptures are developed. Very clean park environment as the setting. Open taxis, at a fee, if you get tired of walking. And",
          "The snow sculptures were outstanding!! From the very large carvings to the wonderfully detailed student carvings we were amazed. If it was just a bit warmer we would have stayed longer to play on the ice. Just a note if you are going, it is cheaper to go at night and children",
          "The time is must take to produce these but be enormous. Some are very high and others are just so cute.",
          "The snow sculptures were just amazing, just for your info the whole park is not used during the ice & snow festival.... only a part of it is used to display the sculptures, so not a good idea to buy the bus tickets as you will not use it.... I never did. Also, as many people",
          "Go to Harbin, even for just the Snow Sculptures, but the Ice Sculptures, Tiger Sanctuary and more makes this trip worthwhile. The Snow sculptures are Huuuge (do I hear Donald Trump?), just fantastic. Not to be missed.",
          "Incredible, you have to keep asking yourself if this is really snow?! Hit the park close to sunset, the lighting is amazing! Was worth it to take the little shuttle bus up, you can only stay out so long in these temps.",
          "duno, maybe just a personal preference, i like this park. huge and with better scenery of snow carving and snow structure. it was more interesting than just ice structure only place.",
          "Nymphs, animals, figures from Chinese legends, monumental castles, galleons, English fortresses: it's all here in China's most stunning display of ice and snow sculpture workmanship.",
          "During the International Snow & Ice Festival you can see amazing snow sculptures. There are so many in varying shapes and sizes that it is difficult to see them all.",
          "beyond words to see these amazing sculptures . I was blown away by the level of detail, and all in snow!",
          "This is where all the main winter attractions are situated. Lots of space. Wide boulevards for traffic.Not to be missed.",
          "Be sure to swing by and check out the Russian products. They're do charge 10 RMB if you take a photo of anyone, but they have a good selection. We picked up a nesting doll, some Russian chocolate, and Russian bread. The passport stamp collecting is fun as well.",
          "We took the cable car over (80\u00a5 return) and had a great day. Dress very warm - it is extremely cold. You can hire a sled for the slides at 30\u00a5 per hour plus 100\u00a5 deposit. Incredible sculptures and a great variety. One was over 100m long. Bring snacks. 240\u00a5 each entry but worth",
          "I loved this attraction! We chose to take the bus to the main area at the top of the park and this meant we could spend more time admiring the huge sculptures around the area. The attention to detail is fabulous and the snow is carved to reveal characters clearly. The frozen",
          "Fantastic snow sculptures lining the lanes. There were also some ice sculptures, and a small play area with short and long slides. I elected not to take the tour bus, as that allowed me to see each sculpture along the road.",
          "This place is near the polar aquarium. In the trip advisor site, it says it only opens until 5pm but they extend to have night trips in the park. The snow sculptures will be lit up and there is a very nice fireworks display around 6pm China time by the snow castle.",
          "This is best to see during the day. There are some really long and curvy Ice Slides down from castles that are pretty fast. Everyone seemed to enjoy the ice slides and climbing the sculptures. It is super cold, wear full winter gear and have heat packs for hands and feet. The",
          "We had a fantastic time at Sun Island! Take advantage of the shuttle bus to get around - minimize walking time and maximize time having fun! We appreciated all the amazing snow sculptures but the highlight for us traveling with school-age kids was the ice slides! Dress warmly",
          "We arrive around 10.00 and we were there for 3 hours. It was our first experience in Harbin so we love it!! We were at minus 28! so be prepared. We enjoy slides without queue for few rmb they asked for a 200 RMB deposit for a snowwheel. No queue even was Saturday morning. The",
          "The Sun Island Snow Park is really impressive. Though shadowed by the nearby Ice Festival, the Snow Park is cheaper and offers not only snow but also a few ice sculptures. The tourist center offers Chinese cuisine and Russian souvenirs.",
          "Visited with my family a clear and very cold December day (-25 deg C). We were lucky that the sun was shining and pollution was low this day so we could see all the snow sculptures sparkle in the sunshine. Some of them are really huge. In all is was an impressive experience",
          "My friends and I are students studying here in China and they have absurd rules to the pay process here. They make their own rules as they go. But rather than being helpful they laugh and just talk in Chinese (even we all understand Chinese). Maybe a tourist attraction but the",
          "While I'm certain this park is amazing year round, I went during the snow festival, which was incredible. Giant snow sculptures, interesting little shops, and lots of fun on the frozen river. Large parts of the park were closed off (probably to keep people near the snow part",
          "This is truly a great place to visit in Harbin, so enjoyable! Some tips: - Shoe spikes and heat pads will be of great help (I use the Mannings heat pads that I bought before the trip, it is much better than the ones sold on the street) - Pay attention to your toes and fingers",
          "This is a beautiful place for all year round. Of course the best time to visit is winter during the Ice and Snow Festival. After you visit/walk in Stalin Park you should take the Ropeway and come to Sun Island a walk next to the river seeing also the Russian Style buildings, a",
          "Get ready to walk around a lot as you would want to take picture with all the sculptures, and there are plenty! The Biggest ones are really stunning. Rent a sled for an hour (30 RMB) and make sure to get a few runs! Recommend to visit during the day and see it around 5pm during",
          "To get there walk along the riverside towards the cable car, and look for where people walk across the river (or take the cable car 80yuan return or 50yuan one way). Once across keep walking on the road that leads inland and you will come across the entrance to the snow world.",
          "This was such a great thing to see. Will never forget it and well worth the travel to see this. Amazing artists.",
          "So much to see despite the very cold weather. Good thing they have transportation (for a fee) inside.",
          "I went before all the sculptures have been completed. but even then, i came away very awed. The sculptures are larger than life and all very detailed and intricately made. just a word of caution, the ice surface where the majority of the ice sculptures are is very slippery.",

          "The park is large and one should take the trolley around and get the most out of it. The ice sculpture inside the building was great to see and should be a must on the list if you go to the park. Nice to walk around as well and take in all the different attractions. There were",
          "It's important to visit here i) in the daytime and ii) before visiting the Ice Festival, otherwise its attraction will be impaired. It's relatively pricey, but definitely worth it to view all the beautiful intricacies in the carving. I can imagine it being underwhelming at",

          "Sun Island Park\u2014the venue for the famous ice carving festival. Battery operated trolley cars are available to take the visitors around but a lot of people walked too. The park is basically a nice place to stroll around and have fun in the water slides.",
          "This park has beautiful snow sculptures that are truly amazing. You walk through a very large park at your own pace. Come during the daytime to visit and take a taxi to get here as walking on the river seems insane. We visited here and then had our taxi driver continue to the",
          "The snow sculptures are majestic! Best to go here with a lot of time to spare, as it is fun to have some rest breaks at the cafes or coffee nooks scattered around the park. We tried the dog-pulled sleds, but that was only for one short loop. Sunset here was picturesque.",

          "Beautiful and breathtaking snow sculpture with all sort of shapes size and also cartoon character too",

          "To visit earlier else, the sculpture does not look good. When were went there in mid-Feb, some parts were melting. And the colour of sculptures looked a bit \"dirtied\". Overall, this place is a little over-rated.",

          "One of the best and sunny island in the world!!) Visited in the summer: Aug 2011. Absolutely loved the fresh air and the atmosphere in which I stayed at. Russian restaurants offered some of the most delicious and decorative foods! This is heaven for me and MY HOME TOWN--HAERBIN!!",
          "The snow sculpture festival is amazing. Certain sculptures are huge and massive. We visited the expo on a very sunny day, perfect to take beautiful pictures. The night before some snow has covered the statues, all the powder snow was been removed by the staff of the park. It\u2019s",
          "This is definitely worth a visit if you are in Harbin. The sculptures are amazing. We enjoyed the walk through the park in the day and then walked back across the river to our hotel. A must see if you are in Harbin!",

          "The Harbin ice sculptures are better known, but the snow sculptures in a nearby location are equally spectacular. These are best seen in the daytime (they do not have the internal illumination that is possible with the ice sculptures). Suggest visit Snow sculptures from 1-4 pm,",
          "Enjoyed the visit, got to see the sculptures and walk around the park. It took about 2 hours. There are sleigh rides and slides, but did not partake in these attractions - kids would love them.",
          "As others have said, plan to go to Sun Island during the day and the Ice and Snow Amusement World at night if you are here during the ice festival . You will cover a fair amount of ground if you want to see everything on foot, so consider the pollution level if you have more",
          "To clarify: Sun Island is where both the Ice & Light Festival and the Snow Sculpture Park is. They are far from each other - you cannot walk. You don't need more than 2-3 hours (each) to do both. The bathroom situation is terrifying (by US standards, typical by CN tourist",
          "OMG it only exists because it's sub-zero; but you knew that, right? So it's cold walking round this giant park. but on a clear blue day with no breeze, it's a great walk in the park. The snow sculptures change every year and they range from professional to university students.",
          "Sun Island was amazing. So different to the ice sculptures we'd seen the night before, but still a must see. If you happen to be there when some cartoon characters come out to dance, make sure you join in. It's a lot of fun for people of all ages. If its gets too cold, there",
          "Loved the slide they have there, and the various activities for everyone. Thank God for their golf car that took me around.",
          "The white snow sculptures were fantastic. Some were stories high, and some were almost hands-on. On a beautiful day, the white snow and blue sky are a perfect combination. Bring extra batteries for your camera! If you wanna walk less, cuz the park is somewhat big, pay $20 for a",
          "I rate the snow sculptures at Sun Island the BEST I've seen and going there during the Ice Festival is a MUST. Allow yourself at least a couple of hours to take in all the beautiful snow NOT ice sculptures at this site. Allow even more time is you can withstand the cold but",

          "We visited during winter in January. Pleasant walk during the morning. It was sunny. Amazing huge snow sculptures. Beautiful snowy view for a nice stroll around the park. Make sure you wear good shoes that is snow contact if not it might be slippery that you may fall. Prepare",
          "We went in late December and the artists were doing the finishing touches. Very creative and we really enjoyed it. Go during the daytime before it gets dark and of course dress warmly. Tip.... organise transport from your hotel for a return trip. Sure it will cost you but we",

          "There is a difference between snow sculpture and ice sculpture. This place is full of snow sculptures. Certainly interesting if you have necen seen one before, like me. Worth a visit. Make sure you dress warmly. It is like walking in an area colder than your freezer all the",

          "The snow sculptures were amazing with many different styles - from Disney rip-offs to comteporary art. All the other attractions such as the slides, dog sleds were a lot extra in terms of money and really not worth it. It is very very cold as you are on a frozen pond - wear",

          "The size of the sculptures are truly amazing. As well as the intricacy in the carving. We did take the trolley bus to get from the entrance to the farthest point, and then walked back in stages. The husky sled ride is a rip-off ... too short ... just for a short circuit. You pay",
          "all under construction or closed, the locals try to charge you double or triple the normal price, if i didn't speak chinese i would have been ripped off really badly. the russian show on the island is really embarrisingly bad and they torture crocodiles making them dance and",
          "On our trip to Harbin we went to the Sun Island Snow Park in the daytime and the Ice Festival at night. The snow sculptures are massive. Most are larger than 3 story houses. The fine details in the carvings are absolutely amazing.",
          "A very large park with electric carts and bicycles - for a fee - to get around. many interesting section. We spent time at the Sun Waterfall which is man made and has caves behind it. We fed the carp in the lake. It was very hot the day we were there and there is limited seating",
          "An enormous garden with loads of attractive spots. Nature, water, flowers... That's for the summer! It's also the venue for the famous ice festival in winter. We crossed the river via cable car, which was a great experience-not to be missed! As for the gardens after you arrive,",
          "Was blown away by the snow sculpture on display everything from tractors, to smurfs to presidents , even a hamburger all very lifelike. We visited on a very sunny but very cold January day but ~I loved this place. There was an opportunity to ice carve but this may have been",
          "This is a large & beautiful garden of 38sq km with many scenic spots. You need to travel in the electric tram from one spot to another to save your legs\u2019 energy and time. The main attraction spots are the Sun Water Fall, the Squirrel Island, the Clove Garden and the most",
          "We visited at the end of January when the snow sculptures were still in pristine condition. The area is large so be prepared for a fair bit of walking. There is a small caf\u00e9 inside which sells drinks & snacks but also provides free hot ginger tea and a seat! A bit of a",
          "We visited towards the end of feb - so not many people at sun island during the day. A lot of the ice sculptures had start to melt as well. Activities inside like ice buggies, slides ext.. (additional costs however). Good for a quick visit after the tiger park &/or polarland.",
          "Runs a clear second to the Harbin Ice and Snow World, but offers enough that is different to ensure you should see both. If you catch it on a snowy day it's also delightful, but sunny might be lovely too. It's a big area, so plenty of walking and it gets quite cold late",
          "The snow sculpture exhibition at Sun Island Park was the first Ice and Snow Festival component we visited upon arriving in Harbin. By itself it's beautiful by most standards - although if you visited towards the tail-end of the festival like we did, many of the snow sculptures",
          "This place actually consists of lots of amusement place in Harbin such as Snow and Ice Festival, Heilongjiang Science and Technology Museum, and Polarland. Definitely have to spend one full day to come here and you probably should decide first where would you go since it's",
          "I was super excited to see the snow sculptures but it was kind of a let down. My 3 year old got bored really fast, so that made the rest of the day hard. The sculptures are all spread way out, so it makes it harder to see it all.",
          "We were there during the Snow and Ice Festival. Two of the three festival venues are on the island - Snow and Ice World and in the Sun Island Scenic Area is the Snow Sculpture Expo. The area is really beautiful with lots of trees, the wide river and plenty for nature lovers. See",

          "This is one of the must-see attractions if visiting harbin in winter. There are heaps of snow sculptures, ranging in size from the height of a person, to huge monumental pieces dozens of meters high. The best way to view the sculptures is by walking around the park. There",
          "This attraction has many snow statues (some gigantic) and many little larger-than-life ice statues. There is a lot of walking in this park, alternatively, a driver can be hired. This is a daylight attraction only; the park closes at 5pm. They turn on the lights at some snow",
          "Great place to spend some time during the day, there are activities, many snow sculptures, if you go around sunset, best views, then walk to the Ice show, great day out.",
          "Wonderful Island with many fantastic from snow carved figures. It is worthwhile in any case to visit this exhibition if you are in Harbin.",
          "This is a lovely and relaxed area, with the truly amazing snow sculptures made by locals and teams from around the world. I had seen photos before going, but until you see them in person, the size and detail of the carvings just can't be appreciated. Incredible.",
          "This is a stunning experience. The snow sculptures are amazing, and far more attractive and interesting than the over-crowded and somewhat tacky Ice World. Go in the day time and allow several hours. Also, don't miss the 'Ethnic Village Museum' located just beyond the very",

          "We were trying to figure out how to get to the island\u2026 A guy we asked said you need to hire a car/cab over, or walk across the river. We thought he was joking! We found the cable car and paid 260RMB which includes the entrance fee to the island site where the sculptures were",
          "Lots of interesting exhibits. It's like an art show outside in sub-freezing temperature! They do have dog sleds, snow mobiles, skiing and snow slides if you like that. Take the 10Y ($1.50) bus. It's worth it.",
          "The snow sculptures were worth every effort to see. We were amazed at the size and intricacy and beautiful portrayal of huge life forms and even architecture. These artists are very talented. It is very cold though. I wore 6 layers, including 3 pairs of thermal socks,",
          "Snow carvings are large and impressive. Few other activities available like dog sleds but we didn't do any of these. 200RMB for entry. Only open until 4pm. If you are in Harbin during winter you should make the trip here.",
          "In December, the park will have exhibition for the snow sculpture, while this one is very interesting, the fee a bit expensive (240 RMB), there are a lot of snow sculpture from as small as statue to as big as castle. If you plan to go to Harbin Amusement, i will say you can skip",
          "We were here for the snow carvings in winter. This place is massive and so are some of the carvings. Leave plenty of time to have a good look around. Amazing displays by people from all over the world, it's such a pity they all melt in the end.",
          "You have to go up close to get a sense of how huge the snow sculpture was and the amount of work and planning to get the done up. The brochures do not do justice to some of the completed work.",
          "We really enjoyed our time at the park, the sculptures are truly breathtaking. I only wish we could have spent more time here. Also they were still building a lot of the sculptures so I would go in January rather than in late December. Still very glad to have visited. The main",
          "Alot of things to see! Dogs pulling sledges, slides, ice skating. Just so many activities to pass ur time. Also people watch and see how the locals pass their time here! Very enjoyable. Also see the igloos that were carved just for this period.",
          "when night pass this place is best thing to visit in sunny time... can see alot of things very big and beautifull all in white!!... but its very pitty when winter gone this place also dont hv the sculpture anymore",

          "With the snow and ice gone, Island Island is a rather dull place in May. The Squirrel Island is wasted time as the few squirrels we saw were high up the trees and not in anyway special. The performance by the sea lions is comparable to those elsewhere (e.g., Sea World in",

          "It's a nice place to visit but my friends and I were really mad when we were there; we are foreign students, we have student cards from our Chinese university, but they refused to give us the student discount because we're not undergraduate students in China. That's the first",
          "A ton of fun. Great sculptures, slides, and ice rides. Not as cold during the day when the sun is out. Try the ice bikes! The 2 minute dogsled ride is terrible. Not much in terms of food offerings.",
          "My February 4, 2013 visit to Sun Island costed 240 RMB, which is about $40. The ticket office workers do not speak English, so you need to gesture how many tickets you want. The snow sculptures are amazing, and there are so many of them. I'm not sure it's possible to see all",
          "Another amazing Harbin site. How is it possible to build entire castles several stories tall out of compacted snow? For those wondering about the difference between this place and the Ice Park, Sun Island has snow construction vs. pure ice. Both are unique and are worth a visit.",
          "This is a really beautiful attraction, although very expensive with adults costing 240rmb each. You can spend ages there looking at everything and there are additional activities available for a price. There are also lots of little cafes where you can warm up. It is a great",
          "We visited during the afternoon. Although it was sunny, dress warm!! Be careful walking around, it's one big ice plate. The snow sculptures are absolutely amazing. This is really one of those \"you-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it\". They are huge, intricate and amazing. Make sure",
          "The snow sculptures on Sun Island are just amazing! I highly recommend taking a few hours to walk around and there are nice forests for the kids to run around and play in the snow. Don't miss this; I thought it was better than the famous Ice Festival!",
          "This place is also close to the Ice World but is very big area with lots of gigantic snow sculptures.. wonderful designs.. eye-catching figurines.. lots of fun things like slides, skates etc..",
          "Our guide brought us to Sun Island which is beautiful in summer and holds the most amazing snow sculptures in winter. Walking can be a bit tricky so if you watch the locals it is \"walk while you skate\". Lots of ice on the sidewalks but well worth the visit. The most amazing",
          "This place is huge, as are the sculptures! It's interesting to see the international sculpture competition and have fun on the slides and snow/ice based activities.",
          "It's totally preposterous how massive some of these snow sculptures are. Sun Island is this park you pay then walk through and there are all these sculptures made of snow, from the beautiful, or weird, or fragile they were all intresting in the way that you know people spent a",
          "You look around - just snow everywhere. Huge snow sculptures are made here. They are not lit as it's snow. but the amount of detailing done in snow is awesome. No words to explain. Is too big to walk. Better take a bus - 20 RMB. There are 2 points where they drop and pick up -",
          "We spent at least 4 hours there and found everything just so absorbing and so totally different to what we had ever seen.The exhibits were beautifully done and on such a large scale. It is almost impossible to imagine what we saw. The restaurants dotted around the park were warm",
          "The sculptures are amazing, and on a scale that is astonishing. They are beautiful, and really worth going to see. When you get too cold, you can always head into one of the fairly numerous mini-cafes for some heat and a warm drink, though it's a little offputting to be blasted",
          "Truly one of the most memorable and beautiful things I,ve ever seen.These snow sculptures were amazing in every way.I preferred to the ice world in evening-more artistic and clever. Only problem was feet becoming painful after half hour.Ski boots or the like are an absolute",
          "Really worth to go there. Tickets fee : 240RMB per person We stayed there almost 2 hours then we left because I was completely frozen. If you want you have some restaurants there to get warm. We didn't try but it was full of people. Amazing and really huge snow scultpures. You",
          "I really did not know what to expect from the snow sculptures, but I was impressed even before we got to Sun Island with the sculptures that lined the road. You can walk around the island and view the sculptures at your own pace or from what I could make out you can pay and take",
          "Went to the ice sculpture festival here which was just magic. Much more there then I though, would be a great place for a peaceful walk after traveling around China's big cities.",

          "The snow sculptures are located in Sun Island Park; the easiest way to make sure you see everything is to follow the path of the tour vehicles, which stop at various sites around the park. We walked it (with our 4 & 6 y.o.) and saw everything in about 2 hours, but you can also",
          "Really interesting snow sculptures scattered across Sun Island in the winter. Some are enormous, while others smaller and more detailed. Fun for a one hour visit.",
          "You can see wonderful works of snow scluptures. Some big ones you can play with, by sliding on the big slide. River was already forzen. However, I feel so cold to explore further.",
          "Sun Island is a large area displaying snow sculptures, including the exhibits from the 18th international competition in Harbin (as at 2012). However, perhaps due to the rather scattered and disorganized positioning of the sculptures without a theme or multi-lingual sign posts,",

          "This is a nice park to walk around and be away from the concrete sidewalks and tall buildings of the city. Landscaping is good, there are trams to ride around the park. The kids enjoyed feeding squirrels. Summer time seems a little slow, but also there had been a torrential rain",
          "The site of many a wedding photographs for Harbin residents. Though billed as something of a nature reserve, it is also something of an amusement park. Plan on a full day if you don't want to be rushed.",
          "It was the best of times, it was the coldest I\u2019ve ever been in my life! Strolling around Sun Island during the Ice and Snow Festival is like walking through the pages of C. S. Lewis\u2019 Narnia. It was the highlight of our trip to Harbin. Sun Island was one of the four",
          "Amazing sculpture of snow and the resto covered with snow.",
          "Went there in end of December 2011. The snow sculptures were breathtaking and stunning. One would never imagine how big the snow sculptures can be. Nice place to take photos, with the snow sculptures or the scenenary in the park. Just go for it, you won't regret.",
          "An island would be more beautiful when visited in Summer, i think. Lots of trees and large Russian houses/mansions scattered around. It seems like a nice, big park. Also, nice to visit in Winter, when the festival areas are packed with sooooooo many people and the large tourist",
          "Don't get me wrong -- the snow sculptures are impressive, but after seeing both Zhaolin Park and Snow and Ice World, the Sun Island sculptures were less festive in comparison. Of course, the Sun Island sculptures are only available in the daytime whereas the latter two are",
          "I am here in March. The river ice is 2 feet thick and the walk looked inviting. so i joined the 30 or so on the whole river to take the 4 km walk. i liked the island bc no one was on it. it felt like my own peaceful setting. There are some russian build vacation homes from",

          "We visited the Sun Island for the Snow Festival in mid-February, arriving at about 4pm. Tickets were 240 RMB for adults and 120RMB for children under 1.2m. After some argument, we managed to get a discount for our eldest (11 year old) daughter too by showing a copy of her",
          "Cold. -2F cold. But very cool! You can walk from the entrance of Sun Island down to the attraction but we took one the little shuttle vehicles because of the cold. This was a great way to spend a few hours. Scores of snow sculptures that are, I don't know, about 10 or 15",
          "This is where they have snow sculptures in the winter and amusements in the summer",
          "do not take the internal bus (20Y), the park is 200 meters and the view is worth a few photos!!!!!!",
          "230 RMB for a snow park is way too much! The whole city during the ice festival seems to be just a huge rip off!",
          "Colorfully (go at night to appreciate) and varied building architecture Now with horse carriage rides Now ridiculously crowded and overpriced; professional security Decent background music gives festive air Slides overcrowded with locals cutting in line",
          "Even though the venue itself is quite big you can expect to see only few sculptures and carvings. Generally two big size, couple of medium and small size snow carvings. Since we had come all the way to Harbin, try not to miss this. It's one of a kind.",
          "if you have a student ID, good luck. they really only accept chinese student ID's. i dont think this site was worth 240 rmb. the world of ice and snow (which we had the same ID problem at) was definitely worth 300 rmb. i would recommend that site instead. sun island is worth",

          "Highly recommend the Sun Island Snow Sculptures. The Sculptures were truly amazing and beautiful. The park is quite big and it will take around 2 hours to complete. It can get very very cold, so do dress up warm (hats, gloves, ear muffs, face masks etc the complete works). Also",
          "make sure you take your student card if you have on, can get in half price. give yourself a good 3 or so hours to look around, though depends on what you like to do. there are a few activities such as dog sled rides, donut slides but you have to pay extra for these, all very",
          "Beautiful place, filled with snow, but it was super duper cold!!! Pad yourself up completely. Do take the shutter tram as it's way too cold to be walking.",
          "During the Ice festival in January and February it is the place to visit but Dress Warmly - Very Warmly - because you will not enjoy the ice sculptures with frozen toes and finger!!",
          "Wonderful scenery during winter but beware that the temperature is another 2 degrees lower than in the city",
          "I think the title of this attraction should be specifically \"Snow Sculptures\" and not \"Sun island\". Cos on Sun island, there are 2 main attractions : the Snow Sculptures \u96ea\u535a\u4f1a http://www.xuebohui.com.cn and the Ice and Snow World \u51b0\u96ea\u5927\u4e16\u754c. Although these are only 1 bus stop apart,",
          "Any more and you will probably be miserable because of the cold. I'm a college student in the US but didn't bring my student ID, if you bring it you will get half off the ticket price. So instead of paying the full price adult of 150RMB, you pay 75RMB. This also applies to",
          "Visited Harbin in earl January 2010. Saw Zhongshan Park on the first evening, then went to Sun Island for the snow sculptures then next morning, and Ice and Snow World that night. I recommend doing them in this order. If you go to Zhongshan Park last, you may be disappointed -",

          "There wasn't a lot of reviews or information on how to get your own way to Sun Island. You can take the cable car (not my thing) ; get a taxi; organise a private car / tour or walk there across the frozen lake. If you want to walk, it saves some money and is a bit of a novelty",
          "First of all the snow Sculpture entrance is either opposite Polarland or take the cable car across the river. The Sun Island is a big place, there are many warm places to stay and eat or drink if you are cold. The snow sculptures are just incredible. Go by day when the Sun gives",

          "Whilst the lights of the Ice Festive are a big draw card the Sun Island Park is equally well worth the visit. Stunning ice sculptures and ice rink (frozen lake). If you head towards the back after the lake there is a free tyre tube slide which was not that busy and so much fun.",
          "We really enjoyed the time we spent at the snow sculptures. The scale is amazing, and other activities on slides etc to do as well. We spent about 3 hours in the end there, on a cold but gorgeous blue sky day. We organised a taxi from our hotel who took us there, and we agreed",

          "We visited with our three kids, and enjoyed being there for about an hour and a half. Cost was around \u00a5300 each. We tried to get a taxi to take us there from the north end of the pedestrian street, but he seemed either unwilling or unable to take us there. We took the cable car",
          "The artwork that they make out of the blocks of snow is amazing. It was truly inspiring to walk through all the great works of art. I really enjoyed myself. No need to take the little bus from the gate to the main site - the walk isn't that far. There was also a free",

          "We enjoyed the snow sculptures laid around Sun Island. It was clear they had encouraged many talents with some sculptures of amazing quality and some not quite so good. But hey, far better that I could make from snow! We enjoyed a couple of hours walking around, slid across the",
          "I'm jealous of everyone who has visited in the winter, but this place is nice in the opposite season as well. There's a paid part and a free part. Both are enjoyable. In the paid part there is tremendous variation for the themes and displays. The gardens are magnificent.",
          "An absolutely marvellous place to visit, the sculptures totally blow you away at their magnificent size and the atmosphere of the park is so free and easy, so easy to just wander and take it all in.",

          "I preferred this over the Ice city. The snow carving requires artistic skill in what can only be described as numbingly cold temperatures. I was totally awestruck by the sizes and variety of the sculptures, the detail is extraordinary and photo's do not do justice to the",
          "This place is Incredible, no words to describe the magnificence of the art of ice sculptures. Its like they say, one of the things you have to see before you die.",

          "In spring or Autumn this park must be really nice to visit. However in summer it is too hot to visit in day time. There is no place to rest, very few benches to sit so you just have to keep walking. Ticket is 30 RMB for adult, children under 1.4 m is half. Ticket include entry",

          "We came at the very end. Most were melted with new snow sitting on top. It was still interesting to see how massive it was. Grab a map and walk, no need for sightseeing bus unless you are tired. Bring your food and drink. Most food places were closed. We sat at the coffee",
          "Feb 2016. We arrived in day, better for ice sculpture pix along streets. Tram blows by all these so pointless. At night when streets lit they are really pretty to walk, tram again pointless. You walk along street with regular sized ice sculptures, a few large, turn left and",
          "This place is separate from the night ice festival that is lit up. We went here during the day and the snow sculptures were equally amazing. The cold is brutal so wear multiple layers and be mentally prepared. Buy a trolley ticket upon entering the park, something like 20 yuan,",
          "Visited Sun Island for 90 minutes before the ice festival, definitely worth seeing. Wasn't sure beforehand what it was all about, but discovered the Ice festival is basically Ice sculptures whereas Sun Island is Snow sculptures and some of them are huge. So you should see both",
          "No tourist would miss this spot. Classy and beautiful. Prepare your camera for all scenic and fun clicks.",
          "We went during the day, which was great as you could walk around easily and see the sculptures well. Good to do this if you only have one full day, as you will probably want to go and see the Ice & Snow World in the evening when it is all lit up.",
          "We went to see the snow sculptures and were not disappointed. From 3 metre cubes to 18 metre monoliths with complete 70 metre building facia and a princesses castle they were great. Well spread out and a pleasant 3 hour walk to catch them all. For the kids there is a very",
          "Totally different to anything we have ever seen before. A must visit while in Harbin over the Ice Festival.",
          "It's again a must visit place in Harbin ... ice and snow world is made up of ice cubes big structures in contrast this is made up of snow ... we took cable car there from down town that took for round trip 80 rmb and then Bus round trip 10 rmb per person ... the entry ticket",
          "So many different areas within this park. A long day to get around it all, but definitely worth it. The ice sculptures are worth a visit, so clever. We visited a couple of times in our 2.5 week visit to harbin.",
          "Tips: Go behind the child type huge snow sculpture and walk up the stair to the very top of the hill, it's an amazing view. Also, rather than taxi back I highly advise crossing by the river. It's cold but the view and scenery is amazing.",
          "Not bad, a lot of flovers, beautiful place to relax, we rented a boat 120 RMB for a 5 person for a 40 minutel. Dont look a price inside, ask about discount! This is China! Just discount Reccomen tp visit this place may-september (a lot of flower there) Minus is that there are",
          "The only thing that I will add to the many reviews are this, be prepared for extreme conditions. It's harsh being in Harbin but it's almost dangerous in Sun Island. At least in the city, there are many tall buildings that chop the wind down but in Sun island, you are totally",
          "This was a nice afternoon walk-around-the-park style thing for us. We slid down some slides, wandered around the snow sculptures, climbed up the little man-made hill on the far side of the pond.. It was pleasant. We didn't do any of the extra money ice sports, but we still",
          "This was an extra tour, added to the Ice Frestival, and to tell you the truth, I thought it was even better. The size and complexity of the carvings are staggering. A must see.",
          "After our experience with the ice sculptures we were prepared for wow...but this surpassed our expectations in every way. The snow sculpture exhibition is unbelievable. The venue was easy to get to (especially with help from a friendly stranger) and very easy to get around.",
          "Though having travelled a lot all over the world this was something outstanding and special! the huge area is covered with very impressing snow scultpures, you can do some funny ice-sports on the frozen lake, and for handicapped there is even a shuttle going to the most",
          "It took us 20 min drive from Central Boulevard to Sun Island. We paid 240 rmb pee adult to our drivers who got us tickets without queuing. We arrived at about 3.30 pm and the crowd was almost gone. We saw some activities on the frozen Song hua river - fun rides on tyres where",
          "Place to go for the snow sculptures, I would recommend to visit this place during the morning or early afternoon and plant to go to then to the Ice and Snow World at around 16:00. I would say it takes about 3 hrs to visit the whole place at normal pace, no rush, cost is 240cny",
          "We were really impressed at the snow sculptures in Sun Island park. They were so big and very detailed. Well worth a visit; the park is the most expensive snow sculpture exhibition in the city but for good reason.",
          "It's really unbelievable to see such fine work - indeed impressive and amazing! Day was beautiful, sunny and not too cold, -11C, so one could take a good stroll around, take perfect pictures with blue sky!",
          "When in Harbin, you must also go to Sun Island aside from Ice and Snow World. They showcase a different type of ice sculptures with more detail. It's a huge place so you'd probably spend about 3 hours in the area. We visited this place in the afternoon but people told us it's",
          "The Ice World which we had visited at night was brilliantly lighted with coloured bulbs but then, there wasn't much of a surprise this time round as nothing seemed special as compared to previous years which I have seen lots of past pictures before this visit. The only thing",
          "We visited the Sun Island Park in a fine but cold afternoon. At about -20C it was bitingly cold. The snow sculptures are truly impressive. The stroll around the sizeable park was pleasant. We managed to spend 1.5 hrs in the park after a hot drink in a cafe that had a mock up",
          "I guess it's a must when in Harbin, but don't expect anything amazing. There's a beautiful view of the Harbin skyline from there, which is pretty impressive, some ice statues..yeah, other than that not much..",
          "Excellent shows of snow sculpture. Place were clean with many toilet facilities. A must see I will say.",
          "The park is huge - had 3 stages - so you need to allow a couple of hours at least. If you can't or don't want to walk, there are small trams which drive you around cost 20 yuan. The paths are very slippery so take care walking. There are many snow sculptures which are part of",
          "The ice and snow sculptures range in size from car-sized to massive buildings. There are additional attractions like ice slides (that require an additional fee). The site includes cafes and restaurants. Is quite a large site so some walking is required. There is a tram that can",
          "We spent 4 hours here thinking that this is the main attraction in harbin, not realising that it is different from ice and snow world. anyway, we had no regrets spending some time at the playground here, It was not very crowded. rented a sliding board for CNY30/hour to go down",
          "This year it seems that the park cut the expense though each ticket is 280 yuan .The scale is smaller and the work looks not beautiful.",
          "This is well worth the effort for anyone travelling to Harbin. It is a beautiful island with plenty of attractions and points of historical and cultural significance.",
          "The most spectacular display in ice that I\u02bbve ever seen...much more than I imagined it would be. The trip began in the city of Dalian and got progressively colder till ending up in Harbin...this tour was well worth the price!",
          "Now its the best to enjoy the winter in north of China. We really enjoyed our days in Harbin, especially at the Sun Island. We will go there for the Harbin International Snow Sculpture Art Expo next time to enjoy enthralling ice and snow sculptures and architectures.",
          "The snow sculptures are huge and stunning... the place itself is also huge and stunning. I stole a weekend from a business trip to come to Harbin on a whim... turns out it was the best weekend I have ever spent as a sightseer. If you are in China in the Winter, it's worth",
          "This is a very picturesque garden surrounded by water. The artificial waterfall is quite majestic. There is also a swan pond nearby. There is a squirrel island too.",
          "This is a separate island where you can explore nature and also lots of shops of course. You have an option to walk or ride their carts with specific stops in some areas. There are lots of activities in the area like boating, amusement park, feeding the fish, feeding the",
          "We caught one of the ferries shuttling across the river and hen Tom the trolley bus to the park entrance, we decided to walk round as it was a pleasant sunny afternoon. We then took the trolley bus back to Russian street and bought our Russian passports tickets to enter the",
          "This park offers very different leisure activities for for anybody regardless of age, single or groups, interests. You can walk and take it in or you can hire the trolleys to take you around from place to place. The scenery differs from, park to lake, and offers different",
          "There were not many people visiting sun island in the month of December. Most of the ice sculptures were up, but they were still doing the ice and snow sculptures when we were there. Some of the sculptures were magnificent, but some were so-so. There is an ice sculpture area, so",
          "A lot of beautiful flowers, different kind of parks and cool statues. The area is wide enough not to make it too crowded. Do not get confused that also the area with no entrance fee (both sides of the bridges) are called Sun Island. The park is on the eastern side and Polar",
          "Although it had rained a multitude put back the ice blocks used to create the frozen city in half a day. I would recommend staying in Harbin 3 days at least in case the weather shuts this event down for a day.",
          "Locals told us it wasn't worth coming to this place. Glad we didn't listen to them. We took a taxi to the here. Once you enter the park the walkway is lined with snow sculptures done by college students which were somewhat underwhelming. Once you get further in the park then it",
          "This is one of the best and most popular place to visit during the Harbin festival in February each year. I would recommend to explore high rise sculptures and iced structures of people, animals, ships, any many many others. It's worth visiting this place.",
          "Probably had insufficient time to do the the place justice. Enjoyed the Russian village and the boat trip over. Nice park, good place to visit.",
          "I visited the park in late December (xmas), a couple of days before the official opening, so some of the structures were still under construction. however most of the sculptures and some of the slides were already open. overall it's a beautiful site and would be perfect for any",
          "I visited sun island on a Saturday in May. It is pretty crowded. I went to the Russian park which is nothing special. The entrance ticket is like a passport. You can get visa stamps by visiting all the shops in the park. The only foreign looking individuals are the one at the",
          "There is a lot to see here, and the sculptures are so detailed, its easy to stay still for too long and get a bit cold. But you can take your time, as there are lots of little sheds set up selling hot drinks. We would walk around for 30 to 60 minutes, then head inside to warm",
          "The architecture remains Russian and Russian songs are played everywhere. This street is famous for locals, with shops and Western restaurants. However nothing else special and interesting, it disappointed me a bit because i expected something more than historical value/",
          "Go accross the SongHua river by fery or you can grab a taxi (it cost 25RMB) Fyi you must buy the ticket at the official ticket counter and or you will get scam becuase you buy the fake ticket. After you arrive to the islannd you still need to buy the enterance ticket to the",
          "Got to the park by cable car - nice view of snowy Songhua river. The snow sculptures were so beautiful. I spent almost 7 hours in this park. Must visit ...",
          "I'd seen the photos but nothing prepared me for how amazing (& big) the snow buildings and sculptures were - fabulous! Cold? Below freezing - you need many layers...",
          "Since I was on the tour to Harbin to see the Ice Festival, I didn't realize there was a separate area of similar size dedicated to snow sculptures. This is a pretty big deal here. To get the compacted snow they need to create these exhibits, they have to use artificial snow",
          "Definitely a must see in Harbin and one of the best attraction for a winter tour in China. Some of the sculptures are about your height, others are gigantic, but all are simply amazing. The details on some of the statues is unbelievable. It is not as big the Ice and snow world,",
          "This is the place to go to view snow sculptures in Harbin. Unfortunately when we went there in late February 2016, some of the exhibits already melted thus become deformed/misshaped. I guess the optimal time to visit will be in January when the sculptures are still freshly",
          "This is the opposite of Ice and Snow world in Harbin. This park is open from the day until evening, where the later it open in the evening for the lightning of its park. Many activities to do in the park, and there is a tram to take you to different part of the park. From small",
          "This place is on the North bank of the river (and on the opposite side to the city) near Harbin Ice and Snow World, which we visited the night before and was somewhat disappointing as many of the sculptures had badly melted and the place was scruffy. Although some of the",
          "Large and smaller scale ice sculptures, ice lanterns, slides, shops and little houses of the old northern China rural village. Go there a couple of hours before sun set to enjoy the snow sculpture then wait for the lights to come up and the fireworks. There are ice lanterns",
          "As most people will only visit this attraction during winter it is essential to be properly clothed while walking around the many hectares of displays; our guess is that we walked well over 3km covering all the displays. Everything is well laid out with many signs in English",
          "This is a favorite picnic spot in the Summer, but is home to the International Snow Sculpture Art Expo in the winter. There are separate areas for students, all-China, international, and large sculptures. It is similar to the separately held (at another site) Ice Sculpture",
          "Went 6 years ago and had more snow.However the park is now bigger and a bit more interactive and the snow sculpture even more impressive than before.Price at 240 Yuan is a lot more than the 100 Yuan 6 years ago..............",
          "Feb 6 Sun Island is the site of the international snow carving competition among students. Our Hotel Kempinski is nearby. You can choose to walk or take the tram to see the hundred or so snow sculptures, both big and small. All are creative and imaginative. The tram makes",
          "In the pictures it can look like nothing nice, but you have to go there and see it by yourself. Sculptures made of snow are as much impressive as the ice one. I strongly recommend you to go there, especially in the sunny day.",
          "The slides here are well worth the price of entry - rent a plastic toboggan for an hour for 30RMB and then bolt down the slopes. Actually, save yourself the 30RMB and just watch everyone else doing it.",
          "It was memorable visit, we enjoyed alot, there was some agents working to sale tickets with a little less price than normal I.e. 240rmb they offered 200 but we were not sure about so we did not purchased ticket through agent. We enjoyed alot by walking. There was gift items shop",
          "It was a sunny but cold day and the best way to see the artwork. We went the week of CNY and the crowds were small and manageable. We walked casually around the park which is very spread out and with lunch and a little shopping, it took us 4.5 hours as we wanted to see",
          "We went there around 11 am and it was not full and very quite. Most of the tourists are locals. Fantastic place with hundreds of snow and ice figures. There is a cafe where you can drink Chinese traditional green tee with sweet pop corn.",
          "Very small and not so many sculptures. 330rmb for adults and 160rmb for children, but you still have to pay for enjoying some rides inside. There are no taxis at the exit so we had to wait a lot and finally pay an excessive amount to go back to our hotel. The Ice and snow",
          "While we went during the day and did not witness any lights... This place was better than Ice & Snow World (IMO). Again, truly amazing on how these sculptures are developed. Very clean park environment as the setting. Open taxis, at a fee, if you get tired of walking. And",
          "The snow sculptures were outstanding!! From the very large carvings to the wonderfully detailed student carvings we were amazed. If it was just a bit warmer we would have stayed longer to play on the ice. Just a note if you are going, it is cheaper to go at night and children",
          "The time is must take to produce these but be enormous. Some are very high and others are just so cute.",
          "The snow sculptures were just amazing, just for your info the whole park is not used during the ice & snow festival.... only a part of it is used to display the sculptures, so not a good idea to buy the bus tickets as you will not use it.... I never did. Also, as many people",
          "Go to Harbin, even for just the Snow Sculptures, but the Ice Sculptures, Tiger Sanctuary and more makes this trip worthwhile. The Snow sculptures are Huuuge (do I hear Donald Trump?), just fantastic. Not to be missed.",
          "Incredible, you have to keep asking yourself if this is really snow?! Hit the park close to sunset, the lighting is amazing! Was worth it to take the little shuttle bus up, you can only stay out so long in these temps.",
          "duno, maybe just a personal preference, i like this park. huge and with better scenery of snow carving and snow structure. it was more interesting than just ice structure only place.",
          "Nymphs, animals, figures from Chinese legends, monumental castles, galleons, English fortresses: it's all here in China's most stunning display of ice and snow sculpture workmanship.",
          "During the International Snow & Ice Festival you can see amazing snow sculptures. There are so many in varying shapes and sizes that it is difficult to see them all.",
          "beyond words to see these amazing sculptures . I was blown away by the level of detail, and all in snow!",
          "This is where all the main winter attractions are situated. Lots of space. Wide boulevards for traffic.Not to be missed.",
          "Be sure to swing by and check out the Russian products. They're do charge 10 RMB if you take a photo of anyone, but they have a good selection. We picked up a nesting doll, some Russian chocolate, and Russian bread. The passport stamp collecting is fun as well.",
          "We took the cable car over (80\u00a5 return) and had a great day. Dress very warm - it is extremely cold. You can hire a sled for the slides at 30\u00a5 per hour plus 100\u00a5 deposit. Incredible sculptures and a great variety. One was over 100m long. Bring snacks. 240\u00a5 each entry but worth",
          "I loved this attraction! We chose to take the bus to the main area at the top of the park and this meant we could spend more time admiring the huge sculptures around the area. The attention to detail is fabulous and the snow is carved to reveal characters clearly. The frozen",
          "Fantastic snow sculptures lining the lanes. There were also some ice sculptures, and a small play area with short and long slides. I elected not to take the tour bus, as that allowed me to see each sculpture along the road.",
          "This place is near the polar aquarium. In the trip advisor site, it says it only opens until 5pm but they extend to have night trips in the park. The snow sculptures will be lit up and there is a very nice fireworks display around 6pm China time by the snow castle.",
          "This is best to see during the day. There are some really long and curvy Ice Slides down from castles that are pretty fast. Everyone seemed to enjoy the ice slides and climbing the sculptures. It is super cold, wear full winter gear and have heat packs for hands and feet. The",
          "We had a fantastic time at Sun Island! Take advantage of the shuttle bus to get around - minimize walking time and maximize time having fun! We appreciated all the amazing snow sculptures but the highlight for us traveling with school-age kids was the ice slides! Dress warmly",
          "We arrive around 10.00 and we were there for 3 hours. It was our first experience in Harbin so we love it!! We were at minus 28! so be prepared. We enjoy slides without queue for few rmb they asked for a 200 RMB deposit for a snowwheel. No queue even was Saturday morning. The",
          "The Sun Island Snow Park is really impressive. Though shadowed by the nearby Ice Festival, the Snow Park is cheaper and offers not only snow but also a few ice sculptures. The tourist center offers Chinese cuisine and Russian souvenirs.",
          "Visited with my family a clear and very cold December day (-25 deg C). We were lucky that the sun was shining and pollution was low this day so we could see all the snow sculptures sparkle in the sunshine. Some of them are really huge. In all is was an impressive experience",
          "My friends and I are students studying here in China and they have absurd rules to the pay process here. They make their own rules as they go. But rather than being helpful they laugh and just talk in Chinese (even we all understand Chinese). Maybe a tourist attraction but the",
          "While I'm certain this park is amazing year round, I went during the snow festival, which was incredible. Giant snow sculptures, interesting little shops, and lots of fun on the frozen river. Large parts of the park were closed off (probably to keep people near the snow part",
          "This is truly a great place to visit in Harbin, so enjoyable! Some tips: - Shoe spikes and heat pads will be of great help (I use the Mannings heat pads that I bought before the trip, it is much better than the ones sold on the street) - Pay attention to your toes and fingers",
          "This is a beautiful place for all year round. Of course the best time to visit is winter during the Ice and Snow Festival. After you visit/walk in Stalin Park you should take the Ropeway and come to Sun Island a walk next to the river seeing also the Russian Style buildings, a",
          "Get ready to walk around a lot as you would want to take picture with all the sculptures, and there are plenty! The Biggest ones are really stunning. Rent a sled for an hour (30 RMB) and make sure to get a few runs! Recommend to visit during the day and see it around 5pm during",
          "To get there walk along the riverside towards the cable car, and look for where people walk across the river (or take the cable car 80yuan return or 50yuan one way). Once across keep walking on the road that leads inland and you will come across the entrance to the snow world.",
          "This was such a great thing to see. Will never forget it and well worth the travel to see this. Amazing artists.",
          "So much to see despite the very cold weather. Good thing they have transportation (for a fee) inside.",
          "I went before all the sculptures have been completed. but even then, i came away very awed. The sculptures are larger than life and all very detailed and intricately made. just a word of caution, the ice surface where the majority of the ice sculptures are is very slippery.",
          "I wish it opens earlier , like by Christmas time . When we went there half of the display was still being made . I'm sure it's amazing once complete",
          "Sun island is just across the river from the winter Ice Festival. There are many winter activities, ice sculptures and snow sculptures and you walk the park. Make sure that you dress VERY warm!",
          "We went originally on a cool cloudy afternoon. The park was so big, and so lovely. It was also pretty quiet as the weather wasn't the greatest so we got to explore with very little people around. There so great views of the city skyline there as well. We went back on a sunnier",
          "Spend few hours with the magic wonderland of Snow and snow art. Food is limited, but restrooms are available. There is a aquarium near by.",
          "This place was awesome. Me and some colleagues went around to the various areas including, squirrel island, Russian village and saw an amazing waterfall and sculptures. It's a great place to take the family, date or to entertain guests.",
          "This is a relatively new theme resort in Haerbin, land area is big but really not much see. Many things I do not like, most water were full of algae and smelly, most attractions were built too artificially, all tour guilds use loud speaker and sound contaminate each others. The",
          "The scope of the spectacular sculptures at Sun Island in Harbin is mind blowing. So impressive is the number and variety on offer. This is a must see if you visit Harbin for the Ice Spectacul. The entire presentation along the river is remarkabkale on so many levels. If in",
          "Sun Island has the snow and ice indoor site, a Japanese Friendship water fall (fake), a Russian Village (kitchy), and various spots that look good for picnics. We enjoyed walking around, and hopping on and off the tourist conveyances. It was worth the entry fees for all the",

          "The park is large and one should take the trolley around and get the most out of it. The ice sculpture inside the building was great to see and should be a must on the list if you go to the park. Nice to walk around as well and take in all the different attractions. There were",
          "It's important to visit here i) in the daytime and ii) before visiting the Ice Festival, otherwise its attraction will be impaired. It's relatively pricey, but definitely worth it to view all the beautiful intricacies in the carving. I can imagine it being underwhelming at",

          "This park has beautiful snow sculptures that are truly amazing. You walk through a very large park at your own pace. Come during the daytime to visit and take a taxi to get here as walking on the river seems insane. We visited here and then had our taxi driver continue to the",
          "The snow sculptures are majestic! Best to go here with a lot of time to spare, as it is fun to have some rest breaks at the cafes or coffee nooks scattered around the park. We tried the dog-pulled sleds, but that was only for one short loop. Sunset here was picturesque.",

          "If it's not festival time, the area is barren and windy and bitterly cold. It's the thing to do during the festival. Many couples walk around here and brave the cold during the winter. During the summer, the trees don't really bloom but it's still the thing to do if your a local",
          "Beautiful and breathtaking snow sculpture with all sort of shapes size and also cartoon character too",

          "To visit earlier else, the sculpture does not look good. When were went there in mid-Feb, some parts were melting. And the colour of sculptures looked a bit \"dirtied\". Overall, this place is a little over-rated.",

          "One of the best and sunny island in the world!!) Visited in the summer: Aug 2011. Absolutely loved the fresh air and the atmosphere in which I stayed at. Russian restaurants offered some of the most delicious and decorative foods! This is heaven for me and MY HOME TOWN--HAERBIN!!",
          "The snow sculpture festival is amazing. Certain sculptures are huge and massive. We visited the expo on a very sunny day, perfect to take beautiful pictures. The night before some snow has covered the statues, all the powder snow was been removed by the staff of the park. It\u2019s",
          "This is definitely worth a visit if you are in Harbin. The sculptures are amazing. We enjoyed the walk through the park in the day and then walked back across the river to our hotel. A must see if you are in Harbin!",
          "Of course the snow sculptures are fabulous and the reason for visiting Harbin in Feb. Suggest seeing both during the day and at night when lit up. Also went to the Russian Village which was interesting, pleasant and walked back to town across the frozen river which was very",
          "The Harbin ice sculptures are better known, but the snow sculptures in a nearby location are equally spectacular. These are best seen in the daytime (they do not have the internal illumination that is possible with the ice sculptures). Suggest visit Snow sculptures from 1-4 pm,",
          "Enjoyed the visit, got to see the sculptures and walk around the park. It took about 2 hours. There are sleigh rides and slides, but did not partake in these attractions - kids would love them.",
          "As others have said, plan to go to Sun Island during the day and the Ice and Snow Amusement World at night if you are here during the ice festival . You will cover a fair amount of ground if you want to see everything on foot, so consider the pollution level if you have more",
          "To clarify: Sun Island is where both the Ice & Light Festival and the Snow Sculpture Park is. They are far from each other - you cannot walk. You don't need more than 2-3 hours (each) to do both. The bathroom situation is terrifying (by US standards, typical by CN tourist",
          "OMG it only exists because it's sub-zero; but you knew that, right? So it's cold walking round this giant park. but on a clear blue day with no breeze, it's a great walk in the park. The snow sculptures change every year and they range from professional to university students.",
          "Sun Island was amazing. So different to the ice sculptures we'd seen the night before, but still a must see. If you happen to be there when some cartoon characters come out to dance, make sure you join in. It's a lot of fun for people of all ages. If its gets too cold, there",
          "Loved the slide they have there, and the various activities for everyone. Thank God for their golf car that took me around.",
          "The white snow sculptures were fantastic. Some were stories high, and some were almost hands-on. On a beautiful day, the white snow and blue sky are a perfect combination. Bring extra batteries for your camera! If you wanna walk less, cuz the park is somewhat big, pay $20 for a",
          "I rate the snow sculptures at Sun Island the BEST I've seen and going there during the Ice Festival is a MUST. Allow yourself at least a couple of hours to take in all the beautiful snow NOT ice sculptures at this site. Allow even more time is you can withstand the cold but",
          "Kids loved the tubing. Nice place to walk around for a few hours. We had a cab take us and we paid him to wait for us. Well worth it!",
          "The Snow and Ice Festival is spectacular, Horse carriages on the ice and amazing ice sculptures. A modern wonder of the world.",
          "HarBin needs just one day, one full-time day. And start with Sun Island that you can only see in the daylight hours. Dress for really cold weather and expect to walk for the most part of two hours that are enough to cover the exhibition. I recommend walking one way and taking",
          "The snow sculptures are really out of this world - hard to believe they're all hand carved!! They had some large professionally carved pieces as well as some student competition sculptures (which were also awesome!). We even got to see some of the artists carving some of the",
          "This is one of two major snow/ice attractions in Harbin. This one is snow sculptures, and you visit during the day, and the other is more ice, with lights lighting up at night. Compared to the ice park, this one is a lot less crowded, and with entrance fee at 240 rmb, it's",
          "Never been so awesome and great place I really enjoy my time here with my girlfriend and it was so much fun. A lot of things to do and try:)",
          "Beautiful. And. Freezing If you well prepared. It will fantastic Ps. Keep your battery warm If not, you will run out of battery very fast",
          "The Sun Island is a very nice and quiet park. In the winter time you will find there some interesting snow sculptures. I recommend to visit the park before you got to the Ice and Snow Festival as maybe you will be disappointed after it.",
          "We visited during winter in January. Pleasant walk during the morning. It was sunny. Amazing huge snow sculptures. Beautiful snowy view for a nice stroll around the park. Make sure you wear good shoes that is snow contact if not it might be slippery that you may fall. Prepare",
          "We went in late December and the artists were doing the finishing touches. Very creative and we really enjoyed it. Go during the daytime before it gets dark and of course dress warmly. Tip.... organise transport from your hotel for a return trip. Sure it will cost you but we",
          "this place is a good introduction before coming to the harbin ice sculpture festival. this place has a lot of ice sculpture with various size of medium to large. sun island feels like a big park with ice sculpture by the side of the road, and during winter, because of the",
          "impressive skills on the gigantic scultures. But I was horrified when I saw the dog sledding. The dogs were obviously not well taken cared of. They were dirty, tired and scared :( Animal intervention should step in.",
          "Excellent experience a don't miss for your visit to Harbin. Our whole family really liked it but it was cold during the day but not as cold as the Ice Castle at night.",
          "Sun Island consists of only snow sculptures (no ice) & was a great day. It's a very large park & you'll be walking a lot (i think we were there 3 hrs) so dress incredibly warmly. Some of the sculptures were stunning & huge. We were there right after the official opening &",
          "There is a difference between snow sculpture and ice sculpture. This place is full of snow sculptures. Certainly interesting if you have necen seen one before, like me. Worth a visit. Make sure you dress warmly. It is like walking in an area colder than your freezer all the",
          "The dog sledge and wonderful snow sculptures are memorable experiences. With large areas - you should really dress warm and prepare for a long walk to capture all the snow show.",
          "The snow sculptures were amazing with many different styles - from Disney rip-offs to comteporary art. All the other attractions such as the slides, dog sleds were a lot extra in terms of money and really not worth it. It is very very cold as you are on a frozen pond - wear",
          "Th\\is place to ener you have to pay money. You horses carrying you around as well as the dogs. To my view the dogs arfe not treated that good as well as the horses. Some form of cruelty does occur. The toilet is open type without any roof. Itr is built just out of ice and",
          "I went here during winter and the sub zero temperature (-20 degrees ) was a first for me the ice sculptures as in many places of Harbin were great... there is also a place to buy fur hats a bit expensive entrance though",
          "Cost a lot in entrance fees, extra for trolley bus. Surly driver.skipped a stop even . Do not visit in winter , not much to see before start of ice festival. and everything under construction. Poor experience, unclear signs",
          "This is the place where they hold the annual Beer Festival. You get all sorts of beer from around the world. Its cheap and fantastic. Do go earlier as there would be alot of people going there during the evening.",
          "The size of the sculptures are truly amazing. As well as the intricacy in the carving. We did take the trolley bus to get from the entrance to the farthest point, and then walked back in stages. The husky sled ride is a rip-off ... too short ... just for a short circuit. You pay",
          "all under construction or closed, the locals try to charge you double or triple the normal price, if i didn't speak chinese i would have been ripped off really badly. the russian show on the island is really embarrisingly bad and they torture crocodiles making them dance and",
          "On our trip to Harbin we went to the Sun Island Snow Park in the daytime and the Ice Festival at night. The snow sculptures are massive. Most are larger than 3 story houses. The fine details in the carvings are absolutely amazing.",
          "A very large park with electric carts and bicycles - for a fee - to get around. many interesting section. We spent time at the Sun Waterfall which is man made and has caves behind it. We fed the carp in the lake. It was very hot the day we were there and there is limited seating",
          "An enormous garden with loads of attractive spots. Nature, water, flowers... That's for the summer! It's also the venue for the famous ice festival in winter. We crossed the river via cable car, which was a great experience-not to be missed! As for the gardens after you arrive,",
          "Was blown away by the snow sculpture on display everything from tractors, to smurfs to presidents , even a hamburger all very lifelike. We visited on a very sunny but very cold January day but ~I loved this place. There was an opportunity to ice carve but this may have been",
          "This is a large & beautiful garden of 38sq km with many scenic spots. You need to travel in the electric tram from one spot to another to save your legs\u2019 energy and time. The main attraction spots are the Sun Water Fall, the Squirrel Island, the Clove Garden and the most",
          "We visited at the end of January when the snow sculptures were still in pristine condition. The area is large so be prepared for a fair bit of walking. There is a small caf\u00e9 inside which sells drinks & snacks but also provides free hot ginger tea and a seat! A bit of a",
          "We visited towards the end of feb - so not many people at sun island during the day. A lot of the ice sculptures had start to melt as well. Activities inside like ice buggies, slides ext.. (additional costs however). Good for a quick visit after the tiger park &/or polarland.",
          "Runs a clear second to the Harbin Ice and Snow World, but offers enough that is different to ensure you should see both. If you catch it on a snowy day it's also delightful, but sunny might be lovely too. It's a big area, so plenty of walking and it gets quite cold late",
          "The snow sculpture exhibition at Sun Island Park was the first Ice and Snow Festival component we visited upon arriving in Harbin. By itself it's beautiful by most standards - although if you visited towards the tail-end of the festival like we did, many of the snow sculptures",
          "This place actually consists of lots of amusement place in Harbin such as Snow and Ice Festival, Heilongjiang Science and Technology Museum, and Polarland. Definitely have to spend one full day to come here and you probably should decide first where would you go since it's",
          "I was super excited to see the snow sculptures but it was kind of a let down. My 3 year old got bored really fast, so that made the rest of the day hard. The sculptures are all spread way out, so it makes it harder to see it all.",
          "We were there during the Snow and Ice Festival. Two of the three festival venues are on the island - Snow and Ice World and in the Sun Island Scenic Area is the Snow Sculpture Expo. The area is really beautiful with lots of trees, the wide river and plenty for nature lovers. See",
          "This place is closed at 4 p.m. same for the toilets there. Not very impressed by the work of art there because have seen more excellent arts.",
          "This is one of the must-see attractions if visiting harbin in winter. There are heaps of snow sculptures, ranging in size from the height of a person, to huge monumental pieces dozens of meters high. The best way to view the sculptures is by walking around the park. There",
          "This attraction has many snow statues (some gigantic) and many little larger-than-life ice statues. There is a lot of walking in this park, alternatively, a driver can be hired. This is a daylight attraction only; the park closes at 5pm. They turn on the lights at some snow",
          "Great place to spend some time during the day, there are activities, many snow sculptures, if you go around sunset, best views, then walk to the Ice show, great day out.",
          "Wonderful Island with many fantastic from snow carved figures. It is worthwhile in any case to visit this exhibition if you are in Harbin.",
          "This is a lovely and relaxed area, with the truly amazing snow sculptures made by locals and teams from around the world. I had seen photos before going, but until you see them in person, the size and detail of the carvings just can't be appreciated. Incredible.",
          "This is a stunning experience. The snow sculptures are amazing, and far more attractive and interesting than the over-crowded and somewhat tacky Ice World. Go in the day time and allow several hours. Also, don't miss the 'Ethnic Village Museum' located just beyond the very",
          "We found this more interesting than the ice blocks and lights of the main ice festival and somehow not as cold. Still very, very cold and difficult to stay out long and appreciate the very impressive, huge and intricate snow sculptures. Best seen during the day where all the",
          "We were trying to figure out how to get to the island\u2026 A guy we asked said you need to hire a car/cab over, or walk across the river. We thought he was joking! We found the cable car and paid 260RMB which includes the entrance fee to the island site where the sculptures were",
          "Lots of interesting exhibits. It's like an art show outside in sub-freezing temperature! They do have dog sleds, snow mobiles, skiing and snow slides if you like that. Take the 10Y ($1.50) bus. It's worth it.",
          "The snow sculptures were worth every effort to see. We were amazed at the size and intricacy and beautiful portrayal of huge life forms and even architecture. These artists are very talented. It is very cold though. I wore 6 layers, including 3 pairs of thermal socks,",
          "Snow carvings are large and impressive. Few other activities available like dog sleds but we didn't do any of these. 200RMB for entry. Only open until 4pm. If you are in Harbin during winter you should make the trip here.",
          "In December, the park will have exhibition for the snow sculpture, while this one is very interesting, the fee a bit expensive (240 RMB), there are a lot of snow sculpture from as small as statue to as big as castle. If you plan to go to Harbin Amusement, i will say you can skip",
          "We were here for the snow carvings in winter. This place is massive and so are some of the carvings. Leave plenty of time to have a good look around. Amazing displays by people from all over the world, it's such a pity they all melt in the end.",
          "You have to go up close to get a sense of how huge the snow sculpture was and the amount of work and planning to get the done up. The brochures do not do justice to some of the completed work.",
          "We really enjoyed our time at the park, the sculptures are truly breathtaking. I only wish we could have spent more time here. Also they were still building a lot of the sculptures so I would go in January rather than in late December. Still very glad to have visited. The main",
          "Alot of things to see! Dogs pulling sledges, slides, ice skating. Just so many activities to pass ur time. Also people watch and see how the locals pass their time here! Very enjoyable. Also see the igloos that were carved just for this period.",
          "when night pass this place is best thing to visit in sunny time... can see alot of things very big and beautifull all in white!!... but its very pitty when winter gone this place also dont hv the sculpture anymore",
          "Now with horse carriage rides. Now ridiculously crowded and overpriced; professional security Decent background music gives festive air. Slides overcrowded with locals cutting in line.",
          "With the snow and ice gone, Island Island is a rather dull place in May. The Squirrel Island is wasted time as the few squirrels we saw were high up the trees and not in anyway special. The performance by the sea lions is comparable to those elsewhere (e.g., Sea World in",
          "It's a huge park and will held snow festival every year. The scenery is beautiful, however, the ticket is too expensive considered it's only a park most of the time.",
          "It's a nice place to visit but my friends and I were really mad when we were there; we are foreign students, we have student cards from our Chinese university, but they refused to give us the student discount because we're not undergraduate students in China. That's the first",
          "A ton of fun. Great sculptures, slides, and ice rides. Not as cold during the day when the sun is out. Try the ice bikes! The 2 minute dogsled ride is terrible. Not much in terms of food offerings.",
          "My February 4, 2013 visit to Sun Island costed 240 RMB, which is about $40. The ticket office workers do not speak English, so you need to gesture how many tickets you want. The snow sculptures are amazing, and there are so many of them. I'm not sure it's possible to see all",
          "Another amazing Harbin site. How is it possible to build entire castles several stories tall out of compacted snow? For those wondering about the difference between this place and the Ice Park, Sun Island has snow construction vs. pure ice. Both are unique and are worth a visit.",
          "This is a really beautiful attraction, although very expensive with adults costing 240rmb each. You can spend ages there looking at everything and there are additional activities available for a price. There are also lots of little cafes where you can warm up. It is a great",
          "We visited during the afternoon. Although it was sunny, dress warm!! Be careful walking around, it's one big ice plate. The snow sculptures are absolutely amazing. This is really one of those \"you-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it\". They are huge, intricate and amazing. Make sure",
          "The snow sculptures on Sun Island are just amazing! I highly recommend taking a few hours to walk around and there are nice forests for the kids to run around and play in the snow. Don't miss this; I thought it was better than the famous Ice Festival!",
          "This place is also close to the Ice World but is very big area with lots of gigantic snow sculptures.. wonderful designs.. eye-catching figurines.. lots of fun things like slides, skates etc..",
          "Our guide brought us to Sun Island which is beautiful in summer and holds the most amazing snow sculptures in winter. Walking can be a bit tricky so if you watch the locals it is \"walk while you skate\". Lots of ice on the sidewalks but well worth the visit. The most amazing",
          "This place is huge, as are the sculptures! It's interesting to see the international sculpture competition and have fun on the slides and snow/ice based activities.",
          "It's totally preposterous how massive some of these snow sculptures are. Sun Island is this park you pay then walk through and there are all these sculptures made of snow, from the beautiful, or weird, or fragile they were all intresting in the way that you know people spent a",
          "You look around - just snow everywhere. Huge snow sculptures are made here. They are not lit as it's snow. but the amount of detailing done in snow is awesome. No words to explain. Is too big to walk. Better take a bus - 20 RMB. There are 2 points where they drop and pick up -",
          "We spent at least 4 hours there and found everything just so absorbing and so totally different to what we had ever seen.The exhibits were beautifully done and on such a large scale. It is almost impossible to imagine what we saw. The restaurants dotted around the park were warm",
          "The sculptures are amazing, and on a scale that is astonishing. They are beautiful, and really worth going to see. When you get too cold, you can always head into one of the fairly numerous mini-cafes for some heat and a warm drink, though it's a little offputting to be blasted",
          "Truly one of the most memorable and beautiful things I,ve ever seen.These snow sculptures were amazing in every way.I preferred to the ice world in evening-more artistic and clever. Only problem was feet becoming painful after half hour.Ski boots or the like are an absolute",
          "Really worth to go there. Tickets fee : 240RMB per person We stayed there almost 2 hours then we left because I was completely frozen. If you want you have some restaurants there to get warm. We didn't try but it was full of people. Amazing and really huge snow scultpures. You",
          "I really did not know what to expect from the snow sculptures, but I was impressed even before we got to Sun Island with the sculptures that lined the road. You can walk around the island and view the sculptures at your own pace or from what I could make out you can pay and take",
          "Went to the ice sculpture festival here which was just magic. Much more there then I though, would be a great place for a peaceful walk after traveling around China's big cities.",
          "Our trip to Harbin was quite hastily planned and therefore we did not know what to expect from the snow sculptures in Sun Island park. The first sculptures we saw were already very impressive but small compared to some of the other sculptures further down the park. The level of",
          "Sun Island is a 38-sq-km recreational zone with landscaped gardens, miniforests, a 'water world', a Russian Style Town, and various small galleries and museums. It is a pleasant place to walk around, though as usual you need to pay extra to get into many areas.",
          "To me, this was the best experience in Harbin. The snow sculptures were brilliant. You could even see expression in the eyes and mouth of those carvings. Loved it, just loved it!",
          "The snow sculptures are located in Sun Island Park; the easiest way to make sure you see everything is to follow the path of the tour vehicles, which stop at various sites around the park. We walked it (with our 4 & 6 y.o.) and saw everything in about 2 hours, but you can also",
          "Really interesting snow sculptures scattered across Sun Island in the winter. Some are enormous, while others smaller and more detailed. Fun for a one hour visit.",
          "You can see wonderful works of snow scluptures. Some big ones you can play with, by sliding on the big slide. River was already forzen. However, I feel so cold to explore further.",
          "Sun Island is a large area displaying snow sculptures, including the exhibits from the 18th international competition in Harbin (as at 2012). However, perhaps due to the rather scattered and disorganized positioning of the sculptures without a theme or multi-lingual sign posts,",
          "the island is very nice with old Russian houses and trails for walk. I recommend access by river when is frozen.",
          "I liked the slow boat ride to this place and after getting there you can look back on the city across the river was nice.",
          "This is a nice park to walk around and be away from the concrete sidewalks and tall buildings of the city. Landscaping is good, there are trams to ride around the park. The kids enjoyed feeding squirrels. Summer time seems a little slow, but also there had been a torrential rain",
          "The site of many a wedding photographs for Harbin residents. Though billed as something of a nature reserve, it is also something of an amusement park. Plan on a full day if you don't want to be rushed.",
          "It was the best of times, it was the coldest I\u2019ve ever been in my life! Strolling around Sun Island during the Ice and Snow Festival is like walking through the pages of C. S. Lewis\u2019 Narnia. It was the highlight of our trip to Harbin. Sun Island was one of the four",
          "Amazing sculpture of snow and the resto covered with snow.",
          "Went there in end of December 2011. The snow sculptures were breathtaking and stunning. One would never imagine how big the snow sculptures can be. Nice place to take photos, with the snow sculptures or the scenenary in the park. Just go for it, you won't regret.",
          "An island would be more beautiful when visited in Summer, i think. Lots of trees and large Russian houses/mansions scattered around. It seems like a nice, big park. Also, nice to visit in Winter, when the festival areas are packed with sooooooo many people and the large tourist",
          "Don't get me wrong -- the snow sculptures are impressive, but after seeing both Zhaolin Park and Snow and Ice World, the Sun Island sculptures were less festive in comparison. Of course, the Sun Island sculptures are only available in the daytime whereas the latter two are",
          "I am here in March. The river ice is 2 feet thick and the walk looked inviting. so i joined the 30 or so on the whole river to take the 4 km walk. i liked the island bc no one was on it. it felt like my own peaceful setting. There are some russian build vacation homes from",
          "The sculptures were wonderful and I am happy that I saw them, but I think the entrance fee was too high for normal Chinese standards.",
          "We visited the Sun Island for the Snow Festival in mid-February, arriving at about 4pm. Tickets were 240 RMB for adults and 120RMB for children under 1.2m. After some argument, we managed to get a discount for our eldest (11 year old) daughter too by showing a copy of her",
          "Cold. -2F cold. But very cool! You can walk from the entrance of Sun Island down to the attraction but we took one the little shuttle vehicles because of the cold. This was a great way to spend a few hours. Scores of snow sculptures that are, I don't know, about 10 or 15",
          "This is where they have snow sculptures in the winter and amusements in the summer",
          "do not take the internal bus (20Y), the park is 200 meters and the view is worth a few photos!!!!!!",
          "230 RMB for a snow park is way too much! The whole city during the ice festival seems to be just a huge rip off!",

          "Even though the venue itself is quite big you can expect to see only few sculptures and carvings. Generally two big size, couple of medium and small size snow carvings. Since we had come all the way to Harbin, try not to miss this. It's one of a kind.",
          "if you have a student ID, good luck. they really only accept chinese student ID's. i dont think this site was worth 240 rmb. the world of ice and snow (which we had the same ID problem at) was definitely worth 300 rmb. i would recommend that site instead. sun island is worth",
          "We went to Sun Island via Bus 29 at the end of Zhongyang st. (Central st.) You can buy your ticket for 240rmb from the bus conductor and ride for free. In our case, the staff at Greentree Hotel where we stayed at gave us 20rmb discount coupons each so they told us to pay the",

          "Going to Taiyang dao/Sun Island is a must in Harbin during the wintertime. Before going to the Ice Festival at night, make some time to visit the Snow Festival at Sun Island (quite close to the Ice Festival, and not to be mistaken with it!), where you will see snow sculptures",
          "Highly recommend the Sun Island Snow Sculptures. The Sculptures were truly amazing and beautiful. The park is quite big and it will take around 2 hours to complete. It can get very very cold, so do dress up warm (hats, gloves, ear muffs, face masks etc the complete works). Also",
          "make sure you take your student card if you have on, can get in half price. give yourself a good 3 or so hours to look around, though depends on what you like to do. there are a few activities such as dog sled rides, donut slides but you have to pay extra for these, all very",
          "Beautiful place, filled with snow, but it was super duper cold!!! Pad yourself up completely. Do take the shutter tram as it's way too cold to be walking.",

          "Wonderful scenery during winter but beware that the temperature is another 2 degrees lower than in the city",
          "I think the title of this attraction should be specifically \"Snow Sculptures\" and not \"Sun island\". Cos on Sun island, there are 2 main attractions : the Snow Sculptures \u96ea\u535a\u4f1a http://www.xuebohui.com.cn and the Ice and Snow World \u51b0\u96ea\u5927\u4e16\u754c. Although these are only 1 bus stop apart,",
          "Any more and you will probably be miserable because of the cold. I'm a college student in the US but didn't bring my student ID, if you bring it you will get half off the ticket price. So instead of paying the full price adult of 150RMB, you pay 75RMB. This also applies to",
          "Visited Harbin in earl January 2010. Saw Zhongshan Park on the first evening, then went to Sun Island for the snow sculptures then next morning, and Ice and Snow World that night. I recommend doing them in this order. If you go to Zhongshan Park last, you may be disappointed -",

        "wiki": "Harbin (Manchu: \u1865\u1820\u182f\u182a\u1873\u1828 (); Chinese: \u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8 H\u0101'\u011brb\u012bn) is a sub-provincial city and the provincial capital of Heilongjiang province, People's Republic of China, as well as the second largest city by urban population and largest city by metropolitan population (urban and rural together) in Northeast China.  Harbin has direct jurisdiction over nine metropolitan districts, two county-level cities and seven counties, and is the eighth most populous Chinese city according to the 2010 census, the built-up area (which consists of all districts except Shuangcheng and Acheng) had 5,282,093 inhabitants, while the total metropolitan population was up to 10,635,971.  Harbin serves as a key political, economic, scientific, cultural and communications hub in Northeast China, as well as an important industrial base of the nation.Harbin, whose name was originally a Manchu word meaning \"a place for drying fishing nets\", grew from a small rural settlement on the Songhua River to become one of the largest cities in Northeast China. Founded in 1898 with the coming of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the city first prospered as a region inhabited by an overwhelming majority of immigrants from the Russian Empire.With its often harsh winters, Harbin is heralded as the Ice City (\u51b0\u57ce) for its well-known winter tourism and recreations. Harbin is notable for its ice sculpture festival in the winter. Besides being well known for its historical Russian legacy, the city serves as an important gateway in Sino-Russian trade today. In the 1920s, the city was considered China's fashion capital since new designs from Paris and Moscow reached here first before arriving in Shanghai. The city was voted \"China Top Tourist City\" by the China National Tourism Administration in 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nHuman settlement in the Harbin area dates from at least 2200 BC during the late Stone Age. Wanyan Aguda, the founder and first emperor (reigned 1115-1123) of the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), was born in the Jurchen Wanyan tribes who resided near the Ashi River in this region.  In AD 1115 Aguda established Jin's capital Shangjing (Upper Capital) Huining Prefecture in today's Acheng District of Harbin. After Aguda's death, the new emperor Wanyan Sheng ordered the construction of a new city on a uniform plan. The planning and construction emulated major Chinese cities, in particular Bianjing (Kaifeng), although the Jin capital was smaller than its Northern Song prototype. Huining Prefecture served as the first superior capital of the Jin empire until Wanyan Liang (the fourth emperor of Jin Dynasty) moved the capital to Yanjing (now Beijing) in 1153. Liang even went so far as to destroy all palaces in his former capital in 1157. Wanyan Liang's successor Wanyan Yong (Emperor Shizong) restored the city and established it as a secondary capital in 1173. Ruins of the Shangjing Huining Prefecture were discovered and excavated about 2 km (1.2 mi)from present-day Acheng's central urban area. The site of the old Jin capital ruins is a national historic reserve, and includes the Jin Dynasty History Museum. The museum, open to the public, was renovated in late 2005. Mounted statues of Aguda and of his chief commander Wanyan Zonghan (also Nianhan) stand in the grounds of the museum.\nMany of the artifacts found there are on display in nearby Harbin.\nAfter the Mongol conquest of the Jin Empire (1211\u20131234), Huining Prefecture was abandoned. In the 17th century, the Manchus used building materials from Huining Prefecture to construct their new stronghold in Alchuka. The region of Harbin remained largely rural until the 1800s, with over ten villages and about 30,000 people in the city's present-day urban districts by the end of the 19th century.\n\n\n=== International city ===\n\nA small village in 1898 grew into the modern city of Harbin. Polish engineer Adam Szyd\u0142owski drew plans for the city following the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which the Russian Empire had financed. The Russians selected Harbin as the base of their administration over this railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. The railways were largely constructed by Russian engineers and indentured workers. The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the Trans-Siberian Railway: substantially reducing the distance from Chita to Vladivostok and also linking the new port city of Dalny (Dalian) and the Russian Naval Base Port Arthur (L\u00fcshun). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a \"boomtown\", growing into a city within five years. The majority of settlers in Harbin came from southern Ukraine (Russian Empire). In addition to Ukrainians there were many Russians, Jews, Poles, Georgians, and Tatars.The city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar Simon Karlinsky, who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian Jewish family, wrote that in Harbin \"the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned\u2014well before the October Revolution\u2014by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners\", giving the city a very European appearance. Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms which soon turned Manchuria into the \"breadbasket of China\" while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize.  Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria.  A sign of Harbin's wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play K zvezdam by Leonid Andreyev had its premiere there.   \n\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies. Churches were rebuilt for Russian Orthodox, Lutheran/German Protestant, and Polish Catholic Christians. Chinese capitalists also established businesses, especially in brewing, food and textiles. Harbin became the economic hub of northeastern China and an international metropolis.The rapid growth of the city challenged the public healthcare system. The worst-ever recorded outbreak of pneumonic plague was spread to Harbin through the Trans-Manchurian railway from the border trade port of Manzhouli. The plague lasted from late autumn of 1910 to spring 1911 and killed 1,500 Harbin residents (mostly ethnic Chinese), or about five percent of its population at the time. This turned out to be the beginning of the large so-called Manchurian plague pandemic which ultimately claimed 60,000 victims. In the winter of 1910, Dr. Wu Lien-teh (later the founder of Harbin Medical University) was given instructions from the Foreign Office, Peking, to travel to Harbin to investigate the plague. Dr. Wu asked for imperial sanction to cremate plague victims, as cremation of these infected victims turned out to be the turning point of the epidemic. The suppression of this plague pandemic changed medical progress in China. Bronze statues of Dr. Wu Lien-teh are built in Harbin Medical University to remember his contributions in promoting public health, preventive medicine and medical education.The first generation of Harbin Russians were mostly the builders and employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They moved to Harbin in order to work on the railroad. At the time Harbin was not an established city. The city was almost built from scratch by the builders and early settlers. Houses were constructed, furniture and personal items were brought in from Russia. After the Manchurian plague epidemic, Harbin's population continued to increase sharply, especially inside the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. In 1913 the Chinese Eastern Railway census showed its ethnic composition as: Russians \u2013 34313, Chinese (that is, including Hans, Manchus etc.) \u2013 23537, Jews \u2013 5032, Poles \u2013 2556, Japanese \u2013 696, Germans \u2013 564, Tatars \u2013 234, Latvians \u2013 218, Georgians \u2013 183, Estonians \u2013 172, Lithuanians \u2013 142, Armenians \u2013 124; there were also Karaims, Ukrainians, Bashkirs, and some Western Europeans. In total, 68549 citizens of 53 nationalities, speaking 45 languages. Research shows that only 11.5 percent of all residents were born in Harbin. By 1917, Harbin's population exceeded 100,000, with over 40,000 of them were ethnic Russians.\n\nAfter Russia's Great October Socialist Revolution in November 1917, more than 100,000 defeated Russian White Guards and refugees retreated to Harbin, which became a major center of White Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s and the largest Russian enclave outside the Soviet Union. Karlinsky noted that a major difference with the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who arrived in Harbin was: \"Unlike the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who went to Paris or Prague or even to Shanghai, the new residents of Harbin were not a minority surrounded by a foreign population. They found themselves instead in an almost totally Russian city, populated mainly by people with roots in the south of European Russia.\" The city had a Russian school system, as well as publishers of Russian-language newspapers and journals. Russian Harbintsy community numbered around 120,000 at its peak in the early 1920s. Many of Harbin's Russians were wealthy, which sometime confused foreign visitors who expected them to be poor, with for instance the American writer Harry A. Franck in his 1923 book Wanderings in North China writing the Russian \"ladies as well gowned as at the Paris races [who] strolled with men faultlessly garbed by European standards\", leading him to wonder how they had achieved this \"deceptive appearance\".The Harbin Institute of Technology was established in 1920 as the Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry to educate railway engineers via a Russian method of instruction. Students could select from two majors at the time: Railway Construction or Electric Mechanic Engineering. On 2 April 1922, the school was renamed the Sino-Russian Industrial University. The original two majors eventually developed into two major departments: the Railway Construction Department and the Electric Engineering Department.  Between 1925 and 1928 the University's Rector was  Leonid Aleksandrovich Ustrugov, the Russian Deputy Minister of Railways under Nicholas II before the Russian Revolution, Minister of Railways under Admiral Kolchak's government, and a key figure in the development of the Chinese Eastern Railway.\nThe Russian community in Harbin made it their mission to preserve the pre-revolutionary culture of Russia. The city had numerous Russian language newspapers, journals, libraries, theaters and two opera companies. One of the famous Russian poets in Harbin was Valery Pereleshin, who started publishing his intensely homoerotic poetry in 1937, and was also one of the few Russian writers in Harbin who learned Mandarin. The subject of Pereleshin's poetry caused problems with the Russian Fascist Party, and led Pereelshin leaving Harbin for Shanghai, and ultimately to the United States. Not all of the Russian newspapers were of high quality, with Karlinsky calling Nash put', the newspaper of the Russian Fascist Party \"the lowest example of gutter journalism that Harbin had ever seen\". Nikolai Baikov, a Russian writer in Harbin was known for his novels of exile life in that city together with his accounts of his travels across Manchuria and the folklore of its Manchu and Chinese population. Boris Yulsky, a young Russian writer who published his short stories in the newspaper Rubezh was considered to be a promising writer whose career was cut short when he gave up literature for activism in the Russian Fascist Party and cocaine addiction. Moya-tvoya (mine \u2013 yours), a pidgin language that was a combination of Russian and Mandarin Chinese that had developed in the 19th century when Chinese went to work in Siberia, was considered essential by the Chinese business people of Harbin. \nIn the early 1920s, according to Chinese scholars' recent studies, over 20,000 Jews lived in Harbin. After 1919, Dr. Abraham Kaufman played a leading role in Harbin's large Russian Jewish community. The Republic of China discontinued diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1920, so many Russians found themselves stateless. When the Chinese Eastern Railway and government in Beijing announced in 1924 that they agreed the railroad would only employ Russian or Chinese nationals, the emigres were forced to announce their ethnic and political allegiance. Most accepted Soviet citizenship.\nThe Chinese warlord Zhang Xueliang, the \"Young Marshal\" seized the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929. Soviet military force quickly put an end to the crisis and forced the Nationalist Chinese to accept restoration of joint Soviet-Chinese administration of the railway.\n\n\n=== Japanese invasion period ===\n\nJapan invaded Manchuria outright after the Mukden Incident in September 1931. After the Japanese captured Qiqihar in the Jiangqiao Campaign, the Japanese 4th Mixed Brigade moved toward Harbin, closing in from the west and south. Bombing and strafing by Japanese aircraft forced the Chinese army to retreat from Harbin. Within a few hours the Japanese occupation of Harbin was complete.With the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, the so-called \"pacification of Manchukuo\" began, as volunteer armies continued to fight the Japanese. Harbin became a major operations base for the infamous medical experimenters of Unit 731, who killed people of all ages and ethnicities. All these units were known collectively as the Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department of the Kwantung Army. The main facility of the Unit 731 was built in 1935 at Pingfang District, approximately 24 km (15 mi) south of Harbin urban area at that time. Between 3,000 and 12,000 citizens including men, women, and children\u2014from which around 600 every year were provided by the Kempeitai\u2014died during the human experimentation conducted by Unit 731 at the camp based in Pingfang alone, which does not include victims from other medical experimentation sites. Almost 70 percent of the victims who died in the Pingfang camp were Chinese, including both civilian and military. Close to 30 percent of the victims were Russian. The Russian Fascist Party had the task of capturing \"unreliable\" Russians living in Harbin to hand over to Unit 731 to serve as the unwilling subjects of the gruesome experiments. Some others were South East Asians and Pacific Islanders, at the time colonies of the Empire of Japan, and a small number of the prisoners of war from the Allies of World War II (although many more Allied POWs were victims of Unit 731 at other sites). Prisoners of war were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia, after infected with various diseases. Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. Unit 731 and its affiliated units (Unit 1644 and Unit 100 among others) were involved in research, development, and experimental deployment of epidemic-creating biowarfare weapons in assaults against the Chinese populace (both civilian and military) throughout World War II. Human targets were also used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in different positions. Flame throwers were tested on humans. Humans were tied to stakes and used as targets to test germ-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, and explosive bombs. Twelve Unit 731 members were found guilty in the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials but later repatriated; others received secret immunity by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur before the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in exchange for biological warfare work in the Cold War for the American Force.\n\nChinese revolutionaries including Zhao Shangzhi, Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, Zhao Yiman continued to struggle against the Japanese in Harbin and its administrative area, commanding the main anti-Japanese guerrilla army-Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army\u2014which was originally organized by the Manchurian branch of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The army was supported by the Comintern after the CPC Manchurian Provincial Committee was dissolved in 1936.\n\nUnder the Manchukuo r\u00e9gime and Japanese occupation, Harbin Russians had a difficult time. In 1935, the Soviet Union sold the Chinese Eastern Railway (KVZhD) to the Japanese, and many Russian emigres left Harbin (48133 of them were arrested during the Soviet Great Purge between 1936 and 1938 as \"Japanese spies\"). Most departing Russians returned to the Soviet Union, but a substantial number moved south to Shanghai or emigrated to the United States and Australia. By the end of the 1930s, the Russian population of Harbin had dropped to around 30,000.Many of Harbin's Jews (13,000 in 1929) fled after the Japanese occupation as the Japanese associated closely with militant anti-Soviet Russian Fascists, whose ideology of anti-Bolshevism and nationalism was laced with virulent anti-Semitism. The Kwantung Army sponsored and financed the Russian Fascist Party, which after 1932 started to play an over-sized role in the Harbin's Russian community as its thugs began to harness and some times killed those opposed to it. Most Jews left for Shanghai, Tianjin, and the British Mandate of Palestine. In the late 1930s, some German Jews fleeing the Nazis moved to Harbin. Japanese officials later facilitated Jewish emigration to several cities in western Japan, notably Kobe, which came to have Japan's largest synagogue.\n\n\n=== After World War II ===\n\nThe Soviet Army took the city on 20 August 1945 and Harbin never came under the control of the Kuomintang, whose troops stopped 60 km (37 mi) short of the city. The city's administration was transferred by the departing Soviet Army to the Chinese People's Liberation Army in April 1946. On 28 April 1946, the communist government of Harbin was established, making the 700,000-citizen-city the first large city governed by the communists. During the short occupation of Harbin by the Soviet Army (August 1945 to April 1946), thousands of Russian emigres who have been identified as members of the Russian Fascist Party and fled communism after the Russian October Revolution, were forcibly deported to the Soviet Union. After 1952 the Soviet Union launched a second wave of immigration back to Russia. By 1964, the Russian population in Harbin had been reduced to 450. The rest of the European community (Russians, Germans, Poles, Greeks, etc.) emigrated during the years 1950\u201354 to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel and the US, or were repatriated to their home countries. By 1988 the original Russian community numbered just thirty, all of them elderly. Modern Russians living in Harbin mostly moved there in the 1990s and 2000s, and have no relation to the first wave of emigration.\nHarbin was one of the key construction cities of China during the First Five-Year Plan period from 1951 to 1956. 13 of the 156 key construction projects were aid-constructed by the Soviet Union in Harbin. This project made Harbin an important industrial base of China. During the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1961, Harbin experienced a very tortuous development course as several Sino-Soviet contracts were cancelled by the Soviet Union. During the Cultural Revolution many foreign and Christian things were uprooted, such as the St. Nicholas church which was destroyed by Red Guards in 1966. On 23 August 1966, the Red Guards stormed into St. Nicholas Cathedral, burned its icons on the streets while chanting xenophobic slogans before destroying St. Nicholas Cathedral.  As the normal economic and social order was seriously disrupted, Harbin's economy also suffered from serious setbacks. One of the main reasons of this setback is with its Soviet ties deteriorating and the Vietnam War escalating, China became concerned of a possible nuclear attack. Mao Zedong ordered an evacuation of military and other key state enterprises away from the northeastern frontier, with Harbin being the core zone of this region, bordering the Soviet Union. During this Third Front Development Era of China, several major factories of Harbin were relocated to Southwestern Provinces including Gansu, Sichuan, Hunan and Guizhou, where they would be strategically secure in the event of a possible war. Some major universities of China were also moved out of Harbin, including Harbin Military Academy of Engineering (predecessor of Changsha's National University of Defense Technology) and Harbin Institute of Technology (Moved to Chongqing in 1969 and relocated to Harbin in 1973).\n\nNational economy and social service have obtained significant achievements since the Chinese economic reform first introduced in 1979. Harbin holds the China Harbin International economic and Trade Fair each year since 1990. Harbin once housed one of the largest Jewish communities in the Far East before World War II. It reached its peak in the mid-1920s when 25,000 European Jews lived in the city. Among them were the parents of Ehud Olmert, the former Prime Minister of Israel. In 2004, Olmert came to Harbin with an Israeli trade delegation to visit the grave of his grandfather in Huang Shan Jewish Cemetery, which had over 500 Jewish graves identified.On 5 October 1984, Harbin was designated a sub-provincial city by the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee. The eight counties of Harbin originally formed part of Songhuajiang Prefecture whose seat was practically located inside the urban area of Harbin since 1972. The prefecture was officially merged into Harbin city on 11 August 1996, increasing Harbin's total population to 9.47 million.Harbin hosted the third Asian Winter Games in 1996. In 2009, Harbin held the XXIV Winter Universiade.\nA memorial hall honoring Korean nationalist and independence activist Ahn Jung-geun was unveiled at Harbin Railway Station on 19 January 2014. Ahn assassinated four-time Prime Minister of Japan and former Resident-General of Korea It\u014d Hirobumi at No.1 platform of Harbin Railway Station on 26 October 1909, as Korea on the verge of annexation by Japan after the signing of the Eulsa Treaty. South Korean President Park Geun-Hye raised an idea of erecting a monument for Ahn while meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to China in June 2013. After that China began to build a memorial hall honoring Ahn at Harbin Railway Station. As the hall was unveiled on 19 January 2014, the Japanese side soon lodged protest with China over the construction of Ahn's memorial hall.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHarbin, with a total land area of 53,068 km2 (20,490 sq mi), is located in southern Heilongjiang province and is the provincial capital. The prefecture is also located at the southeastern edge of the Songnen Plain, a major part of China's Northeastern Plain. The city center also sits on the southern bank of the middle Songhua River. Harbin received its nickname The pearl on the swan's neck, since the shape of Heilongjiang resembles a swan. Its administrative area is rather large with latitude spanning 44\u00b0 04\u2032\u221246\u00b0 40\u2032 N, and longitude 125\u00b0 42\u2032\u2212130\u00b0 10' E. Neighbouring prefecture-level cities are Yichun to the north, Jiamusi and Qitaihe to the northeast, Mudanjiang to the southeast, Daqing to the west, and Suihua to the northwest. On its southwestern boundary is Jilin province. The main terrain of the city is generally flat and low-lyling, with an average elevation of around 150 metres (490 ft). However, the territory that comprises the 10 county-level divisions in the eastern part of the municipality consists of mountains and uplands. The easternmost part of Harbin prefecture also has extensive wetlands, mainly in Yilan County which is located at the southwestern edge of the Sanjiang Plain.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Harbin features a monsoon-influenced, humid continental climate (Dwa). Due to the Siberian high and its location above 45 degrees north latitude, the city is known for its cold weather and long winter. Its nickname Ice City is well-earned, as winters here are dry and freezing cold, with a 24-hour average in January of only \u221217.6 \u00b0C (0.3 \u00b0F), although the city sees little precipitation during the winter and is often sunny. Spring and autumn constitute brief transition periods with variable wind directions. Summers can be hot, with a July mean temperature of 23.1 \u00b0C (73.6 \u00b0F). Summer is also when most of the year's rainfall occurs, and more than half of the annual precipitation, at 538 millimetres (21.2 in), occurs in July and August alone. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 52 percent in December to 63 percent in March, the city receives 2,571 hours of bright sunshine annually; on average precipitation falls 104 days out of the year. The annual mean temperature is +4.86 \u00b0C (40.7 \u00b0F), and extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221242.6 \u00b0C (\u221245 \u00b0F) to 39.2 \u00b0C (103 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Harbin has direct jurisdiction over 9 districts, 2 county-level cities and 7 counties.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHarbin has the largest economy in Heilongjiang province. In 2013, Harbin's GDP totaled RMB501.08 billion, an increase of 8.9 percent over the previous year. The proportion of the three industries to the aggregate of GDP was 11.1:36.1:52.8 in 2012. The total value for imports and exports by the end of 2012 was US$5,330 million. In 2012, the working population reached 3.147 million. In 2015, Harbin had a GDP of RMB 575.12 billion.The chernozem soil in Harbin, called \"black earth\" is one of the most nutrient rich in all of China, making it valuable for cultivating food and textile-related crops. As a result, Harbin is China's base for the production of commodity grain and an ideal location for setting up agricultural businesses.\nHarbin also has industries such as light industry, textile, medicine, food, aircraft, automobile, metallurgy, electronics, building materials, and chemicals which help to form a fairly comprehensive industrial system. Several major corporations are based in the city. Harbin Electric Company Limited, Harbin Aircraft Industry Group and Northeast Light Alloy Processing Factory are some of key enterprises. Power manufacturing is a main industry in Harbin; hydro and thermal power equipment manufactured here makes up one-third of the total installed capacity in China. According to Platts, in 2009-10 Harbin Electric was the second largest manufacturer of steam turbines by worldwide market share, tying Dongfang Electric and slightly behind Shanghai Electric. Harbin Pharmaceutical Group, which mainly focus on research, development, manufacture and sale of medical products, is China's second-biggest pharmaceutical company by market value.Foreign investors seem upbeat about the city. Harbin International Trade and Economic Fair has been held annually since 1990. This investment and trade fair cumulatively attracting more than 1.9 million exhibitors and visitors from more than 80 countries and regions to attend, resulting over US$100 billion contract volume concluded according to the statistics of 2013. Harbin is among major destinations of FDI in Northeast China, with utilized FDI totaling US$980 million in 2013. After the 18th regular meeting between Sino-Russian Prime Ministers between Li Keqiang and Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev in October 2013, two sides come to make an agreement that the Harbin International Trade and Economic Fair will be renamed \"China-Russia EXPO\" and be co-sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, Heilongjiang Provincial government, the Russian Ministry of Economic Development and Russia's Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\nIn the financial sector, Longjiang Bank and Harbin Bank are some of the largest banks in Northeast China, with headquarters in Harbin. The latter ranks 4th by competitiveness among Chinese city commercial banks in 2011.In commerce, there is Qiulin Group, which owns Harbin's largest department store.\n\n\n=== Economic development zones and ports ===\nHarbin Economic & Technology Development Zone (National), mainly focus on telecommunications equipment, chemicals production and processing, automobile production/assembly, electronics, textiles, medical equipment and supplies.\nHarbin High and New Technological Development Zone, focus on optical-mechanical-electrical integration, biology, medicine, electronics and information technology.\nHarbin Pingfang Automobile Industrial Zone (Provincial), mainly focus on automobile production/assembly, electronics assembly & manufacturing, heavy industry, instruments & industrial equipment production.\nHarbin Limin Economic Development Zone (Provincial), mainly focus on trading and distribution, food/beverage processing, medical equipment and supplies, shipping/warehousing/logistics.\nHarbin PortHarbin Songbei Economic Development ZoneSongbei Economic Development Zone is located in Songbei District of Harbin. The zone has a planned area of 5.53 square kilometers. Electronics assembly & manufacturing, food and beverage processing are the encouraged industries in the zone. Many regional and provincial headquarters of large enterprises such as the China Datang Corporation, China Netcom and China Telecom have joined in this district, preliminary constituting the economy concentration zone of the local headquarters. Regional Scientific research centers including Harbin Science and Technology Innovation Center and Harbin International Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Center are also located in this development zone. Profit from these major research institutes, Harbin ranked 9th among 50 major Chinese cities in scientific and technological innovation ability in scientific and technological competitiveness ranking in 2006, as well as ranking 6th among Chinese cities in the amount of scientific and technological achievements.\nHarbin Economic and Technological Development Zone\nHarbin Economic and Technological Development Zone(HETDZ)  is one of the 90 national economical development zones of China. It was set up in June 1991, and was approved by the State Council as a national development zone in April 1993. In December 2012, Harbin High Technology Development Zone was merged into HETDZ. In 2009, the hi-tech zone was separated from HETDZ again. The area now has a total area of 18.5 square-kilometers in the centralized parks, subdivided into Nangang and Haping Road Centralized Parks.

          "To be honest I can't see that this is an attraction as such. Saying that it's a decent place to find somewhere to eat as a tourist and it's easy to walk down because there's no traffic. Maybe more interesting in the summer but just a street as far as I saw.",
          "Has a great collection of buildings and eateries. Visited it during its peek winter , where temperatures were around -44. There were tons of ice sculptures and even Mr.Gangnam style statue as well. It was great fun to visit this place with tons of places to visit near it.",

        "wiki": "Harbin (Manchu: \u1865\u1820\u182f\u182a\u1873\u1828 (); Chinese: \u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8 H\u0101'\u011brb\u012bn) is a sub-provincial city and the provincial capital of Heilongjiang province, People's Republic of China, as well as the second largest city by urban population and largest city by metropolitan population (urban and rural together) in Northeast China.  Harbin has direct jurisdiction over nine metropolitan districts, two county-level cities and seven counties, and is the eighth most populous Chinese city according to the 2010 census, the built-up area (which consists of all districts except Shuangcheng and Acheng) had 5,282,093 inhabitants, while the total metropolitan population was up to 10,635,971.  Harbin serves as a key political, economic, scientific, cultural and communications hub in Northeast China, as well as an important industrial base of the nation.Harbin, whose name was originally a Manchu word meaning \"a place for drying fishing nets\", grew from a small rural settlement on the Songhua River to become one of the largest cities in Northeast China. Founded in 1898 with the coming of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the city first prospered as a region inhabited by an overwhelming majority of immigrants from the Russian Empire.With its often harsh winters, Harbin is heralded as the Ice City (\u51b0\u57ce) for its well-known winter tourism and recreations. Harbin is notable for its ice sculpture festival in the winter. Besides being well known for its historical Russian legacy, the city serves as an important gateway in Sino-Russian trade today. In the 1920s, the city was considered China's fashion capital since new designs from Paris and Moscow reached here first before arriving in Shanghai. The city was voted \"China Top Tourist City\" by the China National Tourism Administration in 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nHuman settlement in the Harbin area dates from at least 2200 BC during the late Stone Age. Wanyan Aguda, the founder and first emperor (reigned 1115-1123) of the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), was born in the Jurchen Wanyan tribes who resided near the Ashi River in this region.  In AD 1115 Aguda established Jin's capital Shangjing (Upper Capital) Huining Prefecture in today's Acheng District of Harbin. After Aguda's death, the new emperor Wanyan Sheng ordered the construction of a new city on a uniform plan. The planning and construction emulated major Chinese cities, in particular Bianjing (Kaifeng), although the Jin capital was smaller than its Northern Song prototype. Huining Prefecture served as the first superior capital of the Jin empire until Wanyan Liang (the fourth emperor of Jin Dynasty) moved the capital to Yanjing (now Beijing) in 1153. Liang even went so far as to destroy all palaces in his former capital in 1157. Wanyan Liang's successor Wanyan Yong (Emperor Shizong) restored the city and established it as a secondary capital in 1173. Ruins of the Shangjing Huining Prefecture were discovered and excavated about 2 km (1.2 mi)from present-day Acheng's central urban area. The site of the old Jin capital ruins is a national historic reserve, and includes the Jin Dynasty History Museum. The museum, open to the public, was renovated in late 2005. Mounted statues of Aguda and of his chief commander Wanyan Zonghan (also Nianhan) stand in the grounds of the museum.\nMany of the artifacts found there are on display in nearby Harbin.\nAfter the Mongol conquest of the Jin Empire (1211\u20131234), Huining Prefecture was abandoned. In the 17th century, the Manchus used building materials from Huining Prefecture to construct their new stronghold in Alchuka. The region of Harbin remained largely rural until the 1800s, with over ten villages and about 30,000 people in the city's present-day urban districts by the end of the 19th century.\n\n\n=== International city ===\n\nA small village in 1898 grew into the modern city of Harbin. Polish engineer Adam Szyd\u0142owski drew plans for the city following the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which the Russian Empire had financed. The Russians selected Harbin as the base of their administration over this railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. The railways were largely constructed by Russian engineers and indentured workers. The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the Trans-Siberian Railway: substantially reducing the distance from Chita to Vladivostok and also linking the new port city of Dalny (Dalian) and the Russian Naval Base Port Arthur (L\u00fcshun). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a \"boomtown\", growing into a city within five years. The majority of settlers in Harbin came from southern Ukraine (Russian Empire). In addition to Ukrainians there were many Russians, Jews, Poles, Georgians, and Tatars.The city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar Simon Karlinsky, who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian Jewish family, wrote that in Harbin \"the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned\u2014well before the October Revolution\u2014by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners\", giving the city a very European appearance. Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms which soon turned Manchuria into the \"breadbasket of China\" while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize.  Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria.  A sign of Harbin's wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play K zvezdam by Leonid Andreyev had its premiere there.   \n\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies. Churches were rebuilt for Russian Orthodox, Lutheran/German Protestant, and Polish Catholic Christians. Chinese capitalists also established businesses, especially in brewing, food and textiles. Harbin became the economic hub of northeastern China and an international metropolis.The rapid growth of the city challenged the public healthcare system. The worst-ever recorded outbreak of pneumonic plague was spread to Harbin through the Trans-Manchurian railway from the border trade port of Manzhouli. The plague lasted from late autumn of 1910 to spring 1911 and killed 1,500 Harbin residents (mostly ethnic Chinese), or about five percent of its population at the time. This turned out to be the beginning of the large so-called Manchurian plague pandemic which ultimately claimed 60,000 victims. In the winter of 1910, Dr. Wu Lien-teh (later the founder of Harbin Medical University) was given instructions from the Foreign Office, Peking, to travel to Harbin to investigate the plague. Dr. Wu asked for imperial sanction to cremate plague victims, as cremation of these infected victims turned out to be the turning point of the epidemic. The suppression of this plague pandemic changed medical progress in China. Bronze statues of Dr. Wu Lien-teh are built in Harbin Medical University to remember his contributions in promoting public health, preventive medicine and medical education.The first generation of Harbin Russians were mostly the builders and employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They moved to Harbin in order to work on the railroad. At the time Harbin was not an established city. The city was almost built from scratch by the builders and early settlers. Houses were constructed, furniture and personal items were brought in from Russia. After the Manchurian plague epidemic, Harbin's population continued to increase sharply, especially inside the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. In 1913 the Chinese Eastern Railway census showed its ethnic composition as: Russians \u2013 34313, Chinese (that is, including Hans, Manchus etc.) \u2013 23537, Jews \u2013 5032, Poles \u2013 2556, Japanese \u2013 696, Germans \u2013 564, Tatars \u2013 234, Latvians \u2013 218, Georgians \u2013 183, Estonians \u2013 172, Lithuanians \u2013 142, Armenians \u2013 124; there were also Karaims, Ukrainians, Bashkirs, and some Western Europeans. In total, 68549 citizens of 53 nationalities, speaking 45 languages. Research shows that only 11.5 percent of all residents were born in Harbin. By 1917, Harbin's population exceeded 100,000, with over 40,000 of them were ethnic Russians.\n\nAfter Russia's Great October Socialist Revolution in November 1917, more than 100,000 defeated Russian White Guards and refugees retreated to Harbin, which became a major center of White Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s and the largest Russian enclave outside the Soviet Union. Karlinsky noted that a major difference with the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who arrived in Harbin was: \"Unlike the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who went to Paris or Prague or even to Shanghai, the new residents of Harbin were not a minority surrounded by a foreign population. They found themselves instead in an almost totally Russian city, populated mainly by people with roots in the south of European Russia.\" The city had a Russian school system, as well as publishers of Russian-language newspapers and journals. Russian Harbintsy community numbered around 120,000 at its peak in the early 1920s. Many of Harbin's Russians were wealthy, which sometime confused foreign visitors who expected them to be poor, with for instance the American writer Harry A. Franck in his 1923 book Wanderings in North China writing the Russian \"ladies as well gowned as at the Paris races [who] strolled with men faultlessly garbed by European standards\", leading him to wonder how they had achieved this \"deceptive appearance\".The Harbin Institute of Technology was established in 1920 as the Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry to educate railway engineers via a Russian method of instruction. Students could select from two majors at the time: Railway Construction or Electric Mechanic Engineering. On 2 April 1922, the school was renamed the Sino-Russian Industrial University. The original two majors eventually developed into two major departments: the Railway Construction Department and the Electric Engineering Department.  Between 1925 and 1928 the University's Rector was  Leonid Aleksandrovich Ustrugov, the Russian Deputy Minister of Railways under Nicholas II before the Russian Revolution, Minister of Railways under Admiral Kolchak's government, and a key figure in the development of the Chinese Eastern Railway.\nThe Russian community in Harbin made it their mission to preserve the pre-revolutionary culture of Russia. The city had numerous Russian language newspapers, journals, libraries, theaters and two opera companies. One of the famous Russian poets in Harbin was Valery Pereleshin, who started publishing his intensely homoerotic poetry in 1937, and was also one of the few Russian writers in Harbin who learned Mandarin. The subject of Pereleshin's poetry caused problems with the Russian Fascist Party, and led Pereelshin leaving Harbin for Shanghai, and ultimately to the United States. Not all of the Russian newspapers were of high quality, with Karlinsky calling Nash put', the newspaper of the Russian Fascist Party \"the lowest example of gutter journalism that Harbin had ever seen\". Nikolai Baikov, a Russian writer in Harbin was known for his novels of exile life in that city together with his accounts of his travels across Manchuria and the folklore of its Manchu and Chinese population. Boris Yulsky, a young Russian writer who published his short stories in the newspaper Rubezh was considered to be a promising writer whose career was cut short when he gave up literature for activism in the Russian Fascist Party and cocaine addiction. Moya-tvoya (mine \u2013 yours), a pidgin language that was a combination of Russian and Mandarin Chinese that had developed in the 19th century when Chinese went to work in Siberia, was considered essential by the Chinese business people of Harbin. \nIn the early 1920s, according to Chinese scholars' recent studies, over 20,000 Jews lived in Harbin. After 1919, Dr. Abraham Kaufman played a leading role in Harbin's large Russian Jewish community. The Republic of China discontinued diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1920, so many Russians found themselves stateless. When the Chinese Eastern Railway and government in Beijing announced in 1924 that they agreed the railroad would only employ Russian or Chinese nationals, the emigres were forced to announce their ethnic and political allegiance. Most accepted Soviet citizenship.\nThe Chinese warlord Zhang Xueliang, the \"Young Marshal\" seized the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929. Soviet military force quickly put an end to the crisis and forced the Nationalist Chinese to accept restoration of joint Soviet-Chinese administration of the railway.\n\n\n=== Japanese invasion period ===\n\nJapan invaded Manchuria outright after the Mukden Incident in September 1931. After the Japanese captured Qiqihar in the Jiangqiao Campaign, the Japanese 4th Mixed Brigade moved toward Harbin, closing in from the west and south. Bombing and strafing by Japanese aircraft forced the Chinese army to retreat from Harbin. Within a few hours the Japanese occupation of Harbin was complete.With the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, the so-called \"pacification of Manchukuo\" began, as volunteer armies continued to fight the Japanese. Harbin became a major operations base for the infamous medical experimenters of Unit 731, who killed people of all ages and ethnicities. All these units were known collectively as the Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department of the Kwantung Army. The main facility of the Unit 731 was built in 1935 at Pingfang District, approximately 24 km (15 mi) south of Harbin urban area at that time. Between 3,000 and 12,000 citizens including men, women, and children\u2014from which around 600 every year were provided by the Kempeitai\u2014died during the human experimentation conducted by Unit 731 at the camp based in Pingfang alone, which does not include victims from other medical experimentation sites. Almost 70 percent of the victims who died in the Pingfang camp were Chinese, including both civilian and military. Close to 30 percent of the victims were Russian. The Russian Fascist Party had the task of capturing \"unreliable\" Russians living in Harbin to hand over to Unit 731 to serve as the unwilling subjects of the gruesome experiments. Some others were South East Asians and Pacific Islanders, at the time colonies of the Empire of Japan, and a small number of the prisoners of war from the Allies of World War II (although many more Allied POWs were victims of Unit 731 at other sites). Prisoners of war were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia, after infected with various diseases. Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. Unit 731 and its affiliated units (Unit 1644 and Unit 100 among others) were involved in research, development, and experimental deployment of epidemic-creating biowarfare weapons in assaults against the Chinese populace (both civilian and military) throughout World War II. Human targets were also used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in different positions. Flame throwers were tested on humans. Humans were tied to stakes and used as targets to test germ-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, and explosive bombs. Twelve Unit 731 members were found guilty in the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials but later repatriated; others received secret immunity by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur before the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in exchange for biological warfare work in the Cold War for the American Force.\n\nChinese revolutionaries including Zhao Shangzhi, Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, Zhao Yiman continued to struggle against the Japanese in Harbin and its administrative area, commanding the main anti-Japanese guerrilla army-Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army\u2014which was originally organized by the Manchurian branch of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The army was supported by the Comintern after the CPC Manchurian Provincial Committee was dissolved in 1936.\n\nUnder the Manchukuo r\u00e9gime and Japanese occupation, Harbin Russians had a difficult time. In 1935, the Soviet Union sold the Chinese Eastern Railway (KVZhD) to the Japanese, and many Russian emigres left Harbin (48133 of them were arrested during the Soviet Great Purge between 1936 and 1938 as \"Japanese spies\"). Most departing Russians returned to the Soviet Union, but a substantial number moved south to Shanghai or emigrated to the United States and Australia. By the end of the 1930s, the Russian population of Harbin had dropped to around 30,000.Many of Harbin's Jews (13,000 in 1929) fled after the Japanese occupation as the Japanese associated closely with militant anti-Soviet Russian Fascists, whose ideology of anti-Bolshevism and nationalism was laced with virulent anti-Semitism. The Kwantung Army sponsored and financed the Russian Fascist Party, which after 1932 started to play an over-sized role in the Harbin's Russian community as its thugs began to harness and some times killed those opposed to it. Most Jews left for Shanghai, Tianjin, and the British Mandate of Palestine. In the late 1930s, some German Jews fleeing the Nazis moved to Harbin. Japanese officials later facilitated Jewish emigration to several cities in western Japan, notably Kobe, which came to have Japan's largest synagogue.\n\n\n=== After World War II ===\n\nThe Soviet Army took the city on 20 August 1945 and Harbin never came under the control of the Kuomintang, whose troops stopped 60 km (37 mi) short of the city. The city's administration was transferred by the departing Soviet Army to the Chinese People's Liberation Army in April 1946. On 28 April 1946, the communist government of Harbin was established, making the 700,000-citizen-city the first large city governed by the communists. During the short occupation of Harbin by the Soviet Army (August 1945 to April 1946), thousands of Russian emigres who have been identified as members of the Russian Fascist Party and fled communism after the Russian October Revolution, were forcibly deported to the Soviet Union. After 1952 the Soviet Union launched a second wave of immigration back to Russia. By 1964, the Russian population in Harbin had been reduced to 450. The rest of the European community (Russians, Germans, Poles, Greeks, etc.) emigrated during the years 1950\u201354 to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel and the US, or were repatriated to their home countries. By 1988 the original Russian community numbered just thirty, all of them elderly. Modern Russians living in Harbin mostly moved there in the 1990s and 2000s, and have no relation to the first wave of emigration.\nHarbin was one of the key construction cities of China during the First Five-Year Plan period from 1951 to 1956. 13 of the 156 key construction projects were aid-constructed by the Soviet Union in Harbin. This project made Harbin an important industrial base of China. During the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1961, Harbin experienced a very tortuous development course as several Sino-Soviet contracts were cancelled by the Soviet Union. During the Cultural Revolution many foreign and Christian things were uprooted, such as the St. Nicholas church which was destroyed by Red Guards in 1966. On 23 August 1966, the Red Guards stormed into St. Nicholas Cathedral, burned its icons on the streets while chanting xenophobic slogans before destroying St. Nicholas Cathedral.  As the normal economic and social order was seriously disrupted, Harbin's economy also suffered from serious setbacks. One of the main reasons of this setback is with its Soviet ties deteriorating and the Vietnam War escalating, China became concerned of a possible nuclear attack. Mao Zedong ordered an evacuation of military and other key state enterprises away from the northeastern frontier, with Harbin being the core zone of this region, bordering the Soviet Union. During this Third Front Development Era of China, several major factories of Harbin were relocated to Southwestern Provinces including Gansu, Sichuan, Hunan and Guizhou, where they would be strategically secure in the event of a possible war. Some major universities of China were also moved out of Harbin, including Harbin Military Academy of Engineering (predecessor of Changsha's National University of Defense Technology) and Harbin Institute of Technology (Moved to Chongqing in 1969 and relocated to Harbin in 1973).\n\nNational economy and social service have obtained significant achievements since the Chinese economic reform first introduced in 1979. Harbin holds the China Harbin International economic and Trade Fair each year since 1990. Harbin once housed one of the largest Jewish communities in the Far East before World War II. It reached its peak in the mid-1920s when 25,000 European Jews lived in the city. Among them were the parents of Ehud Olmert, the former Prime Minister of Israel. In 2004, Olmert came to Harbin with an Israeli trade delegation to visit the grave of his grandfather in Huang Shan Jewish Cemetery, which had over 500 Jewish graves identified.On 5 October 1984, Harbin was designated a sub-provincial city by the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee. The eight counties of Harbin originally formed part of Songhuajiang Prefecture whose seat was practically located inside the urban area of Harbin since 1972. The prefecture was officially merged into Harbin city on 11 August 1996, increasing Harbin's total population to 9.47 million.Harbin hosted the third Asian Winter Games in 1996. In 2009, Harbin held the XXIV Winter Universiade.\nA memorial hall honoring Korean nationalist and independence activist Ahn Jung-geun was unveiled at Harbin Railway Station on 19 January 2014. Ahn assassinated four-time Prime Minister of Japan and former Resident-General of Korea It\u014d Hirobumi at No.1 platform of Harbin Railway Station on 26 October 1909, as Korea on the verge of annexation by Japan after the signing of the Eulsa Treaty. South Korean President Park Geun-Hye raised an idea of erecting a monument for Ahn while meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to China in June 2013. After that China began to build a memorial hall honoring Ahn at Harbin Railway Station. As the hall was unveiled on 19 January 2014, the Japanese side soon lodged protest with China over the construction of Ahn's memorial hall.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHarbin, with a total land area of 53,068 km2 (20,490 sq mi), is located in southern Heilongjiang province and is the provincial capital. The prefecture is also located at the southeastern edge of the Songnen Plain, a major part of China's Northeastern Plain. The city center also sits on the southern bank of the middle Songhua River. Harbin received its nickname The pearl on the swan's neck, since the shape of Heilongjiang resembles a swan. Its administrative area is rather large with latitude spanning 44\u00b0 04\u2032\u221246\u00b0 40\u2032 N, and longitude 125\u00b0 42\u2032\u2212130\u00b0 10' E. Neighbouring prefecture-level cities are Yichun to the north, Jiamusi and Qitaihe to the northeast, Mudanjiang to the southeast, Daqing to the west, and Suihua to the northwest. On its southwestern boundary is Jilin province. The main terrain of the city is generally flat and low-lyling, with an average elevation of around 150 metres (490 ft). However, the territory that comprises the 10 county-level divisions in the eastern part of the municipality consists of mountains and uplands. The easternmost part of Harbin prefecture also has extensive wetlands, mainly in Yilan County which is located at the southwestern edge of the Sanjiang Plain.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Harbin features a monsoon-influenced, humid continental climate (Dwa). Due to the Siberian high and its location above 45 degrees north latitude, the city is known for its cold weather and long winter. Its nickname Ice City is well-earned, as winters here are dry and freezing cold, with a 24-hour average in January of only \u221217.6 \u00b0C (0.3 \u00b0F), although the city sees little precipitation during the winter and is often sunny. Spring and autumn constitute brief transition periods with variable wind directions. Summers can be hot, with a July mean temperature of 23.1 \u00b0C (73.6 \u00b0F). Summer is also when most of the year's rainfall occurs, and more than half of the annual precipitation, at 538 millimetres (21.2 in), occurs in July and August alone. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 52 percent in December to 63 percent in March, the city receives 2,571 hours of bright sunshine annually; on average precipitation falls 104 days out of the year. The annual mean temperature is +4.86 \u00b0C (40.7 \u00b0F), and extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221242.6 \u00b0C (\u221245 \u00b0F) to 39.2 \u00b0C (103 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Harbin has direct jurisdiction over 9 districts, 2 county-level cities and 7 counties.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHarbin has the largest economy in Heilongjiang province. In 2013, Harbin's GDP totaled RMB501.08 billion, an increase of 8.9 percent over the previous year. The proportion of the three industries to the aggregate of GDP was 11.1:36.1:52.8 in 2012. The total value for imports and exports by the end of 2012 was US$5,330 million. In 2012, the working population reached 3.147 million.

          "It is just a monument on the river, doesnt seem to have any English on it but does have a big height line. I would assume this is where the floodwaters got to. It would have put a lot of the riverside under water. Impressive nature",
          "Came here twice with my family members- once at night and during the day. Stalin Park is just next to this and must walk at night. At that time, there were works going on at Stalin Park and the monument as the workers and artists were busy carving ice and snow sculptures. It\u2019s",
          "This memorial tower is quite ordinary in structure and design, but its historical significance draws tourists to this tower. It commemorates the victory of the people during the great flood in 1957. Look out for the horizontal bar, which indicates the flood level at that time. I",
          "Located on the Songhua riverfront at the end of Harbin\u2019s most celebrated tourist street (Z.Y. Street), the Memorial is a monument to those Harbiners whose lives were impacted on by the 1957 flood catastrophe which swept the city. It honours both the victims and the heroes of the",
          "We were out and about shopping and spending time in Zhongyang Pedestrian Street and if you walk the entire length of the street, you\u2019ll come to this monument. It was constructed to honor those that saved the area from flooding. There were many people out and the atmosphere was",
          "Thia park very huge. They are stalin park, habin flood monumen in the same area. I come here when summer. The weather ia very nice. The breeze air and a sunlight. The weather around 23-25 degree celcius. Not too cool for eldery and children. There is big river that has boots",
          "You will enjoy taking pictures at the Memorial Tower. A lot of street vendors need by and can easily find different types of food with good price.",
          "Near to the Songhua river located within an open square. There is a shopping mall beside it. For me this is a photo spot so we just pay a short visit only. Visited on Dec 2018.",
          "Nothing much was happening within the square but there were a lot of people fishing in the SongHua river. This was June period so the river was not frozen. Just walk walk and see see lor, since we are here anyway.",

          "It\u2019s at the end of the beautiful and colorful walking street. There are a lot of different lights and displays coming off of the memorial. It really makes walking to the end of the pedestrian street a nice touch.",
          "The lights at night during the Harbin Winter Festival are pretty! Flood control was pretty much a necessity after a devastating flood in the 1950s.",

          "During the day, the monument and the pillar structure is ok but at night, it is brilliantly lit with color changing lights and also color changing and moving floodlights. There is a shopping center in front with food, stores, games and even a Walmart. It is at the end of the",

          "Situated at the end of the walking street, we thought this was a war memorial, as it appears to have statues of soldiers on the top. If you are really bored and have walked towards the lake it will pass a few minutes, but I wouldn't make a special trip to see it.",

          "Not sure what else to say. I can say I saw it. Appreciated it for a moment, and then moved on. Something to say you saw. It is a good landmark to know where you are too.",
          "I accidently stumbled upon this place as I was walking around the shops and headed to water with my friends eating the famous pudding pop. There is plenty things to do around i.e. the river front, the Wanda Imax movie, shops, food, the ice sculptures if you are there DEC -",

          "If you're going to Sun Island, you'll encounter the area. It's a monument, yes, and more of a place for sitting and taking it easy, watching the crowds. Lovely greenery in the area. Statues. Not exactly a place for spending a lot of time and seeing a lot, unless it's the",
          "Interesting and just another monument at the end of Zhongyang Pedestrian Street, nothing special to go out of your way to see.",
          "It's just some round circle lighted up statue. Did not listen what the guide said about this thing but all I know it's to commemorate the the flood. Go if you are a history lover haha.",
          "The flood that the monument commemorates was certainly tragic and worth remembering (so that it can hopefully be prevented in the future), but it's just a monument. So, why Tripadvisor is calling this a memorial tower is beyond me. The monument is at one end of Zhongyang",
          "I had lived in Harbin a decade ago and was returning with my now teenage twins and younger daughter. This place had stuck in my mind as a lovely place to wander with friends. Indeed, we were there with Chinese friends who also had young children. We saw cool kids on skateboards",
          "It's a memorial comemmorating the hellacious flood that inundated central Haerbin. That's it. Turn around, go back to the pedestrian shopping area, and find the side streets to the west, and go exploring THERE. You will see a few real vestiges of how the people lived in the",

          "This tower is just next to song hua river. The design of the tower is very good, it is attractive both in day or night. In night time, the lighting is well design that it creates an amazing view. This place is cleaned every morning and well maintained. Recommended place to visit.",
          "Not much here at the tower but just a few more steps to the frozen river.... you find some interesting fun activities on the frozen river. Walk over the gates and down the steps and ask the people running the activities for the price. The people on top at the tower are gauging",
          "The memorial tower is in front of the river and connects the river with the pedestrian area. Situated on a nice square with a bridge full of lights in the evening. From there you have a beautiful view of the river",

          "We just made a photo stop as part of a tour of the city sights. Nice enough, but you don't need much time here.",
          "There was a monument and a few people taking a few pics and selfies and that\u2019s it. There\u2019s not much else to see or do. After you take a few steps, you\u2019ll want to continue walking about 20 meters and take the steps out to the Songhua River as it\u2019s frozen during the winter time.",
          "Not much thought or creativeness was put into this monument I thought. In a city that is riddled with creative signs, landmarks and monuments, this was rather tame. I wouldn't go out my way to see this unless you're going for a stroll around the area which I did.",
          "Pretty crowded when everybody want to take a selfie of the monument..-) Nothing much to do except photo session. Just a memorial tower beside the frozen Songhua river.",
          "Unfortunately I had only a minute or two to check out the scene here. It was a lot of fun to watch the hordes of people down on the frozen river engaging in all sorts of outdoor activities. I suspect this would allow you to bike on the ice (etc.) without paying the admission",

          "It's a landmark that commemorates the victory of the fight against the 1957 flood. It's located in the Stalin Park and is on the opposite side of the Zhongyang Pedestrian Center Street (hence why it's achieving 'excellent reviews'). It's generally fairly crowed here and a prome",
          "Nothing impressive really. I visited in January, so had loads of fun on the frozen river. Other than that there's nothing much to do. Chaotic traffic real close to the monument and plenty sellers trying to force you their goods..",
          "We went passed the memorial \"obelisk\" to get to the river, as it was in December it had frozen over. The memorial \"obelisk\" is just to commemorate the building of the flood defences after the area got flooded around the 1950s. Much better things to see around the centre of",
          "I would advise you to visit this in the afternoon/evening when they have put the lights on. The monument itself is not so impressive. It commemorates the struggle to control the floods from the Songhau river. When illuminated from afternoon it is quit beautiful. Take a walk",
          "A visit to this city should include this riverfront. It is very beautiful at night. If you need a toilet there is a big one at the underground by MacDonald's.",
          "It's not a tower guys, it's an obelisk! The Flood Control Monument commemorates the reengineering of the Songhua River to prevent the periodic flooding that used to plague Harbin. The Monument stands at the top of Zhongyang Dajie - Harbin's pedestrian street - and really comes",
          "The square is located in the far end of the Central avenue so very easily accessible. That's also the reason why I have been there several times during my stay in Harbin when I was just hanging around. Daytime it is not so crowded but if you go there during the weekend and",
          "Here is a tower which was previously used to indicate any warning of any flood, this was also used as watch tower. I haven't visited the place but have seen it while passing in the car.",
          "This is the entrance (one of the entrances?) to the park along the river. It is a big, open plaza, with garden sculptures on the sides. Stroll on along the river a little bit. In the summer, it was very lively, with colorful ferries on the river and lots of tourists.",
          "I went in May and happen to go on a sunny blue sky day. This tower is located at the end of Zhongyang Road on the Songhua River. So it's worth visiting if you are walking on the very popular Zhongyang pedestrian street otherwise, your time is better spent on more popular views",
          "Coz i went there during autumn and around the golden week of china so the place was very crowded :( But its a good place for photo taking coz the view was awesome, it also surrounded by a lot of shopping mall, it just at the end of zhong yang dajie :)",
          "This is located at the end of the Pedestrian street and allows you to look over the river. The plaza area is surrounded by shops and Hotels. A good rest spot when you have to walk back down the Pedestrian street.",
          "The tower is just a monument, but the real fun is on the frozen river just next to the monument. There are so many things to do: ice skating, watching kids play top-spinning on the ice, sled down the hill (not expensive)",
          "We reached the monument after a 30 minute winter walk along Central (pedestrian) Street. What we found more spectacular than the monument was the view of hundreds, or maybe thousands of people enjoying activities on the frozen river.",
          "I visited this place in Januray and we were just frozen! Put on your warm clothes if you wanna visit the place! Also you can see crowded people here.",
          "This is neat memorial in the city. They keep this area kept up clean and updated. This is nice area to walk around and explore the history.",
          "so dont expect more than that. its just a monument with all it historical meant to be. if you dont know the history, than it will be just a monument",
          "I visited in winter to see the ice show and snow wonderland. So it was freezing cold. By the way if you go for a walk in winter along or even on the river and it happens you get too cold then near the monuments are some good public toilets which are heated (sauna like) so it's",
          "The Songhua River caused great destruction and this monument rightly acknowledges the sacrifices of the few. Good outlook onto the river in one direction and central street on the other.",
          "The plaza on which the Harbin Flood Control Memorial Tower stands has a commanding view of the river and is at the end of the Zhongyang Pedestrian Street, close to many shops and restaurants. We visited in late December and it was cold!",
          "memorial park commemorating more than century of deadly flooding in harbin - there are markers where the floodwaters reached. reminded me of the floods we experienced here in Phils.",
          "We only came to the memorial because we walked down Zhong Yang Street and wanted to see the river in all of its frozen splendor. I wouldn't make a trip just to see the memorial, although the history behind it is somewhat interesting.",
          "I'm not sure if this deserves a Certificate of Excellence. It was interesting at night, but that's because I visited around the Chinese Lantern Festival I think, and people were writing messages on these red balloons (like mini hot air balloons), which they would then light and",
          "On the river side, Harbin Flood Control Memorial Tower is the center of every tourists attraction. At th end of the central street, the memorial tower is not hard to find. Very Good",
          "A review for things to do in Harbin. Centre St.: This monument is at the end of the very popular Centre St. where there are lots of shops, and places to eat. My favorite is the popsicle shop. You cannot miss out on these popsicles, they've been around for a long time and",
          "What a great place to see the river and people watch. I had the opportunity to visit during the second Valantines day that they celebrate locally. Was great to see the love from the young people every where. I wish more places were this nice.",
          "A nice place to hang out during summer. There were many people at the square and the Song Hua river but we do not feel crowded as the place was very big. It was relaxing and fun seeing the locals enjoying themselves along the Song Hua river, dancing or fishing.",
          "It was just a little monument. I don't think it can be called a tower. Unless you know the history of Harbin, this won't really have much of a draw, other than proving you were in Harbin.",
          "As a child growing up in Haerbin, this monument served as a symbol of victory for me to achieve my dreams!! I absolutely love here! Revisited in Aug 2011, I loved Songhua River and this Memorial Tower! Reminds me of the older Soviet time hero's statue. Much more lovely at night",
          "The monument should be visited in daytime and nighttime. In the nighttime the flood control memorial tower has his better charm with all his lighting. We went back on Chinese New Year's day, very crowded of people strolling along the monument and the frozen river which has a lot",
          "If you are going to stroll Central Pedestrian Street, you should take in this photo opt as it is at the Song Hua River end of Central Street. No much except a very tall monument next to the river...",
          "Our visit to the Flood Control Tower was brief but informative, but the best part was all the different ice activities on the frozen river immediately adjacent to the tower. The ice water swimming had been cancelled the morning we were there (-20C), but there was atleast a dozen",
          "We visited the tower at night in the winter time and was very nice as it was all lit up. We didn't realize that just behind the tower you can go down onto the frozen river where you can see other ice sculptures, go snow tubing, dog sleds and a bunch of other activities! Very",
          "These days you don't see many examples of Socialist / Communist art in the streets of China, so this is a good chance to see an example of from the Marxist era. Here we have patriotic Marxist workers striking heroic poses in their efforts at flood control. It is pretty much just",
          "The Harbin Flood Control Monument is a landmark structure in the Stalin Park facing directly the Zhongyang Pedestrian Central Street. It commemorates the victory of the fight against the 1957 flood. You will visit both Stalin Park and Flood Control Monument at the same time. I",
          "I remember reading the history of the Flood Memorial Tower and was interested in having a look. I went to the Memorial Tower twice in the same day. Once during the day, it was a little hot, and then again at night. During the day was nice but at night it was most impressive.",
          "Visited it during the peak of winter, was amazed at how lively the place was. The fireworks and Laser show was pretty cool.There were rides nearby and loads of stuff to do. Its surrounded by malls and eateries as well. Its very easily accessible, as its pretty much in the center",
          "Although this is listed as an attraciton it is the kind of site that you can't help seeing as you move around the city. I basically just went passed it and with all the other things to see and do in the city I wouldn't put it on any list of lings to do. Nice to see, but not a",
          "A lot of scarf sellers are pushing to sell their scarf. Overall it is a very big round about with a lot of open space.",
          "The tower itself doesn't look very impressive, and without the benefit of a guide, it really didn't have any particular significance to us. They should either hire out audio guides, or offer short guided tours to explain the history and background of this landmark.",
          "This Place is quite interesting. The real adress is close to the River not in the beggining of the main street. Is all frozen full of chinesse people trying selling ice stuff or photos.",
          "best place at night.. hv good history behind this beautifull place.. when winter come all become frezze and we can play alot of games.. the nightboor very nice hv alot of restourant russian..",
          "I agree with other reviewers that in itself, the memorial is not spetacular to behold. Fortunately we have the benefit of a tour guide who told us of the heroic efforts of the citizens and Red Army who toiled tirelessly to prevent the river water from flowing to the town area.",
          "I guess it will be fantastic if I can walk on the frozen river. However, it's partially melted but its still a nice place to relax and trying to figure out what's across the river. Occasionally, you will see the train passing by the railway bridge across the river. Don't forget",
          "Beautiful lighting during night time. A place to go as it is part of the label in Harbin. Nearby the tower, there is a big Russian souvenir shop. I found that the items there are reasonable in price and lots of variety to chose from.",
          "The tower itself is a complete waste of time, neither interesting to look at nor spectacular in other way. The views of the river are great especially since it was frozen solid. Nice for photos as well. Where it gets dangerous are the activities. The nastiest of them is the ice",
          "The statue commemorates two floods (the levels are marked on the statue) when the upriver dam could not cope with the amount of water. The authorities acted to protect Harbin at the expense of smaller cities along the river where many lost their lives. The statue itself is not",
          "Not that interesting however, it commemorate a flood that I think happened in 1998. Although no information in English. it is beside Stain park so it is easy to see both.",
          "The actual Harbin Flood Control Memorial Tower is a monument for tourist to visit. Read up on its history and it sudenly becomes a little more interesting. The entire area is beautiful and the area is worth the visit. The tower it self is not awe inspiring but it is a monument",
          "The memorial area is nice place to visit. The river is an awesome river an this area is clean. There is a lot of history behind this",
          "The story behind the monument might be more interesting than the monument itself, though it is worth a visit to the river's edge and Center Street area that adjoins. Nice place to relax.",
          "If you happen to be strolling down Center Street, when you get to the end, this monument will be there. There were kids painting Chinese characters with water on the sidewalk, with big soft brushes for sale nearby - so that was kind of interesting - but the monument itself is",
          "This would not be a place where a tourist would visit especially. But this is the 'main gate' of Songhua River. In winter, when Songhua River freezes, there are Ice Slopes, Ice activities such as sledges, and even Taxi on the river! It's also a very unique experience to cross",
          "This is the place they remember the great flood. Also open space ofr activities and the Harbin Ice Restaurant with hot pot.",
          "its literally just one tower. there's not much to see there. you can take a few pictures in front of it and then go to the shore side for a stroll but that's about it. there are restaurants and stores by the flood control tower that are fun to visit.",

        "wiki": "Harbin (Manchu: \u1865\u1820\u182f\u182a\u1873\u1828 (); Chinese: \u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8 H\u0101'\u011brb\u012bn) is a sub-provincial city and the provincial capital of Heilongjiang province, People's Republic of China, as well as the second largest city by urban population and largest city by metropolitan population (urban and rural together) in Northeast China.  Harbin has direct jurisdiction over nine metropolitan districts, two county-level cities and seven counties, and is the eighth most populous Chinese city according to the 2010 census, the built-up area (which consists of all districts except Shuangcheng and Acheng) had 5,282,093 inhabitants, while the total metropolitan population was up to 10,635,971.  Harbin serves as a key political, economic, scientific, cultural and communications hub in Northeast China, as well as an important industrial base of the nation.Harbin, whose name was originally a Manchu word meaning \"a place for drying fishing nets\", grew from a small rural settlement on the Songhua River to become one of the largest cities in Northeast China. Founded in 1898 with the coming of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the city first prospered as a region inhabited by an overwhelming majority of immigrants from the Russian Empire.With its often harsh winters, Harbin is heralded as the Ice City (\u51b0\u57ce) for its well-known winter tourism and recreations. Harbin is notable for its ice sculpture festival in the winter. Besides being well known for its historical Russian legacy, the city serves as an important gateway in Sino-Russian trade today. In the 1920s, the city was considered China's fashion capital since new designs from Paris and Moscow reached here first before arriving in Shanghai. The city was voted \"China Top Tourist City\" by the China National Tourism Administration in 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nHuman settlement in the Harbin area dates from at least 2200 BC during the late Stone Age. Wanyan Aguda, the founder and first emperor (reigned 1115-1123) of the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), was born in the Jurchen Wanyan tribes who resided near the Ashi River in this region.  In AD 1115 Aguda established Jin's capital Shangjing (Upper Capital) Huining Prefecture in today's Acheng District of Harbin. After Aguda's death, the new emperor Wanyan Sheng ordered the construction of a new city on a uniform plan. The planning and construction emulated major Chinese cities, in particular Bianjing (Kaifeng), although the Jin capital was smaller than its Northern Song prototype. Huining Prefecture served as the first superior capital of the Jin empire until Wanyan Liang (the fourth emperor of Jin Dynasty) moved the capital to Yanjing (now Beijing) in 1153. Liang even went so far as to destroy all palaces in his former capital in 1157. Wanyan Liang's successor Wanyan Yong (Emperor Shizong) restored the city and established it as a secondary capital in 1173. Ruins of the Shangjing Huining Prefecture were discovered and excavated about 2 km (1.2 mi)from present-day Acheng's central urban area. The site of the old Jin capital ruins is a national historic reserve, and includes the Jin Dynasty History Museum. The museum, open to the public, was renovated in late 2005. Mounted statues of Aguda and of his chief commander Wanyan Zonghan (also Nianhan) stand in the grounds of the museum.\nMany of the artifacts found there are on display in nearby Harbin.\nAfter the Mongol conquest of the Jin Empire (1211\u20131234), Huining Prefecture was abandoned. In the 17th century, the Manchus used building materials from Huining Prefecture to construct their new stronghold in Alchuka. The region of Harbin remained largely rural until the 1800s, with over ten villages and about 30,000 people in the city's present-day urban districts by the end of the 19th century.\n\n\n=== International city ===\n\nA small village in 1898 grew into the modern city of Harbin. Polish engineer Adam Szyd\u0142owski drew plans for the city following the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which the Russian Empire had financed. The Russians selected Harbin as the base of their administration over this railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. The railways were largely constructed by Russian engineers and indentured workers. The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the Trans-Siberian Railway: substantially reducing the distance from Chita to Vladivostok and also linking the new port city of Dalny (Dalian) and the Russian Naval Base Port Arthur (L\u00fcshun). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a \"boomtown\", growing into a city within five years. The majority of settlers in Harbin came from southern Ukraine (Russian Empire). In addition to Ukrainians there were many Russians, Jews, Poles, Georgians, and Tatars.The city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar Simon Karlinsky, who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian Jewish family, wrote that in Harbin \"the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned\u2014well before the October Revolution\u2014by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners\", giving the city a very European appearance. Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms which soon turned Manchuria into the \"breadbasket of China\" while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize.  Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria.  A sign of Harbin's wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play K zvezdam by Leonid Andreyev had its premiere there.   \n\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies. Churches were rebuilt for Russian Orthodox, Lutheran/German Protestant, and Polish Catholic Christians. Chinese capitalists also established businesses, especially in brewing, food and textiles. Harbin became the economic hub of northeastern China and an international metropolis.The rapid growth of the city challenged the public healthcare system. The worst-ever recorded outbreak of pneumonic plague was spread to Harbin through the Trans-Manchurian railway from the border trade port of Manzhouli. The plague lasted from late autumn of 1910 to spring 1911 and killed 1,500 Harbin residents (mostly ethnic Chinese), or about five percent of its population at the time. This turned out to be the beginning of the large so-called Manchurian plague pandemic which ultimately claimed 60,000 victims. In the winter of 1910, Dr. Wu Lien-teh (later the founder of Harbin Medical University) was given instructions from the Foreign Office, Peking, to travel to Harbin to investigate the plague. Dr. Wu asked for imperial sanction to cremate plague victims, as cremation of these infected victims turned out to be the turning point of the epidemic. The suppression of this plague pandemic changed medical progress in China. Bronze statues of Dr. Wu Lien-teh are built in Harbin Medical University to remember his contributions in promoting public health, preventive medicine and medical education.The first generation of Harbin Russians were mostly the builders and employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They moved to Harbin in order to work on the railroad. At the time Harbin was not an established city. The city was almost built from scratch by the builders and early settlers. Houses were constructed, furniture and personal items were brought in from Russia. After the Manchurian plague epidemic, Harbin's population continued to increase sharply, especially inside the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. In 1913 the Chinese Eastern Railway census showed its ethnic composition as: Russians \u2013 34313, Chinese (that is, including Hans, Manchus etc.) \u2013 23537, Jews \u2013 5032, Poles \u2013 2556, Japanese \u2013 696, Germans \u2013 564, Tatars \u2013 234, Latvians \u2013 218, Georgians \u2013 183, Estonians \u2013 172, Lithuanians \u2013 142, Armenians \u2013 124; there were also Karaims, Ukrainians, Bashkirs, and some Western Europeans. In total, 68549 citizens of 53 nationalities, speaking 45 languages. Research shows that only 11.5 percent of all residents were born in Harbin. By 1917, Harbin's population exceeded 100,000, with over 40,000 of them were ethnic Russians.\n\nAfter Russia's Great October Socialist Revolution in November 1917, more than 100,000 defeated Russian White Guards and refugees retreated to Harbin, which became a major center of White Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s and the largest Russian enclave outside the Soviet Union. Karlinsky noted that a major difference with the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who arrived in Harbin was: \"Unlike the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who went to Paris or Prague or even to Shanghai, the new residents of Harbin were not a minority surrounded by a foreign population. They found themselves instead in an almost totally Russian city, populated mainly by people with roots in the south of European Russia.\" The city had a Russian school system, as well as publishers of Russian-language newspapers and journals. Russian Harbintsy community numbered around 120,000 at its peak in the early 1920s. Many of Harbin's Russians were wealthy, which sometime confused foreign visitors who expected them to be poor, with for instance the American writer Harry A. Franck in his 1923 book Wanderings in North China writing the Russian \"ladies as well gowned as at the Paris races [who] strolled with men faultlessly garbed by European standards\", leading him to wonder how they had achieved this \"deceptive appearance\".The Harbin Institute of Technology was established in 1920 as the Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry to educate railway engineers via a Russian method of instruction. Students could select from two majors at the time: Railway Construction or Electric Mechanic Engineering. On 2 April 1922, the school was renamed the Sino-Russian Industrial University. The original two majors eventually developed into two major departments: the Railway Construction Department and the Electric Engineering Department.  Between 1925 and 1928 the University's Rector was  Leonid Aleksandrovich Ustrugov, the Russian Deputy Minister of Railways under Nicholas II before the Russian Revolution, Minister of Railways under Admiral Kolchak's government, and a key figure in the development of the Chinese Eastern Railway.\nThe Russian community in Harbin made it their mission to preserve the pre-revolutionary culture of Russia. The city had numerous Russian language newspapers, journals, libraries, theaters and two opera companies. One of the famous Russian poets in Harbin was Valery Pereleshin, who started publishing his intensely homoerotic poetry in 1937, and was also one of the few Russian writers in Harbin who learned Mandarin. The subject of Pereleshin's poetry caused problems with the Russian Fascist Party, and led Pereelshin leaving Harbin for Shanghai, and ultimately to the United States. Not all of the Russian newspapers were of high quality, with Karlinsky calling Nash put', the newspaper of the Russian Fascist Party \"the lowest example of gutter journalism that Harbin had ever seen\". Nikolai Baikov, a Russian writer in Harbin was known for his novels of exile life in that city together with his accounts of his travels across Manchuria and the folklore of its Manchu and Chinese population. Boris Yulsky, a young Russian writer who published his short stories in the newspaper Rubezh was considered to be a promising writer whose career was cut short when he gave up literature for activism in the Russian Fascist Party and cocaine addiction. Moya-tvoya (mine \u2013 yours), a pidgin language that was a combination of Russian and Mandarin Chinese that had developed in the 19th century when Chinese went to work in Siberia, was considered essential by the Chinese business people of Harbin. \nIn the early 1920s, according to Chinese scholars' recent studies, over 20,000 Jews lived in Harbin. After 1919, Dr. Abraham Kaufman played a leading role in Harbin's large Russian Jewish community. The Republic of China discontinued diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1920, so many Russians found themselves stateless. When the Chinese Eastern Railway and government in Beijing announced in 1924 that they agreed the railroad would only employ Russian or Chinese nationals, the emigres were forced to announce their ethnic and political allegiance. Most accepted Soviet citizenship.\nThe Chinese warlord Zhang Xueliang, the \"Young Marshal\" seized the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929. Soviet military force quickly put an end to the crisis and forced the Nationalist Chinese to accept restoration of joint Soviet-Chinese administration of the railway.\n\n\n=== Japanese invasion period ===\n\nJapan invaded Manchuria outright after the Mukden Incident in September 1931. After the Japanese captured Qiqihar in the Jiangqiao Campaign, the Japanese 4th Mixed Brigade moved toward Harbin, closing in from the west and south. Bombing and strafing by Japanese aircraft forced the Chinese army to retreat from Harbin. Within a few hours the Japanese occupation of Harbin was complete.With the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, the so-called \"pacification of Manchukuo\" began, as volunteer armies continued to fight the Japanese. Harbin became a major operations base for the infamous medical experimenters of Unit 731, who killed people of all ages and ethnicities. All these units were known collectively as the Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department of the Kwantung Army. The main facility of the Unit 731 was built in 1935 at Pingfang District, approximately 24 km (15 mi) south of Harbin urban area at that time. Between 3,000 and 12,000 citizens including men, women, and children\u2014from which around 600 every year were provided by the Kempeitai\u2014died during the human experimentation conducted by Unit 731 at the camp based in Pingfang alone, which does not include victims from other medical experimentation sites. Almost 70 percent of the victims who died in the Pingfang camp were Chinese, including both civilian and military. Close to 30 percent of the victims were Russian. The Russian Fascist Party had the task of capturing \"unreliable\" Russians living in Harbin to hand over to Unit 731 to serve as the unwilling subjects of the gruesome experiments. Some others were South East Asians and Pacific Islanders, at the time colonies of the Empire of Japan, and a small number of the prisoners of war from the Allies of World War II (although many more Allied POWs were victims of Unit 731 at other sites). Prisoners of war were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia, after infected with various diseases. Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. Unit 731 and its affiliated units (Unit 1644 and Unit 100 among others) were involved in research, development, and experimental deployment of epidemic-creating biowarfare weapons in assaults against the Chinese populace (both civilian and military) throughout World War II. Human targets were also used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in different positions. Flame throwers were tested on humans. Humans were tied to stakes and used as targets to test germ-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, and explosive bombs. Twelve Unit 731 members were found guilty in the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials but later repatriated; others received secret immunity by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur before the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in exchange for biological warfare work in the Cold War for the American Force.\n\nChinese revolutionaries including Zhao Shangzhi, Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, Zhao Yiman continued to struggle against the Japanese in Harbin and its administrative area, commanding the main anti-Japanese guerrilla army-Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army\u2014which was originally organized by the Manchurian branch of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The army was supported by the Comintern after the CPC Manchurian Provincial Committee was dissolved in 1936.\n\nUnder the Manchukuo r\u00e9gime and Japanese occupation, Harbin Russians had a difficult time. In 1935, the Soviet Union sold the Chinese Eastern Railway (KVZhD) to the Japanese, and many Russian emigres left Harbin (48133 of them were arrested during the Soviet Great Purge between 1936 and 1938 as \"Japanese spies\"). Most departing Russians returned to the Soviet Union, but a substantial number moved south to Shanghai or emigrated to the United States and Australia. By the end of the 1930s, the Russian population of Harbin had dropped to around 30,000.Many of Harbin's Jews (13,000 in 1929) fled after the Japanese occupation as the Japanese associated closely with militant anti-Soviet Russian Fascists, whose ideology of anti-Bolshevism and nationalism was laced with virulent anti-Semitism. The Kwantung Army sponsored and financed the Russian Fascist Party, which after 1932 started to play an over-sized role in the Harbin's Russian community as its thugs began to harness and some times killed those opposed to it. Most Jews left for Shanghai, Tianjin, and the British Mandate of Palestine. In the late 1930s, some German Jews fleeing the Nazis moved to Harbin. Japanese officials later facilitated Jewish emigration to several cities in western Japan, notably Kobe, which came to have Japan's largest synagogue.\n\n\n=== After World War II ===\n\nThe Soviet Army took the city on 20 August 1945 and Harbin never came under the control of the Kuomintang, whose troops stopped 60 km (37 mi) short of the city. The city's administration was transferred by the departing Soviet Army to the Chinese People's Liberation Army in April 1946. On 28 April 1946, the communist government of Harbin was established, making the 700,000-citizen-city the first large city governed by the communists. During the short occupation of Harbin by the Soviet Army (August 1945 to April 1946), thousands of Russian emigres who have been identified as members of the Russian Fascist Party and fled communism after the Russian October Revolution, were forcibly deported to the Soviet Union. After 1952 the Soviet Union launched a second wave of immigration back to Russia. By 1964, the Russian population in Harbin had been reduced to 450. The rest of the European community (Russians, Germans, Poles, Greeks, etc.) emigrated during the years 1950\u201354 to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel and the US, or were repatriated to their home countries. By 1988 the original Russian community numbered just thirty, all of them elderly. Modern Russians living in Harbin mostly moved there in the 1990s and 2000s, and have no relation to the first wave of emigration.\nHarbin was one of the key construction cities of China during the First Five-Year Plan period from 1951 to 1956. 13 of the 156 key construction projects were aid-constructed by the Soviet Union in Harbin. This project made Harbin an important industrial base of China. During the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1961, Harbin experienced a very tortuous development course as several Sino-Soviet contracts were cancelled by the Soviet Union. During the Cultural Revolution many foreign and Christian things were uprooted, such as the St. Nicholas church which was destroyed by Red Guards in 1966. On 23 August 1966, the Red Guards stormed into St. Nicholas Cathedral, burned its icons on the streets while chanting xenophobic slogans before destroying St. Nicholas Cathedral.  As the normal economic and social order was seriously disrupted, Harbin's economy also suffered from serious setbacks. One of the main reasons of this setback is with its Soviet ties deteriorating and the Vietnam War escalating, China became concerned of a possible nuclear attack. Mao Zedong ordered an evacuation of military and other key state enterprises away from the northeastern frontier, with Harbin being the core zone of this region, bordering the Soviet Union. During this Third Front Development Era of China, several major factories of Harbin were relocated to Southwestern Provinces including Gansu, Sichuan, Hunan and Guizhou, where they would be strategically secure in the event of a possible war. Some major universities of China were also moved out of Harbin, including Harbin Military Academy of Engineering (predecessor of Changsha's National University of Defense Technology) and Harbin Institute of Technology (Moved to Chongqing in 1969 and relocated to Harbin in 1973).\n\nNational economy and social service have obtained significant achievements since the Chinese economic reform first introduced in 1979. Harbin holds the China Harbin International economic and Trade Fair each year since 1990. Harbin once housed one of the largest Jewish communities in the Far East before World War II. It reached its peak in the mid-1920s when 25,000 European Jews lived in the city. Among them were the parents of Ehud Olmert, the former Prime Minister of Israel. In 2004, Olmert came to Harbin with an Israeli trade delegation to visit the grave of his grandfather in Huang Shan Jewish Cemetery, which had over 500 Jewish graves identified.On 5 October 1984, Harbin was designated a sub-provincial city by the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee. The eight counties of Harbin originally formed part of Songhuajiang Prefecture whose seat was practically located inside the urban area of Harbin since 1972. The prefecture was officially merged into Harbin city on 11 August 1996, increasing Harbin's total population to 9.47 million.Harbin hosted the third Asian Winter Games in 1996. In 2009, Harbin held the XXIV Winter Universiade.\nA memorial hall honoring Korean nationalist and independence activist Ahn Jung-geun was unveiled at Harbin Railway Station on 19 January 2014. Ahn assassinated four-time Prime Minister of Japan and former Resident-General of Korea It\u014d Hirobumi at No.1 platform of Harbin Railway Station on 26 October 1909, as Korea on the verge of annexation by Japan after the signing of the Eulsa Treaty. South Korean President Park Geun-Hye raised an idea of erecting a monument for Ahn while meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to China in June 2013. After that China began to build a memorial hall honoring Ahn at Harbin Railway Station. As the hall was unveiled on 19 January 2014, the Japanese side soon lodged protest with China over the construction of Ahn's memorial hall.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHarbin, with a total land area of 53,068 km2 (20,490 sq mi), is located in southern Heilongjiang province and is the provincial capital. The prefecture is also located at the southeastern edge of the Songnen Plain, a major part of China's Northeastern Plain. The city center also sits on the southern bank of the middle Songhua River. Harbin received its nickname The pearl on the swan's neck, since the shape of Heilongjiang resembles a swan. Its administrative area is rather large with latitude spanning 44\u00b0 04\u2032\u221246\u00b0 40\u2032 N, and longitude 125\u00b0 42\u2032\u2212130\u00b0 10' E. Neighbouring prefecture-level cities are Yichun to the north, Jiamusi and Qitaihe to the northeast, Mudanjiang to the southeast, Daqing to the west, and Suihua to the northwest. On its southwestern boundary is Jilin province. The main terrain of the city is generally flat and low-lyling, with an average elevation of around 150 metres (490 ft). However, the territory that comprises the 10 county-level divisions in the eastern part of the municipality consists of mountains and uplands. The easternmost part of Harbin prefecture also has extensive wetlands, mainly in Yilan County which is located at the southwestern edge of the Sanjiang Plain.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Harbin features a monsoon-influenced, humid continental climate (Dwa). Due to the Siberian high and its location above 45 degrees north latitude, the city is known for its cold weather and long winter. Its nickname Ice City is well-earned, as winters here are dry and freezing cold, with a 24-hour average in January of only \u221217.6 \u00b0C (0.3 \u00b0F), although the city sees little precipitation during the winter and is often sunny. Spring and autumn constitute brief transition periods with variable wind directions. Summers can be hot, with a July mean temperature of 23.1 \u00b0C (73.6 \u00b0F). Summer is also when most of the year's rainfall occurs, and more than half of the annual precipitation, at 538 millimetres (21.2 in), occurs in July and August alone. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 52 percent in December to 63 percent in March, the city receives 2,571 hours of bright sunshine annually; on average precipitation falls 104 days out of the year. The annual mean temperature is +4.86 \u00b0C (40.7 \u00b0F), and extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221242.6 \u00b0C (\u221245 \u00b0F) to 39.2 \u00b0C (103 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Harbin has direct jurisdiction over 9 districts, 2 county-level cities and 7 counties.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHarbin has the largest economy in Heilongjiang province. In 2013, Harbin's GDP totaled RMB501.08 billion, an increase of 8.9 percent over the previous year. The proportion of the three industries to the aggregate of GDP was 11.1:36.1:52.8 in 2012. The total value for imports and exports by the end of 2012 was US$5,330 million. In 2012, the working population reached 3.147 million.

        "wiki": "Harbin (Manchu: \u1865\u1820\u182f\u182a\u1873\u1828 (); Chinese: \u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8 H\u0101'\u011brb\u012bn) is a sub-provincial city and the provincial capital of Heilongjiang province, People's Republic of China, as well as the second largest city by urban population and largest city by metropolitan population (urban and rural together) in Northeast China.  Harbin has direct jurisdiction over nine metropolitan districts, two county-level cities and seven counties, and is the eighth most populous Chinese city according to the 2010 census, the built-up area (which consists of all districts except Shuangcheng and Acheng) had 5,282,093 inhabitants, while the total metropolitan population was up to 10,635,971.  Harbin serves as a key political, economic, scientific, cultural and communications hub in Northeast China, as well as an important industrial base of the nation.Harbin, whose name was originally a Manchu word meaning \"a place for drying fishing nets\", grew from a small rural settlement on the Songhua River to become one of the largest cities in Northeast China. Founded in 1898 with the coming of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the city first prospered as a region inhabited by an overwhelming majority of immigrants from the Russian Empire.With its often harsh winters, Harbin is heralded as the Ice City (\u51b0\u57ce) for its well-known winter tourism and recreations. Harbin is notable for its ice sculpture festival in the winter. Besides being well known for its historical Russian legacy, the city serves as an important gateway in Sino-Russian trade today. In the 1920s, the city was considered China's fashion capital since new designs from Paris and Moscow reached here first before arriving in Shanghai. The city was voted \"China Top Tourist City\" by the China National Tourism Administration in 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nHuman settlement in the Harbin area dates from at least 2200 BC during the late Stone Age. Wanyan Aguda, the founder and first emperor (reigned 1115-1123) of the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), was born in the Jurchen Wanyan tribes who resided near the Ashi River in this region.  In AD 1115 Aguda established Jin's capital Shangjing (Upper Capital) Huining Prefecture in today's Acheng District of Harbin. After Aguda's death, the new emperor Wanyan Sheng ordered the construction of a new city on a uniform plan. The planning and construction emulated major Chinese cities, in particular Bianjing (Kaifeng), although the Jin capital was smaller than its Northern Song prototype. Huining Prefecture served as the first superior capital of the Jin empire until Wanyan Liang (the fourth emperor of Jin Dynasty) moved the capital to Yanjing (now Beijing) in 1153. Liang even went so far as to destroy all palaces in his former capital in 1157. Wanyan Liang's successor Wanyan Yong (Emperor Shizong) restored the city and established it as a secondary capital in 1173. Ruins of the Shangjing Huining Prefecture were discovered and excavated about 2 km (1.2 mi)from present-day Acheng's central urban area. The site of the old Jin capital ruins is a national historic reserve, and includes the Jin Dynasty History Museum. The museum, open to the public, was renovated in late 2005. Mounted statues of Aguda and of his chief commander Wanyan Zonghan (also Nianhan) stand in the grounds of the museum.\nMany of the artifacts found there are on display in nearby Harbin.\nAfter the Mongol conquest of the Jin Empire (1211\u20131234), Huining Prefecture was abandoned. In the 17th century, the Manchus used building materials from Huining Prefecture to construct their new stronghold in Alchuka. The region of Harbin remained largely rural until the 1800s, with over ten villages and about 30,000 people in the city's present-day urban districts by the end of the 19th century.\n\n\n=== International city ===\n\nA small village in 1898 grew into the modern city of Harbin. Polish engineer Adam Szyd\u0142owski drew plans for the city following the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which the Russian Empire had financed. The Russians selected Harbin as the base of their administration over this railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. The railways were largely constructed by Russian engineers and indentured workers. The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the Trans-Siberian Railway: substantially reducing the distance from Chita to Vladivostok and also linking the new port city of Dalny (Dalian) and the Russian Naval Base Port Arthur (L\u00fcshun). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a \"boomtown\", growing into a city within five years. The majority of settlers in Harbin came from southern Ukraine (Russian Empire). In addition to Ukrainians there were many Russians, Jews, Poles, Georgians, and Tatars.The city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar Simon Karlinsky, who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian Jewish family, wrote that in Harbin \"the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned\u2014well before the October Revolution\u2014by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners\", giving the city a very European appearance. Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms which soon turned Manchuria into the \"breadbasket of China\" while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize.  Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria.  A sign of Harbin's wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play K zvezdam by Leonid Andreyev had its premiere there.   \n\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies. Churches were rebuilt for Russian Orthodox, Lutheran/German Protestant, and Polish Catholic Christians. Chinese capitalists also established businesses, especially in brewing, food and textiles. Harbin became the economic hub of northeastern China and an international metropolis.The rapid growth of the city challenged the public healthcare system. The worst-ever recorded outbreak of pneumonic plague was spread to Harbin through the Trans-Manchurian railway from the border trade port of Manzhouli. The plague lasted from late autumn of 1910 to spring 1911 and killed 1,500 Harbin residents (mostly ethnic Chinese), or about five percent of its population at the time. This turned out to be the beginning of the large so-called Manchurian plague pandemic which ultimately claimed 60,000 victims. In the winter of 1910, Dr. Wu Lien-teh (later the founder of Harbin Medical University) was given instructions from the Foreign Office, Peking, to travel to Harbin to investigate the plague. Dr. Wu asked for imperial sanction to cremate plague victims, as cremation of these infected victims turned out to be the turning point of the epidemic. The suppression of this plague pandemic changed medical progress in China. Bronze statues of Dr. Wu Lien-teh are built in Harbin Medical University to remember his contributions in promoting public health, preventive medicine and medical education.The first generation of Harbin Russians were mostly the builders and employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They moved to Harbin in order to work on the railroad. At the time Harbin was not an established city. The city was almost built from scratch by the builders and early settlers. Houses were constructed, furniture and personal items were brought in from Russia. After the Manchurian plague epidemic, Harbin's population continued to increase sharply, especially inside the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. In 1913 the Chinese Eastern Railway census showed its ethnic composition as: Russians \u2013 34313, Chinese (that is, including Hans, Manchus etc.) \u2013 23537, Jews \u2013 5032, Poles \u2013 2556, Japanese \u2013 696, Germans \u2013 564, Tatars \u2013 234, Latvians \u2013 218, Georgians \u2013 183, Estonians \u2013 172, Lithuanians \u2013 142, Armenians \u2013 124; there were also Karaims, Ukrainians, Bashkirs, and some Western Europeans. In total, 68549 citizens of 53 nationalities, speaking 45 languages. Research shows that only 11.5 percent of all residents were born in Harbin. By 1917, Harbin's population exceeded 100,000, with over 40,000 of them were ethnic Russians.\n\nAfter Russia's Great October Socialist Revolution in November 1917, more than 100,000 defeated Russian White Guards and refugees retreated to Harbin, which became a major center of White Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s and the largest Russian enclave outside the Soviet Union. Karlinsky noted that a major difference with the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who arrived in Harbin was: \"Unlike the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who went to Paris or Prague or even to Shanghai, the new residents of Harbin were not a minority surrounded by a foreign population. They found themselves instead in an almost totally Russian city, populated mainly by people with roots in the south of European Russia.\" The city had a Russian school system, as well as publishers of Russian-language newspapers and journals. Russian Harbintsy community numbered around 120,000 at its peak in the early 1920s. Many of Harbin's Russians were wealthy, which sometime confused foreign visitors who expected them to be poor, with for instance the American writer Harry A. Franck in his 1923 book Wanderings in North China writing the Russian \"ladies as well gowned as at the Paris races [who] strolled with men faultlessly garbed by European standards\", leading him to wonder how they had achieved this \"deceptive appearance\".The Harbin Institute of Technology was established in 1920 as the Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry to educate railway engineers via a Russian method of instruction. Students could select from two majors at the time: Railway Construction or Electric Mechanic Engineering. On 2 April 1922, the school was renamed the Sino-Russian Industrial University. The original two majors eventually developed into two major departments: the Railway Construction Department and the Electric Engineering Department.  Between 1925 and 1928 the University's Rector was  Leonid Aleksandrovich Ustrugov, the Russian Deputy Minister of Railways under Nicholas II before the Russian Revolution, Minister of Railways under Admiral Kolchak's government, and a key figure in the development of the Chinese Eastern Railway.\nThe Russian community in Harbin made it their mission to preserve the pre-revolutionary culture of Russia. The city had numerous Russian language newspapers, journals, libraries, theaters and two opera companies. One of the famous Russian poets in Harbin was Valery Pereleshin, who started publishing his intensely homoerotic poetry in 1937, and was also one of the few Russian writers in Harbin who learned Mandarin. The subject of Pereleshin's poetry caused problems with the Russian Fascist Party, and led Pereelshin leaving Harbin for Shanghai, and ultimately to the United States. Not all of the Russian newspapers were of high quality, with Karlinsky calling Nash put', the newspaper of the Russian Fascist Party \"the lowest example of gutter journalism that Harbin had ever seen\". Nikolai Baikov, a Russian writer in Harbin was known for his novels of exile life in that city together with his accounts of his travels across Manchuria and the folklore of its Manchu and Chinese population. Boris Yulsky, a young Russian writer who published his short stories in the newspaper Rubezh was considered to be a promising writer whose career was cut short when he gave up literature for activism in the Russian Fascist Party and cocaine addiction. Moya-tvoya (mine \u2013 yours), a pidgin language that was a combination of Russian and Mandarin Chinese that had developed in the 19th century when Chinese went to work in Siberia, was considered essential by the Chinese business people of Harbin. \nIn the early 1920s, according to Chinese scholars' recent studies, over 20,000 Jews lived in Harbin. After 1919, Dr. Abraham Kaufman played a leading role in Harbin's large Russian Jewish community. The Republic of China discontinued diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1920, so many Russians found themselves stateless. When the Chinese Eastern Railway and government in Beijing announced in 1924 that they agreed the railroad would only employ Russian or Chinese nationals, the emigres were forced to announce their ethnic and political allegiance. Most accepted Soviet citizenship.\nThe Chinese warlord Zhang Xueliang, the \"Young Marshal\" seized the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929. Soviet military force quickly put an end to the crisis and forced the Nationalist Chinese to accept restoration of joint Soviet-Chinese administration of the railway.\n\n\n=== Japanese invasion period ===\n\nJapan invaded Manchuria outright after the Mukden Incident in September 1931. After the Japanese captured Qiqihar in the Jiangqiao Campaign, the Japanese 4th Mixed Brigade moved toward Harbin, closing in from the west and south. Bombing and strafing by Japanese aircraft forced the Chinese army to retreat from Harbin. Within a few hours the Japanese occupation of Harbin was complete.With the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, the so-called \"pacification of Manchukuo\" began, as volunteer armies continued to fight the Japanese. Harbin became a major operations base for the infamous medical experimenters of Unit 731, who killed people of all ages and ethnicities. All these units were known collectively as the Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department of the Kwantung Army. The main facility of the Unit 731 was built in 1935 at Pingfang District, approximately 24 km (15 mi) south of Harbin urban area at that time. Between 3,000 and 12,000 citizens including men, women, and children\u2014from which around 600 every year were provided by the Kempeitai\u2014died during the human experimentation conducted by Unit 731 at the camp based in Pingfang alone, which does not include victims from other medical experimentation sites. Almost 70 percent of the victims who died in the Pingfang camp were Chinese, including both civilian and military. Close to 30 percent of the victims were Russian. The Russian Fascist Party had the task of capturing \"unreliable\" Russians living in Harbin to hand over to Unit 731 to serve as the unwilling subjects of the gruesome experiments. Some others were South East Asians and Pacific Islanders, at the time colonies of the Empire of Japan, and a small number of the prisoners of war from the Allies of World War II (although many more Allied POWs were victims of Unit 731 at other sites). Prisoners of war were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia, after infected with various diseases. Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. Unit 731 and its affiliated units (Unit 1644 and Unit 100 among others) were involved in research, development, and experimental deployment of epidemic-creating biowarfare weapons in assaults against the Chinese populace (both civilian and military) throughout World War II. Human targets were also used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in different positions. Flame throwers were tested on humans. Humans were tied to stakes and used as targets to test germ-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, and explosive bombs. Twelve Unit 731 members were found guilty in the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials but later repatriated; others received secret immunity by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur before the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in exchange for biological warfare work in the Cold War for the American Force.\n\nChinese revolutionaries including Zhao Shangzhi, Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, Zhao Yiman continued to struggle against the Japanese in Harbin and its administrative area, commanding the main anti-Japanese guerrilla army-Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army\u2014which was originally organized by the Manchurian branch of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The army was supported by the Comintern after the CPC Manchurian Provincial Committee was dissolved in 1936.\n\nUnder the Manchukuo r\u00e9gime and Japanese occupation, Harbin Russians had a difficult time. In 1935, the Soviet Union sold the Chinese Eastern Railway (KVZhD) to the Japanese, and many Russian emigres left Harbin (48133 of them were arrested during the Soviet Great Purge between 1936 and 1938 as \"Japanese spies\"). Most departing Russians returned to the Soviet Union, but a substantial number moved south to Shanghai or emigrated to the United States and Australia. By the end of the 1930s, the Russian population of Harbin had dropped to around 30,000.Many of Harbin's Jews (13,000 in 1929) fled after the Japanese occupation as the Japanese associated closely with militant anti-Soviet Russian Fascists, whose ideology of anti-Bolshevism and nationalism was laced with virulent anti-Semitism. The Kwantung Army sponsored and financed the Russian Fascist Party, which after 1932 started to play an over-sized role in the Harbin's Russian community as its thugs began to harness and some times killed those opposed to it. Most Jews left for Shanghai, Tianjin, and the British Mandate of Palestine. In the late 1930s, some German Jews fleeing the Nazis moved to Harbin. Japanese officials later facilitated Jewish emigration to several cities in western Japan, notably Kobe, which came to have Japan's largest synagogue.\n\n\n=== After World War II ===\n\nThe Soviet Army took the city on 20 August 1945 and Harbin never came under the control of the Kuomintang, whose troops stopped 60 km (37 mi) short of the city. The city's administration was transferred by the departing Soviet Army to the Chinese People's Liberation Army in April 1946. On 28 April 1946, the communist government of Harbin was established, making the 700,000-citizen-city the first large city governed by the communists. During the short occupation of Harbin by the Soviet Army (August 1945 to April 1946), thousands of Russian emigres who have been identified as members of the Russian Fascist Party and fled communism after the Russian October Revolution, were forcibly deported to the Soviet Union. After 1952 the Soviet Union launched a second wave of immigration back to Russia. By 1964, the Russian population in Harbin had been reduced to 450. The rest of the European community (Russians, Germans, Poles, Greeks, etc.) emigrated during the years 1950\u201354 to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel and the US, or were repatriated to their home countries. By 1988 the original Russian community numbered just thirty, all of them elderly. Modern Russians living in Harbin mostly moved there in the 1990s and 2000s, and have no relation to the first wave of emigration.\nHarbin was one of the key construction cities of China during the First Five-Year Plan period from 1951 to 1956. 13 of the 156 key construction projects were aid-constructed by the Soviet Union in Harbin. This project made Harbin an important industrial base of China. During the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1961, Harbin experienced a very tortuous development course as several Sino-Soviet contracts were cancelled by the Soviet Union. During the Cultural Revolution many foreign and Christian things were uprooted, such as the St. Nicholas church which was destroyed by Red Guards in 1966. On 23 August 1966, the Red Guards stormed into St. Nicholas Cathedral, burned its icons on the streets while chanting xenophobic slogans before destroying St. Nicholas Cathedral.  As the normal economic and social order was seriously disrupted, Harbin's economy also suffered from serious setbacks. One of the main reasons of this setback is with its Soviet ties deteriorating and the Vietnam War escalating, China became concerned of a possible nuclear attack. Mao Zedong ordered an evacuation of military and other key state enterprises away from the northeastern frontier, with Harbin being the core zone of this region, bordering the Soviet Union. During this Third Front Development Era of China, several major factories of Harbin were relocated to Southwestern Provinces including Gansu, Sichuan, Hunan and Guizhou, where they would be strategically secure in the event of a possible war. Some major universities of China were also moved out of Harbin, including Harbin Military Academy of Engineering (predecessor of Changsha's National University of Defense Technology) and Harbin Institute of Technology (Moved to Chongqing in 1969 and relocated to Harbin in 1973).\n\nNational economy and social service have obtained significant achievements since the Chinese economic reform first introduced in 1979. Harbin holds the China Harbin International economic and Trade Fair each year since 1990. Harbin once housed one of the largest Jewish communities in the Far East before World War II. It reached its peak in the mid-1920s when 25,000 European Jews lived in the city. Among them were the parents of Ehud Olmert, the former Prime Minister of Israel. In 2004, Olmert came to Harbin with an Israeli trade delegation to visit the grave of his grandfather in Huang Shan Jewish Cemetery, which had over 500 Jewish graves identified.On 5 October 1984, Harbin was designated a sub-provincial city by the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee. The eight counties of Harbin originally formed part of Songhuajiang Prefecture whose seat was practically located inside the urban area of Harbin since 1972. The prefecture was officially merged into Harbin city on 11 August 1996, increasing Harbin's total population to 9.47 million.Harbin hosted the third Asian Winter Games in 1996. In 2009, Harbin held the XXIV Winter Universiade.\nA memorial hall honoring Korean nationalist and independence activist Ahn Jung-geun was unveiled at Harbin Railway Station on 19 January 2014. Ahn assassinated four-time Prime Minister of Japan and former Resident-General of Korea It\u014d Hirobumi at No.1 platform of Harbin Railway Station on 26 October 1909, as Korea on the verge of annexation by Japan after the signing of the Eulsa Treaty. South Korean President Park Geun-Hye raised an idea of erecting a monument for Ahn while meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to China in June 2013. After that China began to build a memorial hall honoring Ahn at Harbin Railway Station. As the hall was unveiled on 19 January 2014, the Japanese side soon lodged protest with China over the construction of Ahn's memorial hall.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHarbin, with a total land area of 53,068 km2 (20,490 sq mi), is located in southern Heilongjiang province and is the provincial capital.

The cuisine of Harbin consists of European dishes and Northern Chinese dishes mainly typified by heavy sauce and deep-frying.One of the most famous dishes in Northeastern Chinese cuisine is Guo Bao Rou, a form of sweet and sour pork. It is a classic dish from Harbin which originated in the early 20th century in Daotai Fu (pinyin: D\u00e0ot\u00e1i F\u01d4). It consists of a bite-sized pieces of pork in a potato starch batter, deep-fried until crispy. They are then lightly coated in a variation of a sweet and sour sauce, made from freshly prepared syrup, rice vinegar, sugar, flavoured with ginger, cilantro, sliced carrot and garlic. The Harbin Guobaorou is distinct from that of other areas of China, such as Liaoning, where the sauce may be made using either tomato ketchup or orange juice. Rather the Harbin style is dominated by the honey and ginger flavours and has a clear or honey yellow colour. Originally the taste was fresh and salty. In order to fete foreign guests, Zheng Xingwen, the chef of Daotai Fu, altered the dish into a sweet and sour taste. Usually, people prefer to go to several small or middle size restaurants to enjoy this dish, because it is difficult to handle the frying process at home.Demoli Stewed Live Fish is one among other notable dishes in Harbin, which is originated in a village named Demoli on the expressway from Harbin to Jiamusi.

          "Church of St. Sophia has a unique medieval feel to it. Built in neo Byzantine style which is the commonest orthodox church design, it's red brick color and the onion dome impart it a uniquely Russian nostalgia. The entry fee is just 15 Chinese Yuan per person and has discount",
          "This was a nice place to walk around for a little bit but there was lots of ice on the ground and it was very slippery. The staff was trying to break it up with machinery but I would advise caution if traveling with older people or someone who would be injured by a fall. There",
          "This is a nice square to go to especially to see the stunning exterior of St Sophia's Cathedral. We stayed close to Sophia Square but it was a pity that we did not take picture of it in the night. The cab we were in drove past it at night and it was gorgeous. We gave St",
          "Beautiful old building. It has many photos of the Russian community who came here after the Revolution. It is not a church any more. It has seen better days inside the walls. Magnificent to view and photograph when last light in the afternoon.",
          "Harbin is a city that feels like Europe more than China. Sophia Square is a very good example of that. It is next the the Central Street and the whole area is a must see if you go to Harbin",
          "Beautiful Russian church situated in the middle of a square; a favorite spot for the newly weds. The facade of the church is better maintained than the interior; $15 RMB per person for the entrance fee. The interior of church has turned into an exhibit hall with photos of the",
          "For the European, this is pretty standard with nothing too special about it. However, for someone who has a genuine interest in China, this is worth a visit given that it is so out of place and the last building you'd expect in a Chinese city! The exhibit inside is worth a",

          "If you are fan of historial big monuments , this church is a must. Its quite good also at night to visit .",
          "The church has an interesting history, but the interior is nothing special. The Russian influence is clear.",
          "The square with the Sophia Cathedral attract many visitors to take pictures, I enjoy the little mall on left hand side of street. Mc Donald is downstairs with no restroom . You could take bus here to many attractions around Harbin. Be careful your belongings and purses",
          "The area is good for relax and close to shopping mall and branded stores. This area is close to famaous street and Harbin tourist center, food market, etc. Also you can find many stuffs coming from Rusia here. Cafe and restaurant also available at surrounding area.",
          "If you have time, walk and take pictures from the outside. It is not worth the time nor money to go inside. They pretty much made it a photo museum. It looks nothing like a church in the past. It's crumbling down and no renovation is made inside.",
          "Havent been to Russia (yet) so was keen to see. Visited during the day, but wouldn't bother with the inside visit (only 15RMB but a queue). Inside is a photo exhibit of old Harbin rather than the original church.",
          "Went there for the church. There is a shop selling post card and winter stuff. There are some street vendors around the square",
          "Interesting little museum inside - and well worth it if you need to get out of the cold. Interesting look at Russian architecture.",
          "It's a fairly large square with St Sophia old church within it. However if you take a good look at the skyline above the modern fronts you can still see the original features and get a hint of what it once was. The wind does tend to whip through in winter which makes it kind of",
          "Pity we couldnt go inside, but the cathedral is so pretty all lit up at night. A real photographers paradise!",
          "We were taken her as part of a tour and only walked around it. It's now a museum inside, but we didn't go in. It makes for a nice photo opportunity, but it's not a must see!",

          "This is a nice building ... it would b bad to call it a church there is no place for prayer I was disappointed going there entry fees is 15rmb I think it's a waste as it's a museum inside some Russian pictures everything written in Chinese ... its better to go to the square take",
          "My title says it all, the Sophia Cathedral is the highlight of this square. Nothing else to write home about except that its surrounded with restaurants. Take pics of the Sophia as its beautiful. The architecture in Harbin is full of surprises.",

          "if ti is not the only church of this kind you have seen in yourn life, you can skip it, or just take a picture form outside and leave. The (ugli a\u00b4nd emptly) iunterior is a museum - with lots of old photographs and (chinese) explanations. The don't even care to give some",
          "We got to the Sophia square at dusk so did not get a chance to go inside and have a look. But the architecture of the church is amazing, especially on the post card. Top recommendation, there was a small shop at one edge of the square, selling Russian stuffs. The Russian set",
          "It's great to see historical architecture in China, so his is a must see. But it is just one building. I didn't go inside. I didn't trust china to have remodeled it well and it was a stop we made at the end of a long day of walking the Pedestrian Street. So we took some pictures",
          "Sophia's Square, which of course has Sophia's Cathedral, is an absolute must-stop in Harbin. It's well within walking distance from Zhongyang Pedestrian Street, as well as Zhaolin Park. I'd recommend going right before sunset, as the cathedral is stunning in its well-lit and",
          "Beautiful architecture. Nice sight to see. Doesn't have to be a long visit. Free to see from the outside, with lots of street vendors (of course). 20 kuai I believe to go inside for a view, but it'd be brief. Worth a look if you have the time and want to see a little bit of",
          "We did not expect this kind of basilica in the middle of Harbin. Okay did not do our homework as obviously Harbin is quite influenced by Russian culture but it was a nice surprise. Not far from Zhongyang Pedestrian Street.",
          "nice old building surrounded by the neon lights of hotels/shopping malls etc. and the dance music being pumped out of nearby speakers not entirely in keeping! worth a quick visit",
          "May not be as grand as the St. Basil's Cathedral, Moscow but she has her own outstanding charm against a Chinese-looking backdrop of banks and shops. The architecture speaks of her age but with its bold mud-coloured outlook and green tops, she's still a beauty for the camera",
          "Pretty little square. The cathedral is beautiful, but definitely not the only perl on the square. There's other buildings that worth taking a moment to appreciate..",
          "The San Sophia Church is Harbin's signature Russian cathedral. The inside is richly mounted with photographs and newspaper memorabilia from Harbin's heyday in the 1890s-1920s before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. The galleries inside depict the summer leisure and cultural",
          "The square is easy to locate. I didn't go inside the building just admired it from the outside. I found the building really stood out from the surrounding architecture. It wasn't to crowded compared to other tourist attractions I've seen in China.",

          "A lot of people don't realise how special harbin is. This cathedral is heavily influenced by Russia, it is absolutely beautiful. The square is very European. Worth a visit. Harbin is a very unique Chinese city because it's one of the few that are transcultural - sinoeuropean.",
          "The cathedral is pretty special. A piece of old Russia plonked down in the middle of China. Even if you don't buy the ticket to go inside the cathedral (15 kuai, or AUD3), it is worth visiting the square to see the beautiful architecture from outside. Especially in winter, when",
          "Wonderful experience,inside and outside.Pigeon feeding next to cathedral interesting-great to see children and adults enjoying it.",
          "The square is mostly famous because of the church that has given the square its name. Lively please some days people trying to make a living by selling something - and of cause us the tourists. I guess many like me came to admire the Cathedral. That done I was off to my new",

          "The square is quite crowded often maybe just because of it's reputation as a tourist spot. After all there is not that much to see. The building itself is quite beautiful from outside, but I dare to say \"raped\" from inside. Only poor quality pictures of old Harbin inside. The",
          "This is a lovely spot to stop at, but don't expect to need or spend much time here. Admire the exterior of the St. Sophia, enjoy a quirky water and music show (summer time, on the hour), and maybe pop into one of the busineses lining the square for a drink, snack, or air",
          "The whole place is constructed in kind-of-European style - A cathedral in the center of a public square with buildings around it. This place is bustling with lots of tourists. There are many local artists who sketch you. Additionally, there are many malls and good restaurants",

          "The Sophia square is basically an open space with some tourist attractions, including the ortodox church. You can simply walk around the square, take some pictures, even watvh the children feed the pigeons. If you are lucky, loud music will emanate from the church and an",

          "It was really too cold to do much except stroll around the outside of this old church and duck into an occasional shop. But, it is a beautiful structure and not the kind you would normally associate with China. It's also a nice open square area I would expect to be very",
          "It\u00b4s a beautiful cathedral, but the real charm is to imagine you are in China, a country where you wouldn\u00b4t expect a place like that. Close to the pedestrian street, it\u00b4s worth to go take a look. The inside of the cathedral is now a museum.",
          "Based on other reviews, we decided to go to this area around Midday, but skipped going inside the church. We walked around a few minutes and took some photos. Very pretty. There are a couple fast food restaurants and lots of shopping nearby.",

          "This is a great place for people watching if you can stand the cold. We enjoyed seeing the Cathedral at different times of day as we passed by from our hotel (Manhattan Apartments) to the pedestrian street. If you're looking for breakfast it's worth heading across the street",
          "Outer architecture was very interesting. We had looked around there were more places like shops, we found underground market which was closed at that time. But there were a Russian shop one can buy soveigners and other gift items from there. Prices were higher you may need to",
          "An interesting place to visit, and if you're in the area I'd say worthwhile. The church itself is nothing hugely special, although obviously the Russian architecture feels unusual in what is now China. The inside of the church is essentially unmaintained, and filled with",

          "The only reason this building was not smashed down in the cultural revolution is that it was totally forgotten. Cheap apartment buildings had popped up hiding it and it was in ruins and forgotten. The city had the idea to tear down the buildings and fix up the church amd it is",
          "We made a quick stop to see the Church that is no longer a church from the outside. It was a very pretty photo op and interesting to see Soviet influence on the area.",

          "a lot of beautiful doves there and doves can be fed by yourselves you can take your children or GF here to feed doves",
          "Personally, I find the exterior of the cathedral more dramatic than its interior. The cathedral is small inside. There were a lot of people inside when we got there so if you are claustrophobic you might not want to stay long inside. The square offers an interesting fountain",

        "wiki": "Adrian Fisher is a maze and puzzle designer, responsible for more than 700 mazes in 35 countries since 1979.\nFisher has created 48 mirror mazes, and pioneered the extensive use of thematic chambers within mirror mazes, to achieve Mirror Maze Adventures.  He has created 44 hedge mazes, and pioneered the use of Folly Towers, Tunnels, Walk-through Parting Waterfalls and Foaming Fountain Gates in mazes.  He designed the world's first cornfield maize maze in 1993 and over 400 since, and has set 7 Guinness World Records.  He has created water mazes, most notably the award-winning Beatles Maze, and the Jersey Water Maze.  He pioneered the genre of Path-in-Grass Mazes, and has created over a dozen around the world.  \nFisher has invented several brick paving and mosaic tiling systems.  For the Orang Utan Pavement Maze at Edinburgh Zoo, he invented a new paver tessellation using 7-sided and 5-sided (regular pentagon) bricks.  The 'Fisher Paver', his second paving system uses 7-sided and 4-sided bricks and has been installed within paving projects on both sides of the Atlantic.  Its benefits include being able to achieve dynamic and intriguing designs straight off the pallet with no cutting, thus offering excellent labour productivity when laying; it only requires one new 7-sided paver shape, yet its modular scale matches all industry-standard paving systems.  Adrian's third paving system is the Mitre System, which he invented and patented together with the American mathematician Ed Pegg.  Used for both mosaics and paving, their distinctive angular shapes create unique and pleasing images.  Notable examples of its use in England include four Historic Mosaics with the Millennium Maze in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and the 24 ft high SciTec Mosaic at Oundle School, Northamptonshire; and in America, the Tree of Life Mosaic in a private garden in Roxbury, Connecticut.\nHis innovative Colour Mazes have been published in Scientific American, and walk-on examples can be found in the New York Hall of Science, Eureka Children's Museum in Halifax England, The Exploratory in Bristol, Cape Coral Children's Science Center in Florida, and over 30 other locations worldwide.\nFisher designs puzzles for British newspapers and the World Puzzle Championships. The Guardian newspaper named him as one of Britain's top 50 designers.A major Maze Art Exhibition on Adrian Fisher's work was held at the Norton Museum of Art, West Palm Beach, Florida, from January to March 1997; it included the creation of full-size permanent mazes in the surrounding landscape, and the publication \"Your Land is His Canvas\". \nFisher was Director of Britain's \"1991 \u2013 The Year of the Maze\" Tourism Campaign.  He was the recipient of the 2003 Resorgimento Award at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, USA, on May 24, 2003, \"in recognition of those who have demonstrated outstanding creativity, who have and will continue to change the world in which we live\".

        "wiki": "The Songhua River (also Haixi or Xingal, Russian: \u0421\u0443\u043d\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438 Sungari) is one of the primary rivers of China, and the longest tributary of the Amur. It flows about 1,434 kilometres (891 mi) from the Changbai Mountains on the China\u2013North Korea border through China's northeastern Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces.\nThe river drains 557,180 square kilometres (215,130 sq mi) of land, and has an annual discharge of 2,463 cubic metres per second (87,000 cu ft/s).The extreme flatness of the Northeast China Plain has caused the river to meander over time, filling the wide plain with oxbow lakes, as remnants of the previous paths of the river.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Songhua rises south of Heaven Lake, near the China-North Korea border.\nFrom there it flows north, to be interrupted by the Baishan, Hongshi and Fengman hydroelectric dams. The Fengman Dam forms a lake that stretches for 62 kilometres (39 mi). Below the dam, the Second Songhua flows north through Jilin, then northwest until it is joined by its largest tributary, the Nen River, near Da'an, to create the Songhua proper.\nThe Songhua turns east through Harbin, and after the city, it is joined from the south by the Ashi River, and then by the Hulan River from the north.\nA new dam was constructed in 2007 near Bayan (50 km north-east of Harbin), creating the Dadingshan Reservoir, which is named after the scenic area on the south bank (Chinese: \u5927\u9876\u5c71; pinyin: D\u00e0d\u01d0ng Sh\u0101n; lit.: 'Big Topped Mountain').\nThe river flows onward through Jiamusi and south of the Lesser Xing'an Range, to eventually join the Amur at Tongjiang, Heilongjiang.\nThe river freezes from late November until March. It has its highest flows when the mountain snow melts during the spring thaw. The river is navigable up to Harbin by medium-sized ships. Smaller craft can navigate the Songhua up to Jilin and the Nen River up to Qiqihar.\nCities along the river include:\n\nJilin\nHarbin\nJiamusi\n\n\n== History ==\nIn November 2005, the river was contaminated with benzene, leading to a shutdown of Harbin's water supply. The spill stretched 80 kilometres (50 mi) and eventually reached the Amur (Heilong) River on the China\u2013Russia border. On July 28, 2010, several thousand barrels from two chemical plants in China's Jilin City were washed away by floods. Some of them contained 170 kilograms (370 lb) of explosive material like trimethylsilyl chloride and hexamethyldisiloxane. In 2016, the part near the city of Jilin was affected by a minor flood.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeography of China\nMudanjiang River\n\"On Songhua River\", a Chinese patriotic song\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSungari River at the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica",

        "wiki": "Art Nouveau is an international style of art, architecture and applied arts, especially the decorative arts, that was most popular between 1893 and 1910. In the Russian language it is called Art Nouveau or Modern (in Cyrillic: \u0410\u0440-\u043d\u0443\u0432o, \u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0301\u0440\u043d). \n\nArt Nouveau architecture in Russia was mostly built in large cities by merchants and Old Believers, and was highly influenced by the contemporary movements that constituted the Art Nouveau style: the Glasgow School, Jugendstil of Germany, Vienna Secession, as well as Russian Revival architecture and the National Romantic style of Nordic countries (one of which, Grand Duchy of Finland, was a part of Russian Empire)  In some Russian towns, there also were earlier examples of wooden architecture, the architecture of Kievan Rus', which influenced the style.\nSome Russian Art Nouveau buildings were built on territories that were part of Germany and the Grand Duchy of Finland during the Art Nouveau period and were ceded to the Soviet Union after World War II. Russian architects also worked on the development of Harbin in China after 1898, which explains the presence of Art Nouveau architecture there.\n\n\n== Saint Petersburg ==\n\nThe first Art Nouveau building in Russia was built in Saint Petersburg in 1898. It was Hauswald summer house built by Vladimir Chagin and Vasily (Wilhelm) Schoene.\nAs Saint Petersburg was situated close to the border with Grand Duchy of Finland, there was a strong influence of its National Romantic style on Art Nouveau Architecture in Saint Petersburg. This style is called \"Severny modern\" in Russia (in Cyrillic: \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d) meaning \"Northern Art Nouveau\". But European movements influenced local architecture as well.\n\n\n=== Notable examples ===\nSeven Saint Petersburg buildings are sometimes considered as notable examples of Art Nouveau, all by different architects:\n\nEliseyev Emporium by Gavriil Baranovsky (1903),\nWhiplash motifs at the Vitebsky railway station by Sima Mihash and Stanislav Brzozowski (1904),\nSinger House by Pavel Suzor (1904),\nDuke of Leuchtenberg apartments by Fyodor von Postels (1904\u20131905), most notable for its facade-wide frieze by Sergei Schelkovy,\nKshessinskaya House by Alexander von Hohen (1904\u20131906),\nLidval apartments by Fyodor Lidval (also known as Johan Fredrik Lidvall, 1899\u20131904),\nBasseynaya Condominium by Ernest Wirrich,  Aleksei Zazersky, Nikolai Vasilyev, Aleksei Bubyr (1912\u20131917).\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== National Romantic style ===\nThe last two building are examples of Nordic National Romantic style. Other notable examples of that movement are:\n\nRoman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Lourdes by Leon Benois and Marian Peretyatkovich (1903\u20131909),\nPutilova Apartments (also known as House with owls) by Hyppolit Pretreaus (1906\u20131907),\nBubyr' Apartments by Aleksei Bubyr and Nikolai Vasilyev (1907),\nBolsheokhtinsky Bridge (also known as Peter the Great Bridge) by Vladimir Apyshkov (1908 or 1909\u20131911),\n\"New Passage\" Trade house by Nikolai Vasilyev (1912\u20131913),\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Islamic Revival architecture ===\nThe Saint Petersburg Mosque (1919\u201321), designed by the architect Nikolai Vasilyev in the Islamic revival style, is modelled after the mosque of Gur-e-Amir, the tomb of Tamerlane in Samarkand (14th century).\n\n\n=== Russian Revival influence ===\nMany Russian Orthodox churches constructed in the Art Nouveau period are primarily examples of Russian Revival architecture, though they often include some modern elements. In Saint Petersburg these are: \n\nThe Old Believers Church of Our Lady of the Sign by Dmitry Kryzanowski (1906\u20131907),\nThe Church of Peter the Metropolitan by Andrey Aplaksin (1907).\n\t\t\n\n\n== Moscow ==\n\n\n=== Lev Kekushev ===\nOne of first Art Nouveau buildings in Moscow was the List House (1898\u201399) by Lev Kekushev. Kekushev was acquainted with Victor Horta, the initiator of Art Nouveau movement, and the house shows the natural curving forms, open interiors and floral designs of Horta. Kekushev's buildings are notable for his skilful use of ceramic and iron ornaments. His buildings also have a signature feature: a ceramic depiction on the facade or a sculpture of a lion, or 'Lev', after his first name. \nProminent buildings by Lev Kekushev in Art Nouveau style include:\n\nList House (1898\u201399)\nKekushev House, also known as Kekusheva House, as he had to cede it to his ex-wife in settling their divorce, (1900\u20131903),\nMindovsky House and Nosov House (both in 1903),\nIsakov Apartments (1904\u20131906).Lev Kekushev also took part in the construction of the Hotel Metropol Moscow. In 1898\u20131899, he won the first prize in the open contest, but the commissioner of the project Savva Morozov discarded the decision of a professional jury and awarded the prize to William Walcot. However, the owners retained Kekushev as an overall project manager. Kekushev's assistance was probably crucial to the final realization of the complex structure.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Franz (Fyodor) Schechtel ===\nAnother influential master of Russian Art Nouveau who worked in Moscow was Franz (Fyodor) Schechtel. Starting his career with Neo-Gothic buildings and finishing career with Neoclassical ones, he built his best-known masterpieces in Art Nouveau style. In 1901 he was commissioned to build the pavilion of Russia at Glasgow Exhibition. There he gained international recognition and got to know Charles Rennie Mackintosh who influenced Schechtel's art. Another influence was Joseph Maria Olbrich, the founder of the Darmstadt Artists' Colony, whose Ludwig Habich House was an inspiration for the Gorky Museum (1900\u20131903). His other works in Moscow included:\nDerozhinskaya House (1901),\nYaroslavsky railway station (1902\u20131904). The Yaroslavsky station was enlarged, with a new facade in Russian Revival style, with elements of Art Nouveau decoration in the interior.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== National Romantic style ===\nThe influence of Nordic National Romantic style was weaker in Moscow than in Saint Petersburg. Buildings with National Romantic influence in Moscow are:\n\nLomakina Apartments and Tsirkunov Heirs Apartments by Vitaly Maslennikov,\nKalinovskaya Apartments by Ernst Richard Nirnsee with ceramics of Alexander Golovin,\nLoskov Apartments by Alexander Zelenko.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Old Believers churches ===\nAfter the restriction to build Old Believers churches was withdrawn in 1905, construction of numerous Old Believers churches was started. Along with two churches listed above, some of them shared both Russian Revival and Art Nouveau characteristics:\n\nHoly Virgin Protection Church by Vladimir Adamovich and Vladimir Mayat (1907\u20131911),\nBelfry Church of Resurrection by Fyodor Gornostaev (1910),\nSaint Nicholas Church by Anton Gurzhienko (1914\u20131921),An Old Believers chapel was also built on the upper floor of the Ryabushensky House in Moscow, with a mixture of Russian Revival architecture and Art Nouveau decoration.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other architects ===\nOther notable architects of Art Nouveau in Moscow include:\n\nIllarion Ivanov-Schitz, who developed a unique personal style, blending the Vienna Secession school with Greek Revival features,\nGeorgy Makayev, who is mostly known for Tarkhova Apartments that later was bought back by the architect,\nAdolf Erichson with several buildings, most notable of them is Sytin Publishers building,\nIlya Bondarenko, who was the architect of two Old Believers churches,\nAlexey Shchusev, who is mostly known for his works during USSR time and notably design of Lenin's Mausoleum, was an architect of the katholikon of Marfo-Mariinsky Convent (also known as Martha and Mary Convent, 1908\u20131912). The commissioner of the complex, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna was born near Darmstadt that was the center of Jugendstil at the time,\nSergey Malyutin, an artist of Mir iskusstva movement, who after leaving Talashkino colony stood behind Pertsova House (also known as Pertsov House, 1905\u20131907)Some researches characterize Trinity Church Apartments building (also known as House with Beasts) as Art Nouveau. This building is mostly notable for the stone carving made by Sergei Vashkov inspired by carvings of Cathedral of Saint Demetrius in Vladimir and Saint George Cathedral in Yuryev-Polsky of XII and XIII centuries.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Art Nouveau and Russian Revival style outside Saint Petersburg and Moscow ==\n\n\n=== Art colonies ===\nArt Nouveau in Russia was promoted not only by single architects but also by art colonies who worked in the Russian Revival style.  The two best-known colonies were situated in Abramtsevo, funded by Savva Mamontov, and Talashkino, funded by Princess Maria Tenisheva. They mostly dealt with interior and ceramics but also left architecture monuments:\n\nThe Church of the Holy Spirit in Talashkino by Sergey Malyutin with mosaics of Nicholas Roerich (1903\u20131905),\nTeremok House in Talashkino by Sergey Malyutin (1901\u20131902) who later developed a project of Pertsova House in Moscow (see above).Some researches include Church of the Holy Mandylion in Abramtsevo in the list of Art Nouveau buildings, but it was built in 1881\u20131891, before the inception of Art Nouveau movement.\n\n\n=== Other Orthodox churches ===\nMost Art Nouveau churches in Russia are also considered Russian Revival. Along with the already described examples, some notable exampled include:\n\nChurch of the Holy Trinity in Balakovo, Saratov Oblast by Fyodor Schechtel (1908\u201309),\nChurch of the Holy Trinity in Bekhovo, Tula Oblast by famous artist Vasily Polenov who acted as the architect for the church in his own estate (1904\u20131906),\nSeraphimo-Znamenskiy Skit in Bityagovo, Moscow Oblast by Leonid Stezhensky (1912),\nResurrection cathedral in Tver by Nikolay Omelyusty (1912\u20131913),\nChurch of the Holy Mandylion in Klyazma, Pushkino, Moscow Oblast by Sergei Vashkov and Vasily Motylyov (1913\u20131916).\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Wooden art ===\nWood carving is also a distinctive feature of Russian Revival style and has become a feature of Russian Art Nouveau wooden houses. Houses with wood carvings can be found not only in Central Russia but also in Siberia, in Tomsk and Tyumen.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== National Romantic and Jugendstil buildings in Karelia and East Prussia ==\nThe territories of Karelian Isthmus and partly East Prussia that belonged to Finland and Germany respectively were ceded to Soviet Union after World War II. \nThe Art Nouveau heritage at Karelian Isthmus consisted of:\n\nsecular buildings of Vyborg and Sortavala, one of which was built by famous Finnish architects Herman Gesellius, Armas Lindgren and Eliel Saarinen in 1905,\nthree Lutheran churches by Josef Stenb\u00e4ck in Primorsk, Melnikovo and Zelenogorsk (that has been included into Saint Petersburg city limits).In East Prussia (that became Kaliningrad Oblast) houses in Zelenogradsk and the water tower in Svetlogorsk can be noted.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Gallery of regional examples ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nArt Nouveau architecture in Riga\nArt Nouveau religious buildings\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMakinson, Randall (1977). \"Greene & Greene: Architecture as a Fine Art\".

          "If you've seen the cathedrals in Europe, this church is nothing. It's quite nice to look at from the outside, but the inside of the church hasn't been preserved as a church at all, no pews or anything. Only one painting of the last supper, and quite poorly preserved. The inside",

          "I was expecting a grand cathedral. Instead I found what was more of a museum than anything once inside. And not much English to explain the photos. I enjoyed the outside more than the inside which says something. Not an active place to say a prayer either. Disappointed.",
          "If you are in Harbin for the Festival, you must definitively go see the Cathedral. It is quite cheap to enter the cathedral, but I would not advise to do it as the inside has sadly become a not really interesting museum. The outside however is breathtaking, and it is even more",
          "If you live history and architecture, this is the place to visit. Beautiful, well preserved church. Chandeliers and paintings on the inside as well as a walk through the historical record of this church.",

          "It was really odd to see such a beautiful cathedral building standing in the midst of all these other industrial sites. It was definitely nothing like the ones you see in Rome or someplace else. The night we went, there was an event happening, so we couldn\u2019t go inside but we",
          "It is quite small, when you hear word \"cathedral\" expect something grand. It is a beautiful church, unusual style for China. Didn't go inside, as it looked very packed. 15kuai to go inside.",
          "Went there on daytime and nighttime. Beautiful sight and rich in architecture. Not a costly venture as the cathedral is to be appreciated from the outside.",

          "More the size of a small church, we enjoyed walking around the outside of this unique looking cathedral. The architecture is very pretty with the domes. The small pigeon collective also took flight and looped around the building a few times which was a cool site. We paid to go",
          "I was on a tour guide and was allowed only 10 minutes to take photos as the tour bus had nowhere to park. Best to visit in the evening where the Cathedral's exterior light brings out the red/orange facade of the building and yet have enough ambient light to capture the image",
          "It's a gorgeous building. The grandeur is all around. It is also THE place for wedding photos. The visit inside is quite fascinating. Great history of the town, as well as a magnificent interior, though not in the condition of its glory days. It's a must if you visit",
          "Not bad, beautiful building from outside. Great place to visit and close proximity to other attractions, Starlin park, Zhong yang street etc. Good for a short visit to warm up, some interesting photos on the wall, but with kids you probably will be hard pressed to keep their",

          "Saint Sophia Cathedral still retain its good architecture and rustic looks with the red tiles structure. Try to visit in the morning so you can see the structure with the sun light on it to give it more texture on surface. Inside is not so interesting because it was not well",
          "Enjoy one of the most beautiful cathedral in Harbin. For best picture, I recommend to take a tripod and DSLR if possible to take a long exposure shot. (It really pays off than just to click with your best mobile phone camera during low lights when the place is most beautiful).",
          "Sometimes called Harbin's Hagia Sophia, this former Russian Orthodox church is now an architectural museum. It's a popular place for people to come and take photos (especially selfies). When I was there, I saw a couple having wedding photos done with the building as a backdrop.",
          "Despite having lived in Harbin for a year, I had only visited St Sophia's once and never inside so I took my three teenagers and 7 year old. Had a coffee on the other side of the square which was around 35 rmb but was not great. The kids had ice creams which cost about the same",
          "The Saint Sophia Cathedral is probably the most famous Russian cathedral in China. The outside is well restored and very impressive. The Entry Fee for visiting the inside of the cathedral is RMB 15 per adult, but the inside left me somewhat disappointed. All the internal",
          "No longer a functional religious building, this cathedral is now a nice museum for its special history, architecture, the excellent exhibit of old photos on how the city grew to be and how Russians lived here. It is beautiful and educational!",
          "A beautiful small cathedral as I start a review of place which I wanted to see and then wanted to write about. It's must watch in Harbin just because this is the only structure which gave some sense of normality to a city stuffed with sky scrapers. It's a russian architecture",

Admission fee was not expensive but we can't",

          "Quite interesting when we visited cathedrals in the European countries they are usually well refurnished and carrying out religious functions as what they should be. This Cathedral is aged and the past glory was not restored. Contrary to that it has on show many photos of",
          "It was Cathedral but nowadays turn into museum where the Harbin history shows in here.It feels like in Rusia when you're in here not like in China.I think it's a must visit when you're in Harbin.",
          "Its an overrated place, i really don't think it should be in must visit place list in Harbin. Its just a building, not even church. Inside this building there are Historical photos of Harbin for which explanation is only in Chinese so if you can't read Chinese don't waste",
          "Imagine a Chinese city. Where people only speak Chinese. No english at all. But there is another language used in the city. That's russian! And the stores sell russian products, and there is russian arquitecture around. Surreal. This church, although is only a shell, is the",
          "The Cathedral is a most do, although the inside was destroyed in the past, still you should go in, some pictures of the history of Harbin can be seen. The architecture is great and you can use your imagination how it most of looked.",
          "The building now houses a picture trail of the development of Harbin. It costs 15rmb, ( there are concessions), which are purchased from the booth just outside. The pictures are interesting but would benefit from an English language narrative. That said you can follow the basic",
          "Really don't think it's worth going to see. Wasn't impressed with this at all. Not worth paying to come from other side of town to see this.Was really disappointed. It's a church, you look at it, take a photo , and that's it. Appreciate its historical heritage.",
          "This church appears older than its one hundred years. Inside it has been left in its slightly run down state. It has a large collection of history photos and other paraphernalia. Some is in English. The structure is externally in excellent condition.",
          "Such beautiful architecture. It would be good to have some English subtitles in the museum section as we missed a lot of the history, however still worth a visit.",
          "Worth seeing. There is a museum inside, not sure this is worth it. Would recommend just seeing the cathedral on the outside.",
          "We\u2019ve been to Saint Sophia Cathedral before and it has always been a pleasant experience. This time we were visiting family in Harbin and decided to visit Saint Sophia again. We made this decision as were headed to Center Street. We did and it was a mistake. It was a mistake",
          "I love the brick construction of this cathedral, so gorgeous. The inside still has some of the wall painting and decoration, but the plaster is chipped and gone in some places, exposing brick and board. Which, to me, makes it dilapidatedly beautiful. It would, of course, be",
          "This is an included tour destination, and the outside of the building is worth seeing, but the inside is a photographic museum. There is nothing left of the religious interior.",
          "Just visited the beautiful St Sophia Cathedral in the heart of Harbin in icy January. The historical architecture is magnificent. Walk around it to appreciate the details, and take some selfie photos as this is the most highly rated tourist attraction of the city. The church",
          "Really beautiful cathedral. A must if you're in town. They don't allow people inside though. We were looking forward to see the architecture inside",
          "We went to visit the St Sophia Cathedral, which I had read had been turned into an \"architectural\" museum. The 15RMB price tag for entrance was affordable so we investigated. Inside is housed a collection of photos showing the history of Harbin. They were interesting and",
          "We visited in the morning. Lovely to walk around the outside and admire architecture I don't think I've seen. It is a museum now and serves no religious purpose. When we visited there was a photography exhibition that showed the Russian lifestyle in the early 1900s. There are",
          "The cathedral is a beautiful building and it still has painted walls and ceilings inside, but it's no longer used as a church. It houses the Arts Centre and has displays of old photographs for visitors to see at a cost of 15RMB. It's an interesting look back at the history of",

          "Well this view is definitely worth seeing both during the day and at night. I visited during May, so it was warmer here and a different view then one would get in the winter. However, do not pay the 20RMB to go inside the building, you will be disappointed, unless you are into",

          "I was looking forward to seeing a beautiful church from another time, but was disappointed that the interior had been neglected and was now functioning as a museum of photos of days gone by. Photos were interesting but not what I expected of this charming church.",
          "Standing on the square in front of the St. Sophia Church will make you think you are in a different country, and not China. Harbin as a city is strong in Russian influence and this church is a strong reminder of this influence. It is now a tourist attraction and you have to",

          "This is one of the most frequently visited place when I was in Harbin for 4 days. The church just attracted me for no reason, and it looks nice at night too. I went both day time and night time since I'm staying nearby Sophia Square. Lights off quite early, I pass by at around",

          "Thank goodness this survived the Cultural Revolution, though the mindless damage to the interior from that period is painful to see. With the exception of the chandeliers (which I assume are authentic), none of the interior fixtures (altar, artwork, pews, etc) are there. However",
          "Well worth going inside. Our tour guide told us the only reason the church survived, was they used it to store weapons, during the revolution.",
          "We had read the other reviews about the inside being not really worth the visit but my husband wanted to go anyway, so we paid the 20 yuan each and in we went. It is very sad to see that the inside of the church has not be maintained to it's original glory. The photos that show",

          "It is a part of Harbin as it resembles the fine form of Russian architecture. The photos inside are with chinese captions I doubt that foreigners would understand... Quite small when you stepped inside. I don't think the ticket price is reasonable as they charged 20renminbi per",

          "Being there, for a slight moment it felt like being in Russia. The Church was small and was converted to a museum. Very informative and well structured. It's like going through a time tunnel witness the ups and down of Harbin. A must see site in Harbin.",
          "Worth seeing, as an example of Russian influence in Harbin, and a beautiful little church, but small.",

          "Really nice Russian architecture from the outside. Beautiful church and a nice square as well. Took a few pictures and then went inside. 30 RMB to go inside and it is NOT worth it. They should be ashamed of themselves for charging so much. It's not beautiful at all inside - very",
          "Lovely building externally, but less so internally. Russian-style former church is now a sort of city museum, but the interior is in poor shape and the large collection of photos are mostly hard for tourists to interpret (as captions are only in Chinese). Hopefully, some funds",

          "I have just visited Saint Sophia for the third time. It's the kind of place I love visiting whenever I'm in Harbin. The church is very beautiful and stands out amongst the newer buildings in the area. Moreover, the pictures on display in the church give an interesting insight of",

        "wiki": "A temple of Confucius or Confucian temple is a temple for the veneration of Confucius and the sages and philosophers of Confucianism in Chinese folk religion and other East Asian religions. They were formerly the site of the administration of the imperial examination in China and Vietnam and often housed schools and other studying facilities.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe temples are known by a variety of names throughout East Asia. The two greatest temples in Qufu and Beijing are now known in Chinese as \"Temples of Confucius\" (K\u01d2ngmi\u00e0o, \u6587\u5edf). In some localities, they are known as \"Temples of Literature\" (\u6587\u5edf) (Chinese: w\u00e9nmi\u00e0o; Vietnamese: v\u0103n mi\u1ebfu; Korean: munmyo; Indonesian: boen bio) or \"Temples of the Sage of Literature\" (Vietnamese: v\u0103n th\u00e1nh mi\u1ebfu). In Southern China, however, temples by that name generally honor Wenchang Wang, a separate deity associated with the scholar Zhang Yazi. In Japan, they are usually known as \"Temples\" or \"Halls of the Sage\" (Japanese: seiby\u014d or seid\u014d, respectively).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe development of state temples devoted to the cult of Confucius was an outcome of his gradual canonisation. In 195 BC, Han Gao Zu, founder of the Han Dynasty (r. 206\u2013195 BC), offered a sacrifice to the spirit of Confucius at his tomb in Qufu. Sacrifices to the spirit of Confucius and that of Yan Hui, his most prominent disciple, began in the Imperial University (Biyong) as early as 241.\nIn 454, the Liu Song dynasty of southern China built a prominent state Confucian temple. In 489, the Northern Wei constructed a Confucian temple in the capital, the first outside of Qufu in the north. In 630, the Tang Dynasty decreed that schools in all provinces and counties should have a Confucian temple, as a result of which temples spread throughout China. Well-known Confucian shrines include the Confucian Temple in Jianshui, the Confucian Temple in Xi'an (now the Forest of Steles), the Fuzi Miao in Nanjing, and the Confucian Temple in Beijing, first built in 1302. The Confucian Temple of old Tianjin is located on Dongmennei Dajie, a short distance west of Traditional Culture Street (Gu Wenhua Jie). Occupying 32 acres of land, The Confucian Temple is the largest extant traditional architectural complex in Tianjin.\nThe largest and oldest Temple of Confucius is found in Confucius' hometown, present-day Qufu in Shandong Province. It was established in 479 BC, one year after Confucius's death, at the order of the Duke Ai of the State of Lu, who commanded that the Confucian residence should be used to worship and offer sacrifice to Confucius. The temple was expanded repeatedly over a period of more than 2,000 years until it became the huge complex currently standing. There is another temple in Quzhou.\nIn addition to Confucian temples associated with the state cult of Confucius, there were also ancestral temples belonging to the Kong lineage, buildings commemorating Confucius's deeds throughout China, and private temples within academies.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nBeginning in the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907), Confucian temples were built in prefectural and county schools throughout the empire, either to the front of or on one side of the school.  The front gate of the temple is called the Lingxing Gate (simplified Chinese: \u68c2\u661f\u95e8; traditional Chinese: \u6b1e\u661f\u9580). Inside there are normally three courtyards, although sometimes there are only two. However, the complex in Qufu has nine courtyards containing scores of steles commemorating visits by an emperor or imperial grants of noble titles upon descendants of Confucius. The main building, situated in the inner courtyard with entry via the Dachengmen (simplified Chinese: \u5927\u6210\u95e8; traditional Chinese: \u5927\u6210\u9580), is called the Dachengdian (Chinese: \u5927\u6210\u6bbf), variously translated as \"Hall of Great Achievement\", \"Hall of Great Completion\", or \"Hall of Great Perfection\". In imperial China, this hall housed the Spirit Tablets (Chinese: \u795e\u4f4d) of Confucius and those of other important sages (simplified Chinese: \u5723; traditional Chinese: \u8056) and worthies (simplified Chinese: \u8d24; traditional Chinese: \u8ce2). In front of the Dachengdian in Qufu is the Apricot Pavilion or Xingtan (simplified Chinese: \u674f\u575b; traditional Chinese: \u674f\u58c7). Another important building behind the main building is the Shrine of Adoring the Sage (Chongshengci simplified Chinese: \u5d07\u5723\u7960; traditional Chinese: \u5d07\u8056\u7960), which honoured the ancestors of Confucius and the fathers of the Four Correlates and Twelve Philosophers.\n\nUnlike Daoist or Buddhist temples, Confucian temples do not normally have images. In the early years of the temple in Qufu, it appears that the spirits of Confucius and his disciples were represented with wall paintings and clay or wooden statues. Official temples also contained images of Confucius himself. However, there was opposition to this practice, which was seen as imitative of Buddhist temples.  It was also argued that the point of the imperial temples was to honour Confucius's teachings, not the man himself.\nThe lack of unity in likenesses in statues of Confucius first led Emperor Taizu of the Ming dynasty to decree that all new Confucian temples should contain only spirit tablets and no images. In 1530, it was decided that all existing images of Confucius should be replaced with spirit tablets in imperial temples in the capital and other bureaucratic locations; nevertheless many modern Confucian temples do feature statues. Statues also remained in temples operated by Confucius's family descendants, such as that in Qufu.\n\n\n== Worship ==\nThe state cult of Confucius centred upon offering sacrifices to Confucius's spirit in the Confucian temple.\nA dance known as the Eight-Row Dance (\u516b\u4f7e\u821e), consisting of eight columns of eight dancers each, was also performed. Originally this was a Six-Row Dance, as performed for the lesser aristocracy, but in 1477 Confucius was allowed the imperial honour of the eight-row dance since he posthumously received the title of king.  Musicians who accompanied this dance played a form of music termed yayue.\nIn addition to worshipping Confucius, Confucian temples also honour the \"Four Correlates\", the \"Twelve Philosophers\", and other disciples and Confucian scholars through history. The composition and number of figures worshipped changed and grew through time. Since temples were a statement of Confucian orthodoxy, the issue of which Confucians to enshrine was a controversial one.\nBy the Republican period (20th century), there were a total of 162 figures worshipped. The Four Correlates are Yan Hui, Zeng Shen, Kong Ji (Zisi), and Mencius. The Twelve Philosophers are Min Sun (Ziqian), Ran Geng (Boniu), Ran Yong (Zhonggong), Zai Yu (Ziwo), Zi-gong, Ran You, Zi-Lu, Zi-You, Zi-Xia, Zi-Zhang, You Ruo, and Zhu Xi. A list of disciples of Confucius and their place in the Confucian temple can be found at Disciples of Confucius.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Outside mainland China ==\nWith the spread of Confucian learning throughout East Asia, Confucian temples were also built in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. Starting in the 18th century, some were even built in Europe and the Americas. At their height, there are estimated to have been over 3,000 Confucian temples in existence.\n\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n\nThe bill allowing for the building of the very first Confucian Temple in Hong Kong, proposed by the Confucian Academy, passed in September 2013. The location of the temple was decided to be near the famous Taoist temple, Wong Tai Sin Temple, in Wong Tai Sin District.\n\n\n=== Taiwan ===\nThe first Confucian temple in Taiwan to be constructed was the Taiwan Confucian Temple, which was built during the period of Tungning Kingdom in 1665 in Tainan. A more recent one, the Taipei Confucius Temple, was built on Wenwu Street in Taipei in 1879, torn down by Japanese in 1907 to make place for the Taipei First Girls' High School, and re-erected on Dalong Street from 1925 to 1939. The new temple was designed by Wang Yi-Shun, who also oversaw its construction. The design is an example of typical Fujian temple style. Every year on September the 28th, the birthday of Confucius, city authorities hold the Shidian (Chinese: \u91cb\u5960) Ceremony here. In addition, there is a Confucian temple located in Zuoying District of Kaohsiung that was completed in 1974 in the Northern Song architectural style. Other Confucian Temples are found in Chiayi City, Taipei, Taichung and Changhua County.\n\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n\nA Confucian Temple in Vietnam is called V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu. The earliest recorded V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in Vietnam is the V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu, Hanoi, established in 1070 during the L\u00fd dynasty. After 1397, with the construction of schools throughout Vietnam under the Tran, Confucian temples began to spread throughout the country. Another renowned Vietnamese Confucian temple is the V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu, H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean, located in H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean City. Well-known Confucian temples were built in Hu\u1ebf, Tam K\u1ef3, H\u1ed9i An, H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean, H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng, Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a, V\u0129nh Long and B\u1eafc Ninh.\n\n\n=== Korea ===\n\nOutside China, the largest number of Confucian temples is found in Korea. Temples were first built during the Goryeo period (918\u20131392). In the time of Yi Seonggye (r. 1392\u20131398), it was decreed that Confucian temples should be built in all areas of the nation. Although Chinese models were followed, variations in layout and construction were common, such as the building of schools in front of temples. Korea also added its own scholars (the eighteen scholars of the East) to the Confucian pantheon.\nHistorically, Korea had a total of 362 temples devoted to Confucianism. After World War II and the division of the country, those in the North were converted to other uses. However, many of the 232 temples in the South continued their activities (see Munmyo). In addition to temples devoted to Confucianism the Republic of Korea also has twelve Confucian family temples, two temples in private schools, and three libraries.\n\n\n=== Japan ===\n\nConfucian temples (\u5b54\u5b50\u5edf, k\u014dshi-by\u014d) were also widely built in Japan, often in conjunction with Confucian schools. The most famous is the Yushima Seid\u014d, built in 1630 during the Edo period as a private school connected with the Neo-Confucianist scholar Hayashi Razan. Originally built in Shinobi-ga-oka in Ueno, it was moved at the end of the 18th century near present-day Ochanomizu by the Tokugawa Shogunate, and a major state-sponsored school, Shoheik\u014d, was opened on tis grounds..\nOther well-known Confucian temples are found in Nagasaki, Bizen, Okayama prefecture; Taku, Saga prefecture; and Naha, Okinawa prefecture.\n\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n\nConfucian temples are also found in Indonesia, where they are often known as \"Churches of Confucius\" as Confucianism is a recognised religion in that country. In Chinese, these establishments are known as litang (\u793c\u5802) or \"halls of worship\". The largest and oldest is the Boen Bio in Surabaya, originally built in the city's Chinatown in 1883 and moved to a new site in 1907. There are reportedly more than 100 Confucianist halls of worship throughout Indonesia.\n\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nThe first Confucian temple in Malaysia was built within a primary school known as Chung Hwa Confucian School (which has since split into SJK(C) Chung Hwa Confucian A, B and SMJK Chung Hwa Confucian) in Penang, in the early 20th century. The building of the school was initiated by the Qing dynasty ambassador to the British Straits Settlement at that time. In those days parents in Penang brought their children to this temple for prayer before they began their schooling. The children prayed for excellence in their studies.\nThere are also two Confucian schools in Kuala Lumpur, namely SMJK Confucian and Confucian Private School, and a Confucian school in Malacca where ceremonies in honour of Confucius are held annually.\n\n\n== List of temples ==\n\nTemple of Confucius in Qufu, China (Confucius's home town)\nTemple of Confucius in Beijing, China\nTemple of the Master in Nanjing, China\nTemple of Confucius in Shanghai, China\nTemple of Confucius in Suzhou, China\nTemple of Confucius in Jianshui, Yunnan, China (\u5efa\u6c34\u6587\u5e99)\nTemple of Confucius in Daixian, Shanxi, China\nTemple of Confucius in Taipei, Taiwan\nTemple of Confucius in Kaohsiung, Taiwan\nTemple of Confucius in Tainan, Taiwan (\"Taiwan Confucian Temple\")\nTemple of Confucius in Changhua, Taiwan\nTemple of Confucius in Nagasaki, Japan\nShiseiby\u014d, the Temple of Confucius in Naha, Okinawa, Japan\nSeiby\u014d, the Temple of Confucius in Taku, Japan\nYushima Seid\u014d, the Temple of Confucius in Tokyo, Japan\nMunmyo, the Temple of Confucius in Seoul, South Korea\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in Hanoi, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in B\u1eafc Ninh, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in Ngh\u1ec7 An, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai, Vietnam\nV\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu in V\u0129nh Long, Vietnam\nBoen Bio in Surabaya, Indonesia\n\n\n== See also ==\nConfucian churches\nMansion and Cemetery of Confucius\nWenchang Wang\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nImages of the Temple of Culture, with detailed history of Confucian temples\nFull Virtual Walk & Info on Confucius Temple, Beijing\nAsian Historical Architecture: Fuzimiao in Nanjing\nAsian Historical Architecture: Confucian temple in Suzhou\nThe Confucian temple in Tainan\nSurabaya, with description of Boen Bio\nThe Taipei Confucius Temple",

        "wiki": "Harbin (Manchu: \u1865\u1820\u182f\u182a\u1873\u1828 (); Chinese: \u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8 H\u0101'\u011brb\u012bn) is a sub-provincial city and the provincial capital of Heilongjiang province, People's Republic of China, as well as the second largest city by urban population and largest city by metropolitan population (urban and rural together) in Northeast China.  Harbin has direct jurisdiction over nine metropolitan districts, two county-level cities and seven counties, and is the eighth most populous Chinese city according to the 2010 census, the built-up area (which consists of all districts except Shuangcheng and Acheng) had 5,282,093 inhabitants, while the total metropolitan population was up to 10,635,971.  Harbin serves as a key political, economic, scientific, cultural and communications hub in Northeast China, as well as an important industrial base of the nation.Harbin, whose name was originally a Manchu word meaning \"a place for drying fishing nets\", grew from a small rural settlement on the Songhua River to become one of the largest cities in Northeast China. Founded in 1898 with the coming of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the city first prospered as a region inhabited by an overwhelming majority of immigrants from the Russian Empire.With its often harsh winters, Harbin is heralded as the Ice City (\u51b0\u57ce) for its well-known winter tourism and recreations. Harbin is notable for its ice sculpture festival in the winter. Besides being well known for its historical Russian legacy, the city serves as an important gateway in Sino-Russian trade today. In the 1920s, the city was considered China's fashion capital since new designs from Paris and Moscow reached here first before arriving in Shanghai. The city was voted \"China Top Tourist City\" by the China National Tourism Administration in 2004.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nHuman settlement in the Harbin area dates from at least 2200 BC during the late Stone Age. Wanyan Aguda, the founder and first emperor (reigned 1115-1123) of the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234), was born in the Jurchen Wanyan tribes who resided near the Ashi River in this region.  In AD 1115 Aguda established Jin's capital Shangjing (Upper Capital) Huining Prefecture in today's Acheng District of Harbin. After Aguda's death, the new emperor Wanyan Sheng ordered the construction of a new city on a uniform plan. The planning and construction emulated major Chinese cities, in particular Bianjing (Kaifeng), although the Jin capital was smaller than its Northern Song prototype. Huining Prefecture served as the first superior capital of the Jin empire until Wanyan Liang (the fourth emperor of Jin Dynasty) moved the capital to Yanjing (now Beijing) in 1153. Liang even went so far as to destroy all palaces in his former capital in 1157. Wanyan Liang's successor Wanyan Yong (Emperor Shizong) restored the city and established it as a secondary capital in 1173. Ruins of the Shangjing Huining Prefecture were discovered and excavated about 2 km (1.2 mi)from present-day Acheng's central urban area. The site of the old Jin capital ruins is a national historic reserve, and includes the Jin Dynasty History Museum. The museum, open to the public, was renovated in late 2005. Mounted statues of Aguda and of his chief commander Wanyan Zonghan (also Nianhan) stand in the grounds of the museum.\nMany of the artifacts found there are on display in nearby Harbin.\nAfter the Mongol conquest of the Jin Empire (1211\u20131234), Huining Prefecture was abandoned. In the 17th century, the Manchus used building materials from Huining Prefecture to construct their new stronghold in Alchuka. The region of Harbin remained largely rural until the 1800s, with over ten villages and about 30,000 people in the city's present-day urban districts by the end of the 19th century.\n\n\n=== International city ===\n\nA small village in 1898 grew into the modern city of Harbin. Polish engineer Adam Szyd\u0142owski drew plans for the city following the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which the Russian Empire had financed. The Russians selected Harbin as the base of their administration over this railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. The railways were largely constructed by Russian engineers and indentured workers. The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the Trans-Siberian Railway: substantially reducing the distance from Chita to Vladivostok and also linking the new port city of Dalny (Dalian) and the Russian Naval Base Port Arthur (L\u00fcshun). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a \"boomtown\", growing into a city within five years. The majority of settlers in Harbin came from southern Ukraine (Russian Empire). In addition to Ukrainians there were many Russians, Jews, Poles, Georgians, and Tatars.The city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar Simon Karlinsky, who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian Jewish family, wrote that in Harbin \"the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned\u2014well before the October Revolution\u2014by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners\", giving the city a very European appearance. Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms which soon turned Manchuria into the \"breadbasket of China\" while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize.  Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria.  A sign of Harbin's wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play K zvezdam by Leonid Andreyev had its premiere there.   \n\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies. Churches were rebuilt for Russian Orthodox, Lutheran/German Protestant, and Polish Catholic Christians. Chinese capitalists also established businesses, especially in brewing, food and textiles. Harbin became the economic hub of northeastern China and an international metropolis.The rapid growth of the city challenged the public healthcare system. The worst-ever recorded outbreak of pneumonic plague was spread to Harbin through the Trans-Manchurian railway from the border trade port of Manzhouli. The plague lasted from late autumn of 1910 to spring 1911 and killed 1,500 Harbin residents (mostly ethnic Chinese), or about five percent of its population at the time. This turned out to be the beginning of the large so-called Manchurian plague pandemic which ultimately claimed 60,000 victims. In the winter of 1910, Dr. Wu Lien-teh (later the founder of Harbin Medical University) was given instructions from the Foreign Office, Peking, to travel to Harbin to investigate the plague. Dr. Wu asked for imperial sanction to cremate plague victims, as cremation of these infected victims turned out to be the turning point of the epidemic. The suppression of this plague pandemic changed medical progress in China. Bronze statues of Dr. Wu Lien-teh are built in Harbin Medical University to remember his contributions in promoting public health, preventive medicine and medical education.The first generation of Harbin Russians were mostly the builders and employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They moved to Harbin in order to work on the railroad. At the time Harbin was not an established city. The city was almost built from scratch by the builders and early settlers. Houses were constructed, furniture and personal items were brought in from Russia. After the Manchurian plague epidemic, Harbin's population continued to increase sharply, especially inside the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone. In 1913 the Chinese Eastern Railway census showed its ethnic composition as: Russians \u2013 34313, Chinese (that is, including Hans, Manchus etc.) \u2013 23537, Jews \u2013 5032, Poles \u2013 2556, Japanese \u2013 696, Germans \u2013 564, Tatars \u2013 234, Latvians \u2013 218, Georgians \u2013 183, Estonians \u2013 172, Lithuanians \u2013 142, Armenians \u2013 124; there were also Karaims, Ukrainians, Bashkirs, and some Western Europeans. In total, 68549 citizens of 53 nationalities, speaking 45 languages. Research shows that only 11.5 percent of all residents were born in Harbin. By 1917, Harbin's population exceeded 100,000, with over 40,000 of them were ethnic Russians.\n\nAfter Russia's Great October Socialist Revolution in November 1917, more than 100,000 defeated Russian White Guards and refugees retreated to Harbin, which became a major center of White Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s and the largest Russian enclave outside the Soviet Union. Karlinsky noted that a major difference with the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who arrived in Harbin was: \"Unlike the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who went to Paris or Prague or even to Shanghai, the new residents of Harbin were not a minority surrounded by a foreign population. They found themselves instead in an almost totally Russian city, populated mainly by people with roots in the south of European Russia.\" The city had a Russian school system, as well as publishers of Russian-language newspapers and journals. Russian Harbintsy community numbered around 120,000 at its peak in the early 1920s. Many of Harbin's Russians were wealthy, which sometime confused foreign visitors who expected them to be poor, with for instance the American writer Harry A. Franck in his 1923 book Wanderings in North China writing the Russian \"ladies as well gowned as at the Paris races [who] strolled with men faultlessly garbed by European standards\", leading him to wonder how they had achieved this \"deceptive appearance\".The Harbin Institute of Technology was established in 1920 as the Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry to educate railway engineers via a Russian method of instruction. Students could select from two majors at the time: Railway Construction or Electric Mechanic Engineering. On 2 April 1922, the school was renamed the Sino-Russian Industrial University. The original two majors eventually developed into two major departments: the Railway Construction Department and the Electric Engineering Department.  Between 1925 and 1928 the University's Rector was  Leonid Aleksandrovich Ustrugov, the Russian Deputy Minister of Railways under Nicholas II before the Russian Revolution, Minister of Railways under Admiral Kolchak's government, and a key figure in the development of the Chinese Eastern Railway.\nThe Russian community in Harbin made it their mission to preserve the pre-revolutionary culture of Russia. The city had numerous Russian language newspapers, journals, libraries, theaters and two opera companies. One of the famous Russian poets in Harbin was Valery Pereleshin, who started publishing his intensely homoerotic poetry in 1937, and was also one of the few Russian writers in Harbin who learned Mandarin. The subject of Pereleshin's poetry caused problems with the Russian Fascist Party, and led Pereelshin leaving Harbin for Shanghai, and ultimately to the United States. Not all of the Russian newspapers were of high quality, with Karlinsky calling Nash put', the newspaper of the Russian Fascist Party \"the lowest example of gutter journalism that Harbin had ever seen\". Nikolai Baikov, a Russian writer in Harbin was known for his novels of exile life in that city together with his accounts of his travels across Manchuria and the folklore of its Manchu and Chinese population. Boris Yulsky, a young Russian writer who published his short stories in the newspaper Rubezh was considered to be a promising writer whose career was cut short when he gave up literature for activism in the Russian Fascist Party and cocaine addiction. Moya-tvoya (mine \u2013 yours), a pidgin language that was a combination of Russian and Mandarin Chinese that had developed in the 19th century when Chinese went to work in Siberia, was considered essential by the Chinese business people of Harbin. \nIn the early 1920s, according to Chinese scholars' recent studies, over 20,000 Jews lived in Harbin. After 1919, Dr. Abraham Kaufman played a leading role in Harbin's large Russian Jewish community. The Republic of China discontinued diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1920, so many Russians found themselves stateless. When the Chinese Eastern Railway and government in Beijing announced in 1924 that they agreed the railroad would only employ Russian or Chinese nationals, the emigres were forced to announce their ethnic and political allegiance. Most accepted Soviet citizenship.\nThe Chinese warlord Zhang Xueliang, the \"Young Marshal\" seized the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929. Soviet military force quickly put an end to the crisis and forced the Nationalist Chinese to accept restoration of joint Soviet-Chinese administration of the railway.\n\n\n=== Japanese invasion period ===\n\nJapan invaded Manchuria outright after the Mukden Incident in September 1931. After the Japanese captured Qiqihar in the Jiangqiao Campaign, the Japanese 4th Mixed Brigade moved toward Harbin, closing in from the west and south. Bombing and strafing by Japanese aircraft forced the Chinese army to retreat from Harbin. Within a few hours the Japanese occupation of Harbin was complete.With the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, the so-called \"pacification of Manchukuo\" began, as volunteer armies continued to fight the Japanese. Harbin became a major operations base for the infamous medical experimenters of Unit 731, who killed people of all ages and ethnicities. All these units were known collectively as the Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department of the Kwantung Army. The main facility of the Unit 731 was built in 1935 at Pingfang District, approximately 24 km (15 mi) south of Harbin urban area at that time. Between 3,000 and 12,000 citizens including men, women, and children\u2014from which around 600 every year were provided by the Kempeitai\u2014died during the human experimentation conducted by Unit 731 at the camp based in Pingfang alone, which does not include victims from other medical experimentation sites. Almost 70 percent of the victims who died in the Pingfang camp were Chinese, including both civilian and military. Close to 30 percent of the victims were Russian. The Russian Fascist Party had the task of capturing \"unreliable\" Russians living in Harbin to hand over to Unit 731 to serve as the unwilling subjects of the gruesome experiments. Some others were South East Asians and Pacific Islanders, at the time colonies of the Empire of Japan, and a small number of the prisoners of war from the Allies of World War II (although many more Allied POWs were victims of Unit 731 at other sites). Prisoners of war were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia, after infected with various diseases. Prisoners were injected with inoculations of disease, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. Unit 731 and its affiliated units (Unit 1644 and Unit 100 among others) were involved in research, development, and experimental deployment of epidemic-creating biowarfare weapons in assaults against the Chinese populace (both civilian and military) throughout World War II. Human targets were also used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in different positions. Flame throwers were tested on humans. Humans were tied to stakes and used as targets to test germ-releasing bombs, chemical weapons, and explosive bombs. Twelve Unit 731 members were found guilty in the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials but later repatriated; others received secret immunity by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur before the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in exchange for biological warfare work in the Cold War for the American Force.\n\nChinese revolutionaries including Zhao Shangzhi, Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, Zhao Yiman continued to struggle against the Japanese in Harbin and its administrative area, commanding the main anti-Japanese guerrilla army-Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army\u2014which was originally organized by the Manchurian branch of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The army was supported by the Comintern after the CPC Manchurian Provincial Committee was dissolved in 1936.\n\nUnder the Manchukuo r\u00e9gime and Japanese occupation, Harbin Russians had a difficult time. In 1935, the Soviet Union sold the Chinese Eastern Railway (KVZhD) to the Japanese, and many Russian emigres left Harbin (48133 of them were arrested during the Soviet Great Purge between 1936 and 1938 as \"Japanese spies\"). Most departing Russians returned to the Soviet Union, but a substantial number moved south to Shanghai or emigrated to the United States and Australia. By the end of the 1930s, the Russian population of Harbin had dropped to around 30,000.Many of Harbin's Jews (13,000 in 1929) fled after the Japanese occupation as the Japanese associated closely with militant anti-Soviet Russian Fascists, whose ideology of anti-Bolshevism and nationalism was laced with virulent anti-Semitism. The Kwantung Army sponsored and financed the Russian Fascist Party, which after 1932 started to play an over-sized role in the Harbin's Russian community as its thugs began to harness and some times killed those opposed to it. Most Jews left for Shanghai, Tianjin, and the British Mandate of Palestine. In the late 1930s, some German Jews fleeing the Nazis moved to Harbin. Japanese officials later facilitated Jewish emigration to several cities in western Japan, notably Kobe, which came to have Japan's largest synagogue.\n\n\n=== After World War II ===\n\nThe Soviet Army took the city on 20 August 1945 and Harbin never came under the control of the Kuomintang, whose troops stopped 60 km (37 mi) short of the city. The city's administration was transferred by the departing Soviet Army to the Chinese People's Liberation Army in April 1946. On 28 April 1946, the communist government of Harbin was established, making the 700,000-citizen-city the first large city governed by the communists. During the short occupation of Harbin by the Soviet Army (August 1945 to April 1946), thousands of Russian emigres who have been identified as members of the Russian Fascist Party and fled communism after the Russian October Revolution, were forcibly deported to the Soviet Union. After 1952 the Soviet Union launched a second wave of immigration back to Russia. By 1964, the Russian population in Harbin had been reduced to 450. The rest of the European community (Russians, Germans, Poles, Greeks, etc.) emigrated during the years 1950\u201354 to Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel and the US, or were repatriated to their home countries. By 1988 the original Russian community numbered just thirty, all of them elderly. Modern Russians living in Harbin mostly moved there in the 1990s and 2000s, and have no relation to the first wave of emigration.\nHarbin was one of the key construction cities of China during the First Five-Year Plan period from 1951 to 1956. 13 of the 156 key construction projects were aid-constructed by the Soviet Union in Harbin. This project made Harbin an important industrial base of China. During the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1961, Harbin experienced a very tortuous development course as several Sino-Soviet contracts were cancelled by the Soviet Union. During the Cultural Revolution many foreign and Christian things were uprooted, such as the St. Nicholas church which was destroyed by Red Guards in 1966. On 23 August 1966, the Red Guards stormed into St. Nicholas Cathedral, burned its icons on the streets while chanting xenophobic slogans before destroying St. Nicholas Cathedral.  As the normal economic and social order was seriously disrupted, Harbin's economy also suffered from serious setbacks. One of the main reasons of this setback is with its Soviet ties deteriorating and the Vietnam War escalating, China became concerned of a possible nuclear attack. Mao Zedong ordered an evacuation of military and other key state enterprises away from the northeastern frontier, with Harbin being the core zone of this region, bordering the Soviet Union. During this Third Front Development Era of China, several major factories of Harbin were relocated to Southwestern Provinces including Gansu, Sichuan, Hunan and Guizhou, where they would be strategically secure in the event of a possible war. Some major universities of China were also moved out of Harbin, including Harbin Military Academy of Engineering (predecessor of Changsha's National University of Defense Technology) and Harbin Institute of Technology (Moved to Chongqing in 1969 and relocated to Harbin in 1973).\n\nNational economy and social service have obtained significant achievements since the Chinese economic reform first introduced in 1979. Harbin holds the China Harbin International economic and Trade Fair each year since 1990. Harbin once housed one of the largest Jewish communities in the Far East before World War II. It reached its peak in the mid-1920s when 25,000 European Jews lived in the city. Among them were the parents of Ehud Olmert, the former Prime Minister of Israel. In 2004, Olmert came to Harbin with an Israeli trade delegation to visit the grave of his grandfather in Huang Shan Jewish Cemetery, which had over 500 Jewish graves identified.On 5 October 1984, Harbin was designated a sub-provincial city by the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee. The eight counties of Harbin originally formed part of Songhuajiang Prefecture whose seat was practically located inside the urban area of Harbin since 1972. The prefecture was officially merged into Harbin city on 11 August 1996, increasing Harbin's total population to 9.47 million.Harbin hosted the third Asian Winter Games in 1996. In 2009, Harbin held the XXIV Winter Universiade.\nA memorial hall honoring Korean nationalist and independence activist Ahn Jung-geun was unveiled at Harbin Railway Station on 19 January 2014. Ahn assassinated four-time Prime Minister of Japan and former Resident-General of Korea It\u014d Hirobumi at No.1 platform of Harbin Railway Station on 26 October 1909, as Korea on the verge of annexation by Japan after the signing of the Eulsa Treaty. South Korean President Park Geun-Hye raised an idea of erecting a monument for Ahn while meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to China in June 2013. After that China began to build a memorial hall honoring Ahn at Harbin Railway Station. As the hall was unveiled on 19 January 2014, the Japanese side soon lodged protest with China over the construction of Ahn's memorial hall.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHarbin, with a total land area of 53,068 km2 (20,490 sq mi), is located in southern Heilongjiang province and is the provincial capital. The prefecture is also located at the southeastern edge of the Songnen Plain, a major part of China's Northeastern Plain. The city center also sits on the southern bank of the middle Songhua River. Harbin received its nickname The pearl on the swan's neck, since the shape of Heilongjiang resembles a swan. Its administrative area is rather large with latitude spanning 44\u00b0 04\u2032\u221246\u00b0 40\u2032 N, and longitude 125\u00b0 42\u2032\u2212130\u00b0 10' E. Neighbouring prefecture-level cities are Yichun to the north, Jiamusi and Qitaihe to the northeast, Mudanjiang to the southeast, Daqing to the west, and Suihua to the northwest. On its southwestern boundary is Jilin province. The main terrain of the city is generally flat and low-lyling, with an average elevation of around 150 metres (490 ft). However, the territory that comprises the 10 county-level divisions in the eastern part of the municipality consists of mountains and uplands. The easternmost part of Harbin prefecture also has extensive wetlands, mainly in Yilan County which is located at the southwestern edge of the Sanjiang Plain.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Harbin features a monsoon-influenced, humid continental climate (Dwa). Due to the Siberian high and its location above 45 degrees north latitude, the city is known for its cold weather and long winter. Its nickname Ice City is well-earned, as winters here are dry and freezing cold, with a 24-hour average in January of only \u221217.6 \u00b0C (0.3 \u00b0F), although the city sees little precipitation during the winter and is often sunny. Spring and autumn constitute brief transition periods with variable wind directions. Summers can be hot, with a July mean temperature of 23.1 \u00b0C (73.6 \u00b0F). Summer is also when most of the year's rainfall occurs, and more than half of the annual precipitation, at 538 millimetres (21.2 in), occurs in July and August alone. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 52 percent in December to 63 percent in March, the city receives 2,571 hours of bright sunshine annually; on average precipitation falls 104 days out of the year. The annual mean temperature is +4.86 \u00b0C (40.7 \u00b0F), and extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221242.6 \u00b0C (\u221245 \u00b0F) to 39.2 \u00b0C (103 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe sub-provincial city of Harbin has direct jurisdiction over 9 districts, 2 county-level cities and 7 counties.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nHarbin has the largest economy in Heilongjiang province. In 2013, Harbin's GDP totaled RMB501.08 billion, an increase of 8.9 percent over the previous year. The proportion of the three industries to the aggregate of GDP was 11.1:36.1:52.8 in 2012. The total value for imports and exports by the end of 2012 was US$5,330 million. In 2012, the working population reached 3.147 million. In 2015, Harbin had a GDP of RMB 575.12 billion.The chernozem soil in Harbin, called \"black earth\" is one of the most nutrient rich in all of China, making it valuable for cultivating food and textile-related crops. As a result, Harbin is China's base for the production of commodity grain and an ideal location for setting up agricultural businesses.\nHarbin also has industries such as light industry, textile, medicine, food, aircraft, automobile, metallurgy, electronics, building materials, and chemicals which help to form a fairly comprehensive industrial system. Several major corporations are based in the city. Harbin Electric Company Limited, Harbin Aircraft Industry Group and Northeast Light Alloy Processing Factory are some of key enterprises. Power manufacturing is a main industry in Harbin; hydro and thermal power equipment manufactured here makes up one-third of the total installed capacity in China. According to Platts, in 2009-10 Harbin Electric was the second largest manufacturer of steam turbines by worldwide market share, tying Dongfang Electric and slightly behind Shanghai Electric. Harbin Pharmaceutical Group, which mainly focus on research, development, manufacture and sale of medical products, is China's second-biggest pharmaceutical company by market value.Foreign investors seem upbeat about the city. Harbin International Trade and Economic Fair has been held annually since 1990. This investment and trade fair cumulatively attracting more than 1.9 million exhibitors and visitors from more than 80 countries and regions to attend, resulting over US$100 billion contract volume concluded according to the statistics of 2013. Harbin is among major destinations of FDI in Northeast China, with utilized FDI totaling US$980 million in 2013. After the 18th regular meeting between Sino-Russian Prime Ministers between Li Keqiang and Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev in October 2013, two sides come to make an agreement that the Harbin International Trade and Economic Fair will be renamed \"China-Russia EXPO\" and be co-sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, Heilongjiang Provincial government, the Russian Ministry of Economic Development and Russia's Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\nIn the financial sector, Longjiang Bank and Harbin Bank are some of the largest banks in Northeast China, with headquarters in Harbin. The latter ranks 4th by competitiveness among Chinese city commercial banks in 2011.In commerce, there is Qiulin Group, which owns Harbin's largest department store.\n\n\n=== Economic development zones and ports ===\nHarbin Economic & Technology Development Zone (National), mainly focus on telecommunications equipment, chemicals production and processing, automobile production/assembly, electronics, textiles, medical equipment and supplies.\nHarbin High and New Technological Development Zone, focus on optical-mechanical-electrical integration, biology, medicine, electronics and information technology.\nHarbin Pingfang Automobile Industrial Zone (Provincial), mainly focus on automobile production/assembly, electronics assembly & manufacturing, heavy industry, instruments & industrial equipment production.\nHarbin Limin Economic Development Zone (Provincial), mainly focus on trading and distribution, food/beverage processing, medical equipment and supplies, shipping/warehousing/logistics.\nHarbin PortHarbin Songbei Economic Development ZoneSongbei Economic Development Zone is located in Songbei District of Harbin. The zone has a planned area of 5.53 square kilometers. Electronics assembly & manufacturing, food and beverage processing are the encouraged industries in the zone. Many regional and provincial headquarters of large enterprises such as the China Datang Corporation, China Netcom and China Telecom have joined in this district, preliminary constituting the economy concentration zone of the local headquarters.
